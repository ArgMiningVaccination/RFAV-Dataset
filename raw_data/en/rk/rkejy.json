Although not all vitamins are amines, they are organic compounds required by humans in small amounts from the diet. An organic compound is considered a vitamin if a lack of that compound in the diet results in overt symptoms of deficiency. The information from the Linus Pauling Institute's Micronutrient Information Center on vitamins and minerals is now available in a book titled, An Evidence-based Approach to Vitamins and Minerals: Health Benefits and Intake Recommendations. The book can be purchased from the [Linus Pauling Institute](../../publications/books) or [Thieme Medical Publishers](http://www.thieme.com/books-main/complementary-medicine/product/1040-an-evidence-based-approach-to-vitamins-and-minerals). Select a vitamin from the list for more information. Contents Biotin is a water-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) that is generally classified as a B-complex vitamin. After its initial discovery in 1927, 40 years of additional research was required to unequivocally establish biotin as a vitamin [(1)](#references). Biotin is required by all organisms but can be [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by some strains of [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria), yeast, mold, algae, and some plant species [(2)](#reference2). Biotin functions as a [covalently](../glossary#covalent) bound [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) required for the biological activity of the five known mammalian biotin-dependent [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) (see [below](#enzyme-cofactor)). Such non- [protein](../glossary#protein) and common in water-soluble vitamins. The covalent attachment of biotin to the apocarboxylase (i.e., the carboxylase protein without the biotin prosthetic group and is is [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), \"biotinylation\" refers to the covalent addition of biotin to any molecule, including the apocarboxylases [histones](../glossary#histone). HCS catalyzes the post-translational biotinylation of the epsilon amino group of a lysine residue at the active site of each apocarboxylase, converting the inactive apocarboxylase into a fully active holocarboxylase (Figure 1a). Particular lysine residues within the N-terminal tail of specific histone that help package [DNA](../glossary#DNA) in eukaryotic [nuclei](../glossary#nucleus) can biotinylated [(3)](#reference3). catalyzes the biotin from biotinylated histones and from the [peptide](../glossary#peptide) products of Five mammalian to malonyl-CoA using bicarbonate and [ATP](../glossary#ATP); however, the two enzymes have different roles in metabolism and different intracellular locations. ACC1 is located in the cytosol, and the malonyl CoA generated by ACC1 is a rate-limiting substrate for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) (Figure 2). ACC1 is found in all tissues and is particularly active in [lipogenic](../glossary#lipogenesis) tissues (i.e., liver, white adipose tissue, and mammary gland), heart, and [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) islets. ACC2 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the malonyl CoA generated via ACC2 inhibits CPT1, an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that regulates malonyl-CoA entry into the inner mitochondria, thereby regulating fatty acid [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) (Figure 3). ACC2 is especially abundant in skeletal muscle and heart [(4)](#reference4). Pyruvate carboxylase is a critical enzyme in [gluconeogenesis](../glossary#gluconeogenesis) (the formation of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) from sources other than [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) (Figure 3). Oxaloacetate can then be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate and eventually to glucose. Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes an essential step in the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) an essential [branched-chain amino acid](../glossary#branched-chain-amino-acids). This -oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms (Figure 4a). The conversion of propionyl-CoA to D-malonylmalonyl-CoA is also required in the catabolic pathways of two branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine and valine) and the side chain of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) (Figure 4a) and of the amino acids [methionine](../glossary#methionine) and threonine (Figure 4b). In eukaryotic [nuclei](../glossary#nucleus), [DNA](../glossary#DNA) is packaged into compact structures to form [nucleosomes](../glossary#nucleosome) \u2014 fundamental units of [chromatin](../glossary#chromatin). Each nucleosome is composed of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around eight [histones](../glossary#histone) (paired located at the outer surface of each nucleosome and serves as an anchor to fix the DNA around the histone core. The compact packaging of chromatin must be relaxed for DNA replication and [transcription](../glossary#transcription). Chemical modifications of DNA and histones affect the folding of chromatin, increasing or reducing DNA accessibility to factors involved in replication and transcription. DNA [methylation](../glossary#methylation) and a number of chemical modifications within the N-terminal tail of core histones modify their electric charge and structure, thereby changing chromatin conformation and transcriptional activity of [genes](../glossary#gene). regulatory functions. Several sites of biotinylation have been identified in histones lysine (K) 12 (noted H4K12bio) appears to be enriched in heterochromatin, a tightly condensed chromatin associated with repeat regions in (peri)centromeres and [telomeres](../glossary#telomere). H4 biotinylation appears to be enriched in transposable elements known as long terminal repeats [(3)](#reference3). These biotinylation marks also co-localize with well-known gene For example, H4K12bio can be found at the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of the gene SLC5A6 that codes for the transporter mediating biotin uptake into cells, the human sodium-dependent multivitamin biotin H4 in the SLC5A6 promoter, which down regulates hSMVT synthesis and reduces biotin uptake. Conversely, in biotin-deficient cells, biotinylation marks in the SLC5A6 promoter are removed increasing [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) and enabling the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of hSMVT and uptake of biotin [(7)](#reference7). Although clinically overt biotin deficiency is very rare, the human requirement for dietary biotin has been demonstrated in three different situations: prolonged [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) feeding ( [parenteral](../glossary#parenteral-nutrition)) without biotin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement), infants fed an elemental formula devoid of biotin, and consumption of raw egg white for a prolonged period (many weeks to years) [(8)](#reference8). Raw egg white contains avidin; this [antimicrobial](../glossary#antimicrobial) protein binds biotin with an affinity and specificity that is almost unique as a reversible binding. Because native avidin is resistant to mammalian and microbial digestion, avidin prevents biotin absorption. Cooking egg white denatures avidin, rendering it susceptible to digestion and therefore unable to block the absorption of dietary biotin [(5)](#reference5). Signs of overt biotin deficiency include hair loss ( [alopecia](../glossary#alopecia)) and a scaly red rash around the eyes, nose, mouth, and genital area. [Neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms in adults have included depression, lethargy, hallucinations, numbness and tingling of the extremities, [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), and [seizures](../glossary#seizure). The characteristic facial rash, together with unusual facial fat distribution, has been termed the \"biotin deficient facies\" by some investigators [(1)](#references). Individuals with hereditary disorders of biotin [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (see [Inborn metabolic disorders](#inborn-metabolic-disorders)) that result in functional biotin deficiency often have similar physical findings, impaired immune system function, and increased susceptibility to [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) and fungal infections [(9, 10)](#reference9). Aside from prolonged consumption of raw egg white or total [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) nutritional support lacking biotin, other conditions may increase the risk of biotin depletion. Smoking has been associated with increased biotin [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) [(11)](#reference11). The rapidly dividing cells of the developing fetus require biotin for [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of essential [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) and for [histone](../glossary#histone) biotinylation; hence, the maternal biotin requirement is likely increased during pregnancy. Research suggests that a substantial number of women develop marginal or [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) biotin deficiency during normal pregnancy (see also [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(8](#reference8), [12, 13)](#reference12). Moreover, certain types of liver disease may decrease biotinidase activity and theoretically increase the requirement for biotin. For example, a study of 62 children with chronic liver disease and 27 healthy controls found [serum](../glossary#serum) biotinidase activity to be abnormally low in those with severely impaired liver function due to [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis) [(14)](#reference14). However, this study did not provide evidence of biotin deficiency. Additionally, [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) medications used to prevent [seizures](../glossary#seizure) in individuals with [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy) increase the risk of biotin depletion (for more information on biotin and anticonvulsants, see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Biotinidase deficiency is an [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) inherited disorder that is often detected upon newborn screening for metabolic disorders, although late-onset forms have been recently described [(15-17)](#reference15). Biotinidase deficiency leads to secondary biotin deficiency in several ways. Intestinal absorption is decreased because deficient biotinidase impairs release of biotin from dietary [protein](../glossary#protein) [(18)](#reference18). of intracellular biotin bound to [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) and [histones](../glossary#histone) is also impaired, and urinary loss of biocytin (N-biotinyl-lysine) biotin is increased deficiency responds to [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) biotin. Oral supplementation with as much as 5 to 20 milligrams (mg) of biotin daily is sometimes required [(19, 20)](#reference19), although smaller doses may be sufficient, especially later in childhood (reviewed in [20, 21](#reference20)). [Prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) is characteristically good when biotin therapy is introduced in infancy or early childhood and reliably continued for life [(10)](#reference10). Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency results in decreased formation of blood responds to supplementation with [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of biotin in some cases but not others. The [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) of holocarboxylase synthetase is usually, but not always, good if biotin therapy is introduced early (even [antenatally](../glossary#antenatal)) and continued for life [(10](#reference10), [22)](#reference22). There has been one [case report](../glossary#case-report) of a child with biotin transport deficiency who responded to high-dose biotin supplementation [(23)](#reference23). Of note, the presence of a defective human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) was ruled out as a cause of biotin transport deficiency. Four measures of marginal biotin deficiency have been validated as indicators of biotin [status](../glossary#status): and (1) reduced levels of holo-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase and holo-propionyl-CoA carboxylase in lymphocytes, the most of biotin status [(24)](#reference24); (2) reduced propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity in peripheral blood [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) [(5)](#reference5); (3) high urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of an organic acid, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, and its derivative, 3-hydroxyisovaleryl carnitine, both of which reflect decreased activity of biotin-dependent methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase; (4) reduced urinary excretion of biotin and some of its catabolites. These markers have been only validated in men and nonpregnant women, and they may not accurately reflect biotin status in pregnant or breast-feeding women [(12](#reference12), [25)](#reference25). Sufficient scientific evidence is lacking to estimate the dietary requirement for biotin; thus, no Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for biotin has been established. Instead, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Medicine set recommendations for an Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI); Table 1). The AI for adults (30 g/day) was extrapolated from the AI for infants exclusively fed human milk and probably overestimates the dietary requirement for biotin for most adults. Dietary intakes of generally healthy adults have been estimated to be 40 to 60 micrograms (g) of biotin daily [(1)](#references). The requirement for biotin Current research indicates that at least one-third of women develop marginal biotin deficiency during pregnancy [(8)](#reference8). Small [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) in pregnant women have reported an abnormally high urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid in both early and late pregnancy, suggesting decreased activity of biotin-dependent women, supplementation with 300 g/day of biotin for two weeks limited the excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo), confirming that increased 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid excretion indeed reflected marginal biotin deficiency in pregnancy [(29)](#reference29). A small [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in 22 pregnant women reported an incidence of low [lymphocyte](../glossary#lymphocyte) propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity greater than 80% [(13)](#reference13). Although these levels of biotin deficiency are not associated with overt signs of deficiency in pregnant women, such observations are sources of concern because [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) biotin deficiency has been shown to cause cleft palate and limb hypoplasia in several animal species (reviewed in [13](#reference13)). In addition, biotin depletion has been found to suppress the expression of biotin-dependent carboxylases, remove biotin marks from [histones](../glossary#histone), and decrease the in human embryonic palatal mesenchymal cells in culture [(30)](#reference30). Impaired carboxylase activity may result in alterations in [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), which have been linked to cleft palate and skeletal abnormalities in animals. Further, biotin deficiency leading to reduced histone biotinylation at specific genomic loci may increase genomic instability and result in [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) anomalies and fetal malformations [(13)](#reference13). Analogous to pregnant women who are advised to consume [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) folic acid prior to and during pregnancy to prevent [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (see [Folate](folate#adverse-pregnancy-outcomes)), it would also be prudent to ensure adequate biotin intake throughout pregnancy. The current AI for pregnant women is 30 g/day of biotin, and no toxicity has ever been reported at this level of intake (see [Safety](#safety)). Biotin-thiamin-responsive basal deficiency, and an [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) [gene](../glossary#gene) that codes for thiamin transporter-2 (THTR-2). The disease usually presents around 3 to 10 years of age [(31)](#reference31), but an early infantile form of the disease exists with onset as early as one month of age [(32)](#reference32). Clinical features include subacute [encephalopathy](../glossary#encephalopathy) (confusion, drowsiness, altered level of consciousness), [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), and [seizures](../glossary#seizure). A [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) of 18 affected individuals from the same family or the same tribe in Saudi Arabia showed that biotin [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) (5-10 mg/kg/day) efficiently abolished the clinical manifestations of the disease, although one-third of the patients suffered from recurrent acute crises. Often associated with poor outcomes, acute crises were not observed after thiamin supplementation started (300-400 mg/day) and during a five-year follow-up period, early diagnosis and immediate treatment with biotin and thiamin led to positive outcomes [(33)](#reference33). Although the specific mechanism for therapeutic effects of biotin in biotin-thiamin-responsive basal ganglia disease remains unknown, lifelong high-dose supplementation with a combination of biotin and thiamin is the recommended treatment [(31)](#reference31). Early diagnosis and treatment is important to ensure a better [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) [(32, 34)](#reference32). [Multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) (MS) is an [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) characterized by progressive damage to the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath surrounding nerve fibers ( [axons](../glossary#axon)) and [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) loss in the brain and spinal cord of affected individuals in anatomic locations that vary widely among affected individuals producing variable signs and symptoms. The progression of [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disabilities in MS patients is often assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) with scores from 1 to 10, from minimal signs of motor dysfunction (score of 1) to death by MS (score of 10). [ATP](../glossary#ATP) deficiency due to [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) may be partly responsible for the progressive degeneration of [neurons](../glossary#neuron) in MS [(35)](#reference35). Given its role in energy production by intermediary metabolism and [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) and in fatty (see [Function](#function)), high-dose biotin supplementation it has been hypothesized that to exert beneficial effects that would limit or reverse MS-associated functional impairments [(35)](#reference35). The mechanism of action of high-dose biotin has been investigated in a genetic mouse model of chronic axon injury caused by [oxidative [axonal](../glossary#axon) death and locomotor impairment. Dysregulation of the transcriptional program for [lipid](../glossary#lipid) synthesis and degradation in the spinal cord was also normalized, possibly as the result of hyperactivation of a nutrient/energy/ [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) sensor that controls protein synthesis restoring lipid homeostasis. A nonrandomized, uncontrolled [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) in 23 patients with progressive MS found high doses of biotin (100-600 mg/day) to be associated with sustained clinical improvements in five (out of five) patients with progressive visual loss and 16 (out of 18) patients with partial paralysis of the limbs after a mean three months following treatment onset [(36)](#reference36). Additionally, a multicenter, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 154 subjects with progressive MS reported that 13 out of 103 patients supplemented with high-dose, pharmaceutical-grade biotin (300 mg/day) for 12 months achieved MS-related disability reversal \u2014 assessed by improved EDSS or 25-foot walk time [(37)](#reference37). In comparison, none of the 51 patients randomized to the placebo group showed significant clinical improvements [(37)](#reference37). However, when this regimen of high-dose biotin supplementation was examined in a larger, international cohort of patients with progressive MS (326 patients receiving biotin and 316 patients receiving placebo), no benefits on EDSS or walk time were seen after 12 months [(38)](#reference38). Moreover, a randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial in 93 MS patients with chronic visual loss found that 300 mg/day of pharmaceutical-grade biotin for six months did not improve visual acuity, but an interesting trend favoring the biotin group was observed in the subgroup of patients with progressive optic neuritis [(39)](#reference39). Moreover, a meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials (2 on disability; 3 on adverse effects), involving 889 individuals diagnosed with MS (the preponderance of participants [830] had progressive MS while only 59 had remitting relapsing MS) was conducted [(40)](#reference40). Pooling results of two trials found no benefit of high-dose biotin on MS-related disability, but there was significant heterogeneity between the trials. When the subgroup progressive MS was analyzed separately, a moderate certainty of evidence suggested a potential benefit in favor of high-dose biotin for the 25-foot minute walk time [(40)](#reference40). On balance, studies remain inconclusive but promising. Overt biotin deficiency has been shown to impair [glucose](../glossary#glucose) utilization in mice [(41)](#reference41) and cause fatal [hypoglycemia](../glossary#hypoglycemia) in chickens. Overt biotin deficiency likely also causes abnormalities in glucose regulation in humans (see [Function](#function)). One early human study reported lower [serum](../glossary#serum) biotin concentrations in 43 patients with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) compared to 64 control subjects without the disease; an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between fasting blood glucose and biotin concentrations was observed as well [(42)](#reference42). In a small, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 28 patients with type 2 diabetes, daily supplementation with 9 milligrams (mg) of biotin for one month resulted in a 45% decrease in mean fasting blood glucose concentrations [(42)](#reference42). Yet, another small study in 10 patients with type 2 diabetes and 7 controls without diabetes found no effect of biotin supplementation (15 mg/day) for 28 days on fasting blood glucose concentrations in either group [(43)](#reference43). A more recent [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study by the same research group showed that the same biotin regimen lowered [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [triglyceride](../glossary#triglyceride) concentrations in patients with hypertriglyceridemia \u2014 independent of whether they had type 2 diabetes [(44)](#reference44). In this study, biotin administration did not affect blood glucose concentrations in either patient group. Additionally, a few studies have shown that co-supplementation with biotin and chromium picolinate may be a beneficial [adjunct therapy](../glossary#adjunct) in patients with type 2 diabetes [(45-48)](#reference45). For information on chromium supplementation as a [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) for type 2 diabetes, see the article on [Chromium](../minerals/chromium#type-2-diabetes-treatment). Potential mechanisms for the glucose and [lipid](../glossary#lipid) effects have been suggested. As a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) of [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) required for [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), biotin may increase the utilization of glucose for fat synthesis. Also, biotin stimulates glucokinase, a liver [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that increases synthesis of [glycogen](../glossary#glycogen), the storage form of glucose. Biotin also triggers the secretion of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) in the pancreas of rats and improves glucose [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) [(50)](#reference50). Yet, reduced activity of ACC1 and ACC2 would be expected to reduce fatty acid synthesis and increase fatty acid [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation), respectively. Hence, whether [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of biotin benefits the management of [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) in patients with [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) remains unclear. Moreover, whether supplemental biotin lowers the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) complications in patients with diabetes by reducing serum triglycerides and [LDL](../glossary#LDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) remains to be proven [(44-46)](#reference44). The finding that biotin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) were effective in treating hoof abnormalities in hoofed animals suggested that biotin might also be helpful in strengthening brittle fingernails in humans [(50-52)](#reference50). Three uncontrolled trials examining the effects of biotin supplementation (2.5 mg/day for several months) in women with brittle fingernails have been published [(53-55)](#reference53). In two of the trials, subjective evidence of clinical improvement was reported in 67%-91% of the participants available for follow-up at the end of the treatment period [(53, 54)](#reference53). One trial that used scanning electron microscopy to assess fingernail brittleness reported less fingernail splitting and a 25% increase in the thickness of the nail plate in patients supplemented with biotin for 6 to 15 months [(55)](#reference55). Biotin supplementation (5 mg/day) was also found to be effective in controlling unruly hair and splitting nails in two toddlers with inherited uncombable hair syndrome [(56)](#reference56). Although preliminary evidence suggests that supplemental biotin may help strengthen fragile nails (reviewed in [57](#reference57)), larger [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy of high-dose biotin supplementation for the treatment of brittle fingernails. Biotin administration has been associated with [alopecia](../glossary#alopecia) reversal in children treated with the [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) valproic acid (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)), as well as with hair regrowth or normal hair growth in some children with inborn errors of biotin metabolism or other genetic disorders (i.e., uncombable hair syndrome) (reviewed in [58](#reference58)). Yet, while hair loss is a symptom of severe biotin deficiency (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)), there are no published scientific studies that support the claim that high-dose biotin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are effective in preventing or treating hair loss in men or women [(59, 60)](#reference59). [Randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials in healthy individuals would be needed to evaluate this claim. Biotin is found in many foods, either as the free (i.e., unbound) form that is directly taken up by [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte) or as biotin bound to dietary proteins. Egg yolk, liver, and yeast are rich sources of biotin. Estimates of average daily intakes of biotin from small studies ranged between 40 and 60 micrograms (g) per day in adults [(1)](#references). However, US national nutritional surveys have not yet been able to estimate biotin intake due to the scarcity and unreliability of data regarding biotin content of food. Food composition tables for biotin are incomplete such that dietary intakes cannot be reliably estimated in humans. A study by Staggs et al. [(61)](#reference61) employed a high-performance liquid chromatography method rather than bioassays [(62)](#reference62) and reported relatively different biotin content for some selected foods. Table 2 lists some food sources of biotin, along with their content in g. is about the size of a deck of cards.| A majority of [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) that normally colonize the small and large intestine ( [colon](../glossary#colon)) [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) biotin [(63)](#reference63). Whether the biotin is released and absorbed by humans in meaningful amounts remains unknown. The uptake of free biotin into intestinal cells via the human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) has been identified in cultured cells derived from the lining of the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine) and colon [(64)](#reference64), suggesting that humans may be able to absorb biotin produced by enteric bacteria \u2014 a phenomenon documented in swine. Biotin is available as a single-nutrient [supplement](../glossary#supplement) in various doses (many containing 5,000 g [5 mg] of biotin) and is often included in B-complex and multivitamin-mineral supplements. Several multivitamin supplements contain 30 g of biotin, although the amount varies by product [(65)](#reference65). Biotin is not known to be toxic. In people without disorders of biotin [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), doses of up to 5 mg/day (5,000 g) for two years were not associated with adverse effects [(66)](#reference66). Oral biotin supplementation has been well tolerated in doses up to 200 mg/day (nearly 7,000 times the [AI](../glossary#AI)) in people with hereditary disorders of biotin metabolism [(1)](#references). Daily supplementation with a highly concentrated formulation of biotin (100-600 mg) for several months was also found to be well tolerated in individuals with progressive [multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) [(36](#reference36), [67)](#reference67). However, there is one case report of life-threatening eosinophilic pleuropericardial effusion in an elderly woman who took a combination of 10 mg/day of biotin and 300 mg/day of [pantothenic acid](pantothenic-acid) (vitamin B5) for two months [(68)](#reference68). Because reports of adverse events were lacking when the Dietary Reference Intakes ( [DRIs](../glossary#DRI)) for biotin were established in 1998, the Food and Nutrition Board did not establish a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for biotin [(1)](#references). Large doses of [pantothenic acid](pantothenic-acid) (vitamin B5) have the potential to compete with biotin for intestinal and cellular uptake by the human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) [Pharmacologic](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) (very high) doses of lipoic acid have been found to decrease the activity of biotin-dependent [carboxylases](../glossary#carboxylase) in rats, but such an effect has not been demonstrated in humans [(72)](#reference72). Individuals on long-term [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) (anti- [seizure](../glossary#seizure)) therapy reportedly have reduced blood biotin concentrations, as well as an increased urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of organic acids (e.g., 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid) that indicate decreased [carboxylase](../glossary#carboxylase) activity (see [Markers of biotin status](#biomarkers-status)) [(5)](#reference5). as well increased biotin [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) [(73)](#reference73). Use of the anticonvulsant valproic acid in children has resulted in hair loss reversed by biotin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) [(74-77)](#reference74). Long-term treatment with antibacterial sulfonamide (sulfa) drugs or other antibiotics may decrease [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) synthesis of biotin. Yet, given that the extent to which bacterial synthesis contributes to biotin intake in humans is not known, effects of antimicrobial drugs on biotin nutritional [status](../glossary#status) remain uncertain [(73)](#reference73). In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a safety communication regarding high-dose biotin supplementation and its potential interference with streptavidin (avidin)-biotin immunoassays, including assays of thyroid hormones, reproductive hormones, and the cardiac protein, troponin. Such interference can cause aberrant results \u2014 either falsely high or falsely low depending on the method of the particular assay \u2014 and potential misdiagnosis of disease [(78-81)](#reference78). An updated FDA communication in 2019 focused on biotin interference in certain lab assays of troponin that have not addressed the concern of falsely low blood concentrations [(82)](#reference82). Troponin in blood is a marker of cardiac damage and often used in the clinical diagnosis of a myocardial infarction (heart attack). When blood work is planned, patients should routinely inform their health care provider concerning supplementation of biotin at doses substantially greater than those in usual diets or in routine daily multivitamins. Little is known regarding the amount of dietary biotin required to promote optimal health or prevent [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendation made by the National Academy of Medicine, which is 30 micrograms (g) of biotin per day for adults. A varied diet should provide enough biotin for most people. However, following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement will generally provide an intake of at least 30 g/day of biotin. Presently, there is no indication that older adults have an increased requirement for biotin. If dietary biotin intake is not sufficient, a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement will generally provide an intake of at least 30 g of biotin per day.

Accessed 7/5/2022. Contents [Folate is a water-soluble B-vitamin, which is also known as vitamin B9 or folacin. Naturally occurring folates exist in many chemical forms; folates are found in food, as well as in metabolically active forms in the human body. Folic acid is the major synthetic form found in fortified foods and vitamin supplements. Other synthetic forms include folinic acid (Figure 1) and levomefolic acid. Folic acid has no biological activity unless converted into folates ] [(1)](#references). In the following discussion, forms found in food or the body are referred to as \"folates,\" while the form found in supplements or fortified food is referred to as \"folic acid.\" The only function of folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) in the body appears to be in mediating the transfer of [one-carbon units](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) [(2)](#reference2). Folate coenzymes act as acceptors and donors of one-carbon units in a variety of reactions critical to the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [nucleic acids](../glossary#nucleic-acid) and [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) (Figure vital role in [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) through two different pathways. (1) The [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of DNA from its [precursors](../glossary#precursor) (thymidine and purines) is dependent on folate coenzymes. (2) A folate coenzyme is required for the synthesis of [methionine](../glossary#methionine) from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine), and methionine is required for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is a methyl group (one-carbon unit) donor used in most biological [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, including the methylation of a number of sites within DNA, [RNA](../glossary#RNA), [proteins](../glossary#protein), and [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid). The methylation of DNA plays a role in controlling [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) and is critical during cell [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation). Aberrations in DNA methylation have been linked to the development of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) (see [Cancer](#cancer-prevention)). Folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) are required for enzyme (as but also [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12). Thus, folate (and/or vitamin B12) deficiency can result in decreased synthesis of methionine and an accumulation of homocysteine. Elevated blood concentrations of homocysteine have been considered for many years to be a [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for some chronic diseases, including [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) and [dementia](../glossary#dementia) (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). The [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) intermediate in the metabolism of sulfur-containing [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid), provides an example of the interrelationships among nutrients necessary for optimal physiological function and health. Healthy individuals utilize two different pathways to metabolize homocysteine (Figure 3). One pathway (methionine synthase) [methionine](../glossary#methionine) and folate and [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) as [cofactors](../glossary#cofactor). The other pathway converts homocysteine to another amino acid, cysteine, and requires two [vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6)-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). Thus, the concentration of homocysteine in the blood is regulated by three B-vitamins: folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 [(4)](#reference4). In some individuals, riboflavin (vitamin B2) is also involved in the regulation of homocysteine concentrations (see the article on [Riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin)). Although less well recognized, folate has an important metabolic interaction with [riboflavin](../vitamins/riboflavin). Riboflavin [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), (MTHFR). generates 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (see [Figure 2](#figure-2) above). This active form of folate is required to form [methionine](../glossary#methionine) from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine). Along with other B-vitamins, higher riboflavin intakes have been associated with decreased [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations [(5)](#reference5). The effects of riboflavin on folate [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) appear to be greatest in individuals [homozygous](../glossary#homozygous) for the common c.677C>T [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) (i.e., TT genotype) in folate requirements](#genetic-variation-requirements)) [(6)](#reference6). These individuals (about 10% of adults worldwide) typically present with low folate status, along with elevated homocysteine concentrations, particularly when folate and/or riboflavin intake is suboptimal. The elevated homocysteine concentration in these individuals, however, is highly responsive to lowering with riboflavin supplementation, confirming the importance of the riboflavin-MTHFR interaction [(7)](#reference7). [Vitamin C](../vitamins/vitamin-C) may limit degradation of natural folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) and [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) folic acid in the stomach and thus improve folate [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability). A [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in nine healthy men found that oral co-administration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (343 g) and vitamin C (289 mg or 974 mg) was associated with higher concentrations of serum folate compared to 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid alone [(8)](#reference8). Moreover, a recent study suggested that several genetic variations of folate [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) might influence the effect of vitamin C on folate metabolism [(9)](#reference9). Dietary folates exist predominantly in the polyglutamyl form (containing several [glutamate](../glossary#glutamate) residues), whereas folic acid\u2014the synthetic vitamin form\u2014is a monoglutamate, containing just one glutamate moiety. In addition, natural folates are reduced molecules, whereas folic acid is fully oxidized. These chemical differences have major implications for the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) such that folic acid is considerably more bioavailable than naturally occurring food folates at equivalent intake levels. The [intestinal](../glossary#small-intestine) absorption of dietary folates is a two-step process that involves the [hydrolysis](../glossary#hydrolysis) of folate polyglutamates to the corresponding monoglutamyl derivatives, followed by their transport into intestinal cells. There, folic acid is converted into a naturally occurring folate, namely 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is the major circulating form of folate in the human body (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above). The bioavailability of naturally occurring folates is inherently limited and variable. There is much variability in the ease with which folates are released from different food matrices, and the polyglutamyl \"tail\" is removed (de-conjugation) before uptake by intestinal cells. Also, other dietary constituents can contribute to instability of labile folates during the processes of digestion. As a result, naturally occurring folates show incomplete bioavailability compared with folic acid. The bioavailability of folic acid, in contrast, is assumed to be 100% when ingested as a [supplement](../glossary#supplement), while folic acid in [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food is estimated to have about 85% the bioavailability of supplemental folic acid. Of note, folate recommendations in the US and certain other countries are now expressed as Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFEs), a calculation that was devised to take into account the greater bioavailability of folic acid compared to naturally occurring dietary folates (see [The Recommended Dietary Allowance](#RDA)). Folate and its [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) require transporters to cross [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Folate transporters include reduced folate folate transporter FR and FR. Folate [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) is supported by the ubiquitous distribution of folate transporters, although abundance and importance vary among tissues [(10)](#reference10). PCFT plays a major role in folate intestinal transport since [mutations](../glossary#mutation) affecting the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding PCFT cause hereditary folate [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome). Defective PCFT also leads to impaired folate transport into the brain (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). FR and RFC are also critical for folate transport across the blood-brain barrier when extracellular folate is either low or high, respectively. Folate is essential for the proper development of the embryo and the fetus. The [placenta](../glossary#placenta) is known to concentrate folate to the fetal circulation, leading to higher folate concentrations in the fetus compared to those found in the pregnant woman. All three types of [receptors](../glossary#receptor) have been associated with folate transport across the placenta during pregnancy [(11)](#reference11). Folate deficiency is most often caused by a dietary insufficiency; however, folate deficiency can also occur in a number of other situations. For example, chronic and heavy alcohol consumption is associated with diminished absorption of folate (in addition to low dietary intake), which can lead to folate deficiency [(12)](#reference12). Smoking is also associated with low folate status. In one study, folate concentrations in blood were about 15% lower in smokers compared to nonsmokers [(13)](#reference13). Additionally, impaired folate transport to the fetus has been described in pregnant women who either smoked or abused alcohol during their pregnancy [(14, 15)](#reference14). Pregnancy is a time when the folate requirement is greatly increased to sustain the demand for rapid cell replication and growth of fetal, [placental](../glossary#placenta), and maternal tissue. Conditions such as cancer or inflammation can also result in increased rates of cell division and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), causing an increase in the body's demand for folate [(16)](#reference16). Moreover, folate deficiency can result also to folate deficiency (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Finally, a number of genetic diseases affecting folate absorption, transport, or metabolism can cause folate deficiency or impede its metabolic functions (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). Clinical folate deficiency leads to [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia), which is reversible with folic acid treatment. Rapidly dividing cells like those derived from bone marrow are most vulnerable to the effects of folate deficiency since [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and cell division are dependent on folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme). When folate supply to the rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow is inadequate, blood cell division is reduced, resulting in fewer but larger red blood cells. This type of [anemia](../glossary#anemia) is called [megaloblastic](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) or [macrocytic anemia](../glossary#macrocytic-anemia), referring to the enlarged, immature red blood cells. [Neutrophils](../glossary#neutrophil), a type of white blood cell, become hypersegmented, a change that can be found by examining a blood sample microscopically. Because normal red blood cells have a lifetime in the circulation of approximately four months, it can take months for folate-deficient individuals to develop the characteristic megaloblastic anemia. Progression of such an anemia leads to a decreased oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and may ultimately result in symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath [(1)](#references). It is important to point out that megaloblastic anemia resulting from folate deficiency is identical to the megaloblastic anemia resulting from [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) deficiency, and further clinical testing is required to diagnose the true cause of megaloblastic anemia (see [Toxicity](#safety)). Individuals in the early stages of folate deficiency may not show obvious symptoms, but blood concentrations of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) may increase (see [Disease Prevention](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)). Yet, the concentration of circulating homocysteine is not a specific indicator of folate status, as elevated homocysteine can be the result of vitamin B12 and other B-vitamin deficiencies, lifestyle factors, and [renal](../glossary#renal) insufficiency. Subclinical deficiency is typically detected by measurement of folate concentrations in [serum](../glossary#serum)/ [plasma](../glossary#plasma) or in red blood cells. Traditionally, the dietary folate requirement was defined as the amount needed to prevent a deficiency severe enough to cause symptoms like [anemia](../glossary#anemia). The most recent [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (1998; Table 1) was based primarily on the adequacy of red blood cell folate concentrations at different levels of folate intake, as judged by the absence of abnormal [hematological](../glossary#hematology) indicators. Red cell folate has been shown to correlate with liver folate stores and is used as an indicator of long-term folate status. [Plasma](../glossary#plasma) folate reflects recent folate intake and is not a reliable [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) for folate status. Maintenance of normal blood [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations, an indicator of [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), was considered only as an ancillary indicator of adequate folate intake. Because pregnancy is associated with a significant increase in cell division and other metabolic processes that require folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme), the RDA for pregnant women is considerably higher than for women who are not pregnant [(3)](#reference3). However, the prevention of [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (NTDs) was not considered when setting the RDA for pregnant women. Rather, reducing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of NTDs was considered in a separate recommendation for women capable of becoming pregnant (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)), because the crucial events in the development of the neural tube occur before many women are aware that they are pregnant [(18)](#reference18). When the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine set the new dietary recommendation for folate, they introduced a new unit, the Dietary Folate Equivalent (DFE) [(1)](#references). Use of the DFE reflects the higher [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of synthetic folic acid found in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food compared to that of naturally occurring food folates [(18)](#reference18). For example, a serving of food containing 60 g of folate would provide 60 g of DFEs, while a serving of pasta fortified with 60 g of folic acid would provide 1.7 x 60 = 102 g of DFEs due to the higher bioavailability of folic acid. A folic acid supplement of 400 g taken on an empty stomach would provide 800 g of DFEs. It should be noted that DFEs were determined in studies with adults and whether folic acid in infant formula is more bioavailable than folates in mother's milk has not been studied. Use of DFEs to determine a folate requirement for the infant would not be desirable. |Life Stage||Age||Males (g/day)||Females (g/day)| |Infants||0-6 months|| 65 ( | A [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) or variation in the sequence of the [gene](../glossary#gene) for the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thermolabile enzyme [(19)](#reference19). The substitution of a cytosine (C) by a thymine (T) at [nucleotide](../glossary#nucleotide) 677 in the exon 4 of MTHFR gene leads to an alanine-to-valine transition in the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Depending on the population, 20% to 53% of individuals may have inherited one T copy (677C/T genotype), and 3% to 32% of individuals may have inherited two T copies (677T/T genotype) for the MTHFR [methionine](../glossary#methionine) from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) (see [Figure MTHFR (-30%) and homozygous 677T/T [(21)](#reference21). Homozygosity for the [mutation](../glossary#mutation) (677T/T) is linked to lower concentrations of folate in red blood cells and higher blood concentrations of homocysteine [(22, 23)](#reference22). Improving folate nutritional [status](../glossary#status) in elderly the T allele reduced [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine concentration [(24)](#reference24). An important unanswered question about folate is whether the present [RDA](../glossary#RDA) is enough to compensate for the reduced MTHFR enzyme activity in individuals with at least one T allele, or whether those individuals have a higher folate requirement than the RDA [(25)](#reference25). Fetal growth and development are characterized by widespread cell division. Adequate folate is critical for [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and [RNA](../glossary#RNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). (NTDs) arise from failure of embryonic neural tube closure between the 21st and 27th days after conception, a time when many women may not even realize they are pregnant [(26)](#reference26). NTDs include various malformations, such as lesions of the brain (e.g., [anencephaly](../glossary#anencephaly), encephalocele) or lesions of the spine ( [spina bifida](../glossary#spina-bifida)), which are devastating and life-threatening [(27)](#reference27). The prevalence of NTDs in the United States prior to [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of food with folic acid was estimated to be 1 per 1,000 pregnancies [(1)](#references). Results of [randomized trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have demonstrated 60% to 100% reductions in NTD cases when women consumed folic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in addition to a varied diet during the periconceptional period (about one month before and at least one month after conception) [(28, 29)](#reference28). The results of these and other studies prompted the US Public Health Service to recommend that all women capable of becoming pregnant consume 400 g of folic acid daily to prevent NTDs. Women with a previously affected pregnancy were also advised to receive 4,000 g (4 mg) of folic acid daily in order to reduce NTD recurrence [(30)](#reference30). These recommendations were made to all women of childbearing age because adequate folate must be available very early in pregnancy, and because many pregnancies in the US are unplanned [(31)](#reference31). Despite the effectiveness of folic acid supplementation in improving folate status, it appears that globally only 30% of women who become pregnant correctly follow the recommendation, and there is some concern that young women from minority ethnic groups and lower socioeconomic backgrounds are the least likely to follow the recommendation [(32-34)](#reference32). To decrease the incidence of NTDs, the US FDA implemented legislation in 1998 requiring the fortification of all enriched grain products with 1.4 mg of folic acid per kg of grain (see [Sources](#sources)). The required level of folic acid fortification in the US was initially estimated to provide 100 g of additional folic acid in the average person's diet, though it probably provides even more due to overuse of folic acid by food manufacturers [(25](#reference25), [35)](#reference35). The National Birth Defects Prevention Network reported about a 30% decrease in the prevalence of NTDs in the US compared to the pre-fortification period, and the post-fortification prevalence of NTDs is 0.69 cases per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths [(36)](#reference36). Also, a genetic component in NTD [etiology](../glossary#etiology) is evidenced by the increased [risk](../glossary#risk) in women with a family history of an NTD and also by variations in risk among ethnicities [(37)](#reference37). Moreover, NTD occurrence can be attributed to specific folate- [gene](../glossary#gene) interactions. The MTHFR c.677C>T [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) and other genetic variations can increase the folate requirement and susceptibility for an NTD-affected pregnancy. Prior to the fortification era, a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) showed that both red blood cell and [serum](../glossary#serum) folate concentrations were significantly lower in pregnant women with the T/T and C/T variants compared A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 25 case-control studies, including 2,429 case mothers and 3,570 control mothers, showed a positive association between the maternal MTHFR c.677C>T polymorphism and NTDs [(38)](#reference38). Another MTHFR variant, an A-to-C change at position 1298, has also been associated with reduced MTHFR activity and increased NTD risk [(39)](#reference39). Individuals [heterozygous](../glossary#heterozygous) for both of these MTHFR variants 1298A/C) exhibit lower [plasma](../glossary#plasma) folate than 1298A/A [(40)](#reference40). Combined genotypes with carrier transporter (RFC-1) polymorphism (c.80A>G) could further contribute to NTD occurrence [(41)](#reference41). The degree of NTD risk was also assessed with additional MTHFR polymorphisms (c.116C>T, c.1793G>A) [(42)](#reference42), as well as with [mutations](../glossary#mutation) can impact pregnancy outcome, it appears that gene-gene interactions between mother and fetus influence it further. The risk of NTD was increased by certain genetic combinations, including maternal (MTHFR c.677C>T)-fetal Finally, [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12) status has been associated with NTD risk modification in the presence of specific polymorphisms in one-carbon metabolism [(47)](#reference47). [Congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) of the heart are a major cause of infant mortality but also cause deaths in adulthood [(48)](#reference48). Using data from the European Registration of Congenital Anomalies and Twins (EUROCAT) database, a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study), involving 596 cases and 2,359 controls, found that consumption of at least 400 g/day of folic acid during the periconceptual period (one month before conception through eight weeks' post-conception, covering the period of embryonic heart development) was associated with an 18% reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of congenital heart defects [(49)](#reference49). Recent meta-analyses of 20 to 25 case-control and family-based studies observed positive associations between maternal, fetal, or paternal MTHFR c.677C>T variant and incidence of congenital heart defects [(50, 51)](#reference50). Additional studies are needed to elucidate the effects of [gene](../glossary#gene)-nutrient interactions on the risk of congenital heart defects; however, the currently available research indicates that adequate folate intake may play an important role. Maternal folate status during pregnancy may influence the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) called orofacial clefts, [(52)](#reference52). A population-based [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) in Norway investigated the impact of folic acid [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in mothers of 377 newborns with CL/P, 196 with cleft palate only (CPO) and 763 controls [(53)](#reference53). Although dietary intakes or supplements (during the first three months of pregnancy) on their own did not significantly modify the risk of CL/P, the study reported a 64% lower risk among women taking multivitamin and folic acid (400 g daily) supplements in addition to dietary folates. In the same population, [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in the cystathionine [gene](../glossary#gene) (c.699C>T) or (c.677C>T; when folate intake was below 400 g/day) appeared protective, while other gene variants in the folate/ [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) metabolism could not be linked to CL/P [(54, 55)](#reference54). However, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 studies showed an elevation of CL/P risk with the maternal 677T/T [homozygosity](../glossary#homozygous) [(56)](#reference56). Additional studies are needed to evaluate the risk of CL/P while integrating both genetic polymorphism and folate intake parameters. [Epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) evidence supporting a role for folate in the risk of CPO is lacking. Low birth weight has been associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of mortality during the first year of life and may also influence health outcomes during adulthood [(57)](#reference57). A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found a positive association between folic acid [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) and birth weight; no association with length of [gestation](../glossary#gestation) was observed [(58)](#reference58). Additionally, a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 306 pregnant adolescents associated low folate intakes and maternal folate status during the third trimester of pregnancy with higher incidence of small for gestational age births (birth weight <10th percentile) [(59)](#reference59). Moreover, the maternal c.677C>T MTHFR genotype and increased [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations, considered an indicator of functional folate deficiency, have been linked to lower birth weights [(60)](#reference60). Elevated blood homocysteine concentrations have also been associated with increased incidence of miscarriage and other pregnancy complications, including [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) and [placental abruption](../glossary#placental-abruption) [(61)](#reference61). A large [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) showed that [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine in Norwegian women was strongly related to adverse outcomes and complications, including preeclampsia, premature delivery, and very low birth weight, in previous pregnancies [(62)](#reference62). A recent meta-analysis of 51 prospective cohort studies linked the c.677C>T MTHFR variant with increased risk of preeclampsia in Caucasian and East Asian populations, reinforcing the notion that folate [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) may play a role in the condition [(63)](#reference63). A large multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, the Folic Acid Clinical Trial (FACT), has been initiated to evaluate whether the daily supplementation of up to 5.1 mg of folic acid throughout pregnancy could prevent preeclampsia and other adverse outcomes (e.g., maternal death, placental abruption, preterm delivery) in high-risk women [(64)](#reference64). Adequate folate intake during pregnancy protects against [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) [(65)](#reference65). A recent [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) found a reduction in risk of autism spectrum disorders with daily folic acid consumption of 600 g or more before and during pregnancy when mother and child carried the c.677C>T MTHFR genotype [(66)](#reference66). Thus, it is reasonable to maintain folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy, even after closure of the neural tube, in order to decrease the risk of other problems during pregnancy. Moreover, recent systematic reviews of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found no evidence of an association between folate exposure during pregnancy and adverse health outcomes in offspring, in particular childhood [asthma](../glossary#asthma) and allergies [(67, 68)](#reference67). The results of more than 80 studies indicate that even moderately elevated concentrations of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) in the blood increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) [(4)](#reference4). Possible predispositions to vascular accidents have also been linked to genetic deficiencies in homocysteine [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in certain populations [(69)](#reference69). The mechanism by which homocysteine may increase the risk of vascular disease has been the subject of a great deal of research, but it may involve adverse effects of homocysteine on blood clotting, arterial [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation), and thickening of arterial walls [(70)](#reference70). Although increased homocysteine concentrations in the blood have been consistently associated with increased risk of CVD, it is unclear whether lowering circulating homocysteine will reduce CVD risk (see [Folate and homocysteine](#folate-homocysteine)). Research had initially predicted that a prolonged decrease in [serum](../glossary#serum) homocysteine level of 3 micromoles/liter would lower the risk of CVD by up to 25% and be a reasonable treatment goal for individuals at high risk [(71, 72)](#reference71). However, the analysis of recent [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) of B-vitamin supplementation has shown that lowering homocysteine concentrations did not prevent the occurrence of a second [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) event in patients with existing CVD [(73, 74)](#reference73). Consequently, the American Heart Association recommends screening for elevated total homocysteine concentrations only in \"high risk\" individuals, for example, in those with personal or family history of premature cardiovascular disease, malnutrition or [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome), [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism), kidney failure, [lupus](../glossary#systemic-lupus-erythematosus), or individuals resins, methotrexate, [coronary artery disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease), [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (heart attack), and [stroke](../glossary#stroke). A study that followed 1,980 Finnish men for 10 years found that those who consumed the most dietary folate had a 55% lower risk of an acute coronary event when compared to those who consumed the least dietary folate [(75)](#reference75). Of the three B-vitamins that regulate [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations, folic acid has been shown to have the greatest effect in lowering basal concentrations of homocysteine in the blood when there is no coexisting deficiency [vitamin through food or [supplements](../glossary#supplement) has been found to reduce homocysteine concentrations [(77)](#reference77). Besides, blood homocysteine concentrations have declined since the FDA mandated folic acid [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of the grain supply in the US [(25)](#reference25). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 25 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including almost 3,000 subjects, found that folic acid supplementation with 800 g/day or more could achieve a maximal 25% reduction in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine concentrations. In this meta-analysis, daily doses of 200 g and 400 g of folic acid were associated with a 13% and 20% reduction in plasma homocysteine, respectively [(78)](#reference78). A supplement regimen of 400 g of folic acid, 2 mg of vitamin B6, and 6 g of vitamin B12 has been advocated by the American Heart Association if an initial trial of a folate-rich diet (see [Sources](#sources)) is not successful in adequately lowering homocysteine concentrations [(79)](#reference79). Several [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in folate/ [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) metabolism modify homocysteine concentrations in blood [(80)](#reference80). In particular, the effect of the c.677C>T MTHFR variant has been examined in relation to folic acid fortification policies worldwide. The analysis of [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) trials, including 59,995 subjects without a history of CVD, revealed that the difference in homocysteine concentrations between T/T and C/C genotypes was greater in low-folate regions compared to regions with food fortification policy (3.12 vs. 0.13 micromoles/liter) [(81)](#reference81). Although folic acid supplementation effectively decreases homocysteine concentrations, it is not yet clear whether it also decreases risk for CVD. A recent meta-analysis of 19 randomized [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial), including 47,921 subjects with preexisting cardiovascular or [renal](../glossary#renal) disease, found that homocysteine lowering through folic acid and other B-vitamin supplementation failed to reduce the incidence of CVD despite significant reductions in plasma homocysteine concentrations [(74)](#reference74). Other meta-analyses have confirmed the lack of causality between the lowering of homocysteine and the risk of CVD [(80-82)](#reference80), including the risk of stroke [(83, 84)](#reference83). Consequently, the American Heart Association removed its recommendation for using folic acid to prevent cardiovascular disease in high-risk women [(85)](#reference85). It should be noted that the majority of prevention trials to date have been performed in CVD patients with advanced disease. The evidence supporting a beneficial role for folate and related B-vitamins appears to be strongest for the primary prevention of stroke [(86)](#reference86). The introduction of mandatory folic acid fortification has been associated with a decline in stroke-related mortality in North America, adding further support to the potential benefit of enhancing folate status and/or lowering homocysteine in the prevention of stroke [(87)](#reference87). Despite the controversy regarding the role of homocysteine lowering in CVD prevention, some studies have investigated the effect of folic acid supplementation on the development of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis), a known risk factor for vascular accidents. The measurement of the [carotid](../glossary#carotid-arteries) intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a surrogate endpoint for early atherosclerosis and a predictor for [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(88)](#reference88). The meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials testing the effect of folic acid supplementation showed a significant reduction in CIMT in subjects with chronic kidney diseases and in those at risk for CVD, but not in healthy participants [(89)](#reference89). [Endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction is a common feature in atherosclerosis and vascular disease. High doses of folic acid (400-10,000 g/day) have been associated with improvements in vascular health in both healthy and CVD subjects [(90)](#reference90). Although recent trials failed to demonstrate any cardiovascular protection from folic acid supplementation, low folate intake is a known risk factor for vascular disease, and more research is needed to explore the role of folate in maintaining vascular health [(91)](#reference91). [Cancer](../glossary#cancer) is thought to arise from [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage in excess of ongoing DNA repair and/or the inappropriate expression of critical [genes](../glossary#gene). Because of the important roles played by folate in DNA and [RNA](../glossary#RNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and [methylation](../glossary#methylation), it is possible that inadequate folate intake contributes to genome instability and [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) breakage that often characterize cancer development. In particular, DNA replication and repair are critical for genome maintenance, and the shortage in [nucleotides](../glossary#nucleotide) caused by folate deficiency might lead to genome instability and DNA [mutations](../glossary#mutation). A decrease in 5,10-methylene THF can compromise the conversion of deoxyuridine thymine depletion. This could then lead to uracil misincorporation into DNA during replication or repair, and cause DNA damage, including point mutations and strand breaks [(92)](#reference92). Since 5,10-methylene THF is also the MTHFR enzyme substrate, it is plausible that a reduction of MTHFR activity with the c.677C>T polymorphism may increase the use of 5,10-methylene THF for thymidylate synthesis and prevent DNA damage. However, this hypothesis might only be valid in a situation of folate deficiency [(93)](#reference93). Conversely, it was argued that folic acid supplementation could fuel DNA synthesis, therefore promoting tumor growth. This is supported by the observation that TS can function like a tumor promoter (oncogene), while a reduction in TS activity is linked to a lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of cancer [(94, 95)](#reference94). Additionally, antifolate molecules that block the thymidylate synthesis pathway are successfully used in cancer therapy [(96)](#reference96). Folate also controls the homocysteine/ [methionine](../glossary#methionine) cycle and the pool of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for methylation reactions. Thus, folate deficiency may impair DNA and [protein](../glossary#protein) methylation and alter the [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of genes involved in DNA repair, [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and cell death. Global DNA hypomethylation, a typical hallmark of cancer, causes genome instability and chromosome breaks (reviewed in [97](#reference97)). The consumption of at least five servings of fruit and vegetables daily has been consistently associated with a decreased incidence of cancer [(98)](#reference98). Fruit and vegetables are excellent sources of folate, which may play a role in their anti-carcinogenic effect. [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found diminished folate [status](../glossary#status) to be associated with site-specific cancers. While food [fortification](../glossary#fortification) is mandatory in the US (since 1998; see [Sources](#sources)), concerns about the impact of high folic acid intakes on health have delayed the practice in several other countries [(99)](#reference99). However, the most recent [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of folic acid [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) (supplemental doses ranging from 500 to 5,000 g/day for at least one year) did not show any specific benefit or harm regarding total and site-specific cancer incidence [(100, 101)](#reference100). A pooled analysis of 13 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), which followed a total of 725,134 individuals for a 7 to 20-year period, revealed a modest, inverse association between dietary and total (from food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)) folate intake and [colon](../glossary#colon) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) risk. Specifically, a 2% decrease in colon cancer risk was estimated for every 100 g/day increase in total folate intake [(102)](#reference102). A large US [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), which followed 525,488 subjects, ages 50 to 71 years between 1995 and 2006, correlated dietary folate, supplemental folic acid, and total folate intakes with a decreased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk [(103)](#reference103). However, when stratified by gender, there was no association between dietary folate intake and CRC risk in women [(103, 104)](#reference103). A lack of association between CRC risk and dietary, supplemental, and total folate intakes was also reported in another prospective study that followed more than 90,000 US postmenopausal women during an 11-year period encompassing pre- and post- [fortification](../glossary#fortification) periods [(105)](#reference105). These data suggest the possible influence of gender over CRC risk modification by folate. In the latter study, a significant but transient risk elevation was also observed during the post-fortification era; however, some have asserted that this is unlikely to be caused by increased folate intake due to mandatory fortification [(106)](#reference106). Finally, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found a slight reduction in CRC risk with folate from food [(107)](#reference107). However, it is important to note that the case-control studies were highly [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity), and that the authors stated that dietary fiber, vitamins, and alcohol intake could have confounded their results. Moreover, the lower limit of the highest quantile of folate intake was highly variable, ranging from 270 to 1,367 g/day [(107)](#reference107). While most [epidemiological](../glossary#epidemiological-study) research shows a protective effect of folate against colorectal cancer development, it has been suggested that high doses of supplemental folic acid may actually accelerate tumor growth in cancer patients [(108)](#reference108). Whereas higher folate status within the normal dietary range is widely considered to be protective against cancer, some investigators remain concerned that exposure to excessively high folic acid intakes may increase the growth of pre-existing neoplasms [(108)](#reference108). Several [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) addressed the effect of folic acid supplementation in patients with a history of [colorectal adenoma](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma), with trials finding a risk reduction or no effect of supplemental folic acid [(109-112)](#reference109). A recent meta-analysis of three large [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in high-risk subjects did not demonstrate any increase in colorectal adenoma recurrence in subjects supplemented with 500 or 1,000 g/day of folic acid for 24 to 42 months when compared with [placebo](../glossary#placebo) treatment [(113)](#reference113). As suggested earlier, the MTHFR 677T/T genotype might prevent uracil misincorporation and protect [DNA](../glossary#DNA) integrity and stability under low-folate conditions. A meta-analysis of 62 case-control and two cohort studies revealed that while the T/T variant reduces CRC risk by 12% compared to both C/T and C/C genotypes, the risk was decreased by 30% g/day) versus low in the MTR gene, which codes for methionine synthase, was also examined in relation with the risk of colorectal adenoma and cancer. Methionine synthase [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) and into methionine and TFH, respectively. The recent meta-analysis of 27 case-control studies showed no association between MTR variant and cancer risk [(115)](#reference115). Although alcohol consumption interferes with the absorption and metabolism of folate [(16)](#reference16), one case-control and five prospective cohort studies have reported either reduction in CRC risk among nondrinkers compared to drinkers or a lack of association [(107)](#reference107). However, in a large prospective study that followed more than 28,000 male health professionals for 22 years, intake of more than two alcoholic drinks (>30 grams of alcohol) per day augmented CRC risk by 42% during the pre-fortification period. CRC risk was not increased during the post-fortification period, suggesting that it is the combination of high alcohol and low folate intake that might increase CRC risk. Yet, another prospective study that followed more than 69,000 female nurses for 28 years did not report a significant increase in CRC risk with alcohol intake before and after the mandatory folic acid fortification [(116)](#reference116). In some studies, individuals who are [homozygous](../glossary#homozygous) for the c.677C>T MTHFR polymorphism (T/T) have been found to be at decreased risk for colon cancer when folate intake is adequate. However, when folate intake is low and/or alcohol intake is high, individuals with the (T/T) genotype have been found to be at increased risk of colorectal cancer [(117, 118)](#reference117). Several [prospective cohort](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) affects [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [risk](../glossary#risk) have reported mixed results [(119)](#reference119). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 15 prospective studies and one [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) found no relationship with dietary folate intake [(120)](#reference120). Moderate alcohol intake has been associated with increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of breast cancer in women [(121)](#reference121). The results of three prospective studies suggested that increased folate intake may reduce the risk of breast cancer in women who regularly consume alcohol [(122-124)](#reference122). Thus, high folate intake might be associated with a risk reduction only in women whose breast cancer risk is raised by alcohol consumption. A very large prospective study in more than 88,000 nurses reported that folic acid intake was not associated with breast cancer in women who consumed less than one alcoholic drink per day. However, in women consuming at least one alcoholic drink per day, folic acid intake of at least 600 g daily resulted in about half the risk of breast cancer compared with women who consumed less than 300 g of folic acid daily [(124)](#reference124). Nevertheless, whether and how alcohol consumption increases breast cancer risk is still subject to discussion [(125, 126)](#reference125). Finally, recent meta-analyses evaluating the influence of [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) on cancer risk found that specific variants in the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding thymidylate synthase increased the risk of breast cancer in certain ethnic populations [(127, 128)](#reference127). The incidence of Wilms' tumors (kidney [cancer](../glossary#cancer)) and certain types of brain cancers (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and ependymoma) in children has decreased since the mandatory [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of the US grain supply in 1998 [(129)](#reference129). However, incidence rates were unchanged between the pre- and post-fortification periods for leukemia\u2014a predominant childhood malignancy. Despite earlier studies linking maternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy with the reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of childhood leukemia, more recent investigations have found little evidence to support a preventive effect of folic acid [(130)](#reference130). Several [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) have also found little to no protective effect with MTHFR [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism); however, the most recent meta-analysis of 22 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found a reduction in the risk of acute lymphoblastic [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia) (ALL) with the c.677C>T variant in Caucasians and Asians [(131)](#reference131). [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) is the most common form of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), affecting more than 5 million individuals over 65 years old in the US [(132)](#reference132). [-amyloid plaque](../glossary#amyloid-plaque) deposition, Tau protein-forming tangles, and increased cell death in the brain of AD patients have been associated with [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline and memory loss. One study associated increased consumption of fruit and vegetables, which are abundant sources of folate, with a reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing dementia and AD in women [(133)](#reference133). Through its role in [nucleic acid](../glossary#nucleic-acid) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and methyl donor provision for [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, folate is critical for normal brain development and function, not only during pregnancy and after birth, but also later in life [(134)](#reference134). In one [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of elderly women, AD patients had significantly higher [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) and lower red blood cell folate concentrations compared to healthy individuals. However, there was no difference in the level of [serum](../glossary#serum) folate between groups, suggesting that long-term folate status, rather than recent folate intake, may be associated with the risk of AD [(135)](#reference135). Several investigators have described associations between increased homocysteine concentrations and cognitive impairment in the elderly [(136)](#reference136), but [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have not found higher folate intakes to be associated with improved [cognition](../glossary#cognition) [(137, 138)](#reference137). Higher homocysteine concentrations were found in individuals suffering from dementia, including AD and [vascular dementia](../glossary#vascular-dementia), compared to healthy subjects [(139, 140)](#reference139). Although deficiencies in folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 could increase homocysteine concentrations, a reduction in [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) concentrations in the serum of AD patients compared to healthy individuals could not be attributed to decreased vitamin intakes [(141)](#reference141). It is not presently clear whether serum homocysteine is a risk factor for developing dementia or simply associated with the cognitive decline. In the last decade, a number of [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have tested the use of B-vitamins to lower homocysteine and prevent or delay cognitive decline. A meta-analysis of nine randomized, placebo-controlled trials of folic acid supplementation (0.2 to 15 mg/day for a median duration of six months) in healthy individuals over 45 years of age failed to find a short-term effect on cognitive functions, including memory, speed, language, and [executive functions](../glossary#executive-function) [(142)](#reference142). More recently, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 19 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials of B-vitamin supplementation found no difference in cognitive parameters between the treatment and placebo groups, despite the treatment effectively lowering homocysteine concentrations [(143)](#reference143). Inconsistent findings across trials may be due to differences in design and methodology (reviewed in [144](#reference144)). Nevertheless, a two-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 168 elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment recently described the benefits of a daily regimen of 800 g of folic acid, 500 g of vitamin B12, and 20 mg of vitamin B6 [(145, 146)](#reference145). [Atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) of specific brain regions affected by AD was observed in individuals of both groups, and this atrophy correlated with cognitive decline; however, the B-vitamin treatment group experienced a smaller loss of [gray matter](../glossary#gray-matter) compared to the placebo group (0.5% vs. 3.7%). A greater benefit was seen in subjects with higher baseline homocysteine concentrations, suggesting the importance of lowering circulating homocysteine in prevention of cognitive decline and dementia. Although encouraging, the effect of B-vitamin supplementation needs to be further studied in larger trials that evaluate long-term outcomes, such as the incidence of AD. Folinic acid (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above), a tetrahydrofolic acid derivative, is used in the clinical management of rare inborn errors that affect folate transport or [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) (reviewed in [147](#reference147)). Such conditions are of [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) inheritance, meaning only individuals receiving two copies of the mutated [gene](../glossary#gene) (one from each parent) develop the disease. Hereditary folate [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) is caused by [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the SLC46A1 [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for the folate transporter PCFT and typically affects [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) folate absorption and folate transport into the brain [(148)](#reference148). Patients present with low to undetectable concentrations of folate in [serum](../glossary#serum) and [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid), pancytopenia (low number of all blood cells), impaired immune responses that increase susceptibility to infections, and a general failure to thrive [(149)](#reference149). [Neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms, including [seizures](../glossary#seizure), have also been observed [(150)](#reference150). Clinical improvements have been recorded following [parenteral](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) provision of folinic acid [(151)](#reference151). CFD is characterized by low levels of folate [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme) in [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) despite normal concentrations of folate in blood. Folate transport across the blood-brain barrier is compromised in CFD and has been linked either to the presence of [antibodies](../glossary#antibody) blocking the folate receptor FR or FR 153)](#reference152). [Neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) abnormalities, along with visual and hearing impairments, have been described in children with CFD; autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is present in some cases. Folinic acid (also known as leucovorin) can enter the brain and normalize the level of folate coenzymes and has been shown to normalize folate concentrations and improve various social interactions in CFD, including mood, behavior, and verbal communication in children with ASD [(152, 154, 155)](#reference152). DHFR is the NADPH-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). DHFR is also required to convert folic acid to DHF. DHFR deficiency is characterized by [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) and [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) folate deficiency causing intractable [seizures](../glossary#seizure) and mental deficits. Although folinic acid treatment can alleviate the symptoms of DHFR deficiency, early diagnosis is essential to prevent irreversible brain damage and improve clinical outcomes [(156, 157)](#reference156). Green leafy vegetables (foliage) are rich sources of folate and provide the basis for its name. Citrus fruit juices, [legumes](../glossary#legumes), and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) foods are also excellent sources of folate [(1)](#references); the folate content of fortified cereal varies greatly. A number of folate-rich foods are listed in Table 2, along with their folate content in micrograms (g). For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search [USDA's FoodData help prevent neural tube defects, the US FDA required the addition of 1.4 milligrams (mg) of folic acid per kilogram (kg) of grain to be added to refined grain products, which are already enriched with niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and iron, as of January 1, 1998. The addition of nutrients to food in order to prevent a nutritional deficiency or restore nutrients lost in processing is known as | The principal form of [supplementary](../glossary#supplement) folate is folic acid. It is available in single-ingredient and combination products, such as B-complex vitamins and multivitamins. Doses of 1 mg or greater require a prescription [(159)](#reference159). Additionally, folinic acid, a tetrahydrofolic acid derivative, is used to manage certain metabolic diseases (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)). Further, the US FDA has approved the supplementation of folate in oral contraceptives. The addition of levomefolate calcium (the calcium salt of MeTHF; 451 g/tablet) to oral contraceptives is intended to raise folate status in women of childbearing age [(160)](#reference160). According to a US national survey, only 24% of non-pregnant women aged 15-44 years are meeting the current recommendation of 400 g/day of folic acid [(161)](#reference161). No adverse effects have been associated with the consumption of excess folate from food. Concerns regarding safety are limited to synthetic folic acid intake. Deficiency of vitamin B12, though often undiagnosed, may affect a significant number of people, especially older adults (see the article on [Vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12#deficiency)). One symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency is [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia), which is indistinguishable from that associated with folate deficiency (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). Large doses of folic acid given to an individual with an undiagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency could correct megaloblastic anemia without correcting the underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, leaving the individual at [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing irreversible [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) damage. Such cases of neurologic progression in vitamin B12 deficiency have been mostly seen at folic acid doses of 5,000 g (5 mg) and above. In order to be very sure of preventing irreversible neurological damage in vitamin B12-deficient individuals, the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine advises that all adults limit their intake of folic acid ( [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and [fortification](../glossary#fortification)) to 1,000 g (1 mg) daily (Table 3). The Board also noted that vitamin B12 deficiency is very rare in women in their childbearing years, making the consumption of folic acid at or above 1,000 g/day unlikely to cause problems [(1)](#references); however, there are limited data on the effects of large doses. |Age of intake should be from food and formula only.| The saturation of DHFR metabolic capacity by oral doses of folic acid has been associated with the appearance of unmetabolized folic acid in blood [(162)](#reference162). [Hematologic](../glossary#hematology) abnormalities and poorer [cognition](../glossary#cognition) have been associated with the presence of unmetabolized folic acid in vitamin B12-deficient older adults (60 years) [(163, 164)](#reference163). A small study conducted in postmenopausal women also raised concerns about the effect of exposure to unmetabolized folic acid on immune function [(165)](#reference165). In a small, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [open-label trial](../glossary#open-label-trial) in 38 women of reproductive age receiving 30 weeks of daily multivitamin supplements, daily supplementation with either 1.1 mg or 5 mg of folic acid resulted in the transient appearance of unmetabolized folic acid in blood over the first 12 weeks of supplementation [(166)](#reference166). However, unmetabolized folic acid concentrations returned to baseline levels at the end of the study, suggesting that adaptive mechanisms eventually converted folic acid to reduced forms of folate. Nonetheless, the use of supplemental levomefolate (5-methyl THF) may provide an alternative to prevent the potential negative effects of unconverted folic acid in older adults. When nonsteroidal anti- [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen, are taken in very large therapeutic dosages (i.e., to treat severe arthritis), they may interfere with folate [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). In contrast, routine use of NSAIDs has not been found to adversely affect folate [status](../glossary#status). The [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant), phenytoin, has been shown to inhibit the [intestinal](../glossary#small-intestine) absorption of folate, and several studies have associated decreased folate status with long-term use of the anticonvulsants, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone [(167)](#reference167). However, few studies controlled for differences in dietary folate intake between anticonvulsant users and nonusers. Also, taking folic acid at the same time as the [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering agents, cholestyramine and colestipol, may decrease the absorption of folic acid [(159)](#reference159). Methotrexate is a folate [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) used of diseases, including [cancer](../glossary#cancer), [rheumatoid arthritis](../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis), and [psoriasis](../glossary#psoriasis). Some of the side effects of methotrexate are similar to those of severe folate deficiency, and supplementation with folic or folinic acid is used to reduce antifolate toxicity. Other antifolate molecules currently used in cancer therapy include aminopterin, pemetrexed, pralatrexate, and raltitrexed [(96)](#reference96). Further, a number of other medications have been shown to have antifolate activity, including trimethoprim (an antibiotic), pyrimethamine (an antimalarial), triamterene (a blood pressure medication), and sulfasalazine (a treatment for [ulcerative colitis](../glossary#ulcerative-colitis)). Early studies of oral contraceptives (birth control pills) containing high doses of [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) indicated adverse effects on folate status; however, this finding has not been supported in more recent studies that used low-dose oral contraceptives and controlled for dietary folate [(168)](#reference168). The available scientific evidence shows that adequate folate intake prevents [neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) and other poor outcomes of pregnancy; is helpful in lowering the [risk](../glossary#risk) of some forms of [cancer](../glossary#cancer), especially in genetically susceptible individuals; and may lower the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that adults take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, which typically contains 400 g of folic acid, the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)). Even with a larger than average intake of folic acid from [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food, it is unlikely that an individual's daily folic acid intake would regularly exceed the tolerable upper intake level of 1,000 g/day established by the Institute of Medicine (see [Safety](#safety)). The recommendation for 400 g/day of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) folic acid as part of a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, in addition to a folate-rich diet, is especially important for older adults because blood [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations tend to increase with age (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)).

Rev. 2011;69(10):572-583. Niacin or vitamin B3 is a water-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) used by the body to form the nicotinamide [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme), NAD+. The term 'niacin' is often used to refer to nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) only, although other vitamers with a pyridine ring, including nicotinamide (pyridine-3-carboxamide) and nicotinamide riboside, also contribute to NAD+ formation [(1)](#references). None of the vitamers are related to the nicotine found in tobacco, although their names are similar. Likewise, nicotine \u2014 but not nicotinic acid \u2014 is an [agonist](../glossary#agonist) of the nicotinic [receptors](../glossary#receptor) that respond to the [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter), acetylcholine. Essential to all forms of life, the nicotinamide [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) NAD+ is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) in the body from four [precursors](../glossary#precursor) that are provided in the diet: nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, nicotinamide riboside, and tryptophan (Figure 1). Figure 2 illustrates the separate biosynthetic pathways that lead to NAD+ production from the various dietary precursors. NAD+ is synthesized from nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside via two enzymatic reactions, while the pathway that yields NAD+ from nicotinic acid - known as the Preiss-Handler pathway \u2014 includes three steps. The kynurenine pathway is the longest NAD+ biosynthetic pathway: the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) of tryptophan through kynurenine produces acid, which is then converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide, an intermediate in NAD+ [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). NAD+ is then synthesized from nicotinic acid mononucleotide the Preiss-Handler pathway [(2)](#reference2). All pathways mononucleotide. Specific a phosphoribose moiety onto nicotinic acid or quinolinic acid to produce onto nicotinamide to generate nicotinamide mononucleotide. or (NADSYN), which uses glutamine as amide (Figure 2) [(2)](#reference2). Of note, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide has been reported to form following the administration of high-dose nicotinamide riboside, suggesting that a potential deamidation could occur to convert NAD+ to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide when the pool is high [(1)](#references). NAD kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of into ( [redox](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#redox%20reaction)) properties of the dinucleotide are not affected by the phosphorylation such that the redox pairs NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH show similar redox potentials [(4)](#reference4). Oxidation and reduction of the C-4 position of the nicotinamide moiety of NADand its phosphorylated form are essential for electron-transfer reactions supporting vital metabolic and bioenergetic functions in all cells (see [Function](#function)). Thus, NAD and NADP are recycled back and forth between oxidized (NAD+ and NADP+) and reduced forms (NADH and NADPH), as shown in Figure 3. Living organisms derive most of their energy from [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) reactions, which are processes involving the transfer of [electrons](../glossary#electron). Over 400 [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) require the niacin [coenzymes](../glossary#coenzyme), NAD and NADP, mainly to accept or donate electrons for redox reactions [(5)](#reference5). NAD and NADP appear to support distinct functions (Figure 4). NAD functions most often in energy-producing reactions involving the degradation ( [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism)) of [carbohydrates](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#carbohydrate), fats, [proteins](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#protein), and alcohol. NADP generally serves in biosynthetic (anabolic) reactions, such as [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [steroids](../glossary#steroid) (e.g., [cholesterol](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#cholesterol), bile acids, building blocks of other macromolecules [(4)](#reference4). NADP is also essential for the regeneration of components of detoxification and [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) systems [(4)](#reference4). To support these functions, the cell maintains NAD in a largely oxidized state (NAD+) to serve as oxidizing agent for catabolic reactions, while NADP is kept largely in a reduced state (NADPH) to readily donate electrons for reductive cellular processes The niacin [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme), NAD, is the [substrate](../glossary#substrate) (reactant) for at least four classes of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). Two classes of enzymes with mono adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase and/or poly (ADP-ribose) Silent information regulator-2 (Sir2)-like proteins removal of acetyl groups acetylated [proteins](../glossary#protein), utilizing ADP-ribose from NAD as an acceptor for acetyl groups. Finally, ADP-ribosylcyclases are involved in the regulation of intracellular [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling). [Enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) with ADP-ribosyltransferase activities were ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). ARTs were first discovered in certain [pathogenic](../glossary#pathogen) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) \u2014 like those causing cholera or diphtheria \u2014 where they mediate the actions of toxins. These enzymes transfer an ADP-ribose residue moiety from NAD to a specific [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) of a target [protein](../glossary#protein), with the creation of an ADP-ribosylated protein and the release of nicotinamide. Because most PARPs have been found to exhibit only mono ADP-ribosyltransferase activities, a new nomenclature was proposed for enzymes catalyzing ADP-ribosylation: A family of mono ADP-ribosyltransferases with [homology](../glossary#homologous) to bacterial diphteria toxins was named ARTD, while enzymes with either mono or poly ADP-ribosyltransferase activities and related to C2 and C3 clostridial toxins sirtuins (SIRT 1-7) have been Sirtuins are a class of NAD-dependent deacetylase [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) that remove acetyl groups from the acetylated lysine residues of target [proteins](../glossary#protein). During the deacetylation process, the acetyl group is transferred onto the ADP-ribose moiety cleaved off NAD, producing O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Nicotinamide can to the Like ADP-ribosylation, [acetylation](../glossary#acetylation) is a post- [translational](../glossary#translation) modification that affects the function of target proteins. The initial interest in sirtuins followed the discovery that their activation could mimic caloric restriction, which has been shown to increase lifespan in lower organisms. Such a role in mammals is controversial, although sirtuins are energy-sensing regulators involved in [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways that could play important roles in delaying the onset of age-related diseases (e.g., [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), [cancer](../glossary#cancer), [dementia](../glossary#dementia), arthritis). To date, the spectrum of their biological functions includes [gene](../glossary#gene) silencing, [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage repair, [cell cycle](../glossary#cell-cycle) regulation, and cell [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) [(10)](#reference10). In humans, CD38 and CD157 belong to a family of NAD+ glycohydrolases/ADP-ribosylcyclases. These [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) [catalyze](../glossary#catalyst) the formation of ADP-ribose, cyclic and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate works within cells to provoke the release of calcium [ions](../glossary#ion) from internal storage sites (i.e., endoplasmic reticulum, mononucleotide O-acetyl-ADP-ribose generated by the activity of sirtuins also controls calcium entry through TRPM2 channels [(6)](#reference6). Intracellular calcium-mediated signal transduction is regulated by transient calcium entry into the cell or release of calcium from intracellular stores. Calcium signaling is critically involved in processes like neurotransmission, [insulin](../glossary#insulin) release from [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) -cells, muscle cell contraction, and T- [lymphocyte](../glossary#lymphocyte) activation [(6)](#reference6). NAD+ has been identified as [membrane](../glossary#cell-membrane) [receptors](../glossary#receptor) of the P2Y subclass. In particular, NAD was found to bind to P2Y1 receptor and act as an inhibitory [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) at neuromuscular junctions in visceral smooth muscles [(12)](#reference12). Extracellular NAD+ was also found to behave like a proinflammatory [cytokine](../glossary#cytokine), triggering the activation of isolated granulocytes. NAD+ binding to the P2Y11 receptor at the granulocyte surface activated a [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) cascade involving cyclic ADP-ribose and the rise of intracellular calcium, eventually stimulating superoxide generation and [chemotaxis](../glossary#chemotaxis) [(13)](#reference13). [monocytes](../glossary#monocyte) NAADP+ and ADP-ribose receptors and trigger intracellular and ADP-ribose-dependent calcium mobilization (see [Calcium over half a century, [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of nicotinic acid, but not nicotinamide, have to reduce [serum](../glossary#serum) [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) (see [Disease Treatment](#disease-treatment)) [(17)](#reference17). However, the exact mechanisms underlying the [lipid](../glossary#lipid)-lowering effect of nicotinic acid remain speculative. Two G-protein-coupled [membrane](../glossary#cell-membrane) [receptors](../glossary#receptor), GPR109A and GPR109B, bind nicotinic acid with high and low affinity, respectively. These nicotinic acid receptors are primarily expressed in [adipose tissue](../glossary#adipose-tissue) and immune cells (but not [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte)). They are also found in retinal pigmented and colonic epithelial cells, [keratinocytes](../glossary#keratinocyte), breast cells, microglia, and possibly at low levels in the liver [(18)](#reference18). Thus, lipid-modifying effects of nicotinic acid are likely to be mediated by receptor-independent mechanisms in major tissues of lipid [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) like liver and skeletal muscle. Early [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) data suggested that nicotinic acid in [hepatocytes](../glossary#hepatocyte) [(19)](#reference19). In another study, nicotinic acid affected the hepatic uptake of ApoAI lipoprotein, thereby reducing [high-density lipoprotein](../glossary#HDL) (HDL) removal from the circulation (reviewed in [20](#reference20)). In adipocytes, the binding of nicotinic acid to GPR109A was found to initiate a [signal transduction cascade](../glossary#signal-transduction-pathway) resulting in reductions in free [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase involved in triglyceride lipolysis [(21)](#reference21). Nonetheless, recent observations have suggested that the lipid-lowering effect of nicotinic acid was not due to its anti-lipolytic activity [(22)](#reference22). Trials showed that synthetic agonists of GPR109A acutely lowered free fatty acids yet failed to affect serum lipids [(22)](#reference22). Aside from its impact on HDL and other [plasma](../glossary#plasma) lipids, nicotinic acid has exhibited modulating [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and regulating cell adhesion, migration, and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) (reviewed in [18](#reference18)). The late stage of severe niacin deficiency is known as pellagra. Early records of pellagra followed the widespread cultivation of corn in Europe in the 1700s [(23)](#reference23). The disease is generally associated with poorer social classes whose chief dietary staple consisted of cereal like corn or sorghum. Pellagra was also common in the southern United States during the early 1900s where income was low and corn products were a major dietary staple [(24)](#reference24). Interestingly, pellagra was not known in Mexico, where corn was also an important dietary staple and much of the population was also poor. In fact, if corn contains appreciable amounts of niacin, it is present in a bound form that is not nutritionally available to humans. The traditional preparation of corn tortillas in Mexico involves soaking the corn in a lime (calcium oxide) solution, prior to cooking. Heating the corn in an [alkaline](../glossary#alkaline) solution results in the release of bound niacin, increasing its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) [(25)](#reference25). Pellagra epidemics were also unknown to Native Americans who consumed immature corn that contains predominantly unbound (bioavailable) niacin [(24)](#reference24). Niacin deficiency or pellagra may result from inadequate dietary intake of NAD precursors, including tryptophan. Niacin deficiency \u2014 often associated with malnutrition \u2014 is observed in the homeless population, in individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa or [obesity](../glossary#obesity), and in consumers of diets high in maize and poor in animal protein [(26-29)](#reference26). Deficiencies of other B [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin) and some trace [minerals](../glossary#mineral) may aggravate niacin deficiency [(30, 31)](#reference30). Malabsorptive disorders megaduodenum [(32, 33)](#reference32). Patients disease](../glossary#hartnup-disease), a hereditary disorder resulting in defective tryptophan absorption, have developed pellagra (see [Niacin-responsive genetic disorders](#niacin-responsive-genetic-disorders-treatment)). [Carcinoid syndrome](../glossary#carcinoid-syndrome), a condition secretion of [serotonin](../glossary#serotonin) and other [catecholamines](../glossary#catecholamine) by carcinoid tumors, may also result in pellagra due to increased utilization of dietary tryptophan for serotonin rather than niacin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). Further, prolonged treatment with the anti- [tuberculosis](../glossary#tuberculosis) drug isoniazid has resulted in niacin deficiency [(34)](#reference34). Other pharmaceutical agents, including the immunosuppressive given to people with [Parkinson's disease)](../glossary#parkinson-disease), are known to increase the reliance on dietary niacin by interfering with the tryptophan-kynurenine-niacin pathway [(35)](#reference35). Finally, other populations at risk for niacin deficiency include [dialysis](../glossary#dialysis) patients, cancer patients [(36, 37)](#reference36), individuals suffering from chronic alcoholism [(38)](#reference38), and people with [HIV](../glossary#HIV) (see [HIV/AIDS](#HIV-AIDS-treatment) below). Further, chronic alcohol intake can lead to severe niacin deficiency through reducing dietary niacin intake and interfering with the tryptophan-to-NAD conversion [(30)](#reference30). The most common symptoms of niacin deficiency involve the skin, the digestive system, and the nervous system. The symptoms of pellagra are commonly referred to as the three \"Ds\": sun-sensitive [dermatitis](../glossary#dermatitis), diarrhea, and [dementia](../glossary#dementia). A fourth \"D,\" death, occurs if pellagra is left untreated [(5)](#reference5). In the skin, a thick, scaly, darkly pigmented rash develops symmetrically in areas exposed to sunlight. In fact, the word \"pellagra\" comes from \"pelle agra,\" the Italian phrase for rough skin. Symptoms related to the digestive system include [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the mouth and tongue (\"bright red tongue\"), vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and ultimately, diarrhea. [Gastrointestinal ](../glossary#gastrointestinal)disorders and diarrhea contribute to the ongoing malnourishment of the patients. [Neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms include headache, apathy, fatigue, depression, disorientation, and memory loss and are more consistent with delirium than with the historically described dementia [(38)](#reference38). Disease presentations vary in appearance since the classic triad rarely presents in its entirety. The absence of dermatitis, for example, is known as pellagra sine pellagra. To treat pellagra, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends administering nicotinamide to avoid the flushing commonly caused by nicotinic acid (see [Safety](#safety)). Treatment guidelines suggest using 300 mg/day of oral nicotinamide in divided doses, or 100 mg/day administered parenterally in divided doses, for three to four weeks [(37, 39)](#reference37). Because patients with pellagra often display additional [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) deficiencies, administration of a vitamin B-complex preparation is advised [(39)](#reference39). The term \"niacin equivalent\" (NE) is used to describe the contribution to dietary intake of all the forms of niacin that are available to the body. In healthy individuals, less than 2% of dietary tryptophan is converted to NAD in the kynurenine pathway [(40)](#reference40). The synthesis of NAD from tryptophan is fairly inefficient and depends on [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) requiring [vitamin B6](vitamin-B6) and riboflavin, Nonetheless, tryptophan is essential as a for NAD+. Inherited defects in tryptophan transport and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) result in severe clinical disorders attributed to NAD+ depletion (see [Niacin-responsive genetic disorders](#niacin-responsive-genetic-disorders-treatment)). On average, 60 milligrams (mg) of tryptophan are considered to correspond to 1 mg of niacin or 1 mg of NE. The recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for niacin is based on the prevention of deficiency. Pellagra can be prevented by about 11 mg NE/day, but 12 mg to 16 mg NE/day has been found to normalize the urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of niacin [metabolites](../glossary#metabolism) (breakdown products) in healthy young adults. Because pellagra represents severe deficiency, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine chose to use the excretion of niacin metabolites as an indicator of niacin nutritional status rather than symptoms of pellagra [(41)](#reference41). However, it has been argued that cellular NAD and NADP content may be more relevant indicators of niacin nutritional [(24)](#reference24). of cultured cells ( [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro)) provide evidence that NAD content influences mechanisms that maintain [genomic](../glossary#genome) stability. Loss of genomic stability, characterized by a high rate of damage to [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and [chromosomes](../glossary#chromosome), is a hallmark of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(42)](#reference42). The current understanding is that the pool of NAD is decreased during niacin deficiency and that it affects the activity of NAD-consuming [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) rather than [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) and metabolic poly ADP-ribosylations catalyzed by PARP enzymes (ARTDs) are critical for the cellular response to DNA injury. After DNA damage, PARPs are activated; the subsequent poly ADP-ribosylations of a number of signaling and structural molecules by PARPs were shown to facilitate DNA repair at DNA strand breaks [(44)](#reference44). Cellular depletion of NAD has been found to decrease levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53, a target for poly ADP-ribosylation, in human breast, skin, and lung cells [(45)](#reference45). The expression of p53 was also altered by niacin deficiency in rat bone marrow cells [(46)](#reference46). Impairment of DNA repair caused by niacin deficiency could lead to genomic instability and drive tumor development in rat models [(47, 48)](#reference47). Both PARPs and sirtuins have been recently involved in the maintenance of heterochromatin, a chromosomal domain associated with genome stability, as well as in [transcriptional](../glossary#transcription) [gene](../glossary#gene) silencing, [telomere](../glossary#telomere) integrity, and chromosome segregation during cell division [(49, 50)](#reference49). Neither the cellular NAD content nor the dietary intake of NAD precursors necessary for optimizing protective responses following DNA damage has been determined, but both are likely to be higher than that required for the prevention of pellagra. [Cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients often suffer from bone marrow suppression following [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy), given that bone marrow is one of the most [proliferative](../glossary#proliferation) tissues in the body and thus a primary target for chemotherapeutic agents. Niacin deficiency was found to decrease bone marrow NAD and poly-ADP-ribose levels and increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of chemically induced [leukemia](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#leukemia) in rats [(51)](#reference51). Conversely, a [pharmacologic dose](../glossary#pharmacological-dose) of either nicotinic acid or nicotinamide was able to increase NAD and poly ADP-ribose in bone marrow and decrease the development of leukemia in rats [(52)](#reference52). It has been suggested that niacin deficiency often observed in cancer patients could sensitize bone marrow tissue to the suppressive effect of chemotherapy. However, little is known regarding cellular NAD levels and the prevention of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage or cancer in humans. One study in two healthy individuals involved elevating NAD levels in blood [lymphocytes](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#lymphocyte) by supplementation with 100 mg/day of nicotinic acid for eight weeks. Compared to non-supplemented individuals, the supplemented individuals had reduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes exposed to [free radicals](../glossary#free-radical) in a test tube assay [(53)](#reference53). However, nicotinic acid supplementation of up to 100 mg/day for 14 weeks in 21 healthy smokers failed to provide any evidence of a decrease in cigarette smoke-induced genetic damage in blood lymphocytes compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(54)](#reference54). More recently, the frequency of [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) translocation was used to evaluate DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 82 pilots chronically exposed to ionizing radiation, a known human [carcinogen](../glossary#carcinogen). In this [observational study](../glossary#observational-study), the rate of chromosome aberrations was significantly lower in subjects with higher (28.4 mg/day) compared to lower (20.5 mg/day) dietary niacin intake [(55)](#reference55). Higher availability of NAD+ in X-irradiated peripheral blood lymphocytes was found to favor DNA repair by enhancing survival, particularly through SIRT-mediated p53 deacetylation [(56)](#reference56). Generally, relationships between dietary factors and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) are established first in [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) and followed up by basic cancer research at the cellular level. In the case of niacin, research on biochemical and cellular aspects of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) repair has stimulated an interest in the relationship between niacin intake and cancer risk in human populations [(57)](#reference57). A large [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) found increased consumption of niacin, along with [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients, to be associated with decreased incidence of oral (mouth), pharyngeal (throat), and [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) cancers in northern Italy and Switzerland. An increase in daily niacin intake of 6.2 mg was associated with about a 40% decrease in cases of cancers of the mouth and throat, while a 5.2 mg increase in daily niacin intake was associated with a similar decrease in cases of [esophageal](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#esophagus) cancer [(58, 59)](#reference58). Niacin deficiency can lead to severe sunlight sensitivity in exposed skin. Given the implication of NAD-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) in [DNA](../glossary#DNA) repair, there has been some interest in the effect of niacin on skin health. [In vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) and animal experiments have helped gather information, but human data on niacin/NAD status and skin [cancer](../glossary#cancer) are very limited. One study reported that niacin supplementation decreased the [risk](../glossary#risk) of ultraviolet light (UV)-induced skin cancers in mice, despite the fact that mice convert tryptophan to NAD more efficiently than rats and humans and thus do not get severely deficient [(60)](#reference60). Hyper- [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and impaired [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) of skin cells can alter the integrity of the skin barrier and increase the occurrence of pre- [malignant](../glossary#malignant) and malignant skin conditions. A protective effect of niacin was suggested by [topical](../glossary#topical) application of myristyl nicotinate, a niacin derivative, which successfully increased the expression of [epidermal](../glossary#epidermis) [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) markers in subjects with [photodamaged](../glossary#photodamage) skin [(61)](#reference61). The activation of the nicotinic and GPR109B, by [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of niacin could be involved in improving skin barrier function. Conversely, differentiation defects in skin cancer cells were linked to the abnormal cellular localization of defective nicotinic acid receptors [(62)](#reference62). Nicotinamide restriction with subsequent depletion of cellular NAD was shown to increase [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress)-induced DNA damage in a precancerous skin cell model, implying a protective role of NAD-dependent pathways in cancer [(63)](#reference63). Altered NAD availability also affects sirtuin expression and activity in UV-exposed human skin cells. Along with PARPs, NAD-consuming sirtuins could play an important role in the cellular response to photodamage and skin [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) [(64)](#reference64). A pooled analysis of two large US [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 41,808 men and 72,308 women for up to 26 years suggested that higher versus lower intake of niacin (from diet and supplements) might be protective against squamous-cell carcinoma but not against basal-cell [phase III](../glossary#phase-III-clinical-trial), [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), trial in 386 subjects with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer recently examined the effect of daily nicotinamide supplementation (1 g) for 12 months on skin cancer recurrence at three-month intervals over an 18-month period [(66)](#reference66). Nicotinamide carcinoma (-30%), and basal-cell carcinoma (-20%) compared to placebo after 12 months, yet this protection was not sustained during the six-month post-supplementation period [(66)](#reference66). Larger trials are needed to assess whether nicotinamide could reduce the risk of melanomas, which are not as common as other skin cancer but are more deadly [(67)](#reference67). Type 1 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) in children is caused by the [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) destruction of [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-secreting -cells in the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas). Prior to the onset of symptomatic diabetes, specific [antibodies](../glossary#antibody), including islet cell autoantibodies (ICA), can be detected in the blood of high-risk individuals [(68)](#reference68). In an experimental animal model of diabetes, high levels of nicotinamide are administered to protect -cells from damage caused by streptozotocin [(69)](#reference69). Yet, [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of nicotinamide (up to 3 g/day) have not been found to be effective in delaying or preventing the onset of type 1 diabetes in at-risk subjects. An analysis of 10 trials, of which five were [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, found evidence of improved -cell function after one year of treatment with nicotinamide, but the analysis failed to find any clinical evidence of improved glycemic control [(70)](#reference70). A large, multicenter [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of nicotinamide in ICA-positive siblings (ages, 3-12 years) of type 1 diabetic patients also failed to find a difference in the incidence of type 1 diabetes after three years [(70)](#reference70). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled multicenter trial of 3 g/day) was conducted in 552 ICA-positive relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes. The proportion of relatives who developed type 1 diabetes within five years was comparable whether they were treated with nicotinamide or placebo [(71)](#reference71). Nicotinamide could reduce [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation)-related parameters in these high-risk subjects yet was ineffective to prevent disease onset [(72)](#reference72). More recently, [case reports](../glossary#case-report) of the combined use of nicotinamide (25 mg/kg/day) and acetyl-L- [carnitine](../dietary-factors/L-carnitine) (50 mg/kg/day) in children at risk for type 1 diabetes showed promising results, warranting further investigation [(73)](#reference73). Niacin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) at [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) (i.e., doses much larger than those needed to prevent deficiency) have been used in an attempt to treat a range of conditions, some of which are discussed below. Congenital NAD deficiency-related disorders can result from [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in the uptake and transport of the various dietary NAD+ [precursors](../glossary#precursor) or in the distinct metabolic pathways leading to NAD+ production (see [Metabolism](#metabolism)). Some of these disorders might respond to niacin supplementation. For example, defective transport of tryptophan into cells results in [Hartnup disease](../glossary#hartnup-disease), which features signs of severe niacin deficiency [(74)](#reference74). Hartnup disease is due to mutations in the SLCA19 gene, which codes for a sodium-dependent neutral [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) transporter expressed primarily in the kidneys and intestine. Disease management involves supplementation with nicotinic acid or nicotinamide [(75)](#reference75). [Recessive mutations](../glossary#recessive-trait) in genes coding for [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) kynurenine pathway \u2014 namely kynureninase and 3-hydroxyanthranilic-acid \u2014 lead to combined Depletion of NAD+, rather than accumulation of intermediate [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) in the kynurenine pathway, was found to be responsible for these malformations. Niacin supplementation throughout pregnancy ensured adequate levels of NAD+ and prevented [congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly) in mice with kynurenine pathway mutations [(76)](#reference76). In humans, the dose of NAD+ precursors necessary to avert NAD deficiency-induced congenital VACTERL malformations has yet to be defined [(77)](#reference77). Nicotinamide may also rescue NAD+ depletion secondary to an ultra-rare inborn error of glutamine metabolism [(78)](#reference78). Glutamine is required for the conversion dinucleotide to NAD+ 2). Thus, inherited glutamine synthetase deficiency specifically affects the synthesis of NAD+ from the NAD+ precursors, tryptophan and nicotinic acid. If the combined deficiencies of glutamine and NAD+ are responsible for the severe clinical phenotype of subjects with inherited glutamine synthetase deficiency, it is likely that supplementation with both glutamine and nicotinamide would provide some relief [(78)](#reference78). Finally, many inborn errors of metabolism result from genetic mutations decreasing [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) binding affinity and, subsequently, enzyme efficiency [(79)](#reference79). In many cases, the administration of high doses of the [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin) serving as precursors of cofactors can restore enzymatic activity \u2014 at least partially \u2014 and lessen signs of the genetic diseases [(79)](#reference79). Given the large number of enzymes requiring NAD, it is speculated that many of the conditions due to defective enzymes might be rescued by niacin supplementation [(5)](#reference5). Nicotinic acid is dense low-density lipoprotein ( [LDL](../glossary#LDL)) particles to large, buoyant LDL particles. All of these changes in the blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile are considered cardioprotective. Low concentrations of HDL-cholesterol are one major [risk](../glossary#risk) factor for [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD), and an increase in HDL concentrations is associated with a reduction of that risk [(80)](#reference80). Because of the adverse side effects associated with high doses of nicotinic acid (see [Safety](#safety)), nicotinic acid has most often been used in combination with other lipid-lowering medications at slightly lower doses [(17)](#reference17). In particular, low-dose nicotinic acid is often co-administered with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), the cornerstone of treatment of [hyperlipidemia](../glossary#hyperlipidemia), a major risk factor for CHD. A [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 39 patients taking statins (cerivastatin, atorvastatin, or simvastatin) found that a very low dose of nicotinic acid (100 mg/day) increased HDL-cholesterol by only 2.1 mg/dL, and the combination had no effect on LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, or [triglyceride](../glossary#triglyceride) concentrations [(81)](#reference81). The Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol (ARBITER) 2 study \u2014 a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial \u2014 investigated the incremental effect of adding nicotinic acid (1 g/day) to statin therapy in 167 patients with known CHD and low HDL concentrations on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) [(82)](#reference82), a surrogate endpoint for the development of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis). The addition of extended-release nicotinic acid to simvastatin prevented the increase in CIMT compared to simvastatin [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy). A post-hoc analysis of data from ARBITER2 showed that the blockade of atherosclerotic progression was related to the increase in HDL concentrations in patients with normal glycemic status. However, in the presence of additional risk factors, such as impaired fasting [glucose](../glossary#glucose) or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), the increase in HDL concentrations was not predictive of CIMT reduction and atherosclerotic retardation [(83)](#reference83). A comparative efficacy trial (ARBITER6) also showed a significant reduction of baseline CIMT with extended-release nicotinic acid (2 g/day for 14 months), as opposed to ezetimibe (a cholesterol-lowering drug), in patients taking statins [(84)](#reference84). Additional studies have examined the impact of nicotinic acid on endothelium-dependent brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients at risk of CHD or with established CHD. The measurement of FMD is often used as a surrogate marker of endothelial function; FMD values are [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the risk of future cardiovascular events [(85)](#reference85). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including 441 participants, showed a significant, 2% increase with nicotinic acid (1-2 g/day) administered for 12 weeks to one year [(86)](#reference86). Several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, multicenter trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of nicotinic acid therapy, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents, on outcomes of [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD). Specifically, the Coronary Drug Project (CDP) followed over 8,000 men with a previous [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) for six years [(87)](#reference87). Compared to the placebo group, patients who took 3 g of immediate-release nicotinic acid daily experienced an average 10% reduction in total blood cholesterol, a 26% decrease in [triglycerides](../glossary#triglyceride), a 27% reduction in recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction, and a 10% reduction in total deaths with nicotinic acid treatment. The HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS), a three-year [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 160 patients with documented CHD and low HDL concentrations, found that a combination of simvastatin and nicotinic acid (2-3 g/day) increased HDL concentrations, inhibited the progression of coronary artery [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing), and decreased the frequency of [cardiovascular ](../glossary#cardiovascular)events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, compared to placebo [(88)](#reference88). A subgroup analysis of the HATS patients with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) showed a reduction in rate of primary clinical events even though [glucose](../glossary#glucose) and [insulin](../glossary#insulin) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) were moderately impaired by nicotinic acid [(89)](#reference89). Moreover, a review of nicotinic acid safety and tolerability among the HATS subjects showed glycemic control in diabetic patients returned to pretreatment values following eight months of disease management with medication and diet [(90)](#reference90). Similarly, the cardiovascular benefit of long-term nicotinic acid therapy outweighed the modest increase in risk of newly onset type 2 diabetes in patients from the CDP study [(91)](#reference91). In contrast, the AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis intervention in metabolic syndrome with low HDL/high triglycerides: impact on global health outcomes) trial, which examined the incremental effect of extended-release nicotinic acid (1.5-2 g/day) on 3,414 patients who had [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia) and were treated with simvastatin (+/- ezetimibe), provided disappointing results. Indeed, in these patients who had achieved target concentrations of LDL-cholesterol (<70 mg/dL) before randomization, the HDL-raising effect of nicotinic acid treatment failed to reduce the number of cardiovascular events after a mean follow-up of three years [(92, 93)](#reference92). While some limitations, like a greater use of simvastatin and ezetimibe in the control group, may have [confounded](../glossary#confounder) the results, it was also suggested that low HDL-cholesterol might be a marker of risk rather than a causal risk factor for predicting CVD [(93)](#reference93). In addition, a post-hoc analysis of 505 participants with stage 3 chronic kidney disease found an increase in all-cause mortality in those randomized to nicotinic acid compared to those in the placebo group [(94)](#reference94). Although nicotinic acid failed to reduce the number of cardiovascular events in simvastatin-treated patients with low LDL-cholesterol, these results cannot be extrapolated to patients with higher LDL-cholesterol at baseline. A much larger multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial \u2014 the HPS2-THRIVE (Heart protection study 2: treatment of HDL to reduce the incidence of vascular events) trial \u2014 in 25,673 participants with vascular disease examined the incremental effect of extended-release nicotinic acid (2 g/day) and laropiprant (a prostaglandin D2 receptor-1 antagonist; 40 mg/day) on the incidence of vascular events. Compared to placebo, nicotinic acid/laropiprant reduced LDL-cholesterol by an average of 10 mg/dL, decreased triglycerides by 33 mg/dL, and increased HDL-cholesterol by 6 mg/dL after a median 3.9-year follow-up period. Nonetheless, nicotinic acid/laropiprant showed no effect on the incidence of major vascular events and death of any cause [(95)](#reference95). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 23 randomized controlled trials \u2014 including the CDP, AIM-HIGH, and HPS2-THRIVE trials \u2014 in 39,195 subjects with a history of vascular disease compared the effect of nicotinic acid alone or as an add-on to other lipid-lowering agents. No cardiovascular benefits were associated with nicotinic acid therapy: the number of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions and strokes was not decreased with nicotinic acid supplementation (median dose of 2 g/day for a median period of 11.5 months) [(96)](#reference96). Despite the lack of evidence for a role of nicotinic acid in CVD prevention [(96, 97)](#reference96), the use of nicotinic acid therapy has rapidly increased over the years in the US [(98)](#reference98). Friedreich's ataxia, a common form of inherited [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), is an early onset [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) disorder with clinical features that includes progressive ataxia, scoliosis, dysarthria, [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy), guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) expansions in the first intron of the [gene](../glossary#gene) FXN coding for the [protein](../glossary#protein) frataxin. These abnormal and unstable GAA repeats trigger gene silencing through heterochromatin formation, leading to significantly reduced frataxin expression [(100)](#reference100). Frataxin is a [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) protein needed for the making of iron-sulfur clusters (ISC). ISC-containing subunits are especially important for the mitochondrial [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) and for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [heme](../glossary#heme)-containing proteins localized in the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus), SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase that promotes gene silencing through heterochromatin formation. Nicotinamide has been shown to [antagonize](../glossary#antagonist) heterochromatization FXN locus and lymphoblastoid cells derived Friedreich's ataxia-affected patients, possibly through inhibiting SIRT1 activity [(100)](#reference100). In an open-label, dose escalating [pilot trial](../glossary#pilot-study) in 10 adult patients with Friedreich's ataxia, single and repeated doses of nicotinamide (2-8 g) for up to eight weeks were found to be well tolerated [(101)](#reference101). Repeated daily doses of 3.5 to 6 g of nicotinamide led to significant increases in frataxin concentration in peripheral white blood cells [(101)](#reference101). Yet, no [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) improvements were reported, suggesting that the duration of the treatment was too short and/or the nervous system of the participants was unresponsive to increases in frataxin [(102)](#reference102). To our knowledge, there is currently no ongoing trial designed to further investigate the effect of nicotinamide in Friedreich's ataxia-affected patients. The first step in the pathway is [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyst) by the extrahepatic [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase which is responsible for the cleavage of tryptophan. The chronic stimulation of tryptophan oxidation, mediated by an increased activity of IDO and/or inadequate dietary niacin intakes, is observed with the infection of human immunodeficiency virus ( [HIV](../glossary#HIV)), the virus that causes ( [AIDS](../glossary#AIDS)). Interferon-gamma (IFN-) is a [cytokine](../glossary#cytokine) produced by cells of the immune system in response to infection. Through stimulating the enzyme IDO, IFN- increases the breakdown of tryptophan, thus supporting the finding that the average tryptophan concentration in blood is significantly lower in HIV patients compared to uninfected subjects [(40)](#reference40). An increased degradation of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway appears to coexist with intracellular niacin/NAD deficiency in HIV infection [(103)](#reference103). An explanatory model for these paradoxical observations incriminates the [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) induced by multiple nutrient deficiencies in HIV patients [(103)](#reference103). In particular, the activation of PARP enzymes (ARTDs) by [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to [DNA](../glossary#DNA) could be responsible for inducing niacin/NAD depletion (see [Function](#function)). The breakdown of tryptophan would then be a compensatory response to inadequate niacin/NAD levels. However, [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite) derived from the oxidation of tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway regulate specific T- [lymphocyte](../glossary#lymphocyte) subgroups. As mentioned above, circulating IFN-, but also [viral](../glossary#virus) and [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) products, can activate IDO during HIV infection. The overstimulation of the tryptophan pathway has been involved in the loss of normal T-lymphocyte function, which characterizes HIV infection [(104, 105)](#reference104). The increased IDO activity has been linked to the altered immune response that contributes to the persistence of HIV [(104)](#reference104). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) only partially restores normal IDO activity, without normalizing it, yet induces viral suppression and CD4 T-cell recovery [(106)](#reference106). In a monkey model for HIV infection, a partial and transient blockade of IDO with IDO inhibitor 1-methyl tryptophan proved ineffective to reduce the viral load in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and intestinal tissues beyond the level achieved by ART [(107)](#reference107). At present, a better understanding of the role of kynurenine pathway and other NAD biosynthetic pathways during HIV infection is needed before the relevance and clinical implications of niacin supplementation in HIV treatment could be considered. Nonetheless, [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of nicotinic acid have been shown to be well tolerated in HIV patients with [hyperlipidemia](../glossary#hyperlipidemia) [(108)](#reference108). Abnormal [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profiles observed in patients have been attributed to the HIV infection and to the highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) [(109)](#reference109). Moreover, [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) has been ART-treated patients [(110)](#reference110). [Cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) is the second most frequent cause of deaths in the HIV population, and the rate of CVD is predicted to increase further as patients are living longer due to successful antiretroviral therapies. As for the general population, statin-based therapy appears to benefit HIV patients in terms of [atherogenic](../glossary#atherogenic) protection and CVD risk reduction, although contraindications exist due to drug interactions with ART. Other first-line treatments include lipid-lowering fibrates, which are preferred to nicotinic acid due to the increased risk of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance [(111)](#reference111). Nevertheless, an unblinded, controlled [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) showed that extended-release nicotinic acid (0.5-1.5 g/day for 12 weeks) could effectively improve endothelial function of the brachial artery in ART-treated HIV subjects with low [HDL](../glossary#HDL)- [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and no history of CVD [(112)](#reference112). In addition, combined treatment of fibrates, extended-release nicotinic acid (0.5-2 g/day), and lifestyle changes (low-fat diet and exercise) for 24 weeks was effective in normalizing lipid parameters in a cohort of 191 ART-treated patients. Increased risk of liver dysfunction was detected in subjects receiving both fibrates and niacin, but [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) was not affected by nicotinic acid treatment given alone or when combined with fibrates [(113)](#reference113). Another 24-week, [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), uncontrolled trial in 99 to extended-release nicotinic acid (0.5-2 g/day) or fenofibrates increased blood HDL-cholesterol but did not reduce inflammatory markers or improve endothelial function when compared to baseline [(114)](#reference114). [Schizophrenia](../glossary#schizophrenia) is a [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disorder with unclear [etiology](../glossary#etiology) that is diagnosed purely from its clinical presentation. Because neurologic disorders associated with pellagra resemble acute schizophrenia, niacin-based therapy for the condition was investigated during the 1950s-70s (reviewed in [115](#reference115)). The [adjunctive](../glossary#adjunct-therapy) use of nutrients like niacin to correct deficiencies associated with neurologic symptoms is called orthomolecular psychiatry [(116)](#reference116). Such an approach has not been included in psychiatric practice; practitioners have instead relied solely on antipsychotic drugs to eliminate the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, recent scientific advances and new [hypotheses](../glossary#hypothesis) on the benefit of nutrient supplementation in the treatment of psychiatric disorders have suggested the re-assessment of orthomolecular medicine by the medical community [(117, 118)](#reference117). Skin flushing is one major side effect of the therapeutic use of nicotinic acid and the primary reason for non-adherence to treatment (see [Toxicity](#toxicity)). Flushing is caused by the activation of phospholipase A2, an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that stimulates the production of a specific [lipid](../glossary#lipid) from the prostanoid family called [prostaglandin](../glossary#prostaglandin) D2. Prostaglandin D2, [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by [antigen](../glossary#antigen)-presenting cells of the skin and mucosa (i.e., the Langerhans cells), can induce the dilation of blood vessels and trigger a flushing response. Interestingly, patients with schizophrenia tend not to flush following treatment with nicotinic acid. This blunted skin flushing response suggests abnormal prostanoid signaling in schizophrenic patients [(119, 120)](#reference119). An association has been found between the altered niacin sensitivity and greater functional impairment in schizophrenic subjects [(121)](#reference121), which supports other findings suggesting that altered lipid [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) could critically impair brain development and contribute to the disease [(122)](#reference122). Interestingly, blunted skin flushing responses are more [prevalent](../glossary#prevalent) in first-degree relatives of people with schizophrenia than in the general population, suggesting that reduced niacin sensitivity is a heritable trait within affected families [(123)](#reference123). Good sources of niacin include yeast, meat, poultry, red fish (e.g., tuna, salmon), cereal (especially [fortified](../glossary#fortification) cereal), [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), and seeds. Milk, green leafy vegetables, [coffee](../food-beverages/coffee), and [tea](../food-beverages/tea) also provide some niacin [(124)](#reference124). In plants, especially mature cereal grains like corn and wheat, niacin may be bound to sugar molecules in the form of [glycosides](../glossary#glycoside), which significantly decrease its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) [(25)](#reference25). In the United States, the average dietary intake of niacin is about 30 mg/day for young adult men and 20 mg/day for young adult women. In a sample of adults over the age of 60, men and women were found to have an average dietary intake of 21 mg/day and 17 mg/day, respectively [(41)](#reference41). Some foods with substantial amounts of niacin are listed in Table 2, along with their niacin content in milligrams (mg). Food composition tables generally list niacin content without including niacin equivalents (NE) from tryptophan or any adjustment for niacin bioavailability. For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search [USDA's FoodData Central database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/); data included in Table 2 are from this database [(125)](#reference125). |Food||Serving||Niacin (mg)| |Chicken (light meat, cooked canned, packed in the size of a deck of cards.| Niacin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are available as nicotinamide or nicotinic acid. Nicotinamide is the form of niacin typically used in nutritional supplements and in food [fortification](../glossary#fortification). Nicotinic acid is available over the counter and with a prescription as a [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering agent [(126)](#reference126). Nicotinic acid for anti- three formulations: immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid (absorption time, 1-2 hrs), acid (absorption time, 8-12 hrs), and sustained-release nicotinic (absorption time, >12 hrs) [(127)](#reference127). At the [pharmacologic dose](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) required for cholesterol-lowering effects, the use of nicotinic acid should be approached as if it were a drug (see [Safety](#safety)). Individuals should only undertake cholesterol-lowering therapy with nicotinic acid under the supervision of a qualified health care provider in order to minimize potentially adverse effects and maximize therapeutic benefits. Common side effects of nicotinic acid include flushing, [pruritus](../glossary#pruritus) (severe itching of the skin), skin rashes, and [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) disturbances, such as nausea and vomiting [(97)](#reference97). Transient episodes of low blood pressure (hypotension) and headache have also been reported. Hepatotoxicity (liver cell damage), including elevated liver [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) and [jaundice](../glossary#jaundice), has been observed at intakes as low as 750 mg/day of nicotinic acid [(128)](#reference128). Although [hepatitis](../glossary#hepatitis) has been observed with extended-release nicotinic acid at dosages as little as 500 mg/day for two months, almost all reports of severe hepatitis have been associated with doses of 3 to 9 g/day used to treat high [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) for months or years [(41)](#reference41). It is unclear whether immediate-release (crystalline) nicotinic acid is less toxic to the liver than extended-release forms [(41)](#reference41). Yet, immediate-release nicotinic acid is often used at higher doses than extended-release forms, and severe liver toxicity has occurred in individuals who substituted extended-release nicotinic acid for immediate-release nicotinic acid at equivalent doses [(126)](#reference126). Large doses of nicotinic acid have been observed to [impair glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance), likely because of a decrease in [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive). Impaired glucose tolerance in susceptible (pre-diabetic) individuals could result in elevated blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) concentrations and clinical type 2 diabetes mellitus. An analysis of the HPS2-THRIVE trial (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-treatment)), using data from 17,374 participants without type 2 diabetes at baseline, found a significantly higher proportion of newly diagnosed cases among those [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to nicotinic acid/laropiprant than to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) to nicotinic acid/laropiprant significantly increased the [risk](../glossary#risk) of serious disturbances in diabetes control (leading to hospitalization) compared to placebo among 8,299 participants with diabetes at baseline [(95)](#reference95). Elevated blood concentrations of [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid), occasionally resulting in attacks of [gout](../glossary#gout) in susceptible individuals, have also been observed with high-dose nicotinic acid therapy [(126)](#reference126). Niacin at doses of 1.5 to 5 g/day has resulted in a few [case reports](../glossary#case-report) of blurred vision and other eye problems, which have generally been reversible upon discontinuation [(41)](#reference41). People with abnormal liver function or a history of liver disease, diabetes, active [peptic ulcer disease](../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease), gout, cardiac [arrhythmias](../health-disease/arrhythmia), [inflammatory bowel disease](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease), [migraine headaches](../glossary#migraine-headache), or alcoholism may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of excess niacin intake than the general population [(41)](#reference41). Nicotinamide is generally better tolerated than nicotinic acid; it does not generally cause flushing [(126)](#reference126). However, nausea, vomiting, and signs of liver toxicity (elevated liver [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), [jaundice](../glossary#jaundice)) have been observed at very high doses (10 g/day) [(126)](#reference126). A study in 12 healthy subjects found that nicotinamide riboside at three single doses (100 mg, 300 mg, and 1,000 mg) safely increased blood NAD+. Two of the participants self-reported skin flushing after taking the 300-mg dose, and two others reported feeling hot following intake of 1,000 mg of nicotinamide riboside [(1)](#references). In a recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 120 healthy adults (ages, 60-80 years), daily supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (250 mg or 500 mg) and pterostilbene (a SIRT activator; 50 mg or 100 mg) for eight weeks showed a favorable side effect profile, with no evidence of higher incidence of adverse effects compared to placebo [(129)](#reference129). Most recently, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 40 obese men (ages, 40-70 years) found that daily supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (2,000 mg/day divided into two daily dosages) for 12 weeks was associated with reports of only minor side effects, including excessive sweating, [pruritus](../glossary#pruritus), and mild [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) symptoms like bloating [(139)](#reference139). Flushing of the skin primarily on the face, arms, and chest is a common side effect of nicotinic acid and may occur initially at doses as low as 30 mg/day. Although flushing from nicotinamide is rare, the Food and Nutrition Board set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for niacin (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) at 35 mg/day in adults to avoid the adverse effect of flushing [(41)](#reference41). Analysis of data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006 found that 15.8% of children and adolescents (ages 2-18 years) and 8.5% of adults (19 years) had total usual niacin intakes exceeding the UL [(130)](#reference130). The UL applies to the general population and is not meant to apply to individuals who are being treated with a nutrient under medical supervision (e.g., high-dose nicotinic acid for cholesterol of intake should be from food and formula only.| The occurrence of rhabdomyolysis is increased in patients treated with statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively uncommon condition in which muscle cells are broken down, releasing [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) and [electrolytes](../glossary#electrolyte) into the blood, and sometimes resulting in kidney failure [(131)](#reference131). Co-administration of nicotinic acid with a statin seems to enhance the [risk](../glossary#risk) of rhabdomyolosis [(132)](#reference132). A new drug, laropiprant, blocks nicotinic acid-induced flushing [(133)](#reference133). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial was designed to identify possible adverse effects of the niacin/laropiprant combination in over 25,000 simvastatin-treated subjects [(134)](#reference134). When added to the statin therapy, niacin/laropiprant increased the risk of [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy) and rhabdomyolosis, particularly in Asian subjects. It is possible that the niacin/laropiprant combination further reduces the poor tolerability to statin treatment observed in certain populations [(135)](#reference135). In the three-year, randomized controlled HATS study, concurrent therapy with [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) (1,000 mg/day of vitamin C, 800 IU/day of RRR--tocopherol, 100 \u00b5g/day of selenium, and 25 mg/day of -carotene) diminished the protective effects of the simvastatin-nicotinic acid combination [(136)](#reference136). Although the mechanism for these effects is not known, the benefit of concurrent antioxidant therapy in patients on lipid-lowering agents has been questioned [(137)](#reference137). Adverse effects of large doses of nicotinic acid may be exacerbated by the concomitant use of certain medications. The risk of [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy) may be further increased in those taking nicotinic acid and [bile acid](../glossary#bile-acids) and the risk of hepatotoxicity observed with nicotinic acid might be enhanced by drugs like paracetamol, amiodarone (Cordarone), or carbamazepine (Tegretol) [(35)](#reference35). In nicotinic acid may reduce [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid) [excretion](../glossary#excretion), thereby opposing the action of uricosuric agents like probenecid (Probalan) [(35)](#reference35). Several other medications may interact with niacin therapy or with absorption and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) [(126)](#reference126). [Estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives increase the efficiency of niacin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) from tryptophan, resulting in a decreased dietary requirement for niacin [(138)](#reference138). Long-term administration of [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) agents has been reported to cause symptoms of pellagra; therefore, niacin supplementation may be needed (see [Pellagra causes](#pellagra)). The optimum intake of niacin for health promotion and [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) prevention is not yet known. The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (16 mg NE/day for men and 14 mg NE/day for women) is easily obtainable by consuming a varied diet and should prevent deficiency in most people. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, containing 100% of the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for niacin, will provide at least 20 mg of niacin daily.

Pantothenic acid is found throughout all branches of life in the form of [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) A, a vital coenzyme in numerous chemical reactions [(2)](#reference2). Pantothenic acid is a [precursor](../glossary#precursor) in the [biosynthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of coenzyme A (CoA) (Figure 1), an essential coenzyme in a variety of biochemical reactions that sustain life (see below). Pantothenic acid kinase II (PANKII) catalyzes the initial step of [phosphorylation](../glossary#phosphorylation) of pantothenic acid to 4'-phosphopantothenic acid. Coenzyme A and its derivatives inhibit the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of 4'-phosphopantothenic acid, but the inhibition can be reversed by [carnitine](../glossary#carnitine), required for the transport of [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) into the [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria) [(3)](#reference3). The subsequent reactions in this biosynthetic pathway include the synthesis of the intermediate 4'-phosphopantetheine, as well as the recycling of coenzyme A to 4'-phosphopantetheine (Figure 1). The 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety of coenzyme A can be transferred to [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) in which 4'-phosphopantetheine is an essential [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for their biological activities (see [4'-phosphopantetheinylation](#phosphopantetheinylation)). Coenzyme A reacts with acyl groups, giving rise acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA. Coenzyme A and its acyl derivatives are required for reactions that generate energy from the degradation of dietary fat, [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), and [proteins](../glossary#protein). In addition, coenzyme A in the form of acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is involved in the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle), in the synthesis of essential fats, [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol), [steroid](../glossary#steroid) [hormones](../glossary#hormone), vitamins A and D, the [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter) in the [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) - [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) pathway. Coenzyme A derivatives are also required for the synthesis of the hormone, melatonin, and for a component of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) called [heme](../glossary#heme). Further, [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of a number of drugs and toxins by the liver requires coenzyme A [(4)](#reference4). Coenzyme A was named for its role in [acetylation](../glossary#acetylation) reactions. Most acetylated proteins in the body have been modified by the addition of an acetate group that was donated by the coenzyme A thioester derivative, acetyl-CoA. Protein acetylation alters the overall charge of proteins, modifying their three-dimensional structure and, potentially, their function. For example, acetylation is a mechanism that regulates the activity of [peptide hormones](../glossary#peptide-hormone), including those produced by the [pituitary gland](../glossary#pituitary-gland) [(5)](#reference5). Also, protein acetylation, like other posttranslational modifications, has been shown to regulate the subcellular localization, the function, and the half-life of many [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) molecules, [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor), and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). Notably, the acetylation of [histones](../glossary#histone) plays a role in the regulation of [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) by facilitating [transcription](../glossary#translation) (i.e., [mRNA](../glossary#mRNA) synthesis), while deacetylated histones are usually associated with [chromatin](../glossary#chromatin) compaction and [gene](../glossary#gene) silencing. The acetylation of histones was found to result in structural changes of the chromatin, which affect both [DNA](../glossary#DNA)-protein and protein-protein interactions. Crosstalk between acetylation marks and other posttranscriptional modifications of the histones also facilitate the recruitment of transcriptional regulators to the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of genes that are subsequently transcribed (reviewed in [6](#reference6)). Finally, a number of signaling molecules are modified by the attachment of long-chain fatty acids donated by coenzyme A. These modifications are known as protein acylation and have central roles in [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways [(4)](#reference4). Specific multi- [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) complexes, which need to carry out several reactions in an orderly manner, may require the [covalent](../glossary#covalent-bond) attachment of a 4'-phosphopantetheine arm to a \"carrier\" domain (or [protein](../glossary#protein)). This carrier domain holds substrates or reaction intermediates during the progression through the various enzymatic reactions. In mammals, the transfer of the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety from coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue of a specific carrier domain is [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyze) by one unique phosphopantetheinyl transferase [(7)](#reference7). The 4'-phosphopantetheinylation is necessary for the conversion of apo-enzymes into fully active holo-enzymes (see below). [Lipids](../glossary#lipid) are fat molecules essential for normal physiological function and, among other types, include sphingolipids (essential components of the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath that enhances nerve transmission), [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) (important structural components of [cell membranes)](../glossary#cell-membrane), and that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of fatty acids. Within the FAS complex, the acyl-carrier protein (ACP) requires pantothenic acid in the form of 4'-phosphopantetheine for its activity as a carrier protein [(3)](#reference3). A group, such as the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety for ACP, is called a prosthetic group; the prosthetic group is not composed of [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) and is a tightly bound [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) required for the biological activity of some [proteins](../glossary#protein) (Figure 2). Acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and ACP are all required for the synthesis of fatty acids in the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol). During fatty acid synthesis, the acyl groups of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are transferred to the sulfhydryl group (-SH) of the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl moiety of ACP. The prosthetic group is used as a flexible arm to transfer the growing fatty acid chain to each of the enzymatic centers of the type I FAS complex. In the [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria), 4'-phosphopantetheine also serves as a prosthetic group for an ACP homolog present in mitochondrial type II FAS complex [(8)](#reference8). the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [nucleic acids](../glossary#nucleic-acid) and [amino acids](../glossary#amino-acid) (Figure 3). Similar to ACP, FDH requires a 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group for its biological activity. The prosthetic group acts as a swinging arm to couple the activities of the two catalytic domains of FDH [(9, 10)](#reference9). A homolog of FDH to be biologically active [(11)](#reference11). 4'-phosphopantetheinylation is required for -aminoadipate semialdehyde synthase (AASS). AASS [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the initial the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) pathway for the degradation of lysine \u2014 an essential [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) for humans. AASS is made of two catalytic domains. The lysine-ketoglutarate reductase domain first catalyzes the conversion of lysine to saccharopine. Saccharopine is further converted to -aminoadipate semialdehyde in a reaction catalyzed by the saccharopine dehydrogenase domain (Figure 4). Naturally occurring pantothenic acid deficiency in humans is very rare and has been observed only in cases of severe malnutrition. World War II prisoners in the Philippines, Burma, and Japan experienced numbness and painful burning and tingling in their feet; these symptoms were relieved specifically by pantothenic acid supplementation [(4)](#reference4). Pantothenic acid deficiency in humans has been induced experimentally by co-administering a pantothenic acid kinase and a pantothenic acid-deficient diet. Participants in this experiment complained of headache, fatigue, insomnia, intestinal disturbances, and numbness and tingling of their hands and feet [(12)](#reference12). In another study, participants fed only a pantothenic acid-free diet did not develop clinical signs of deficiency, although some appeared listless and complained of fatigue [(13)](#reference13). Calcium homopantothenate (or hopantenate) is a pantothenic acid [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) with [cholinergic](../glossary#cholinergic) effects (i.e., similar to those of the [neurotransmitter](../glossary#neurotransmitter), acetylcholine). This compound is used in Japan to enhance mental function, especially in [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease). A rare side effect was the development of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition of abnormal brain function resulting from the failure of the liver to eliminate toxins. The encephalopathy was reversed by pantothenic acid supplementation, suggesting that it was due to homopantothenate-induced pantothenic acid deficiency [(14)](#reference14). Of note, genetic [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the human [gene](../glossary#gene) PANKII, which codes for pantothenic acid kinase II (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above), result in impaired [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of 4'-phosphopantetheine and A (see [Function](#function)). The disorder, called pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, is characterized by visual and intellectual impairments, dystonia, speech abnormalities, behavioral difficulties, and personality disorders [(15)](#reference15). Yet, because pantothenic acid is widely distributed in nature and deficiency is extremely rare in humans, most information regarding the consequences of deficiency has been gathered from experimental research in animals (reviewed in [3](#reference3)). Pantothenic acid-deficient rats developed damage to the [adrenal glands](../glossary#adrenal-glands), while monkeys developed [anemia](../glossary#anemia) due to decreased synthesis of [heme](../glossary#heme), a component of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin). Dogs with pantothenic acid deficiency developed low blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose), rapid breathing and heart rates, and convulsions. Chickens developed skin irritation, feather abnormalities, and spinal nerve damage associated with the degeneration of the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath. Pantothenic acid-deficient mice showed decreased exercise tolerance and diminished storage of glucose (in the form of [glycogen](../glossary#glycogen)) in muscle and liver. Mice also developed skin irritation and graying of the fur, which is reversed by pantothenic acid administration. The diversity of symptoms emphasizes the numerous functions of pantothenic acid in its [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) forms. Because there was little information on the requirements of pantothenic acid in humans, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine set an adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) based on observed dietary intakes in healthy of calcium D-pantothenate and/or pantothenol (Figure 5) to the medium of cultured skin [fibroblasts](../glossary#fibroblast) given an artificial wound was found to increase cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and migration, thus accelerating wound healing [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [(17, 18)](#reference17). Likewise, in vitro deficiency in pantothenic acid induced the expression of [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) markers in proliferating skin fibroblasts and inhibited proliferation in human [keratinocytes](../glossary#keratinocyte) [(19)](#reference19). The application of ointments containing either calcium D-pantothenate or pantothenol \u2014 also known as D-panthenol or dexpanthenol \u2014 to the skin has been shown to accelerate the closure of skin wounds and increase the strength of scar tissue in animals [(3)](#reference3). The effects of dexpanthenol on wound healing are unclear. In a [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study that included 12 healthy volunteers, the application of dexpanthenol-containing ointment (every 12 hours for 1 to 6 days) in a model of skin wound healing was associated with an enhanced expression of markers of proliferation, [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), and tissue repair [(20)](#reference20). However, the study failed to report whether these changes in response to [topical](../glossary#topical) dexpanthenol improved the wound-repair process compared to placebo [(20)](#reference20). Some studies have shown no effects. Early [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in patients undergoing surgery for tattoo removal found that daily co-supplementation with 1 gram or 3 grams of vitamin C and 200 mg or 900 mg of pantothenic acid for 21 days did not significantly improve the wound-healing process [(21, 22)](#reference21). Yet, in a recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), study, the use of dexpanthenol pastilles (300 mg/day for up to 14 days post surgery) was found to accelerate mucosal healing after tonsillectomy in children [(23)](#reference23). Early studies suggested that [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of pantethine, a pantothenic acid derivative, might have a [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering effect [(24, 25)](#reference24). Pantethine is made of two molecules of pantetheine joined by a disulfide bond (chemical bond between two molecules of sulfur) (Figure 5). Pantethine is structurally related to coenzyme A and is found in the prosthetic group that is required for the biological function of acyl-carrier protein, formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, pantethine (600 mg/day for 8 weeks, followed by 900 mg/day for another 8 weeks) significantly improved the profile of [lipid](../glossary#lipid) parameters in 120 individuals at low-to-moderate risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD). After adjusting to baseline, pantethine was found to be significantly more effective than placebo in lowering the concentrations of [low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol](../glossary#LDL) (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB), as well ratio of [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides) to [high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol](../glossary#HDL) (TG:HDL-C) [(26)](#reference26). Although it appears to be well tolerated and potentially beneficial in improving cholesterol [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), pantethine is not a [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin), and the decision to use pharmacologic doses of pantethine to treat elevated blood cholesterol or triglycerides should only be made in collaboration with a qualified health care provider who provides appropriate follow up. Mice that are deficient in pantothenic acid developed skin irritation and graying of the fur, which is reversed by pantothenic acid administration. In humans, there is no evidence that taking pantothenic acid as [supplements](../glossary#supplement) or using shampoos containing pantothenic acid can prevent or restore hair color. Pantothenic acid is available in a variety of foods, usually as a component of coenzyme A (CoA) and 4'-phosphopantetheine (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above). Upon ingestion, dietary coenzyme A and phosphopantetheine are [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) to pantothenic acid prior to intestinal absorption [(3)](#reference3). Animal liver and kidney, fish, shellfish, pork, chicken, egg yolk, milk, yogurt, [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes), mushrooms, avocados, broccoli, and sweet potatoes are good sources of pantothenic acid. [Whole grains](../food-beverages/whole-grains) are also good sources of pantothenic acid, but processing and refining grains may result in a 35 to 75% loss. Freezing and canning of foods result in similar losses [(16)](#reference16). Large national, nutritional surveys failed to estimate pantothenic acid intake, mainly because of the scarcity of data on the pantothenic acid content of food [(16)](#reference16). Smaller studies estimated average daily intakes of pantothenic acid to be between 4 and 7 mg/day in adults. Table 2 lists some rich sources of pantothenic acid, along with their content in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content of foods, search [USDA's FoodData of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| The [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) that normally colonize the [colon](../glossary#colon) (large intestine) are capable of [synthesizing](../glossary#synthesis) pantothenic acid. A specialized transporter for the uptake of [biotin](biotin) and pantothenic acid was identified in cultured cells derived from the lining of the colon, suggesting that humans may be able to absorb pantothenic acid and biotin produced by intestinal bacteria [(27)](#reference27). However, the extent to which bacterial synthesis contributes to pantothenic acid intake in humans is not known [(28)](#reference28). [Supplements](../glossary#supplement) commonly contain pantothenol (panthenol), a stable alcohol [analog](../glossary#analog) of pantothenic acid, which can be rapidly converted to pantothenic acid by humans. Calcium and sodium D-pantothenate, the [calcium](../minerals/calcium) and [sodium](../minerals/sodium) salts of pantothenic acid, are also available as supplements. Pantethine is used as a [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering agent in Japan and is available in the US as a dietary supplement [(29)](#reference29). Pantothenic acid is not known to be toxic in humans. The only adverse effect noted was diarrhea resulting from very high intakes of 10 to 20 g/day of calcium D-pantothenate [(30)](#reference30). of life-threatening eosinophilic pleuropericardial effusion in an elderly woman who took a combination of 10 mg/day of [biotin](biotin) and 300 mg/day of pantothenic acid for two months [(31)](#reference31). Due to the lack of reports of adverse effects when the Dietary Reference Intakes ( [DRI](../glossary#DRI)) for pantothenic acid were established in 1998, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine did not establish a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for pantothenic acid [(16)](#reference16). Pantethine is generally well tolerated in doses up to 1,200 mg/day. However, [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) side effects, such as nausea and heartburn, have been reported [(29)](#reference29). Also, [topical](../glossary#topical) formulations containing up to 5% of dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) have been safely used for up to one month. Yet, a few cases of skin irritation, contact [dermatitis](../glossary#dermatitis), and eczema have been reported with the use of dexpanthenol-containing ointments [(32, 33)](#reference32). Large doses of pantothenic acid have the potential to compete with [biotin](biotin) for intestinal and cellular uptake by the human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (hSMVT) [(27](#reference27), [34)](#reference34). Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) containing [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) and progestin may increase the requirement for pantothenic acid [(30)](#reference30). Use of pantethine in combination with cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) or with nicotinic acid (see the article on [Niacin](niacin)) may produce additive effects on blood [lipids](../glossary#lipid) [(29)](#reference29). More data are needed to define the amount of dietary pantothenic acid required to promote optimal health or prevent [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendation by the Food and Nutrition Board of 5 mg/day of pantothenic acid for adults. A varied diet should provide enough pantothenic acid for most people. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) that contains 100% of the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for pantothenic acid will ensure an intake of at least 5 mg/day. There is currently little evidence that older adults differ in their intake of or their requirement for pantothenic acid. Most [multivitamin/mineral supplements](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) provide at least 5 mg/day of pantothenic acid.

Riboflavin is primarily found as an integral component of the that use a flavocoenzyme are called flavoproteins [(2)](#reference2). Living organisms derive most of their energy from [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) reactions, which are processes that involve the transfer of [electrons](../glossary#electron). Flavocoenzymes participate in redox reactions in numerous metabolic pathways They are critical for the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), [lipids](../glossary#lipid), and [proteins](../glossary#protein). FAD is part of the [electron transport (respiratory) chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain), which is central to energy production. In conjunction with [cytochrome P-450](../glossary#cytochrome-P450), flavocoenzymes also participate in the metabolism of toxins [(4)](#reference4). Glutathione reductase is a FAD-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction) cycle of [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione). The glutathione redox cycle plays a major role in protecting organisms from [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species), such as hydroperoxides. Glutathione reductase requires FAD to regenerate two molecules of reduced glutathione from oxidized glutathione. Riboflavin deficiency has been associated with increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) [(4)](#reference4) Measurement of glutathione reductase activity in red blood cells is commonly used assess riboflavin nutritional [status](../glossary#status) [(5)](#reference5). Glutathione peroxidases (GPx), [selenium](../minerals/selenium)-containing enzymes, reduced glutathione to break down hydroperoxides. GPx are involved in the [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid). Uric acid is one of the most effective water-soluble [ antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) in the blood. Riboflavin deficiency can result in decreased xanthine oxidase activity, reducing blood uric acid levels [(6)](#reference6). Riboflavin (as FAD or FMN) is required for the synthesis of [niacin](niacin) from tryptophan, and in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [vitamin B6](vitamin-B6) and [iron](../minerals/iron). It is also essential for folate and related [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) metabolism, where FAD is required as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a key folate-metabolizing enzyme. B6](vitamin-B6), riboflavin [status](../glossary#status) can affect several [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) systems. The conversion of vitamin B6 to its active [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) form in Human studies have provided evidence of the metabolic dependency of vitamin B6 on riboflavin status in older [(8-10)](#reference8) and younger [(10)](#reference10) adults. The [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the NAD 3-monooxygenase. deficiency can thus decrease the conversion of tryptophan to NAD and NADP, increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) is enzyme plays a key role in [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) metabolism by catalyzing the reduction of 5,10 methyleneTHF to 5 methylTHF. Once formed, 5 methylTHF is used by methionine synthase for the vitamin B12-dependent conversion of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) to methionine and the formation of THF (Figure 2). Both FMN and FAD are coenzymes for the enzyme methionine synthase reductase, which is responsible for the regeneration of methylcobalamin, the biologically active form of vitamin B12 acting as a coenzyme for methionine synthase [(11)](#reference11). Along with other B vitamins vitamin B12, and vitamin B6), higher dietary riboflavin intakes have been associated with lower [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of homocysteine [(12)](#reference12). In individuals [homozygous](../glossary#homozygous) [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) in the MTHFR [gene](../glossary#gene), low riboflavin status is associated with elevated plasma homocysteine, and in turn linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and other [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) [(13, 14)](#reference13). Furthermore, supplementation with riboflavin results in marked lowering of homocysteine concentrations specifically in individuals with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype [(15)](#reference15). Such results illustrate that chronic disease risk may be influenced by complex interactions between genetic and dietary factors. Riboflavin deficiency alters [iron](../minerals/iron) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). Although the mechanism is not clear, research in animals suggests that riboflavin deficiency may impair iron absorption, increase intestinal loss of iron, and/or impair iron utilization for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) [(16)](#reference16). In humans, low dietary intake of riboflavin has been associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for [anemia](../glossary#anemia) [(17)](#reference17), and improving riboflavin nutritional [status](../glossary#status) has been found to increase circulating hemoglobin levels [(18)](#reference18). Correction of riboflavin deficiency in individuals who are both riboflavin and iron deficient improves the response of iron-deficiency anemia to iron therapy [(19)](#reference19). Anemia during pregnancy, a worldwide public health problem, is responsible for considerable perinatal morbidity and mortality [(20, 21)](#reference20). The management of maternal anemia typically involves [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with iron alone or iron in combination with folic acid [(22)](#reference22). It is possible that the inclusion of riboflavin could enhance the effects of iron-folic acid supplementation in treating maternal anemia, but the evidence is limited. There are, however, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) conducted in pregnant women with anemia in Southeast Asia showing that a combination of folic acid, iron, [vitamin A](vitamin-A), and riboflavin improved hemoglobin levels and decreased anemia compared to iron-folic acid supplementation alone [(23, 24)](#reference23). Ariboflavinosis is the medical name for clinical riboflavin deficiency, which occurs commonly in low- and middle-income countries. Riboflavin deficiency is rarely found in isolation; it typically occurs in combination with deficiencies of other water-soluble [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin). Clinical signs of riboflavin deficiency include sore throat, redness and swelling of the lining of the mouth and throat, cracks or sores on the outsides of the lips (cheliosis) and at the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and redness of the tongue (magenta tongue), and a moist, scaly skin inflammation (seborrheic dermatitis). Other signs may involve the formation of blood vessels in the clear covering of the eye ( [vascularization](../glossary#vascularization) of the [cornea](../glossary#cornea)) and decreased red blood cell count in which the existing red blood cells contain normal levels of hemoglobin and are of normal size (normochromic normocytic [anemia](../glossary#anemia)) [(1, 3)](#references). Subclinical deficiency (low [status](../glossary#status)) of without clinical signs may be widespread, including in high-income countries, but usually goes undetected because riboflavin [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) are very rarely measured in human studies. Low or deficient riboflavin status may result in decreased conversion of vitamin B6 to its active [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) form (PLP) and decreased conversion of tryptophan to [niacin](niacin) (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)). [Preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) is defined as the presence of elevated blood pressure, protein in the urine, and [edema](../glossary#edema) (significant swelling) during pregnancy. About 5% of women with preeclampsia progress to [eclampsia](../glossary#eclampsia), a significant cause of maternal and fetal death. Eclampsia is characterized by seizures, in addition to high blood pressure and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) (severe bleeding) [(25)](#reference25). A study in 154 pregnant women at increased risk of preeclampsia found that those who were riboflavin deficient were 4.7 times more likely to develop preeclampsia than those who had adequate riboflavin nutritional status [(26)](#reference26). The cause of preeclampsia-eclampsia is not known. Decreased intracellular levels of flavocoenzymes could cause [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction, increase [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and interfere with [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide) release and thus blood vessel dilation - all of these changes have been associated with preeclampsia [(26)](#reference26). A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 54 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found that the MTHFR C677T [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) was associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, especially in Caucasian and Asian populations [(27)](#reference27). The reduction in the flavoprotein MTHFR activity observed in individuals with the variant MTHFR 677TT [genotype](../glossary#genotype) leads to an increase in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) higher homocysteine concentrations [(28)](#reference28). One [small randomized controlled](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) trial in 450 pregnant women in West Africa, without specified MTHFR genotype but at high risk for preeclampsia, found that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 15 mg of riboflavin daily was not effective in preventing the condition [(29)](#reference29), but the study was likely underpowered to detect a significant effect. Further studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of riboflavin supplementation in reducing [perinatal](../glossary#perinatal) complications generally and specifically in preeclamptic women with the MTHFR 677TT genotype. Alcoholics are at an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of riboflavin deficiency, likely due to decreased dietary intake, decreased absorption, and/or impaired utilization of riboflavin. Interestingly, the elevated blood [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations associated with riboflavin deficiency rapidly decline during alcohol withdrawal [(30)](#reference30). Additionally, people with anorexia rarely consume adequate dietary riboflavin, and those who are lactose intolerant are unlikely to meet requirements due to the avoidance of dairy products, the major dietary sources of riboflavin. The conversion of riboflavin into the active [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) forms FAD and FMN is impaired in [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism) and [adrenal](../glossary#adrenal-glands) insufficiency [(3, 4)](#reference3). Further, people who are very active physically (athletes, laborers) may have slightly increased riboflavin requirements. However, riboflavin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) has not generally been found to increase exercise tolerance or performance [(31)](#reference31) unless the individuals are riboflavin deficient [(32)](#reference32). The [ RDA](../glossary#RDA) for riboflavin, revised in 1998, is based on the prevention of deficiency (Table 1). Clinical signs of deficiency in humans appear at intakes of less than 0.5 to 0.6 milligrams (mg)/day, and urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of riboflavin is seen are the leading cause of visual disability in the US and other developed countries. Research has focused on the role of nutritional [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) because of evidence that light-induced [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) of [lens](../glossary#lens) proteins may lead to the development of age-related cataracts. A [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) found significantly decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of age-related cataracts (33% to 51%) in men and women in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of dietary riboflavin intake (median of 1.6 to 2.2 mg/day) compared to those in the lowest quintile (median of 0.08 mg/day in both men and women) [(33)](#reference33). Another case-control study reported that individuals in the highest quintile of riboflavin [status](../glossary#status), as measured by red blood cell glutathione reductase activity, had approximately one-half the occurrence of age-related cataract as those in the lowest quintile of riboflavin status, though the results were not statistically significant [(34)](#reference34). A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 2,900 Australian men and women, 49 years of age and older, found that those in the highest quintile of riboflavin intake were 50% less likely to have cataracts than those in the lowest quintile [(35)](#reference35). A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of more than 50,000 women did not observe a difference between rates of cataract extraction between women in the highest quintile of riboflavin intake (median of 1.5 mg/day) and women in the lowest quintile (median of 1.2 mg/day) [(36)](#reference36). However, the range between the highest and lowest quintiles was small, and median intake levels for both quintiles were above the [RDA](#RDA) for riboflavin. A study in 408 women found that higher dietary intakes of riboflavin were [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with a lens [(37)](#reference37). A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) using a fractional factorial design showed that compared with [placebo](../glossary#placebo), the combined supplementation with riboflavin (3 mg/day) and niacin (40 mg/day) for five to six years reduced the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of nuclear cataract but increased the progression of posterior subcapsular cataracts in population affected by multiple nutrient deficiency living in rural China [(38)](#reference38). Of note is that the results of this trial are somewhat conflicting, and the study design does not allow the effects of riboflavin and niacin to be differentiated. In summary, there is some evidence predominantly from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), that suggests higher riboflavin status might be beneficial; however, more evidence from well-designed, randomized controlled trials is needed to confirm a role for riboflavin in the prevention of cataracts. The flavoprotein, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase plays converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to re-methylation of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) to [methionine](../glossary#methionine) (see [Figure 2](#figure-2) above). The conversion of homocysteine to methionine is of importance for homocysteine detoxification and for the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for the [methylation](../glossary#methylation) of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and [histones](../glossary#histone). Folate deficiency and elevated homocysteine concentrations may [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [risk](../glossary#risk) (see the article on [Folate](folate#cancer-prevention)). Aberrant methylation changes are also known to alter the structure and function of DNA and histones during cancer development [(39)](#reference39). Since MTHFR controls the detoxification of homocysteine and the supply of methyl groups for SAM synthesis, a reduction in its activity can affect homocysteine metabolism and disturb cellular methylation processes. The substitution of a cytosine by a thymine in position 677 (c.677C>T) in the MTHFR [gene](../glossary#gene) is a [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism) that affects the binding of FAD and leads to an increased propensity for MTHFR to lose its flavin exhibit reduced MTHFR activity and increased risk for a wide variety of cancers [(41-43)](#reference41), but the evidence of an association between this polymorphism and cancer is inconsistent, with some reports suggesting a reduction in [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) risk with the T [allele](../glossary#allele) [(44)](#reference44). As mentioned above (see [B-complex vitamins](#B-complex-vitamins)), riboflavin intake is a determinant of homocysteine concentration. This suggests that riboflavin [status](../glossary#status) can influence MTHFR activity and the metabolism of folate, thereby affecting cancer risk [(43)](#reference43). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, 93 subjects with colorectal [polyps](../glossary#polyp) and 86 healthy subjects were given a placebo, folic acid (400 or 1,200 g/day), or folic acid (400 g/day) plus riboflavin (5 mg/day) for 45 days. These interventions significantly improved folate and riboflavin status in [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin)- [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) individuals compared to those taking the placebo. Interestingly, riboflavin enhanced the effect of 400 g folic acid on circulating 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) specifically in the polyp patients with the C677T genetic variant [(45)](#reference45). This suggests that riboflavin may improve the response to folic acid supplementation in individuals with a reduced MTHFR activity. Additionally, a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 88,045 postmenopausal women found total (dietary plus supplemental) intake of riboflavin to be [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with colorectal cancer risk when comparing the highest (>3.97 mg) and lowest (<1.80 mg) [quartiles](../glossary#quartile) of daily intake [(46)](#reference46); intake in the reference group was well above the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for riboflavin of 1.1 mg/day. The subjects in this study were not prescreened to identify those with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype, and the association between this polymorphism and colorectal cancer remains unclear, with some reports suggesting a reduction in cancer risk with the T allele [(44)](#reference44). Two [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) have found inverse associations between riboflavin intake and risk of colorectal cancer [(47, 48)](#reference47). The most recent of these was a dose-response meta-analysis that pooled results from five prospective cohort studies, nine [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), and two studies reporting blood concentrations of riboflavin. This analysis found that higher intakes of riboflavin were associated with a significantly lower risk of colorectal cancer ( [RR](../glossary#relative-risk)=0.87; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval), 0.81-0.93); inverse associations were observed for both dietary riboflavin intake and total daily intake from the diet and supplements [(48)](#reference48). Associations between riboflavin intake and cancer risk have also been evaluated in other types of cancer. A seven-year [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) evaluated the use of riboflavin-fortified salt in 22,093 individuals at high risk for [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) cancer in China. Riboflavin status and esophageal [pathology](../glossary#pathology) (percent normal, dysplastic, and cancerous tissues) improved in the intervention group compared to the control group, but the lower incidence of esophageal cancer found in the intervention group was not statistically significant [(49)](#reference49). Additionally, a 25-year follow up of an intervention trial in patients at high risk for gastric cancer found that dietary supplementation with riboflavin (3.2 mg/day) and niacin (40 mg/day) for five years decreased the risk of mortality from esophageal cancer by 8% but had no effect on mortality from [gastric cancer](../health-disease/stomach-cancer) [(50)](#reference50). In the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, which followed 41,514 men and women over a 15-year period, weak inverse associations were found between riboflavin intake and lung cancer [(51)](#reference51) and breast cancer [(52)](#reference52); no association of riboflavin intake with [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer was observed in this cohort [(53)](#reference53). A 2017 meta-analysis of 10 observational studies found an overall inverse association of riboflavin intake and breast cancer incidence and reported a 6% lower risk with each 1 mg/day increment of riboflavin intake [(54)](#reference54). Further, studies to date have not found riboflavin intake or measures of riboflavin status to be associated with renal cell carcinoma, as reviewed in a recent meta-analysis [(55)](#reference55). Some evidence indicates that impaired [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) oxygen [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in the brain may play a role in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of [migraine headaches](../glossary#migraine-headache). Since riboflavin is the [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of the two flavocoenzymes (FAD and FMN) required by flavoproteins of the mitochondrial [electron transport chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain), [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) riboflavin has been investigated as a treatment for migraine. A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examined the effect of very high dose riboflavin (400 mg/day) for three months on migraine prevention in 54 men and women with a history of recurrent migraine headaches [(56)](#reference56). Riboflavin compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) reduced attack frequency and the number of headache days, though the beneficial effect was most pronounced during the third month of treatment [(56)](#reference56). Another study by the same investigators found that treatment with either a -blocker drug or high-dose riboflavin (400 mg/day) for four months resulted in clinical improvement, but each therapy appeared to act on a distinct pathological mechanism: -blockers on abnormal cortical information processing and riboflavin on decreased brain mitochondrial energy reserve [(57)](#reference57). A small study in 23 patients reported a reduction in median migraine attack frequency after supplementation with 400 mg of riboflavin daily for three months [(58)](#reference58). A single-blinded, randomized, parallel group trial in 85 patients with migraine headaches (ages 15-55 years), high-dose riboflavin supplementation (400 mg/day) for 12 weeks decreased migraine frequency, duration, and severity compared to baseline and was as effective as sodium valproate (500 mg/day) [(59)](#reference59), a medication with established efficacy in migraine preventative therapy [(60)](#reference60). Riboflavin elicited significantly fewer adverse effects compared to the drug [(59)](#reference59). Thus, although the available trials have been small and short term, most studies to date suggest that high-dose riboflavin supplementation might be a useful [adjunct therapy](../glossary#adjunct-therapy) in adults with migraine headaches. A few randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of riboflavin supplementation on the frequency and severity of headache attacks in children with migraines. An initial study evaluated riboflavin at 200 mg/day for 12 weeks in 48 children of ages 5 to 15 years old [(61)](#reference61). A second study was a [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) with half of the 42 children, ages 6 to 13, receiving 50 mg/day riboflavin for 16 weeks then placebo (100 mg/day carotene) for 16 weeks (with a four-week washout period in between each), while the other half were first given the placebo then riboflavin [(62)](#reference62). Neither study showed differences in the frequency, duration, or intensity of migraines between treatments. However, a more recent trial found a benefit of intervention with higher dose riboflavin: children with migraine treated with 400 mg/day of riboflavin for 12 weeks (n=30) had reductions in migraine frequency and duration, but not intensity, compared to placebo (n=30), yet no benefit was seen in children taking 200 mg/day for 12 weeks in this study [(63)](#reference63). Additionally, a randomized controlled trial in 98 adolescents, ages 12 to 19 years, found that 400 mg/day of riboflavin for three months decreased both headache frequency and duration and improved migraine-related disability compared to placebo [(64)](#reference64). [Retrospective studies](../glossary#retrospective-study) of children and adolescents suffering from migraine have also suggested some benefit associated with supplemental riboflavin [(65-67)](#reference65). Thus, studies to date are somewhat conflicting, and more research is needed to understand whether riboflavin supplementation might have utility in the treatment of childhood migraine and the most effective dose required for any beneficial effects. Increasing evidence from [case reports](../glossary#case-report) indicates that patients with [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) disorders caused defective FAD-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) could benefit from riboflavin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement). MADD, also known acidemia), is a [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) disorder characterized by the accumulation of short-, medium-, and long-chain acyl- [carnitines](../glossary#carnitine) in various tissues. MADD is classified into three separate types based on age of onset and clinical symptoms: type I MADD is evident in the neonatal period and is characterized by the presence of [congenital anomalies](../glossary#congenital-anomaly); type II MADD is present in the neonatal period but lacks congenital defects; and type III is characterized by late onset, from infancy through adulthood [(68)](#reference68), and even as late as the seventh decade of life [(69)](#reference69). Clinical symptoms of type I and II MADD present shortly after birth and include hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, metabolic acidosis, hepatomegaly, and respiratory distress [(68](#reference68), [70)](#reference70); these forms of MADD are often fatal in infancy, even if treated. Type III MADD usually presents later in life and includes milder symptoms, varying from periodic vomiting, rhabdomyolysis, muscle pain and weakness, and exercise intolerance [(68](#reference68), [70)](#reference70). [Peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy) has also recently been reported as a symptom of adult-onset MADD [(71)](#reference71). MADD is caused by [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [genes](../glossary#gene) that impair the activity of [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in the transfer of [electrons](../glossary#electron) from acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to [coenzyme (Figure ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH code for the two subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF-A and -B) and for ETF dehydrogenase/ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETFDH/ETFQO), respectively. Deficiencies in these enzymes (ETF or ETFDH) lead to a decrease in oxidized FAD, which becomes unavailable for FAD-dependent dehydrogenation reactions, including the first step in -oxidation - a major fatty acid [catabolic](../glossary#catabolism) process that takes place in the mitochondria. A defect in fatty acid -oxidation causes [lipid](../glossary#lipid) accumulation in skeletal muscles, leading to lipid storage [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy) characterized by muscle pain and weakness and exercise intolerance. Together with a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, riboflavin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) has led to significant clinical improvements in patients with ETFDH mutations. The specific type of the mutation in ETF/ETFDH contributes to age of onset, severity, and responsiveness to riboflavin treatment [(70](#reference70), [72)](#reference72). Additionally, the report of a 20-year-old man with riboflavin-responsive MADD failed to find mutations in ETF and ETFDH genes, suggesting that other sites of mutation should not be excluded [(73)](#reference73). Finally, secondary deficiencies in the respiratory chain are observed in MADD and appear to respond favorably to riboflavin supplementation [(72](#reference72), FAD-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) with important roles in both the [electron transport -oxidation of ACAD9 [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for ACAD9 have been found in patients with mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a respiratory chain disorder [(75)](#reference75). Complex I carries [electrons](../glossary#electron) from NADH to [coenzyme Q10](../dietary-factors/coenzyme-Q10) Defective oxidative phosphorylation ( [ATP](../glossary#ATP) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by the respiratory chain) due to complex I deficiency has been linked to a broad variety of clinical manifestations, from neonatal death to late-onset [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease). The clinical symptoms of complex I deficiency due to ACAD9 mutations typically include muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, lactic acidosis, and [hypertrophic](../glossary#hypertrophy) [cardiomyopathy](../glossary#cardiomyopathy) [(76)](#reference76). However, symptoms can be of varying severity, likely due to the remaining functional activity of ACAD9. For example, affected patients have been reported to exhibit a spectrum of cardiac deficits, including isolated, mild ventricular has been shown to increase complex I activity in patients with childhood-onset clinical forms of ACAD9 deficiency. Improvements in muscle strength and exercise tolerance have also been associated with riboflavin supplementation [(78-80)](#reference78). A review of cases of ACAD9 deficiency presenting in infancy (i.e., cases with severe symptoms) found riboflavin treatment to be associated with improved survival: 7 of 22 patients treated with riboflavin succumbed to the illness compared to 16 out of 17 untreated patients [(76)](#reference76). SLC52A1, SLC52A2, and SLC52A3 [genes](../glossary#gene) RFVT1, RFVT2, and RFVT3, respectively. [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) in these genes lead to riboflavin transporter deficiency, a rare [neurodegenerative](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) condition with variable age of onset, from infancy to early stages of adulthood. [Autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 respectively cause disorders known as riboflavin transporter deficiency type 2 (RFVT2 deficiency) and riboflavin transporter deficiency type 3 (RFVT3 deficiency). These genetic disorders were formerly called Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and Fazio-Londe syndrome [(81)](#reference81). Riboflavin transporter deficiency caused by mutation of SLC52A1 is exceedingly rare and has been reported in only three cases (reviewed in [82](#reference82)). Clinical features of riboflavin transporter deficiency can include muscle weakness in the arms and legs, sensory [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), bulbar palsy with hypotonia and High-dose, oral supplementation with riboflavin improves many of these symptoms in the majority of affected patients; such treatment should be given at the time of suspected riboflavin transporter deficiency for a better [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) [(84)](#reference84). A 2016 review of the published literature found that oral supplementation with riboflavin - at doses ranging from 7 to 60 mg/kg/day - led to improved symptoms in 71% of the patients (n=39) and to no deaths [(83)](#reference83). In contrast, all of the untreated patients (n=31) had a progression of the disease and a mortality rate of at least 48% [(83)](#reference83). Primary [trimethylaminuria](../glossary#trimethylaminuria) is caused by defective [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of trimethylamine by a liver flavoprotein called flavin containing mono-oxygenase 3 (FMO3). Individuals with FMO3 deficiency have increased levels of trimethylamine in urine, sweat, and breath [(85)](#reference85). This socially distressing condition is known as \"fish odor syndrome\" due to the fishy odor and volatile nature of trimethylamine. FMO3 [gene](../glossary#gene) [mutations](../glossary#mutation) are usually associated with mild or intermittent trimethylaminuria; the condition is sometimes limited to peri-menstrual periods in female subjects or to the consumption of trimethylamine-rich food. The clinical management of the condition includes dietary restriction of trimethylamine and its [precursors](../glossary#precursor), such as foods rich in [choline](../other-nutrients/choline) and seafood, as well as [cruciferous vegetables](../food-beverages/cruciferous-vegetables) that contain both trimethylamine precursors and FMO3 [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) [(86)](#reference86). The use of riboflavin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) was reported 17-year-old female patient affected by pyridoxine non-responsive homocystinuria [(87)](#reference87). The disease was initially treated with betaine (a choline derivative), which caused body odor secondary to FMO3 deficiency. Riboflavin supplementation (200 mg/day) reduced trimethylamine [excretion](../glossary#excretion) and the betaine body odor. Similar effects were seen with riboflavin supplementation in two pediatric patients [(88)](#reference88). The data suggest that riboflavin might help maximize residual FMO3 [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) activity in patients with primary trimethylaminuria. Moreover, a recent [case report](../glossary#case-report) in a 35-year-old male with [HIV](../glossary#HIV) described supplemental riboflavin as an effective treatment for secondary trimethylaminuria caused by antiretroviral therapy [(89)](#reference89). [Hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) in adulthood is recognized as the leading risk factor contributing to mortality worldwide primarily from [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease), while hypertension in pregnancy leads to serious adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. A number of risk factors are recognized to contribute to the development of hypertension. In recent years, evidence has emerged from genetic and clinical studies pointing to the role of [one-carbon](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in blood pressure [(90)](#reference90). The common MTHFR C677T [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism), affecting 1 in 10 adults globally, is associated with higher blood pressure, although this is much less well recognized compared with the phenotype of elevated [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations that was established at the time of discovery of this polymorphism and its link with cardiovascular disease [(91)](#reference91). [Meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) show that this polymorphism is associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hypertension by up to 87% and of heart disease and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) by up to 40% [(92)](#reference92). The MTHFR C677T polymorphism is also associated with a significantly higher risk of hypertension in pregnancy [(93)](#reference93) and with [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) [(27)](#reference27). Since FAD is required as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for the MTHFR [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) and the MTHFR C677T polymorphism results in decreased MTHFR activity, studies have investigated whether affected individuals may benefit from riboflavin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement). In an initial [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 77 healthy young adults stratified by MTHFR [genotype](../glossary#genotype), riboflavin supplementation at dietary levels (1.6 mg/day for 12 weeks) resulted in marked lowering of homocysteine concentrations in the MTHFR 677TT genotype group, but not in the 677CC or 677CT genotype groups who exhibited normal [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine at baseline [(15)](#reference15). Three randomized controlled trials subsequently investigated the effect of riboflavin on blood pressure in patients with hypertension with or without overt cardiovascular disease [(91](#reference91), [94, 95)](#reference94). The results of these trials showed that supplementation with low-dose riboflavin (1.6 mg/day for 16 weeks) resulted in significant lowering of blood pressure and reduction in incidence of hypertension specifically in those patients with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype. Riboflavin intervention reduced mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure in those with the TT genotype from 144/87 to 131/80 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg), with no response observed in those without the genetic variant (i.e., the CT or CC genotypes) [(89)](#reference89). Notably, the 13 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred even though over 80% of the patients were taking one or more antihypertensive drugs at recruitment, and the addition of supplemental riboflavin was shown to greatly enhance the achievement of goal blood pressure with routine antihypertensive drugs [(89, 91)](#reference89). Furthermore, the magnitude of blood pressure response achieved with riboflavin in these trials compares very favorably with typical decreases from other interventions, such as dietary salt reductions of 3 g/day (3.6/1.9 mm Hg) and 6 g/day (7.1/3.9 mm Hg). The trial findings therefore suggest that the excess risk of hypertension linked to this genetic polymorphism can be overcome by low-dose riboflavin supplementation. Also, analysis of plasma samples from individuals participating in these trials showed lower concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), an important methyl group donor for [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, in those with the MTHFR (1.6 mg/day) for 12 weeks was shown to increase plasma concentrations of SAM and another one-carbon metabolite, cystathionine [(96)](#reference96), and thus may have potential in correcting the altered one-carbon metabolism arising with the variant TT genotype. Thus, studies to date indicate that riboflavin supplementation may have benefits in lowering blood pressure and reducing hypertension in individuals (and sub-populations) affected by the common MTHFR C677T polymorphism. However, the mechanisms explaining the blood pressure phenotype and its responsiveness to riboflavin remain unclear. Future studies examining the effects of riboflavin supplementation on one-carbon metabolism may help to elucidate the biological mechanisms involved. Interestingly, a recent randomized controlled trial found that riboflavin supplementation in those with the variant MTHFR 677TT genotype resulted in altered [DNA](../glossary#DNA) methylation of certain [genes](../glossary#gene) known to be involved in blood pressure regulation [(97)](#reference97). Anticancer agents often display various side effects that may force patients to limit the dose or to discontinue the treatment. The [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) effect of co-administering riboflavin was evaluated in 78 postmenopausal patients with breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer) treated with tamoxifen for 90 days. This [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) effectively prevented the [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) associated with tamoxifen treatment [(98)](#reference98). Riboflavin can also act as a photosensitizer, and this property may have value in photodynamic therapy of cancer. A mouse model was used to assess the effect of riboflavin in combination with cisplatin, one of the most effective anticancer agents. Under light exposure, riboflavin administration reduced cisplatin-induced [DNA](../glossary#DNA) damage in the liver and kidneys [(99)](#reference99). These results are promising, but human studies are needed to examine whether riboflavin is an effective [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct-therapy) to [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy). Corneal ectasia is an eye condition characterized by irregularities of the [cornea](../glossary#cornea) that affect vision. Corneal cross-linking - a fairly new procedure used by professionals to limit the progression of corneal damage -involves the use of [topical](../glossary#topical) riboflavin in conjunction with ultraviolet-A irradiation. Riboflavin functions as a photosensitizer in the reaction. Cross-linking modifies the properties of the cornea and strengthens its architecture [(100, 101)](#reference100). [Multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) (MS) is an [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) of unknown [etiology](../glossary#etiology) that is characterized by the progressive destruction of [myelin](../glossary#myelin) and nerve fibers in the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), causing [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms in affected individuals [(102)](#reference102). Riboflavin appears to have a role in the formation of myelin [(103)](#reference103), and [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) has been implicated in the [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) of MS; thus, riboflavin may be helpful in treatment of the disease. A strong [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between dietary riboflavin intake and [risk](../glossary#risk) for MS was initially observed in a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) [(104)](#reference104). In a mouse model of MS (i.e., experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), riboflavin supplementation improved clinical measures of a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study) in 29 patients with MS found that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 10 mg/day of riboflavin for six months had no effect on MS-related disability, assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale [(106)](#reference106). Large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to determine whether riboflavin supplementation has a beneficial effect in the treatment of MS. Most plant- and animal-derived foods contain at least small quantities of riboflavin. In the US, wheat flour and bread have been enriched with riboflavin (as well as [thiamin](thiamin), [niacin](niacin), and [iron](../minerals/iron)) since 1943. Data from a US national survey indicate that the average dietary intake of riboflavin is 2.5 mg/day for men and 1.8 mg/day for women [(107)](#reference107); these intakes are well above the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) values of 1.3 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women. Surveys of adults of ages 70 years or older showed similar intakes: 2.2 mg/day for older men and 1.8 mg day for older women [(107)](#reference107). Riboflavin is heat-stable, but it is easily destroyed upon exposure to light. For instance, up to 50% of the riboflavin in milk contained in a clear glass bottle can be destroyed after two hours of exposure to bright sunlight [(6)](#reference6). Nationally representative surveys from the US, Ireland, and the UK showed that milk and other dairy products were the main dietary contributors to riboflavin intake, followed by meat and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals [(108-110)](#reference108). Some foods with substantial amounts of riboflavin are listed in Table 2, along with their riboflavin content in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content of food, search [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). The [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of riboflavin from food is reported to be very high, nearly 95% [(108)](#reference108). Limited data exist for the relative bioavailability of riboflavin from different food sources, however a [cross-over study](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in healthy women using stable isotopes and kinetic modeling did not find significant differences in riboflavin absorption from milk and spinach [(111)](#reference111). of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.| The most common forms of riboflavin available in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are riboflavin and riboflavin 5'-monophosphate. Riboflavin commonly found in multivitamin and vitamin B-complex preparations [(112)](#reference112). No toxic or adverse effects of high riboflavin intake in humans are known. Studies in cell culture indicate that excess riboflavin may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) strand breaks in the presence of chromium (VI), a known [carcinogen](../glossary#carcinogen) [(113)](#reference113). This may be of concern to workers exposed to chrome, yet no data in humans are available. High-dose riboflavin therapy has been found to intensify urine color to a bright yellow (flavinuria), but this is a harmless side effect. The Food and Nutrition Board did not establish a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) when the RDA was revised in 1998 [(1)](#references). Several early reports indicated that women taking high-dose oral contraceptives had diminished riboflavin [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) status. However, when investigators controlled for dietary riboflavin intake, no differences between users of oral contraceptives and non-users were found [(1)](#references). Phenothiazine derivatives like the anti-psychotic medication, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), and tricyclic antidepressants inhibit the conversion of riboflavin to FAD and FMN, as do the and the the may increase destruction of riboflavin by liver [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), increasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of deficiency [(3)](#reference3). Additionally, chronic alcohol consumption has been associated with riboflavin deficiency. In rats chronically fed alcohol, the inhibition of riboflavin transporters caused impairment in intestinal absorption and [renal](../glossary#renal) re-uptake of the vitamin [(114)](#reference114). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for riboflavin (1.3 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women), which should prevent deficiency in most individuals, is easily met by eating a varied diet. Consuming a varied diet should supply 1.5 mg to 2 mg of riboflavin a day. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement containing 100% of the Daily Values ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) will ensure an intake of at least 1.3 mg/day of riboflavin. Some experts in nutrition and aging feel that the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) (1.3 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women) leaves little margin for error in people over 50 years of age [(115, 116)](#reference115). A study of independently living people between 65 and 90 years of age found that almost 25% consumed less than the recommended riboflavin intake, and 10% had biochemical evidence of that riboflavin 1.6 to 2.2 mg/day may reduce the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing age-related cataracts. Additionally, older people suffering from acute [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) were found to be deficient for riboflavin [(118)](#reference118), and riboflavin deficiency has been linked to a higher risk of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in postmenopausal women with the MTHFR 677T variant [(119)](#reference119). Individuals whose diets may not supply adequate riboflavin, especially those over 50 years of age, should consider taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement, which generally provides at least 1.3 mg/day of riboflavin.

Isolated and characterized in the 1930s, thiamin was one of the first organic compounds to be recognized as a vitamin [(2)](#reference2). Thiamin occurs in the human body as free required as a in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and [branched-chain amino acids](../glossary#branched-chain-amino-acids). Forms of thiamin are also needed for ribose synthesis complex within cellular [organelles](../glossary#organelle) called [mitochondria](../glossary#mitochondria). (CoA), succinyl-CoA, glutaryl-CoA, and derivatives of BCAA, respectively (Figure 1). All products play critical roles in the production of energy from food through their connection to the [citric acid (Krebs) cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) [(2)](#reference2). BCAA, into acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA to fuel the citric acid cycle. The [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) of the three BCAAs also contributes to the production of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and donates nitrogen for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter), [glutamate](../glossary#glutamate) and g-aminobutyric requires catalyzes critical reactions in another metabolic pathway occurring in the [cytosol](../glossary#cytosol), known as the pentose phosphate pathway. One of the most important intermediates of this pathway is ribose-5-phosphate, a phosphorylated 5-carbon sugar required for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) [DNA](../glossary#DNA), and [RNA](../glossary#RNA). The pentose decreases early in thiamin deficiency and, unlike most thiamin-dependent enzymes, is present in red blood cells, measurement of its activity in red blood cells has been used to assess thiamin nutritional of acids through the process of -oxidation, the oxidative removal of a single carbon atom from fatty acids like phytanic acid [(7)](#reference7). Beriberi, the disease resulting from severe thiamin deficiency, was described in Chinese literature as early as 2600 B.C. Thiamin deficiency affects the [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular), muscular, [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal), and central and peripheral nervous systems [(2)](#reference2). Beriberi has been subdivided into dry, wet, cerebral, or gastrointestinal, depending on the systems affected by severe thiamin deficiency [(1](#references), [8)](#reference8). The main feature of dry (paralytic or nervous) beriberi is [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy). Early in the course of the neuropathy, \"burning feet syndrome\" may occur. Other symptoms include abnormal (exaggerated) reflexes, as well as diminished sensation and weakness in the legs and arms. Muscle pain and tenderness and difficulty rising from a squatting position have also been observed [(9)](#reference9). In addition to [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms, wet (cardiac) beriberi is characterized by [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) manifestations of thiamin deficiency, which include rapid heart rate, enlargement of the heart, severe swelling ( [edema](../glossary#edema)), difficulty breathing, and ultimately, [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure). The Japanese literature describes the acute fulminant form of wet beriberi as \"shoshin\" [(10)](#reference10). Cerebral beriberi may lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis, especially in people who abuse alcohol. The diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy is based on a \"triad\" of signs, which include abnormal eye movements, stance and gait [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), and [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) impairment. Due in part to an overlap of symptoms with alcoholic delirium, Wernicke's encephalopathy is thought to be underdiagnosed [(11)](#reference11). If left untreated, the irreversible [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) damage can cause additional clinical manifestations known as Korsakoff's psychosis. This syndrome - also called Korsakoff's [dementia](../glossary#dementia), Korsakoff's amnesia, or amnestic confabulatory syndrome - involves a confused, apathetic state and a profound memory disorder, with severe amnesia and loss of recent and working memory. Thiamin deficiency affecting the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system) is referred to as Wernicke's disease when the amnesic state is not present and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) when the amnesic symptoms are present along with the eye-movement and gait disorders. Rarer neurologic manifestations can include [seizures](../glossary#seizure) [(12)](#reference12). Most WKS sufferers are alcoholics, although it has been observed in other disorders of gross malnutrition, including stomach [cancer](../glossary#cancer) and [AIDS](../glossary#AIDS). Administration of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) thiamin to WKS patients generally results in prompt improvement of the eye symptoms, but improvements in motor coordination and memory may be less, depending on how long the symptoms have been present. Evidence of increased immune cell activation and increased [free radical](../glossary#free-radical) production in the areas of the brain that are selectively damaged suggests that [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) plays an important role in the neurologic pathology of thiamin deficiency [(13)](#reference13). TPP is critical for metabolic reactions that utilize [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [glycolysis](../glossary#glycoloysis) and the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) (see [Figure 1](#figure-1)). A decrease in the activity of thiamin-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) limits the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and the utilization of the citric acid cycle, leading to accumulation of pyruvate and lactate. Lactic acidosis, a condition resulting from the accumulation of lactate, is often associated with nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain in a syndrome described as gastrointestinal beriberi [(8)](#reference8). Thiamin deficiency may result from inadequate thiamin intake, increased requirement for thiamin, excessive loss of thiamin from the body, consumption of anti-thiamin factors in food, or a combination of these factors. Inadequate consumption of thiamin is the main cause of thiamin deficiency in developing countries [(2)](#reference2). Thiamin deficiency is common in low-income populations whose diets are high in [carbohydrate](../glossary#carbohydrate) and low in thiamin (e.g., milled or polished rice). Breast-fed infants whose mothers are thiamin deficient are vulnerable to developing infantile beriberi. Alcoholism, which is associated with low intake of thiamin among other nutrients, is the primary cause of thiamin deficiency in industrialized countries. Some of the non-alcoholic conditions associated with WKS include anorexia nervosa, [bariatric](../glossary#bariatrics) heightened thiamin deficiency [(18, 19)](#reference18). Moreover, cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy have been linked with hyperemesis gravidarum (severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy) [parenteral nutrition](../glossary#parenteral-nutrition) lacking [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) supplementation Conditions resulting in an increased requirement for thiamin include strenuous physical exertion, fever, pregnancy, breast-feeding, and adolescent growth. Such conditions place individuals with marginal thiamin intake at [risk](../glossary#risk) for developing symptomatic thiamin deficiency. [Malaria](../glossary#malaria) patients in Southeast Asia were found to be thiamin deficient more frequently than non-infected individuals [(24, 25)](#reference24). Malarial infection leads to a large increase in the metabolic demand for [glucose](../glossary#glucose). Because thiamin is required for [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) involved in glucose [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), the stresses induced by malarial infection could exacerbate thiamin deficiency in predisposed individuals. [HIV](../glossary#HIV)-infected individuals, whether or not they had developed [AIDS](../glossary#AIDS), were also found to be at increased risk for thiamin deficiency [(26)](#reference26). Further, chronic alcohol abuse impairs intestinal absorption and utilization of thiamin [(1)](#references); thus, alcoholics have increased requirements for thiamin. Thiamin deficiency is also observed as a complication of the refeeding syndrome: the introduction of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) in severely starved individuals leads to an increased demand for thiamin in [glycolysis](../glossary#glycoloysis) and the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) that Excessive precipitate deficiency. By increasing urinary flow, [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic) may prevent reabsorption of thiamin by the kidneys and increase its excretion in the urine [(28, 29)](#reference28). The [risk](../glossary#risk) of thiamin deficiency is increased in diuretic-treated patients with marginal thiamin intake [(30)](#reference30) and in individuals receiving long-term, diuretic therapy [(31)](#reference31). Individuals with kidney failure requiring [hemodialysis](../glossary#hemodialysis) lose thiamin at an increased rate and are at risk for thiamin deficiency [(32)](#reference32). Alcoholics who maintain a high fluid intake and high urine flow rate may also experience increased loss of thiamin, exacerbating the effects of low thiamin intake [(33)](#reference33). The presence of anti-thiamin factors (ATF) in foods contributes to the [risk](../glossary#risk) of thiamin deficiency. Certain plants contain ATF, which react with thiamin to form an oxidized, inactive product. Consuming very large amounts of tea or coffee (including decaffeinated), as well as chewing tea leaves and betel nuts, might lower thiamin status due to the presence of ATF [(34, 35)](#reference34). ATF include mycotoxins (molds) and thiaminases that break down thiamin in food. Individuals who habitually eat certain raw fresh-water fish, raw shellfish, or ferns are at higher risk of thiamin deficiency because these foods contain thiaminase that normally is inactivated by heat in cooking [(1](#references), [6)](#reference6). In Nigeria, an acute, [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) syndrome (seasonal [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia)) has been associated with thiamin deficiency precipitated by a thiaminase in African silkworms, a traditional, high-protein food for some Nigerians [(36)](#reference36). The [ RDA](../glossary#RDA) for thiamin, revised in 1998 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, was based on the prevention of deficiency in generally healthy individuals [(37](#reference37); Table 1). |Life of 2,900 Australian men and women, 49 years of age and older, found that those in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of thiamin intake were 40% less likely to have nuclear [cataracts](../glossary#cataract) than those in the lowest quintile [(38)](#reference38). In addition, a study in 408 US women found that higher dietary intakes of thiamin were [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with five-year change in lens opacification [(39)](#reference39). However, these cross-sectional associations have yet to be elucidated by studies of causation. Patients with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) have been reported to have low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations and high [renal](../glossary#renal) clearance of thiamin [(40, 41)](#reference40), suggesting that individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for thiamin deficiency. Two thiamin transporters, thiamin transporter-1 THTR-2, are involved in thiamin uptake by [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte) in the small intestine and re-uptake in the proximal tubules of the kidneys. One study suggested that [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) in patients with diabetes could affect thiamin re-uptake by decreasing the expression of thiamin transporters in the kidneys [(42)](#reference42). Conversely, thiamin deficiency appears to impair the normal [endocrine](../glossary#endocrine-system) function of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) and exacerbate hyperglycemia. Early studies showed that [insulin](../glossary#insulin) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and secretion were altered in the endocrine of thiamin-deficient rats [(43, 44)](#reference43). In caused by [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding leads to the thiamin-responsive six weeks to hyperglycemic individuals (either [glucose](../glossary#glucose) intolerant or newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes). Thiamin supplementation prevented any further increase in fasting glucose and insulin concentrations compared with [placebo](../glossary#placebo) treatment but did not reduce the hyperglycemia [(45)](#reference45). However, one study suggested that thiamin supplementation might improve fasting glucose concentrations in in early stages of type 2 diabetes (i.e., pre-diabetes) [(46)](#reference46). Some older adults are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for developing [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) thiamin deficiency secondary to poor dietary intake, reduced [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption, and multiple medical conditions [(47, 48)](#reference47). Since thiamin deficiency can result in a form of [dementia](../glossary#dementia) (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), its relationship to [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) (AD) and other forms of dementia have been investigated. AD is characterized by a decline in [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function in elderly people, accompanied by [pathologic](../glossary#pathology) features that include [-amyloid plaque](../glossary#amyloid-plaque) deposition and tomography (PET) scanning](../glossary#PET-scan), reduced [glucose](../glossary#glucose) metabolism has been observed in brains of AD patients [(50)](#reference50). A large, multicenter PET study using a radiolabeled glucose [analog](../glossary#analog), 18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG), correlated a reduction in FDG uptake (a surrogate marker for glucose metabolism) with the extent of cognitive impairment in AD patients. This study, which included 822 subjects over 55 years of age that were cognitively normal (n=229), displayed mild cognitive impairment (n=405), or had mild AD (n=188), demonstrated that brain glucose utilization could predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD [(51)](#reference51). A nine-year longitudinal study associated the presence of [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) in older people (above 55 years old) with an increased risk for developing AD [(52)](#reference52). Emerging evidence links type 2 diabetes and AD, conditions that may involve [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) in the brain (reviewed in [53](#reference53)). A reduction in thiamin-dependent processes in the brain appears to be related to the altered glucose metabolism in patients with AD [(54-56)](#reference54). [Case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) have found blood levels of thiamin, TPP, and TMP to be lower in those with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) compared to control subjects [(57, 58)](#reference57). Moreover, several investigators have found evidence of decreased activity of TPP-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase, in the brains of patients who died of AD [(59)](#reference59). The finding of decreased brain levels of TPP in the presence of normal levels of free thiamin and TMP suggests altered TPP synthesis rather than poor thiamin [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability). However, it is not clear whether the activities of TPP-metabolizing enzymes (including thiamin pyrophosphokinase) are altered in AD patients [(60, 61)](#reference60). Chronic administration of the thiamin derivative benfotiamine alleviated cognitive alterations and decreased the number of -amyloid plaques in a mouse model of AD without increasing TMP and TPP levels in the brain. This suggested that the beneficial effects of benfotiamine in the brain were likely mediated by the stimulation of TPP-independent pathways [(62)](#reference62). Chronic benfotiamine administration was also shown to decrease the number of neurofibrillary tangles in certain brain regions and improve survival in a mouse model [(63)](#reference63). In a rat model of neurodegeneration, long-term oral benfotiamine [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) increased thiamin pyrophosphate concentrations and led to improvements in insulin signaling and cognitive deficits [(64)](#reference64). Thiamin deficiency has been linked to increased -amyloid production in cultured [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) cells and to plaque formation in animal models [(65, 66)](#reference65). These pathological hallmarks of AD could be reversed by thiamin supplementation, suggesting that thiamin could be protective in AD. Other disorders, including [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and chronic [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), have been linked to both thiamin deficiency and AD pathogenesis and progression [(13](#reference13), [55](#reference55), [67)](#reference67). Presently, there is only slight and inconsistent evidence that thiamin supplements are of benefit in AD. A [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study of 15 patients (10 completed the study) reported no beneficial effect of 3 grams/day of thiamin on cognitive decline over a 12-month period [(68)](#reference68). A preliminary report from another study claimed a mild benefit of 3 to 8 grams of thiamin per day in DAT, but no additional data from that study are available [(69)](#reference69). A mild beneficial effect in patients with AD was reported after 12 weeks of treatment with 100 mg/day of a thiamin derivative (thiamin tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide), but review](../glossary#systematic-review) of [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of thiamin in patients with DAT found no evidence that thiamin was a useful treatment for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease [(71)](#reference71). More recently, a small uncontrolled study in five patients with mild-to-moderate AD reported cognitive improvement, measured by the Mini-Mental Status Examination, following supplementation with 300 mg/day of benfotiamine for 18 months [(72)](#reference72). In a placebo-controlled study of 70 -amyloid positive patients with either amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a [precursor](../glossary#precursor) to AD) or mild AD, those receiving 600 mg/day of benfotiamine for 12 months experienced less cognitive decline compared to placebo, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.125; [73)](#reference73). Large-scale, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to determine whether supplemental thiamin or benfotiamine might help slow progression of cognitive decline in those with Alzheimer's disease. [Huntington's disease](../glossary#huntington-disease) is an inherited [neurodegenerative disorder](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease) characterized by selective degeneration of nerve cells known as striatal spiny neurons. Symptoms, such as movement disorders and impaired [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) function, typically develop in the fourth decade of life and progressively deteriorate over time. A recent study found decreased levels of the thiamin transporter-2 (THTR-2) protein in the striatum and frontal cortex of patients with Huntington's disease compared to age-and sex-matched healthy controls [(74)](#reference74). Compared to control subjects, this study also found lower concentrations of TPP in the striatum and lower concentrations of TMP in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) of patients with thiamin for life (see [Biotin-thiamin-responsive ganglia disease](#biotin-thiamin-responsive-basal-ganglia-disease) In a mouse model of Huntington's disease, high-dose supplementation with both of these vitamins improved neuropathological and motor deficits but had no effect on lifespan (p=0.15) [(74)](#reference74). A [phase II](../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial), at moderate (600 mg/day of thiamin and 150 mg/day of biotin) and high (1,200 mg/day of thiamin and 300 mg/day of biotin) dosages, in Huntington's disease is currently underway [(75)](#reference75). Severe thiamin deficiency (wet beriberi) can lead to impaired cardiac function and ultimately [congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) (CHF). Although cardiac manifestations of beriberi are rarely encountered in industrialized countries, CHF due to other causes is common, especially in the elderly. Loop [diuretics](../glossary#diuretic) used in the treatment of CHF, notably furosemide, increase thiamin [excretion](../glossary#excretion), potentially leading to thiamin deficiency [(76, Patients with CHF might also have altered thiamin [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), including reduced absorption of thiamin in the [(78)](#reference78). A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found a 2.5 times higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of thiamin deficiency in patients with heart failure compared to control subjects [(78)](#reference78). As in the general population, older CHF patients were found to be at higher risk of thiamin deficiency than younger ones [(79)](#reference79). An important measure of cardiac function in CHF is the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which can be assessed by [echocardiography](../glossary#echocardiography). One study in 25 patients found that furosemide use at doses of 80 mg/day or greater was associated with a 98% [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of thiamin deficiency [(31)](#reference31). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) study of 30 CHF patients, all of whom had been taking furosemide (80 mg/day) for at least three months, [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) (IV) thiamin therapy (200 mg/day) for seven days resulted in an improved LVEF compared to IV [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(80)](#reference80). When all 30 of the CHF patients in that study subsequently received six weeks of oral thiamin therapy (200 mg/day), the average LVEF improved by 22%. This finding may be relevant because improvements in LVEF have been associated with improved survival in CHF patients [(81)](#reference81). However, [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) of oral thiamin supplementation in heart failure patients have not found any benefit. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 52 patients with systolic heart failure, 300 mg/day of supplemental thiamin for one month did not improve LVEF compared to placebo [(82)](#reference82). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 64 patients with heart failure reported that 200 mg/day or supplemental thiamin for six months did not improve LVEF [(83)](#reference83). Although little evidence supports the routine use of supplemental thiamin in CHF patients, trials specifically in CHF patients with marginal thiamin [status](../glossary#status) have not been done, and some suggest that it may be prudent to screen patients on long-term diuretic therapy for thiamin deficiency and treat accordingly [(84)](#reference84). Chronic [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) in individuals with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) contributes to the [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) of microvascular diseases. Diabetes-related [retina](../glossary#retina) (retinopathy), and [neuropathy](../glossary#neuropathy)). In subjects with diabetes, hyperglycemia alters the function of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) that are critical for the growth of blood vessels [(85)](#reference85). Interestingly, a higher daily intake of thiamin from the diet was correlated with more circulating EPC and with better vascular endothelial health in 88 individuals with type 2 diabetes [(86)](#reference86). An [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) has also been found between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of thiamin and the presence of soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), a marker of vascular dysfunction, in patients with diabetes [(40](#reference40), [87)](#reference87). Early markers of diabetic nephropathy include the presence of [serum](../glossary#serum) albumin in the urine, known as microalbuminuria. Administration of thiamin or benfotiamine (a thiamin derivative) prevented the development of [renal](../glossary#renal) complications in chemically-induced diabetic rats [(88)](#reference88). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study conducted in 40 patients with type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria found that high-dose thiamin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) three-month period [(87)](#reference87). Since thiamin treatment has shown promising results in cultured cells and animal models [(89-91)](#reference89), the effects of thiamin and its derivatives on vascular complications should be examined in patients with diabetes. Thiamin deficiency and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome have been observed in some [cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients with rapidly growing tumors [(92, 93)](#reference92). Research in cell culture and animal models indicates that rapidly dividing cancer cells have a high requirement for thiamin [(94)](#reference94). All rapidly dividing cells require [nucleic acids](../glossary#nucleic-acid) at an increased rate, and some cancer cells appear to rely heavily on the TPP-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), transketolase, to provide the ribose-5-phosphate necessary for nucleic acid [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). One study found that the levels of THTR-1, transketolase, and TPP [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) transporters were increased in samples of human breast cancer tissue compared to normal tissue, suggesting an adaptation in thiamin [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) in support of cancer metabolism [(95)](#reference95). Other studies have found that the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding THTR-2 is downregulated in certain cancers [(96)](#reference96). Moreover, use of the chemotherapeutic drug, 5-fluorouracil, inhibits [phosphorylation](../glossary#phosphorylation) of thiamin to thiamin thiamin deficiency [(97, 98)](#reference97). Thiamin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in cancer patients is common to prevent thiamin deficiency, but Boros et al. caution that too much thiamin may actually fuel the growth of some [malignant](../glossary#malignant) tumors [(99)](#reference99), suggesting that thiamin supplementation be reserved for those cancer patients who are actually deficient in thiamin. Presently, there is no evidence available from studies in humans to support or refute this theory. However, it would be prudent for individuals with cancer who are considering thiamin supplementation to discuss it with the clinician managing their cancer therapy. [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous), high-dose thiamin has been suggested as a treatment for cancer patients with confirmed Wernicke-Korsakoff [(93)](#reference93). Sepsis is a life-threatening critical illness caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. The widespread [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) can lead to tissue and organ damage and to death [(100)](#reference100). Because thiamin deficiency is common among septic patients [(101)](#reference101), several studies have investigated the treatment effect of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) thiamin - alone or in combination with other agents like vitamin C and hydrocortisone. [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) examining the association of intravenous thiamin as a [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) have mainly looked at its association with lactic acidosis, which commonly occurs in both thiamin deficiency and sepsis, and with mortality. One [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) in 123 septic patients and 246 matched controls found that intravenous thiamin administration within 24 hours of hospital admission was linked to improvements in both lactate clearance and 28-day mortality [(102)](#reference102). In a small retrospective study of 53 alcohol-use disorder patients presenting with septic shock, lower mortality was observed in the 34 patients who received intravenous thiamin compared to the 19 patients who did not [(103)](#reference103). A few [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have evaluated the effect of intravenous thiamin in the treatment of sepsis. A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 88 patients with sepsis and elevated blood concentrations of lactate reported that intravenous thiamin (200 mg twice daily for seven days or until discharge from the hospital) did not decrease lactate concentrations at 24 hours post initiation of treatment - the primary endpoint of the trial [(104)](#reference104). No differences between the treatment and placebo groups were found for the secondary endpoints, which included survival [(104)](#reference104). In a subsequent analysis of data from this trial, the septic patients that were given parenteral thiamin (n=31) had lower creatinine concentrations throughout the treatment and were less likely to need [renal](../glossary#renal) replacement therapy compared to placebo (n=39; [105)](#reference105). A 2020 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four studies - one observational and three randomized controlled trials - found no benefit of intravenous thiamin for improving lactate concentrations, length of hospital stay in intensive care, or overall survival [(106)](#reference106). Large-scale [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to determine whether parenteral administration of thiamin is beneficial in the treatment of sepsis. Administering thiamin in combination with vitamin C and corticosteroids may be more efficacious to treat sepsis [(107)](#reference107); some clinical trials of such treatments are currently underway (see clinicaltrials.gov/). Thiamin [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) is included in the clinical management of genetic diseases that affect the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) and [branched-chain amino acids](../glossary#branched-chain-amino-acids) efficient [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate) in affected individuals. PDHC deficiency is commonly characterized by lactic acidosis, [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) and neuromuscular degeneration, and death during childhood. The patients who respond to thiamin treatment (from a few mg/day to doses above 1,000 mg/day) exhibit PDHC deficiency due to the decreased affinity of PDHC for TPP [(108, 109)](#reference108). Although thiamin supplementation can reduce lactate accumulation and improve the clinical features in thiamin-responsive patients, it does not constitute a cure [(110)](#reference110). Inborn errors of [BCAA](../glossary#branched-chain-amino-acids) metabolism lead to thiamin-responsive branched-chain ketoaciduria, also known as maple syrup urine disease. Alterations in the BCAA [catabolic](../glossary#catabolism) pathway result in [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) dysfunction caused by the accumulation of BCAAs and their derivatives, branched-chain ketoacids (BCKA). The therapeutic approach includes a synthetic diet with reduced BCAA content, and thiamin (10-1,000 mg/day) is supplemented to subunit of the BCKDH complex [(111)](#reference111). In thiamin-responsive individuals, the supplementation has been proven effective to correct the phenotype without recourse to the BCAA restriction diet. [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) SLC19A2 [gene](../glossary#gene) impairs to thiamin-responsive [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) [(112)](#reference112). This syndrome, which is also called thiamin metabolism dysfunction syndrome-1, is characterized by megaloblastic anemia, [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), and deafness. A review of 30 cases reported additional [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic), visual, and cardiac impairments [(113)](#reference113). High-dose oral supplementation with thiamin (up to 300 mg/day) helps to maintain health and correct [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) in prepubescent children. A recent study in 32 individuals with found no additional benefit of oral doses above 150 mg/day [(114)](#reference114). After puberty, a decline in [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) function results in the requirement of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) together with thiamin to control the hyperglycemia. One study also reported that the treatment of a four-month-old girl with 100 mg/day of thiamin did not prevent hearing loss at 20 months of age [(115)](#reference115). Early diagnosis of the syndrome and early treatment with thiamin is important for a better [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) deficiency, and an [autosomal](../glossary#autosomal) [recessive](../glossary#recessive-trait) [mutation](../glossary#mutation) in the SLC19A3 [gene](../glossary#gene) that codes for THTR-2. The disease usually presents around 3 to 10 years of age [(116)](#reference116), but an early infantile form of the disease exists with onset as early as one month of age [(117)](#reference117). Clinical features include subacute [encephalopathy](../glossary#encephalopathy) (confusion, drowsiness, altered level of consciousness), [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia), and [seizures](../glossary#seizure). A [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) of 18 affected individuals from the same family or the same tribe in Saudi Arabia showed that biotin [monotherapy](../glossary#monotherapy) (5-10 mg/kg/day) efficiently abolished the clinical manifestations of the disease, although one-third of the patients suffered from recurrent acute crises. Often associated with poor outcomes, acute crises were not observed for a five-year follow-up period following thiamin supplementation (300-400 mg/day) - early diagnosis and immediate treatment with biotin and thiamin led to positive outcomes [(118)](#reference118). Recent studies have found supplemental thiamin to be important in treating the condition. In an [open-label study](../glossary#open-label-trial) of 20 pediatric patients with the disease, supplemental thiamin alone was as effective as combined biotin-thiamin supplementation when given for 30 months [(119)](#reference119). Lifelong high-dose supplementation with a combination of biotin and thiamin is generally the treatment for biotin-thiamin-responsive basal ganglia disease [(116)](#reference116). Early diagnosis and treatment is to ensure a better [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) [(117](#reference117), [120)](#reference120). [Supplemental](../glossary#supplement) thiamin has limited utility in treating other inborn errors of thiamin metabolism. [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the SLC25A19 [gene](../glossary#gene) that codes for the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) TPP transporter can result in either thiamin metabolism dysfunction syndrome-3 (THMD3) or thiamin metabolism dysfunction called Amish-type or Amish lethal microcephaly) the more severe phenotype, resulting in a congenital microcephaly, elevated concentrations of -ketoglutarate in urine, and usually death in infancy [(121)](#reference121). THMD4 is characterized by episodic encephalopathy and weakness, which often presents following a viral infection or febrile illness in childhood. Some patients affected with THMD4 may respond to high-dose thiamin supplementation [(122)](#reference122). Mutations in the TPK1 gene result pyrophosphokinase 1 deficiency and thiamin metabolism dysfunction syndrome-5 (THMD5), which usually manifests in early childhood. While the clinical presentation of THMD5 varies, affected individuals often experience episodic ataxia, dystonia, and lactic acidosis [(123)](#reference123). Only a few cases of THMD5 have been reported to date; two of these patients experienced limited improvement of symptoms upon supplementation with thiamin, in conjunction with adherence to a high-fat diet [(124)](#reference124). Humans obtain thiamin from dietary sources and from the normal [microflora](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) of the [colon](../glossary#colon), although the contribution of the latter towards the body's requirement for thiamin is not clear [(125)](#reference125). A varied diet should provide most individuals with adequate thiamin to prevent deficiency. In the US the average dietary thiamin intake for young adult men is about 2 mg/day and 1.2 mg/day for young adult women. A survey of people over the age of 60 found an average dietary thiamin intake of 1.4 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women [(37)](#reference37). However, institutionalization and poverty both increase the likelihood of inadequate thiamin intake in the elderly [(126)](#reference126). Whole-grain cereals, [legumes](../food-beverages/legumes) (e.g., beans and lentils), [nuts](../food-beverages/nuts), lean pork, and yeast are rich sources of thiamin [(1)](#references). Because most of the thiamin is lost during the production of white flour and polished (milled) rice, white rice and foods made from white flour (e.g., bread and pasta) are [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with thiamin in many Western countries. A number of thiamin-rich foods are listed in the table below, along with their thiamin content in milligrams (mg). For more information on the nutrient content of of meat is a serving about the size of a deck of cards| Thiamin is available in dietary [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and in [fortified](../glossary#fortification) foods, most commonly as thiamin hydrochloride or thiamin mononitrate [(127)](#reference127). Multivitamin supplements typically contain at least 1.2 mg of thiamin, the Daily Value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) for adults and children 4 years and older [(128)](#reference128). Benfotiamine is a synthetic, lipid-soluble [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of thiamin that is available as a dietary supplement. It has higher [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) compared to thiamin [(129)](#reference129). The Food and Nutrition Board did not set a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for thiamin because there are no well-established toxic effects from consumption of excess thiamin in food or through long-term, oral [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (up to 200 mg/day). A small number of life-threatening [anaphylactic](../glossary#anaphylaxis) reactions have been observed with large [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) doses of thiamin [(37)](#reference37). Reduced blood concentrations of thiamin have been reported in individuals with [seizure](../glossary#seizure) disorders ( [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy)) taking the [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) medication, phenytoin, for long periods of time [(130)](#reference130). 5-Fluorouracil, a drug used in [cancer](../glossary#cancer) therapy, inhibits of thiamin to TPP especially furosemide, may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of thiamin deficiency in individuals with marginal thiamin intake due to increased urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of thiamin [(29)](#reference29). Moreover, chronic alcohol abuse is associated with thiamin deficiency due to low dietary intake, impaired absorption and utilization, and increased excretion of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) [(1)](#references). Chronic alcohol feeding to rats showed a decrease in the active absorption of thiamin linked to the inhibition of thiamin membrane transporter THTR-1 in the intestinal epithelium [(132)](#reference132). Alcohol consumption in rats also decreases the levels of THTR-1 and THTR-2 in [renal](../glossary#renal) [epithelial](../glossary#epithelium) cells, thus limiting thiamin re-uptake by the kidneys [(133)](#reference133). The Linus Pauling Institute supports the recommendation by the Food and Nutrition Board of 1.2 mg/day of thiamin for men and 1.1 mg/day for women. A varied diet should provide enough thiamin for most people. Following the Linus Pauling Institute recommendation to take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement, containing 100% of the Daily Values (DV), will ensure an intake of at least 1.5 mg/day of thiamin. Presently, there is no evidence that the requirement for thiamin is increased in older adults, but some studies have found inadequate dietary intake and thiamin insufficiency to be more common in elderly populations [(126)](#reference126). Thus, it would be prudent for older adults to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement, which will generally provide at least 1.5 mg/day of thiamin.

Retinol and retinyl esters are often referred to as preformed vitamin A. Retinol can be converted by the body to retinal, which can be in turn be ] [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) to retinoic acid, the form of vitamin A known to regulate [gene](../glossary#gene) [transcription](../glossary#transcription). Retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and related compounds are known as retinoids. -Carotene and other food carotenoids that can be converted by the body into retinol are referred to as provitamin A carotenoids (see the article on [Carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids)). Hundreds of different carotenoids are [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by plants, but only about 10% of them are capable of being converted to retinol [(1)](#references). The following discussion will focus mainly on preformed vitamin A compounds and retinoic acid. Vitamin A compounds are essential fat-soluble molecules predominantly stored in the liver in the form of retinyl esters (e.g., retinyl palmitate). When appropriate, retinyl which binds to retinol binding [protein](../glossary#protein) (RBP) before being released in the bloodstream. The all-trans-retinol/RBP complex circulates bound to the protein, transthyretin, which delivers all-trans-retinol to peripheral tissues (reviewed in [2](#reference2)). Vitamin A as retinyl esters in chylomicrons was also found to have an appreciable role in delivering vitamin A to extrahepatic tissues, especially in early life [(3, 4)](#reference3). Located at the back of the eye, the [retina](../glossary#retina) contains two main types of light-sensitive [receptor](../glossary#receptor) cells known as rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Photons (particles of light) that pass through the [lens](../glossary#lens) are sensed by the photoreceptor cells of the retina and converted to [nerve impulses](../glossary#nerve-impulse) (electric signals) for interpretation by the brain. All-trans-retinol is transported to the retina via the circulation and accumulates in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (Figure 2) [(5)](#reference5). Here, all-trans-retinol is esterified to form a retinyl ester, which can be stored. When needed, retinyl esters are broken apart ( [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis)) and isomerized to 11-cis-retinol, which can be [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) to form 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-retinal can be shuttled across the interphotoreceptor space to the rod photoreceptor cell that is specialized for vision in low-light conditions and for detection of motion. In rod cells, 11-cis-retinal binds to a [protein](../glossary#protein) called opsin to form the visual pigment rhodopsin (also known as visual purple). Absorption of a photon of light [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the isomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal that is released from the opsin molecule. This photoisomerization triggers a cascade of events, leading to the generation of a nerve impulse conveyed by the optic nerve to the brain's visual cortex. All-trans-retinal is converted to all-trans-retinol and transported across the interstitial space to the RPE cells, thereby completing the visual cycle. A similar cycle occurs in cone cells that contain red, green, or blue opsin proteins required for the absorption of photons from the visible light spectrum [(2)](#reference2). Vitamin A is also essential for mammalian eye development [(6)](#reference6). Thus, because vitamin A is required for the normal functioning of the retina, dim-light vision, and color vision, inadequate retinol and retinal available to the retina result in impaired dark adaptation. In the severest cases of vitamin A deficiency, thinning and ulceration of the cornea leads to blindness (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). In cells, all-trans-retinol can be either stored (in the form of retinyl ester) or [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) to all-trans-retinal by alcohol dehydrogenases. retinaldehyde dehydrogenases can [catalyze](../glossary#catalyze) the conversion of retinoic as to [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) and thereby influence numerous physiological processes. All-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA are transported to the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) of the cell bound to cellular retinoic acid-binding [proteins](../glossary#protein) (CRABP). Within the nucleus, RA isomers bind specific nuclear [receptor](../glossary#receptor) proteins that are [ligand](../glossary#ligand)-dependent [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor) (Figure 3). Both all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA can bind to retinoic acid receptors (RAR, RAR, and RAR), whereas only 9-cis-RA binds to retinoid X receptors (RXR, RXR, and RXR) [(7)](#reference7). RAR and RXR subtypes form either complexes of two of the same protein (RAR/RAR and RXR/RXR [homodimers](../glossary#homodimer)) or complexes of two different proteins (RAR/RXR [heterodimers](../glossary#heterodimer)). RAR/RXR heterodimers can bind to a regulatory [DNA](../glossary#DNA) sequence called retinoic acid response element (RARE) located within the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of retinoid-responsive [genes](../glossary#gene). The [transcriptional](../glossary#transcription) activity of RAR/RXR heterodimers appears to be mainly driven by the binding of all-trans-RA to RAR. The activation of RAR by RA binding triggers the recruitment of transcriptional coregulators to target promoters, thereby inhibiting or allowing the transcription of genes [(8)](#reference8). RXR also forms heterodimers with several other nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone receptor (TR), [vitamin D](vitamin-D) receptor (VDR), [steroid](../glossary#steroid) receptors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) [(9)](#reference9). In this way, vitamin A may interact with thyroid hormone, vitamin D, steroids (e.g., estrogen), or PPAR ligands [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) pathways and influence the transcription of a broad range of genes. There is also evidence that RA/RAR can affect gene expression in a RARE-independent manner. For example, it was reported that RAR could interfere with TGF/Smad signaling pathway through direct interaction of RAR with the heterodimeric transcription factor, Smad3/Smad4. In the absence of RA, RAR was found to act as a coactivator of Smad3/Smad4-mediated transcription, while RAR agonists repressed the transcriptional activity of Smad3/Smad4 [(10)](#reference10). In retinoblastoma cells, RAR was also involved in RA-induced activation of signaling cascades mediated by tyrosine kinases known as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and leading to [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) [(11, 12)](#reference11). RA also appeared to induce [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) differentiation by activating ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathway that [phosphorylated](../glossary#phosphorylation) transcription factor, CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding protein). Phosphorylated CREB can subsequently bind to the CREB response element in the promoter of genes involved in cell differentiation [(13)](#reference13). Also, independently of RAR, RA was found to inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation and subsequent AP1-mediated expression of interleukin-6 in synovial cells [(14)](#reference14). Hence, RA can influence the expression of genes whose promoters do not contain RARE. By regulating the expression of over 500 retinoid-responsive genes (including several genes involved in vitamin A [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) itself), retinoic acid isomers play major roles in cellular [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and differentiation (i.e., cell commitment to highly specialized functions). In the eye and tissues like white [adipose](../glossary#adipose) and muscle, [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) retinol esterification and to maintain an inward concentration gradient of retinol [(15)](#reference15). Interestingly, retinol uptake by STRA6 was found to trigger the activation of a [signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) cascade mediated by tyrosine kinases known as Janus kinases (JAK) and associated [transcription factors](../glossary#transcription-factor) (STAT). JAK/STAT signaling pathway regulates the expression of a wide range of [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine), [hormones](../glossary#hormone), and growth factors [(16)](#reference16). Animal studies have reported that an increased [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of [genes](../glossary#gene), such as SOCS3 by the JAK/STAT pathway, could result in the inhibition of [insulin](../glossary#insulin) signaling. Hence, obese mice lacking LRAT or be protected from retinol/STRA6-induced [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) [(17, 18)](#reference17). Apart from its role as a [ligand](../glossary#ligand) for opsin in the visual cascade (see [Visual system and eyesight](#visual-system)), retinal has been specifically implicated in the regulation of [genes](../glossary#gene) important for [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). In humans, two types of [adipose tissue](../glossary#adipose) have been distinguished based on their respective functions: white adipose tissue (WAT) stores [fatty acids](../glossary#fatty-acid) as [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) [oxidizes](../glossary#oxidation) to generate heat (thermogenesis). In the [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) [respiratory chain](../glossary#electron-transport-chain) of brown adipose cells, the processes of electron transport and [ATP](../glossary#ATP) production are uncoupled (dissociated) to permit the rapid production of heat from fatty acid oxidation [(19)](#reference19). Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (RALDH1), which converts retinal to retinoic acid, is highly expressed in WAT but not in BAT. The suppression of RALDH1 expression in WAT can induce a thermogenic phenotype resembling that of BAT [(20)](#reference20). During adipocyte differentiation, the stimulation of cells with all-trans retinal has been found to activate the UCP1 gene required for thermogenesis while inhibiting genes promoting adipogenesis, such as PPAR [(20)](#reference20). Retinal also appeared to regulate lipid metabolism and adiposity in bone marrow by inhibiting PPAR/RXR [heterodimer](../glossary#heterodimer)-mediated [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) [(21)](#reference21). In addition, retinal was found to inhibit [gluconeogenic](../glossary#gluconeogenesis) gene expression and [glucose](../glossary#glucose) production in the liver of mice deficient in RALDH1 [(22)](#reference22). Vitamin A was initially coined \"the anti-infective [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin)\" because of its importance in the normal functioning of the immune system [(23)](#reference23). The skin and mucosal cells, lining the airways, digestive tract, and urinary tract function as a barrier and form the body's first line of defense against infection. Retinoic acid (RA) is produced by [antigen](../glossary#antigen)-presenting cells (APCs), including [macrophages](../glossary#macrophage) and [dendritic cells](../glossary#dendritic-cell), found in these mucosal interfaces and associated lymph nodes. RA appears to act on dendritic cells themselves to regulate their [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation), migration, and antigen-presenting capacity. In addition, the production of RA by APCs is required for the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4 T- [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) into induced regulatory T- lymphocytes (Tregs). Critical to the maintenance of mucosal integrity, the differentiation of Tregs is driven by all-trans-RA through RAR-mediated regulation of [gene (see [Regulation of gene expression](#gene-expression-regulation)). Also, during [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), signaling pathway the conversion of na\u00efve into effector T-lymphocytes type 1 helper T-cells (Th1) (rather than into Tregs) and induces the production of proinflammatory [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine) by effector T-lymphocytes in response to infection. There is also substantial evidence to suggest that RA may help prevent the development of autoimmunity (reviewed in [24](#reference24)). Both vitamin A excess and deficiency are known to cause birth defects. Retinoid signaling begins soon after the early phase of embryonic development known as gastrulation. During fetal development, RA is critical for the development of organs, including the heart, eyes, ears, lungs, as well as other limbs and visceral organs. Vitamin A has been implicated in fetal lung maturation [(2)](#reference2). Vitamin A status is lower in preterm newborns than in full-term infants [(25)](#reference25). There is some evidence to suggest that vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplmentation) may help reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease and mortality in preterm newborns (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). Retinoid signaling is also involved in the expression of many [proteins](../glossary#protein) of the extracellular matrix (ECM; material surrounding cells), including [collagen](../glossary#collagen), laminin, and [proteoglycans](../glossary#proteoglycan) [(26)](#reference26). Vitamin A deficiency may then result in alterations of the ECM composition, thus disrupting organ morphology and function (reviewed in [26](#reference26)). Red blood cells ( [erythrocytes](../glossary#erythrocyte)), like all blood cells, are derived from pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow. Studies involving [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) culture systems have suggested a role for retinoids in stem cell commitment and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) to the red blood cell lineage. Retinoids might also regulate [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) (programmed cell death) of red blood cell [precursors](../glossary#precursor) (erythropoietic cells) [(27)](#reference27). However, whether retinoids regulate erythropoiesis vivo](../glossary#in-vivo) has not been established. Yet, vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in vitamin A deficient-individuals has been shown to increase [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) concentrations. Additionally, vitamin A appears to facilitate the mobilization of [iron](../minerals/iron) from storage sites to the developing red blood cell for incorporation into hemoglobin, the oxygen carrier in red blood cells [(27, 28)](#reference27). [Zinc](../minerals/zinc) deficiency is thought to interfere with vitamin A [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) in several ways [(29)](#reference29): (1) zinc deficiency results in decreased [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of retinol-binding protein (RBP), which transports retinol through the circulation to peripheral tissues and protects the organism against potential toxicity of retinol; (2) zinc deficiency results in decreased activity of the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that releases retinol from its storage form, retinyl palmitate, in the liver; and (3) zinc is required for the enzyme that converts retinol into retinal [(30)](#reference30). The health consequences of zinc deficiency on vitamin A nutritional status in humans are yet to be defined [(29)](#reference29). Vitamin A deficiency often coexists with [iron](../minerals/iron) deficiency and may exacerbate iron deficiency [anemia](../glossary#anemia) by altering iron [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) [(27)](#reference27). Vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) has beneficial effects on iron deficiency anemia and improves iron nutritional status among children and pregnant women [(27, 28)](#reference27). The combination of supplemental vitamin A and iron seems to reduce anemia more effectively than either supplemental iron or vitamin A alone [(31)](#reference31). Moreover, studies in rats have shown that iron deficiency alters [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and liver levels of vitamin A [(32, 33)](#reference32). Vitamin A deficiency usually results from inadequate intakes of vitamin A from animal products (as preformed vitamin A) and fruit and vegetables (as provitamin A carotenoids). In developing countries, vitamin A deficiency and associated disorders predominantly affect children and women of reproductive age. Other individuals at [risk](../glossary#risk) of vitamin A deficiency are those with poor absorption of [lipids](../glossary#lipid) due to impaired [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) or [biliary](../glossary#bile) secretion and those and [celiac disease](../glossary#celiac-disease) A deficiency is often defined by serum retinol concentrations lower than 0.70 mol/L (20 g/dL). In severe vitamin A deficiency, vitamin A body stores are depleted and serum retinol concentrations fall below 0.35 mol/L (10 g/dL). Other [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) have been calibrated to assess vitamin A nutritional status (reviewed in [34](#reference34)). Of note, the World Health Organization considers vitamin A deficiency a public health problem when the prevalence of low serum retinol (<0.70 mol/L) reaches 15% or more of a defined population. With an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 children becoming blind annually, vitamin A deficiency constitutes the leading preventable cause of blindness in low- and middle-income nations [(35)](#reference35). The earliest symptom of vitamin A deficiency is impaired dark adaptation known as night blindness or nyctalopia. The next clinical stage is the occurrence of abnormal changes in the conjunctiva (corner of the eye), manifested by the presence of Bitot's spots. Severe or prolonged vitamin A deficiency eventually results in a condition called xerophthalmia (Greek for dry eye), characterized by changes in the cells of the cornea (clear covering of the eye) that ultimately result in corneal ulcers, scarring, and blindness [(36)](#reference36). Immediate administration of 200,000 international units (IU) of vitamin A for two consecutive days is required to prevent blinding xerophthalmia [(36)](#reference36). There is an estimated 19.1 million pregnant women worldwide (especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America) with vitamin A deficiency and over half of them are affected by night blindness [(37)](#reference37). The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and night blindness is especially high during the third trimester of pregnancy due to accelerated fetal growth. Also, approximately 190 million preschool-age children have low [serum](../glossary#serum) retinol concentrations (<0.70 mol/L), with 5.2 million suffering from night blindness. Moreover, half of the children affected by severe vitamin A deficiency-induced blinding xerophthalmia are estimated to die within a year of becoming blind [(37)](#reference37). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) promote vitamin A supplementation as a public health intervention to reduce child mortality in areas and populations where vitamin A deficiency is [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) [(38-40)](#reference38). Infectious diseases have been associated with depletion of vitamin A [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) reserves (already limited in vitamin A-deficient subjects), reduced [serum](../glossary#serum) retinol concentrations, and increased loss of vitamin A in the urine [(37)](#reference37). Infection with the measles virus was found to precipitate conjunctival and [corneal](../glossary#cornea) damage, leading to blindness in children with poor vitamin A status [(41)](#reference41). Conversely, vitamin A deficiency can be considered a nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency disease [(42)](#reference42). Even children who are only mildly deficient in vitamin A have a higher incidence of respiratory complications and diarrhea, as well as a higher rate of mortality from measles infection compared to children consuming sufficient vitamin A [(43)](#reference43). Because vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may decrease both the severity and incidence of measles complications in developing countries (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)), WHO recommends that children aged at least one year receive 200,000 IU of vitamin A (60 mg RAE) for two consecutive days in addition to standard treatment when they are infected with measles virus and live in areas of vitamin A deficiency [(44)](#reference44). A recent [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), conducted in 2,774 Colombian children (ages, 5-12 years old) followed for a median 128 days, also reported an inverse relationship between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) retinol concentrations and rates of diarrhea with vomiting and cough with fever, the latter being a strong predictor of influenza infection (flu) [(45)](#reference45). A review of five [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies that included 7,528 [HIV](../glossary#HIV)-positive pregnant or breast-feeding women found no substantial benefit of vitamin A supplementation in reducing the mother-to-child transmission of HIV [(46)](#reference46). One early [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) found that HIV-infected women who were vitamin A deficient were three to four times more likely to transmit HIV to their infants [(47)](#reference47). Yet, no trial to date has provided any information on potential adverse effects of vitamin A supplementation on mother-to-child HIV transmission [(48)](#reference48). In North and West Africa, vitamin A deficiency and [iodine](../minerals/iodine) deficiency induced- [goiter](../glossary#goiter) can coexist in up to 50% of children. The response to iodine [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) in iodine-deficient populations appears to depend on various nutritional factors, including vitamin A status [(49, 50)](#reference49). Vitamin A deficiency in animal models was found to interfere with the [pituitary](../glossary#pituitary-gland)- [thyroid](../glossary#thyroid) axis by (1) increasing the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) thyroid-stimulating [hormone](../glossary#hormone) (TSH) by the pituitary gland, (2) increasing the size of the thyroid gland, (3) reducing iodine uptake by the thyroid gland and impairing the synthesis and iodination of thyroglobulin, and (4) increasing circulating concentrations of thyroid hormones (reviewed in [51](#reference51)). A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 138 children with concurrent vitamin A and iodine deficiencies found that the severity of vitamin A deficiency was associated with higher [risk](../glossary#risk) of goiter and higher concentrations of circulating TSH and thyroid hormones [(50)](#reference50). These children received iodine-enriched salt with either vitamin A (200,000 IU at baseline and 5 months) or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), 10-month trial. This vitamin A supplementation significantly decreased TSH concentration and thyroid volume compared to placebo [(50)](#reference50). In another trial, supplementation of vitamin A to iodine-deficient children had no additional effect to iodine on thyroid status compared to placebo, but vitamin A supplementation alone (without iodine) reduced the volume of the thyroid gland, as well as TSH and thyroglobulin concentrations [(52)](#reference52). Phrynoderma or follicular hyperkeratosis is a skin condition characterized by an excessive production of keratin in hair follicles. The lesions first appear on the extremities, shoulders, and buttocks and may spread over the entire body in the severest cases [(53)](#reference53). While vitamin A deficiency may contribute to the occurrence of phrynoderma, the condition has been strongly associated with multiple nutritional deficiencies and is considered a sign of general malnutrition. A rare case of esophagitis ( [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the [esophagus](../glossary#esophagus)) has recently been attributed to hyperkeratosis secondary to vitamin A deficiency [(54)](#reference54). Also, vitamin A deficiency affects [iron](../minerals/iron) mobilization, impairs [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), and precipitates iron deficiency anemia that is only alleviated with [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) of both vitamin A and iron (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)) [(27)](#reference27). Vitamin A can be obtained from food as preformed vitamin A in animal products or as provitamin A carotenoids in fruit and vegetables (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). Yet, while preformed vitamin A is effectively absorbed, stored, and [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) to form retinol, provitamin A [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids) like -carotene are less easily digested and absorbed, and must be converted to retinol and other retinoids by the body after uptake into the small intestine. The efficiency of conversion of provitamin A carotenes into retinol is highly variable, depending on factors such as food matrix, food preparation, and one's digestive and absorptive capacities [(55)](#reference55). The most recent international standard of measure for vitamin A is retinol activity equivalents (RAE), which represent vitamin A activity as retinol. It has been determined that 2 micrograms (g) of -carotene in oil provided as a [supplement](../glossary#supplement) could be converted by the body to 1 g of retinol giving it an RAE ratio of 2:1. However, 12 g of -carotene from food are required to provide the body with 1 g of retinol, giving dietary -carotene an RAE ratio of 12:1. Other provitamin A carotenoids in food are less easily absorbed than -carotene, resulting in RAE ratios of 24:1. RAE ratios are shown in Table 1 [(56)](#reference56). |Quantity Consumed||Quantity Bioconverted to Retinol||RAE Ratio| |1 supplemental vitamin A||1 g of retinol*||1:1| |2 g of supplemental -carotene||1 g of retinol||2:1| |12 g of dietary -carotene||1 g of retinol||12:1| |24 g of dietary -carotene||1 g of retinol||24:1| of dietary -cryptoxanthin||1 g of retinol||24:1| |*1 IU is equivalent to 0.3 microgram (g) of retinol, and 1 g of retinol is equivalent to 3.33 IU of retinol.| The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin A was revised by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2001. The RDA is based on the Estimated Average Requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)), which is defined as the biological requirement for 50% of the population. The RDA is the recommended intake needed by nearly all of the population to ensure adequate [hepatic](../glossary#hepatic) stores of vitamin A in the body (20 g/g for four months if the person consumes a vitamin A-deficient diet) to support normal reproductive function, immune function, [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), and vision (for details of calculations, see [56](#reference56)). Table 2 lists the RDA values in micrograms (g) of Retinol Activity Equivalents (RAE) months|| 400 ( | Preterm infants are born with inadequate body stores of vitamin A, placing them at [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing diseases of the eye and the respiratory and [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) tracts. About one-third of preterm infants born between 22 and 28 weeks of gestation develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease that can be fatal or result in life-long morbidities in survivors. A few [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have investigated the effect of postnatal vitamin A supplementation on the incidence of BPD and the risk of mortality in very low birth weight infants (1,500 g) requiring respiratory support [(57-59)](#reference57). In the largest, multicenter, randomized, blinded, [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial that enrolled 807 extremely low birth weight (ELBW; 1,000 g) preterm newborns, the intramuscular administration of 5,000 IU of vitamin A three times a week for four weeks significantly, though modestly, reduced the risk of BPD or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (gestational age plus chronological age) [(58)](#reference58). While vitamin A supplementation was included in some neonatal programs after this trial [(60)](#reference60), a national shortage in vitamin A supply that has affected US neonatal intensive care units since 2010 has led to a significant reduction in the use of vitamin A supplementation in premature newborns (401-1,000 g at birth) with respiratory failure [(61, 62)](#reference61). However, a [retrospective analysis](../glossary#retrospective-study) of US nationwide data from 6,210 preterm infants born between 2010 and 2012 found that a reduction in vitamin A [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) from 27.2% to 2.1% during the same period had no significant impact on the incidence of BPD or death before hospital discharge [(62)](#reference62). In another retrospective study, the nonrandomized use of vitamin A supplementation with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) was found to result in a lower incidence of BPD (but not mortality) compared to iNO therapy alone in preterm newborns with a birth weight of 750-999 g [(63)](#reference63). Neurodevelopment index scores at one year of age were also improved in the vitamin A group of newborns weighing 500-749 g at birth. Yet, caution is advised with the interpretation of the results, especially because the trial was not designed to assess the effect of vitamin A. In Germany, one large, multicenter, randomized study - the NeoVitaA trial - is under way to explore the effect of high-dose oral vitamin A (5,000 IU/kg/day) for 28 days on the incidence of BPD and mortality at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age [(64)](#reference64). While high doses of vitamin A during early pregnancy can cause birth defects (see [Safety](#safety)), vitamin A supplementation during late pregnancy may improve maternal and fetal vitamin A status [(65)](#reference65). Although a few randomized controlled trials have failed to show an effect on maternal and neonatal mortality [(66)](#reference66), more research is required to assess whether vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy reduces BPD incidence in infants. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) evaluating the preventive effect of vitamin A on childhood mortality indicated that vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) (200,000 IU every 4 or 6 months) reduced all-cause mortality by 25% (13 studies) and diarrhea-specific mortality by 30% (7 studies) in children aged 6 to 59 months. However, vitamin A administration in this age group had no preventive effect on rates of [pneumonia](../glossary#pneumonia)-specific mortality (7 studies), measles-specific mortality (5 studies), or meningitis-specific mortality (3 studies). Moreover, no reduction in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of disease-specific mortality was found in neonates (0 to 28 days of age) and infants 1 to 6 months of age supplemented with vitamin A [(67)](#reference67). Another meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found no evidence of a reduction in mortality risk during infancy when either breast-feeding mothers (7 studies) or infants aged less than six months (9 studies) were supplemented with vitamin A [(68)](#reference68). Current WHO policy recommends vitamin A supplementation at routine vaccination contacts in children after six months of age living in regions at high risk of vitamin A deficiency. Supplementation with high doses of vitamin A 100,000 IU (30 mg RAE) for infants 6 to 11 months of age and 200,000 IU (60 mg RAE) for children 12 to 59 months of age is thought to provide adequate protection for up to six months [(38)](#reference38). A recent placebo-controlled trial in Guinea-Bissau, which randomized 7,587 children (ages, 6 to 23 months old) to receive vitamin A supplementation at one vaccination contact, evaluated the co-administration of vitamin A and vaccines on child mortality [(69)](#reference69). The study found that vitamin A supplementation had no effect on overall mortality rates, although a six-month follow-up of infants given both measles and DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccinations showed a significant reduction in mortality in girls, but not in boys [(69)](#reference69). Although neonatal vitamin A supplementation is not currently recommended, a trial assessing the benefit of early measles vaccination at 4.5 rather than the usual 9 months of age found no reduction in mortality rates when children had received neonatal vitamin A supplementation [(70)](#reference70). The recent pooled analysis of previous trials of vitamin A supplementation (VITA I-III) in Guinea-Bissau confirmed that vitamin A supplementation may interfere with vaccines. Specifically, compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo), neonatal vitamin A supplementation was associated with a significant increase in mortality rates in boys (but not in girls) when children had received measles virus vaccination at 4.5 months of age rather than the usual 9 months of age [(71)](#reference71). The timing of vitamin A interventions needs to be further examined in relation to the timing of vaccinations in order to maximize their benefits. An earlier [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) examining specifically the role of vitamin A supplementation in 2,069 children with measles found no overall reduction on the [risk](../glossary#risk) of mortality [(72)](#reference72). Yet, the pooled analysis of four studies that reported the age distribution of participants found an 83% lower risk of mortality with two doses of 200,000 IU of vitamin A in children younger than two years. In addition, the pooled analysis of three studies indicated a 67% reduction in the risk of [pneumonia](../glossary#pneumonia)-led mortality [(72)](#reference72). Similar to WHO and UNICEF guidelines, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vitamin A supplementation for children over six months of age when they are infected with measles while malnourished, immunodeficient, or are at risk of measles complications or vitamin A deficiency disorders [(73)](#reference73). Although measles infection has been associated with vitamin A deficiency and blindness, there is currently no evidence to suggest that vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk of blindness in children infected with measles [(74)](#reference74). Studies in cell culture and animal models have documented the capacity for natural and synthetic retinoids to reduce [carcinogenesis](../glossary#carcinogenesis) significantly in skin, breast, liver, [colon](../glossary#colon), [prostate](../glossary#prostate), and other sites. However, the results of human studies examining the relationship between the consumption of preformed vitamin A and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) do not currently suggest that consuming vitamin A at intakes greater than the RDA benefit in the prevention of cancer [(2)](#reference2). The results of the -Carotene And Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) have suggested that high-dose supplementation of preformed vitamin A and -carotene should be avoided in people at high [risk](../glossary#risk) for lung [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(75)](#reference75). In the CARET study, about 9,000 people (smokers and people with asbestos exposure) were assigned a daily regimen of 25,000 IU (7,500 g RAE) of retinyl palmitate and 30 mg of -carotene, while a similar number of people were assigned a [placebo](../glossary#placebo). After four years of follow-up, the incidence of lung cancer was 28% higher in the [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) group compared to the placebo group; however, the incidence was not different six years after the intervention ended [(76)](#reference76). A possible explanation for an increase in lung cancer is that the [oxidative](../glossary#oxidation) environment of the lung, created by smoke or asbestos exposure, could give rise to unusual [carotenoid](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids) cleavage products, which might promote [carcinogenesis](../glossary#carcinogenesis) [(77)](#reference77). Interestingly, a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) that included 749 lung cancer cases and 679 controls from the CARET trial found a significant association between lung cancer risk reduction and high [vitamin D](vitamin-D) intakes (400 IU/day) in individuals who received the active CARET supplements or in those with vitamin A intakes equal to or greater than 1,500 g RAE/day [(78)](#reference78). Further, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including a total of 202,924 participants at low risk of lung cancer, indicated that supplementation with retinol and/or -carotene had no significant effect on lung cancer incidence [(79)](#reference79). At present, it seems unlikely that increased intake of preformed vitamin A (e.g., retinol) could lower the risk of lung cancer. Retinoids may be used at [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) to treat several conditions, including, acute promyelocytic [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia), retinitis pigmentosa, and various skin diseases. It is important to note that treatment with high doses of natural or synthetic retinoids overrides the body's own control mechanisms; therefore, retinoid therapies are associated with potential side effects and toxicities. Additionally, all of the retinoid compounds have been found to cause fetal deformations. Thus, women who have a chance of becoming pregnant should avoid treatment with these medications. Retinoids tend to be very long acting: side effects and birth defects have been reported to occur months after discontinuing retinoid therapy [(2)](#reference2). The retinoids discussed below are prescription drugs and should not be used without medical supervision. Normal [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) of myeloid stem cells in the bone marrow gives rise to [platelets](../glossary#platelet), red blood cells, and white blood cells (also called [leukocytes](../glossary#leukocyte)) that are important for the immune response. Altered differentiation of myeloid cells can result in the [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) of immature white blood cells, giving rise to [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia). Reciprocal [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) translocations involving the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) [gene](../glossary#gene) and the gene coding for retinoic acid [receptor](../glossary#receptor) (RAR) lead to a specific type of leukemia called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The fusion protein PML/RAR represses [transcription](../glossary#transcription) by binding to RARE in the [promoter](../glossary#promoter) of retinoid-responsive genes involved in hematopoietic cell differentiation. Gene repression by PML/RAR is achieved by the recruitment of several [histone](../glossary#histone) receptor, PML/RAR appears to be insensitive to physiological concentrations of retinoic acid (RA) such that only treatments with high doses of all-trans-RA can restore normal differentiation and lead to significant improvements and complete remission in some APL patients [(80)](#reference80). More information on APL treatment programs can be found in the [National Cancer Institute website](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/childAML/HealthProfessional/page6). Both natural and synthetic retinoids have been used as pharmacologic agents to treat disorders of the skin. Acitretin is a synthetic retinoid that has been proven useful in combination treatments for [psoriasis](../glossary#psoriasis) [(81)](#reference81). [Topical](../glossary#topical) tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) and oral isotretinoin vulgaris](../glossary#acne-vulgaris) [(82, 83)](#reference82). [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) of skin [epithelial](../glossary#epithelium) cells, as well as the production of [sebum](../glossary#sebum). Use of [pharmacological doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of retinoids (especially oral isotretinoin) by pregnant women causes birth defects and is therefore contraindicated prior to and during pregnancy (see [Safety in pregnancy](#safety-pregnancy)). For more information on the use of retinoids in the management of acne, see the article on [Vitamin A and Skin Health](../micronutrients-health/skin-health/nutrient-index/vitamin-A). Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affects approximately 1.5 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of inherited blindness. RP describes a broad spectrum of genetic disorders that result in the progressive loss of photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) in the [retina](../glossary#retina) of the eye [(84)](#reference84). While at least 45 loci have been associated with RP, [mutations](../glossary#mutation) in the rhodopsin [gene](../glossary#gene) (RHO), the usherin gene (USH2A), and the RP GTPase regulator gene (RPGR) account for about 30% of all RP cases [(85)](#reference85). Early symptoms of RP include impaired dark adaptation and night blindness, followed by the progressive loss of peripheral and central vision over time [(85)](#reference85). The results of only one [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 601 patients with common forms of RP indicated that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 15,000 IU/day of retinyl palmitate (4,500 g RAE) significantly slowed the loss of retinal function over a period of four to six years [(86)](#reference86). In contrast, supplementation with 400 IU/day of vitamin E (dl--tocopherol) modestly but significantly increased the loss of retinal function, suggesting that patients with common forms of RP may benefit from long-term vitamin A supplementation but should avoid high-dose vitamin E supplementation. Up to 12 years of follow-up in these patients did not reveal any signs of liver toxicity as a result of excess vitamin A intake [(87)](#reference87). Because neither children younger than 18 years nor adults affected by less common forms of RP were included in the trial, no formal recommendation about vitamins A and E could be made [(85)](#reference85). High-dose vitamin A supplementation to slow the course of RP requires medical supervision and must be discontinued if there is a possibility of pregnancy (see [Safety](#safety)). Free retinol is not generally found in food. Retinyl esters (including retinyl palmitate) are the storage form of retinol in animals and thus the main [precursors](../glossary#precursor) of retinol in food from animals. Plants contain [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids), some of which are precursors for vitamin A (e.g., -carotene, -carotene, and -cryptoxanthin). Yellow- and orange-colored vegetables contain significant quantities of carotenoids. Green vegetables also contain carotenoids, though yellow-to-red pigments are masked by the green pigment of chlorophyll [(1)](#references). The table below lists a number of good food sources of vitamin A, including fruit and vegetables, along with their vitamin A content. The retinol activity is indicated in micrograms of retinol activity equivalents (g RAE). For information on this unit of measurement, see the section on [RAE](#RAE). In addition, use [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) to check foods for their content of carotenoids without vitamin A activity, such as lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. Vitamin A may still be listed on food and supplement labels in international units versus as g RAE ('mcg' on labels). [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) also provides the vitamin A content of food sources using the vitamin A international unit (IU). Yet, contrary to RAE, the number of IUs of vitamin A does not reflect the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of vitamin A from different food sources. Conversion rates between IUs and g RAE are set as follows: 1 IU of retinol is equivalent to 0.3 g RAE 1 IU of supplemental -carotene is equivalent to 0.3 g RAE 1 IU of dietary -carotene is equivalent to 0.05 g RAE 1 IU of -carotene or -cryptoxanthin to 0.025 g RAE Thus, in Table 3, the number of IUs of vitamin A in carotenoid-containing food (numbers in italics) can be obtained by multiplying the RAE by approximately 20. |Food||Serving||Preformed Vitamin A (Retinol), g||Vitamin A, g cup (8 milk (vitamin intake level ( | The principal forms of preformed vitamin A in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) are retinyl palmitate and retinyl acetate. -Carotene is also a common source of vitamin A in supplements, and many supplements provide a combination of retinol and -carotene [(88)](#reference88). If a percentage of the total vitamin A content of a supplement comes from -carotene, this information is included in the Supplement Facts label under vitamin A (Figure 4). Some multivitamin supplements available in the US provide up to 5,000 IU of preformed vitamin A, corresponding to 1,500 g RAE, which is substantially more than the current [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin A. This is due to the fact that the Daily Values (DV) used by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for supplement labeling are based on the RDA established in 1968 rather than the most recent RDA, and multivitamin supplements typically provide 100% of the DV for most nutrients. Because retinol intakes of 5,000 IU/day (1,500 g RAE) may be associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) in older adults (see [Safety](#safety)), some companies have reduced the retinol content in their multivitamin supplements to 2,500 IU (750 g RAE). The condition caused by vitamin A toxicity is called hypervitaminosis A. It is caused by overconsumption of preformed vitamin A, not [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids). Preformed vitamin A is rapidly absorbed and slowly cleared from the body. Therefore, toxicity from preformed vitamin A may result acutely from high-dose exposure over a short period of time or chronically from a much lower intake [(2)](#reference2). Acute vitamin A toxicity is relatively rare, and symptoms include nausea, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, dizziness, dry skin, desquamation, and [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) [edema](../glossary#edema). Signs of chronic toxicity include dry itchy skin, desquamation, anorexia, weight loss, headache, cerebral edema, enlarged liver, enlarged spleen, [anemia](../glossary#anemia), and bone and joint pain. Also, symptoms of vitamin A toxicity in infants include bulging fontanels. Severe cases of hypervitaminosis A may result in liver damage, [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage), and coma. Generally, signs of toxicity are associated with long-term consumption of vitamin A in excess of 10 times the RDA (8,000-10,000 g RAE/day or 25,000-33,000 IU/day). However, more research is necessary to determine if [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) vitamin A toxicity is a concern in certain populations [(89)](#reference89). There is evidence that some populations may be more susceptible to toxicity at lower doses, including the elderly, chronic alcohol users, and some people with a genetic predisposition to high [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) [(90)](#reference90). In January 2001, the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) of vitamin A intake for adults at 3,000 g RAE (10,000 IU)/day of of preformed vitamin A is equivalent to 0.3 g RAE, and 1 g RAE is equivalent to 3.33 IU of preformed vitamin A| Although normal fetal development requires sufficient vitamin A intake, consumption of excess preformed vitamin A (such as retinol) during early pregnancy is known to cause birth defects. No increase in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of vitamin A-associated birth defects has been observed at doses of preformed vitamin A from [supplements](../glossary#supplement) below 3,000 g RAE/day (10,000 IU/day) [(56)](#reference56). Of note, in 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended vitamin A supplementation (up to 3,000 g RAE/day or 7,500 g RAE/week) during pregnancy in areas with high [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin A deficiency for the prevention of blindness [(91)](#reference91). In industrialized countries, pregnant or potentially pregnant women should monitor their intake of vitamin A from [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food and food naturally high in preformed vitamin A (e.g., liver) and avoid taking daily multivitamin supplements that contain more than 1,500 g RAE (5,000 IU) of vitamin A. There is no evidence that consumption of vitamin A from -carotene might increase the risk of birth defects. The synthetic derivative of retinol, isotretinoin, is known to cause serious birth defects and should not be taken during pregnancy or if there is a possibility of becoming pregnant [(82)](#reference82). Tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid), another retinol derivative, is prescribed as a topical preparation that is applied to the skin. Although percutaneous absorption of [topical](../glossary#topical) tretinoin is minimal, its use during pregnancy is not recommended [(92)](#reference92). Results from some [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have suggested that long-term intakes of preformed vitamin A in excess of 1,500 g RAE/day (equivalent to 5,000 IU/day of vitamin A as retinol) were associated with reduced [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporotic](../glossary#osteoporosis) [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in older adults [(93-95)](#reference93). However, other investigators failed to observe such detrimental effects on BMD and/or fracture risk [(96-98)](#reference96). The recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four prospective studies, including nearly 183,000 participants over 40 years of age, found that highest vs. lowest [quintiles](../glossary#quintile) of retinol (preformed vitamin A) intake significantly increased the risk of hip fracture [(99)](#reference99). Only excess intakes of retinol, not -carotene, were associated with adverse effects on bone health. Besides, the pooled analysis of four observational studies also indicated that a U-shaped relationship between circulating retinol and risk of hip fracture, suggesting that both elevated and reduced retinol concentrations in the blood were associated with an increased risk of hip fracture [(99)](#reference99). To date, limited experimental data have suggested that vitamin A (as all-trans-retinoic acid) may affect the development of [bone-remodeling](../glossary#bone-remodeling) cells and stimulate bone matrix degradation ( [resorption](../glossary#resorption)) (reviewed in [100](#reference100)). Vitamin A may also interfere with the ability of [vitamin D](vitamin-D) to maintain [calcium](../minerals/calcium) balance [(101)](#reference101). In the large Women's Health Initiative (WHI) prospective study, the highest vs. lowest quintile of retinol intake (1,426 g/day vs. <474 g/day) was found to be significantly associated with increased risk of fracture only in women with the lowest vitamin D intakes (440 IU/day) [(102)](#reference102). Until supplements and fortified food are reformulated to reflect the current RDA for vitamin A, it is advisable for older individuals to consume multivitamin supplements that contain no more than 2,500 IU (750 g) of preformed vitamin A (usually labeled vitamin A acetate or vitamin A palmitate) and no more than 2,500 IU of additional vitamin A as -carotene. Chronic alcohol consumption results in depletion of liver stores of vitamin A and may contribute to alcohol-induced liver damage ( [cirrhosis](../glossary#cirrhosis)) [(103)](#reference103). However, the liver toxicity of preformed vitamin A (retinol) is enhanced by chronic alcohol consumption, thus narrowing the therapeutic window for vitamin A [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in alcoholics [(103)](#reference103). Oral contraceptives that contain [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) and progestin increase retinol binding protein (RBP) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by the liver, increasing the export of all-trans-retinol/RBP complex to the circulation. Whether this increases the dietary requirement of vitamin A is not known. Also, the use of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering medications (like cholestyramine and colestipol), as well as orlistat, mineral oil, and the fat substitute, olestra, which interfere with fat absorption, may affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A [(88)](#reference88). Further, intake of large doses of vitamin A may decrease the absorption of [vitamin K](vitamin-K). isotretinoin, should not be used in combination with single-nutrient vitamin A [supplements](../glossary#supplement), because they may increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of vitamin A toxicity [(88)](#reference88). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin A (700 g RAE/day for women and 900 g RAE/day for men) is sufficient to support normal [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), immune function, and vision. However, following the Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement daily could supply as much as 5,000 IU (1,500 g RAE)/day of vitamin A as retinol, the amount that has been associated with adverse effects on bone health in older adults. For this reason, we recommend taking a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) that provides no more than 2,500 IU (750 g) of preformed vitamin A (usually labeled vitamin A acetate or vitamin A palmitate) and no more than 2,500 IU of additional vitamin A as -carotene. High potency vitamin A supplements should not be used without medical supervision due to the [risk](../glossary#risk) of toxicity. Presently, there is little evidence that the requirement for vitamin A in older adults differs from that of younger adults. Additionally, vitamin A toxicity may occur at lower doses in older adults than in younger adults. Further, data from observational studies suggested an association between intakes of preformed vitamin A in excess of 1,500 g RAE (5,000 IU)/day and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in older people (see [Safety](#safety)). Yet, following the Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation to take a multivitamin/mineral supplement daily could supply as much as 5,000 IU/day of retinol, the amount that has been associated with adverse effects on bone health in older adults. For this reason, we recommend taking a multivitamin/mineral supplement that provides (750 g) of preformed vitamin A (usually labeled vitamin A acetate or vitamin A palmitate) and no more than 2,500 IU of additional vitamin A as -carotene. As for all age groups, high potency vitamin A supplements should not be used without medical supervision due to the risk of toxicity.

The term vitamin B6 refers to six common forms, namely pyridoxal, pyridoxine (pyridoxol), pyridoxamine, and 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the bioactive [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) form involved in over 4% of all [enzymatic](../glossary#enzyme) reactions (Figure 1) [(1-3)](#references). Vitamin B6 must be obtained from the diet because humans cannot synthesize it. PLP plays a vital role in the function of over 100 enzymes that catalyze essential chemical reactions in the human body [(4)](#reference4). PLP-dependent enzymes have been classified into five structural classes known as Fold Type I-V [(5)](#reference5): The many biochemical reactions catalyzed by PLP-dependent enzymes are involved in essential biological processes, such as [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) and [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) biosynthesis, as well as [fatty functions for [glycogen](../glossary#glycogen) phosphorylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the release of [glucose](../glossary#glucose) from stored glycogen. Much of the PLP in the human body is found in muscle bound to glycogen phosphorylase. PLP is also a coenzyme for reactions that generate glucose from amino acids, a process known as [gluconeogenesis](../glossary#gluconeogenesis) [(6)](#reference6). In the brain, the PLP-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) aromatic [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) reactions catalyzed by PLP-dependent enzymes [(7)](#reference7). PLP functions as a [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme) of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, which is involved in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [heme](../glossary#heme), an [iron](../minerals/iron)-containing component of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin). Hemoglobin is found in red blood cells and is critical to their ability to transport oxygen throughout the body. Both pyridoxal and PLP are able to bind to the hemoglobin molecule and affect its ability to pick up and release oxygen. However, the impact of this on normal oxygen delivery to tissues is not known [(6, 8)](#reference6). Vitamin B6 deficiency may impair hemoglobin synthesis and lead to microcytic [anemia](../glossary#anemia) [(3)](#reference3). Deficiency in another B vitamin, [niacin](../vitamins/niacin), is easily prevented by adequate dietary intakes. The dietary requirement for niacin and the niacin [coenzyme](../glossary#coenzyme), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), can be also met, though to a fairly limited extent, by the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) of the essential [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) tryptophan in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway (Figure 2). Key reactions in this pathway are PLP-dependent; in particular, PLP is the [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) kynureninase, which [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the conversion of 3-hydroxykynurenine to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid. A reduction in PLP availability appears to primarily affect kynureninase activity, limiting NAD production and leading to higher concentrations of kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and xanthurenic acid in blood and urine (Figure 2) [(9)](#reference9). Thus, while dietary vitamin B6 restriction impairs NAD [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) from tryptophan, adequate PLP levels help maintain NAD formation from tryptophan [(10)](#reference10). The effect of vitamin B6 inadequacy on immune activation and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) may be partly related to the role of PLP in the tryptophan-kynurenine [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) as [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) and testosterone, exert their effects in the body by binding to [steroid hormone receptors](../glossary#steroid-hormone-receptor) in the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) of target cells. The nuclear receptors themselves bind to specific regulatory sequences in [DNA](../glossary#DNA) and alter the [transcription](../glossary#transcription) of target [genes](../glossary#gene). Experimental studies have uncovered a mechanism by which PLP may affect the activity of steroid receptors and decrease their effects on [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression). It was found that PLP could interact with RIP140/NRIP1, a repressor of nuclear receptors known for its role in reproductive biology [(11)](#reference11). Yet, additional research is needed to confirm that this interaction can enhance RIP140/NRIP1 repressive activity on steroid receptor-mediated gene expression. If the activity of steroid receptors for estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, or other steroid hormones can be inhibited by PLP, it is possible that vitamin B6 status may influence one's risk of developing diseases driven by steroid hormones, such as breast and [prostate](../glossary#prostate) [cancers](../glossary#cancer) [(6)](#reference6). a coenzyme for SHMT, which [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the simultaneous conversions glycine and tetrahydrofolate (THF) to 5,10-methylene THF. The latter molecule is the donor](../glossary#one-carbon-unit) for the generation of dTMP from deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) by TYMS. Severe deficiency of vitamin B6 is uncommon. Alcoholics are thought to be most at risk of vitamin B6 deficiency due to low dietary intakes and impaired [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of the [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin). In the early 1950s, [seizures](../glossary#seizure) were observed in infants as a result of severe vitamin B6 deficiency caused by an error in the manufacture of infant formula [(7)](#reference7). Abnormal [electroencephalogram](../glossary#electroencephalogram) (EEG) patterns have also been reported in vitamin B6-deficient adults. Other [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms observed in severe vitamin B6 deficiency include irritability, depression, and confusion; additional symptoms include [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the tongue, sores or ulcers of the mouth, and ulcers of the skin at the corners of the mouth [(12)](#reference12). Since vitamin B6 is involved in many aspects of especially in [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) metabolic pathways, an individual's [protein](../glossary#protein) intake is likely to influence the requirement for vitamin B6 [(13)](#reference13). Unlike previous recommendations issued by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine, the most recent [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin B6 was not expressed in terms of protein intake, although the relationship was considered in setting the RDA [(14)](#reference14). The current RDA was revised by the FNB in 1998 and is presented in Table 1. |Life (mg/day)||Females (mg/day)| |Infants||0-6 are metabolism](#tryptophan-metabolism)). This pathway is known to be activated during pro- [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) immune responses and plays a critical role in immune tolerance of the fetus during pregnancy [(15)](#reference15). Key intermediates in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway are involved in the regulation of immune responses. Several tryptophan derivatives have been found to induce the death ( [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis)) or block the [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) of certain types of immune cells, such as [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) (in particular T-helper 1). They can also inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine) (reviewed in [15](#reference15)). There is evidence to suggest that adequate vitamin B6 intake is important for optimal immune system function, especially in older individuals [(16, 17)](#reference16). Yet, chronic inflammation that triggers tryptophan degradation and underlies many diseases (e.g., [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) and [cancers](../glossary#cancer)) may precipitate the loss of PLP and increase vitamin B6 requirements. Additional research is needed to evaluate whether vitamin B6 intakes higher than the current [RDA](../glossary#RDA) could prevent and/or reverse immune system impairments (see also [Vitamin B6 and inflammation](#inflammation)). The use of multivitamin [supplements](../glossary#supplement) (including vitamin B6) has been associated with a 24% lower risk of incidental [coronary artery disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CAD) in a large [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 80,082 women from the US Nurses' Health Study cohort [(18)](#reference18). Using [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire), the authors observed that women in the highest quintile of vitamin B6 intakes from both food and supplements (median, 4.6 mg/day) had a 34% lower risk of CAD compared to those in the lowest quintile (median, 1.1 mg/day). CAD is characterized by the abnormal [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing) of [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-artery) (generally due to [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis)), which can result in a potentially fatal [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (heart attack). More recently, a prospective study that followed a Japanese cohort of over 40,000 middle-aged individuals for 11.5 years reported a 48% lower risk of myocardial infarction in those in the highest (mean, 1.6 mg/day) versus lowest quintile (mean, 1.3 mg/day) of in non-supplement users [(19)](#reference19). Early an between suboptimal pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) plasma level, elevated [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) blood level, and increased risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(20-22)](#reference20). More recent research has confirmed that low plasma PLP status is a risk factor for CAD. In a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study), which included 184 participants with CAD and 516 healthy controls, low plasma PLP levels (<30 nanomoles/liter) were associated with a near doubling of CAD risk when compared to higher PLP levels (30 nanomoles/liter) [(23)](#reference23). In a nested case-control study based on the Nurses' Health Study cohort and including 144 cases of myocardial infarction (of which 21 were fatal), women in the highest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of blood PLP levels (70 nanomoles/liter) had a 79% lower risk of myocardial infarction compared to those in the lowest quartile (<27.9 nanomoles/liter) [(24)](#reference24). Even moderately elevated levels of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) in the blood have been associated with increased risk for [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD), including cardiac insufficiency acids](../glossary#amino-acid), including [methionine](../glossary#methionine), released. Methionine is an essential amino acid and [precursor](../glossary#precursor) of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor for most [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, including the methylation of [DNA](../glossary#DNA), [RNA](../glossary#RNA), proteins, and [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) (Figure 4). Homocysteine is an intermediate in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of methionine. Healthy individuals utilize two different pathways to regenerate methionine from homocysteine in the methionine remethylation cycle (Figure 5). One pathway relies on the [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12)-dependent methionine synthase and the methyl donor, 5-methyl folate derivative), to convert homocysteine back to The other reaction is [catalyzed](../glossary#catalyze) by betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, which uses betaine as a source of methyl groups for the formation of methionine from homocysteine. Moreover, two PLP-dependent enzymes are required to convert homocysteine to the amino synthase 5). Thus, the amount of homocysteine in the blood may be influenced by nutritional status of at least three B vitamins, namely [folate](../vitamins/folate), [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12), and vitamin B6. Deficiencies in one or all of these B vitamins may affect both remethylation and transsulfuration processes and result in abnormally elevated homocysteine levels. An early study found that vitamin B6 supplementation could lower blood homocysteine levels after an oral dose of methionine was given (i.e., a methionine load test) [(26)](#reference26), but vitamin B6 supplementation might not be effective in decreasing fasting levels of homocysteine. In a recent study conducted in nine healthy young volunteers, the rise of homocysteine during the postprandial period (after a meal) was found to be greater with marginal vitamin B6 deficiency (mean [plasma](../glossary#plasma) PLP level of 19 nanomoles/liter) as compared to vitamin B6 sufficiency (mean PLP level of 49 nanomoles/liter) [(27)](#reference27). The authors reported an increased rate of cystathionine synthesis with vitamin B6 restriction, suggesting that homocysteine catabolism in the transsulfuration may be maintained or enhanced in response to a marginal reduction in PLP availability. Yet, the flux ratio between methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway appeared to favor homocysteine clearance by remethylation rather than transsulfuration in six out of nine participants [(27)](#reference27). Numerous [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), many in subjects with existing [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) and vascular dysfunction, have demonstrated that supplementation with folic acid, alone or combined with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, could effectively reduce fasting plasma homocysteine concentrations. In 19 intervention studies recently included in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis), reductions in homocysteine level in the blood following B-vitamin supplementation ranged between 7.6% and 51.7% compared to baseline levels [(28)](#reference28). In contrast, studies supplementing individuals with only vitamin B6 have usually failed to show an effect on fasting levels of homocysteine [(29, 30)](#reference29). Of the three supplemental B vitamins, folic acid appears to be the main determinant in the regulation of fasting homocysteine levels when there is no coexisting deficiency of vitamin B12 or vitamin B6 [(31)](#reference31). Yet, the effect of homocysteine lowering on CVD risk reduction is debated. A recent meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials reported a 10% reduction in stroke events with supplemental B vitamins, with greater benefits for high-risk subjects (e.g., those with kidney disease) [(32)](#reference32). However, most [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) and meta-analyses of B-vitamin intervention studies to date have indicated a lack of causality between the decrease of fasting homocysteine levels and the prevention of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(28](#reference28), [33-35)](#reference33). Moreover, B-vitamin supplementation trials in high-risk subjects have not resulted in significant changes in carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, two markers of vascular health used to assess [atherosclerotic](../glossary#atherosclerosis) progression [(36)](#reference36). Finally, in the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial (WENBIT), a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 87 subjects CAD, vitamin B6 supplementation (40 mg/day of pyridoxine) for a median of 10 months had no effect on coronary [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) progression, assessed by quantitative [angiography](../glossary#angiography) [(37)](#reference37). It has been suggested that antiplatelet therapy used in the primary prevention of CVD might interfere with the effect of homocysteine lowering by B vitamins on CVD risk [(38)](#reference38). In this context, a post-hoc subgroup analysis of the multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled VITATOPS trial [(39)](#reference39) proposed that the small benefit of homocysteine-lowering by B vitamins might be cancelled in patients treated with antiplatelet drugs [(40)](#reference40). Yet, the benefit of B-vitamin supplementation in primary prevention (i.e., in non-antiplatelet users) remains to be established. A growing body of evidence currently suggests that low vitamin B6 status may increase the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) through mechanisms independent of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) lowering [(41-43)](#reference41). Markers of immune activation and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) have been associated with [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) (homocysteine levels individuals with [coronary artery disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CAD) [(44)](#reference44). In fact, inflammation is involved in the early steps of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis) in which [lipids](../glossary#lipids) deposit in plaques (known as atheromas) within arterial walls and increase the risk of CAD [(45)](#reference45). In a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) that included 267 patients with CAD and 475 healthy controls, [plasma](../glossary#plasma) PLP concentrations were inversely correlated with the levels of two markers of systemic inflammation, [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP) and fibrinogen [(46)](#reference46). suboptimal PLP levels (<36.3 nanomoles/liter) might contribute to an increased risk of CAD independently of inflammation since the risk was unchanged after adjustment for inflammation markers (unadjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.71 vs. multivariate adjusted OR: 1.73). Furthermore, the analysis of inflammation markers in 2,686 participants of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 indicated that serum CRP concentrations were inversely related to total vitamin B6 intakes (from both food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)). Specifically, the risk of having serum CRP levels greater than 10 mg/L (corresponding to high inflammatory activity) was 57% higher in individuals with vitamin B6 intakes lower than 2 mg/day compared to those with intakes equal to and above 5 mg/day [(41)](#reference41). In addition, the prevalence of inadequate vitamin B6 status (plasma PLP levels <20 nanomoles/liter) with intakes lower than 5 mg/day was systematically greater in individuals with high versus low serum CRP concentrations (>10 mg/L vs. 3 mg/L), suggesting that inflammation might impair vitamin B6 [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism). These observations were confirmed in the study of another cohort (Framingham Offspring Study) in which vitamin B6 status was linked to an overall inflammatory score based on the levels of 13 inflammation markers (including CRP, fibrinogen, tumor necrosis factor-, and interleukin-6) [(42)](#reference42). Specifically, plasma PLP levels were 24% lower in individuals in the highest versus lowest tertile of inflammatory score. Moreover, the inverse correlation between PLP levels and inflammatory scores remained significant regardless of vitamin B6 intakes, questioning again the nature of this relationship. Interestingly, a recent analysis of data collected in the WENBIT study demonstrated that systemic inflammation was associated with an increased degradation of pyridoxal (PL) to 4-pyridoxic acid (PA), supporting the use of the ratio PA:(PL+PLP) as a marker of both vitamin B6 status and systemic inflammation [(47)](#reference47). Finally, while inflammation may contribute to lower vitamin B6 status, current evidence fails to support a role for vitamin B6 in the control of inflammation in patients with cardiovascular disease [(48, 49)](#reference48). A few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have linked [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline and [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) in the elderly with inadequate status of [folate](../vitamins/folate), [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12), and vitamin B6 [(50)](#reference50). Yet, the relationship between B vitamins and cognitive health in aging is complicated by both the high prevalence of [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) and signs of systemic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) in elderly people [(51)](#reference51). On the one hand, since inflammation may impair vitamin B6 metabolism, low serum PLP levels may well be caused by processes related to aging rather than by malnutrition. On the other hand, high serum [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) may possibly be a risk factor for cognitive decline in the elderly, although the matter remains under debate. Specifically, the [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 19 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials of B-vitamin supplementation failed to report any difference in several measures of cognitive function between treatment and placebo groups, despite the treatment effectively lowering homocysteine levels [(52)](#reference52). In a recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study of 2,695 [stroke](../glossary#stroke) survivors with or without cognitive impairments, daily supplementation with 2 mg of folic acid, 0.5 mg of vitamin B12, and 25 mg of vitamin B6 for 3.4 years resulted in significant reductions in mean homocysteine levels (by 28% and 43% in cognitively unimpaired and impaired patients, respectively) compared to placebo. Yet, the B-vitamin intervention had no effect on either the incidence of newly diagnosed cognitive impairments or on measures of cognitive performance when compared to placebo [(53)](#reference53). In contrast, another recent placebo-controlled trial found that a daily B-vitamin regimen that led to significant homocysteine lowering in high-risk elderly individuals could limit the progressive [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) of [gray matter](../glossary#gray-matter) brain regions associated with the AD process [(54)](#reference54). Yet, the authors attributed the changes in homocysteine levels primarily to vitamin B12. Because of mixed findings, it is presently unclear whether supplementation with B vitamins might blunt cognitive decline in the elderly. Evidence is needed to determine whether marginal B-vitamin deficiencies, which are relatively common in the elderly, even contribute to age-associated declines in cognitive function, or whether both result from processes associated with aging and/or disease. Late-life depression is a common disorder sometimes occurring after acute illnesses, such as hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) or [stroke](../glossary#stroke) [(55, 56)](#reference55). Coexistence of symptoms of depression and low vitamin B6 status ( [plasma](../glossary#plasma) PLP level 20 nanomoles/liter) In a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 3,503 free-living people aged 65 and older from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, total vitamin B6 intakes (but not dietary intakes alone) were [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the incidence of depressive symptoms during a mean follow-up period of 7.2 years [(59)](#reference59). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 563 individuals who suffered from a recent stroke, daily supplementation of 2 mg of folic acid, 0.5 mg of vitamin B12, and 25 mg of vitamin B6 halved the risk of developing a major depressive episode during a mean follow-up period of 7.1 years [(60)](#reference60). This reduction in risk was associated with a 25% lower level of plasma [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) in supplemented patients compared to controls. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate whether B vitamins could be included in the routine management of older people at high risk for depression. Chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) that underlies most [cancers](../glossary#cancer) may enhance vitamin B6 degradation (see [Vitamin B6 and inflammation](#inflammation)). In addition, because PLP is the [methionine](../glossary#methionine) cycle, [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism), and thymidylate [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), low vitamin B6 status might affect these pathways and potentially increase the risk for chronic conditions. The [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of nine [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found either inverse or associations between vitamin B6 intakes and [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) (CRC) risk [(61)](#reference61). Inconsistent evidence regarding the link between vitamin B6 intakes and breast cancer was also recently reported in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) [(62)](#reference62). Yet, a prospective study that followed nearly 500,000 older adults for nine years observed that the risk of [esophageal](../glossary#esophagus) and stomach cancers was lower in participants in the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of total vitamin B6 intakes (median values, 2.7 mg/day vs. 1.4 mg/day) [(63)](#reference63). Additionally, a meta-analysis of four nested [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) reported a 48% reduction in CRC risk in the highest versus lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of blood PLP level [(61)](#reference61). Another meta-analysis of five nested case-control studies found higher versus lower [serum](../glossary#serum) PLP levels to be associated with a 29% lower risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, women [(62)](#reference62). Very few [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials investigating the nature of the association between B vitamins and cancer risk have focused on vitamin B6. Two earlier studies conducted in subjects with [coronary artery disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) failed to observe any benefit of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6 (40 mg/day) on CRC risk and mortality (reviewed in [64](#reference64)). A recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study conducted in 1,470 women with high [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) risk showed that daily supplementation with 2.5 mg of [folic acid](../vitamins/folate), 1 mg of [vitamin B12](../vitamins/vitamin-B12), and 50 mg of vitamin B6 for a mean treatment period of 7.3 years had no effect on the risk of developing [colorectal adenoma](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) when compared to placebo [(65)](#reference65). A large [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) examined the relationship between vitamin B6 intake and the occurrence of symptomatic [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones) in women. A group of more than 85,000 women without a prior history of kidney stones were followed over 14 years, and those who consumed 40 mg or more of vitamin B6 daily had only two-thirds the risk of developing kidney stones compared with those who consumed 3 mg or less [(66)](#reference66). However, in a group of more than 45,000 men followed for 14 years, no association was found between vitamin B6 intake and the occurrence of kidney stones [(67)](#reference67). Limited experimental data have suggested that supplementation with high doses of pyridoxamine may help decrease the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones and reduce urinary oxalate levels, an important determinant of calcium oxalate kidney stone formation [(68, 69)](#reference68). Presently, the relationship between vitamin B6 intake and the risk of developing kidney stones requires further study before any recommendations can be made. Vitamin B6 [supplements](../glossary#supplement) at [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) (i.e., doses much larger than those needed to prevent deficiency) have been used in an attempt to treat a wide variety of conditions, some of which are discussed below. A few rare inborn metabolic disorders, including pyridoxine-dependent [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy) (PDE) and cause of early-onset epileptic encephalopathies that are found to be responsive to [pharmacologic doses](../glossary#pharmacologic-dose) of vitamin B6. In individuals affected by PDE and PNPO deficiency, PLP [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) is limited, and treatment with pyridoxine and/or PLP have been used to alleviate or abolish epileptic [seizures](../glossary#seizure) characterizing these conditions [(70, 71)](#reference70). Pyridoxine therapy, along with dietary protein restriction, is also used in the management of vitamin B6 responsive homocystinuria caused by the deficiency of the PLP-dependent enzyme, cystathionine synthase [(72)](#reference72). Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), often referred to as morning sickness, can affect up to 85% of women during early pregnancy and usually lasts between 12 and 16 weeks [(73)](#reference73). Vitamin B6 has been used since the 1940s to treat nausea during pregnancy. Vitamin B6 was originally included in the medication Bendectin, which was prescribed for NVP treatment and later withdrawn from the market due to unproven concerns that it increased the risk for birth defects. Vitamin B6 itself is considered safe during pregnancy and has been used in pregnant women without any evidence of fetal harm [(74)](#reference74). The results of two [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials, including 401 pregnant women that used 25 mg of pyridoxine every eight hours for three days [(75)](#reference75) or 10 mg of pyridoxine every eight hours for five days [(76)](#reference76), suggested that vitamin B6 may be beneficial in reducing nausea. A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) on NVP symptoms during early pregnancy found [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6 to be somewhat effective [(77)](#reference77). It should be noted that NVP usually resolves without any treatment, making it difficult to perform well-controlled trials. More recently, NVP symptoms were evaluated using Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) scores in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 256 pregnant women gestation) suffering from NVP [(78)](#reference78). Supplementation with pyridoxine and the drug doxylamine significantly improved NVP symptoms, as assessed by lower PUQE scores compared to placebo. Moreover, more women supplemented with pyridoxine-doxylamine (48.9%) than placebo-treated (32.8%) asked to continue their treatment at the end of the 15-day trial. The American and Canadian Colleges of Obstetrics and Gynecology have recommended the use of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride, 10 mg) and doxylamine succinate (10 mg) as first-line therapy for NVP [(73)](#reference73). Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a cluster of symptoms, including but not limited to fatigue, irritability, moodiness/depression, fluid retention, and breast tenderness, that begin sometime after ovulation (mid-cycle) and subside with the onset of [menstruation](../glossary#menstruation) (the monthly period). A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of nine [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials suggested that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6, up to 100 mg/day, may be of value to treat PMS, including mood symptoms; however, only limited conclusions could be drawn because most of the studies were of poor quality [(79)](#reference79). Another more recent review of 13 randomized controlled studies also emphasized the need for conclusive evidence before recommendations can be made [(80)](#reference80). The importance of PLP-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of several [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) (see [Nervous system function](#nervous-system-function)) has led researchers to consider whether vitamin B6 deficiency may contribute to the onset of depressive symptoms (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). There is limited evidence suggesting that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6 may have therapeutic efficacy in the management of depression. In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial conducted in 225 elderly patients hospitalized for acute illness, a six-month intervention with daily multivitamin/mineral supplements improved nutritional B-vitamin status and decreased the number and severity of depressive symptoms when compared to placebo [(81)](#reference81). In addition, while supplement intake effectively reduced [plasma](../glossary#plasma) [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels compared to placebo, the effect of supplementation on depressive symptoms at the end of the trial was greater in treated subjects in the lowest versus highest quartile of homocysteine levels (10 micromoles/liter vs. 16.1 micromoles/liter) [(82)](#reference82). Yet, the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) of late-onset depression is unclear and evidence is currently lacking to suggest whether supplemental B vitamins (including vitamin B6) could relieve depressive symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) causes numbness, pain, and weakness of the hand and fingers due to compression of the median nerve at the wrist. It may result from repetitive stress injury of the wrist or from soft-tissue swelling, which sometimes occurs with pregnancy or [hypothyroidism](../glossary#hypothyroidism). Early studies by the same investigator suggested that supplementation with 100-200 mg/day of vitamin B6 for several months might improve CTS symptoms in individuals with low vitamin B6 status [(83, 84)](#reference83). In addition, a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in 137 men not taking [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) [supplements](../glossary#supplement) found that decreased blood levels of PLP were associated with increased pain, tingling, and nocturnal awakening\u2014all symptoms of CTS [(85)](#reference85). However, studies using electrophysiological measurements of median nerve conduction have largely failed to find an association between vitamin B6 deficiency and CTS [(86)](#reference86). While a few studies have noted some symptomatic relief with vitamin B6 supplementation, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have not generally found vitamin B6 to be effective in treating CTS [(86)](#reference86). Yet, despite its equivocal effectiveness, vitamin B6 supplementation is sometimes used in complementary therapy in an attempt to avoid hand surgery. Patients taking high doses of vitamin B6 should be advised by a physician and monitored for vitamin B6-related toxicity symptoms (see [Toxicity](#safety)) [(87)](#reference87). The analysis of data collected in the US NHANES 2003-2004 has indicated that vitamin B6 intakes from food only averaged about 1.9 mg/day [(88)](#reference88). Yet, despite values well above the current [RDA](../glossary#RDA), total vitamin B6 intakes (combining food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)) below 2 mg/day appear to be associated with relatively high proportions of low vitamin B6 status in all age groups (see [Supplements](#supplements)). Many plant foods contain a unique form of vitamin B6 called pyridoxine glucoside; this form of vitamin B6 appears to be only about half as [bioavailable](../glossary#bioavailability) as vitamin B6 from other food sources or supplements [(7)](#reference7). Vitamin B6 in a mixed diet has been found to be approximately 75% bioavailable [(14)](#reference14). In most cases, including foods in the diet that are rich in vitamin B6 should supply enough to meet the current RDA. However, those who follow a very restricted vegetarian diet might need to increase their vitamin B6 intake by eating foods [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with vitamin B6 or by taking a supplement. Some foods that are relatively rich in vitamin B6 and their vitamin B6 content in milligrams (mg) are listed in Table 2. For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, serving of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| Vitamin B6 is available as pyridoxine hydrochloride in nanomoles/liter) was reported in 24% of non users of supplements and 11% of supplement users. Moreover, total vitamin B6 intakes (from food and supplements) lower than 2 mg/day were associated with high proportions of low plasma PLP levels: 16% in men aged 13-54 years, 24% in [menstruating](../glossary#menstruation) women, and 26% in individuals aged 65 years and older. Finally, the prevalence of low PLP levels was found to be greater in individuals consuming less than 2 mg/day of vitamin B6 compared to higher intakes. For example, only 14% of men and women aged 65 and older had low PLP values with total vitamin B6 intakes of 2-2.9 mg/day compared to 26% in those consuming less than 2 mg/day of vitamin B6 [(88)](#reference88). Because adverse effects have only been documented from vitamin B6 [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and never from food sources, safety concerning only the supplemental form of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is discussed. Although vitamin B6 is a water-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) and is excreted in the urine, long-term supplementation with very high doses of pyridoxine may result in painful [neurological](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms known as sensory [neuropathy](../glossary#neuropathy). Symptoms include pain and numbness of the extremities and in severe cases, difficulty walking. Sensory neuropathy typically develops at doses of pyridoxine in excess of 1,000 mg per day. However, there have been a few [case reports](../glossary#case-reports) of individuals who developed sensory neuropathies at doses of less than 500 mg daily over a period of months. Yet, none of the studies in which an objective neurological examination was performed reported evidence of sensory nerve damage at intakes below 200 mg pyridoxine daily [(90)](#reference90). To prevent sensory neuropathy in virtually all individuals, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for pyridoxine at 100 mg/day for adults (Table 3) [(14)](#reference14). Because [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies have generally failed to show therapeutic benefits of high doses of pyridoxine, there is little reason to exceed the of intake should be from food and formula only.| Certain medications interfere with the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of vitamin B6; therefore, some individuals may be vulnerable to a vitamin B6 deficiency if [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B6 is not taken. In the NHANES 2003-2004 analysis, significantly more current and past users of oral contraceptives (OCs) among [menstruating](../glossary#menstruation) women had low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) PLP levels compared to women who have never used OCs, suggesting that the [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) content of OCs may interfere with vitamin B6 metabolism (see [Side effects of oral contraceptives](#side-effects-oral-contraceptives)) [(88)](#reference88). and anti- [parkinsonian](../glossary#parkinson-disease) drugs like L-Dopa can all form complexes with vitamin B6 and limit its [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability), thus creating a functional deficiency. PLP bioavailability may also be reduced by methylxanthines, such as theophylline used to treat certain respiratory conditions [(7)](#reference7). The long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g. celecoxib and naproxen) may also impair vitamin B6 metabolism [(91)](#reference91). Conversely, high doses of vitamin B6 have been found to decrease the efficacy of two [anticonvulsants](../glossary#anticonvulsant), phenobarbital and phenytoin, and of L-Dopa [(6](#reference6), [90)](#reference90). Because of the [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid) the tryptophan load test (an assay of tryptophan metabolites after an oral dose of tryptophan) has been used as a functional assessment of vitamin B6 status. Abnormal tryptophan load tests in women taking high-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that these women were vitamin B6 deficient, which led to the prescription of high doses of vitamin B6 (100-150 mg/day) to women taking OCs. However, most other indices of vitamin B6 status were normal in women on high-dose OCs, and the [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) content of OCs appeared to be more likely responsible for the abnormality in tryptophan metabolism [(88)](#reference88). Yet, more recently, the use of lower dose formulations has also been associated with vitamin B6 inadequacy [(88](#reference88), [92)](#reference92). Although it is not known whether OCs actually impair vitamin B6 metabolism or merely affect the tissue distribution of PLP, the use of OCs may place women at higher risk of vitamin B6 deficiency when they discontinue OCs and become pregnant [(93)](#reference93). Whether OC users are at higher risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) despite normal [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels also needs to be determined. Finally, although high doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) have demonstrated no benefit in preventing the risk of side effects from OCs [(94)](#reference94), the use of vitamin B6 supplements may be warranted in current and past OC users. The Linus Pauling Institute supports the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin B6. LPI recommends that all adults take a daily [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which usually contains at least 2 mg of vitamin B6. This amount is slightly above the RDA but still 50 times lower than the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) set by the Food and Nutrition Board (see [Safety](#safety)). Early metabolic studies have indicated that the requirement for vitamin B6 in older adults is approximately 2 mg daily [(95)](#reference95). Yet, the analysis of the US population survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 showed that adequate vitamin B6 status and low [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels were associated with total vitamin B6 intakes equal to and above 3 mg/day in people aged 65 years and older [(88)](#reference88). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that older adults take a [multivitamin/mineral supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which provides at least 2.0 mg of vitamin B6 daily.

J Nutr. 1991;121(7):1062-1074. ] [(PubMed)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2051226) Contents Vitamin B12 has the largest and most complex chemical structure of all the [vitamins](../glossary#vitamin). It is unique among vitamins in that it contains a metal [ion](../glossary#ion), cobalt. For this reason cobalamin is the term used to refer to compounds having vitamin B12 activity. Methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the forms of vitamin B12 used in the human body [(1)](#references). The form of cobalamin used in most nutritional supplements and fortified foods, cyanocobalamin, is readily converted to 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin in the body. In mammals, cobalamin is a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for only L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase [(2)](#reference2). the folate-dependent [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme), methionine synthase. This enzyme [amino acid](../glossary#amino-acid), [methionine](../glossary#methionine), from [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine). Methionine in turn is required for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl group donor used in many biological [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions, including the methylation of a number [DNA](../glossary#DNA), [RNA](../glossary#RNA), and [proteins](../glossary#protein) [(3)](#reference3). Aberrant methylation of DNA and which causes alterations in [chromatin](../glossary#chromatin) structure and [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression), are a common feature of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) cells. Inadequate function of methionine synthase can lead to an accumulation of homocysteine, which has been associated with increased risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (Figure 1). 5-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin is required by the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyze) the conversion of L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A to succinyl-coenzyme A (succinyl-CoA), which then enters the [citric acid cycle](../glossary#citric-acid-cycle) (Figure 2). Succinyl-CoA plays an important role in the production of energy from [lipids](../glossary#lipid) and [proteins](../glossary#protein) and is also required for the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin), the oxygen-carrying pigment in red blood cells [(3)](#reference3). In healthy adults, vitamin B12 deficiency is uncommon, mainly because total body stores can exceed 2,500 g, daily turnover is slow, and dietary intake of only 2.4 g/day is sufficient to maintain adequate vitamin B12 status (see [RDA](#RDA)) [(4)](#reference4). In elderly individuals, vitamin B12 deficiency is more common mainly because of impaired intestinal absorption that can result in marginal to severe vitamin B12 deficiency in this population. Intestinal [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome), rather than inadequate dietary intake, can explain most cases of vitamin B12 deficiency [(5)](#reference5). Absorption of vitamin B12 from food requires normal function of the stomach, [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), and [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine). Stomach acid and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) free vitamin B12 from food, allowing it to bind to R-protein (also known as transcobalamin-1 or haptocorrin), found in saliva and [gastric](../glossary#gastric) fluids. In the [alkaline](../glossary#alkaline) environment of the small intestine, R-proteins are degraded by pancreatic enzymes, freeing vitamin B12 to bind to intrinsic factor (IF), a protein secreted by specialized cells in the stomach. [Receptors](../glossary#receptor) on the surface of the ileum (final part of the small intestine) take up the IF-B12 complex only in the presence of calcium, which is supplied by the pancreas [(5)](#reference5). Vitamin B12 can also be absorbed by passive diffusion, but this process is very inefficient\u2014only about 1% absorption of the vitamin B12 dose is absorbed passively [(2)](#reference2). The prevalent causes of vitamin B12 deficiency are (1) an [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) condition known as [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia), and (2) a disorder called food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption. Both conditions have been associated with a chronic [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) disease of the stomach known as [atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis). [Atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis) is thought to affect 10%-30% of people over 60 years of age [(6)](#reference6). The condition is frequently associated with the presence of autoantibodies directed toward stomach cells (see [Pernicious anemia](#pernicious-anemia)) and/or infection the [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria), Helicobacter [(7)](#reference7). H. pylori infection induces chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the which may to [peptic ulcer disease](../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease), atrophic gastritis, and/or [gastric](../glossary#gastric) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) in Diminished gastric function in individuals with atrophic gastritis can result in bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and cause food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption. Vitamin B12 levels in [serum](../glossary#serum), [plasma](../glossary#plasma), and gastric fluids are significantly decreased in individuals with H. pylori infection, and eradication of the bacteria has been shown to significantly improve vitamin B12 serum concentrations [(8)](#reference8). [Pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia) has been estimated to be present in approximately 2% of individuals over 60 years of age [(9)](#reference9). Although [anemia](../glossary#anemia) is often a symptom, the condition is actually the end stage of an [autoimmune](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the stomach known as autoimmune [atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis), resulting in destruction of stomach cells by one's own [antibodies](../glossary#antibody) (autoantibodies). Progressive destruction of the cells that line the stomach causes decreased secretion of acid and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) required to release food-bound vitamin B12. Antibodies to intrinsic factor (IF) bind to IF preventing formation of the IF-B12 complex, further inhibiting vitamin B12 absorption. About 20% of the relatives of pernicious anemia patients also have the condition, suggesting a genetic predisposition. It is also thought that H. pylori infection could be involved in initiating the autoimmune response in a subset of individuals [(10)](#reference10). Further, co-occurrence of autoimmune atrophic gastritis with other autoimmune conditions, especially autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), has been reported [(11, 12)](#reference11). Treatment of pernicious anemia generally requires injections of vitamin B12 to bypass intestinal absorption. High-dose oral supplementation is another treatment option, because consuming 1,000 g (1 mg)/day of vitamin B12 orally should result in the absorption of about 10 g/day (1% of dose) by passive diffusion. In fact, high-dose oral therapy is considered to be as effective as intramuscular injection [(4)](#reference4). Food-bound vitamin B12 [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) is defined as an impaired ability to absorb food- or [protein](../glossary#protein)-bound vitamin B12; individuals with this condition can fully absorb the free form [(13)](#reference13). While the condition is the major cause of poor vitamin B12 status in the elderly population, it is usually associated with [atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis), a chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) of the lining of the stomach that ultimately results in the loss of glands in the stomach ( [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy)) and decreased stomach acid production (see [Atrophic gastritis](#atrophic-gastritis)). Because stomach acid is required for the release of vitamin B12 from the proteins in food, vitamin B12 absorption is diminished. Decreased stomach acid production also provides an environment conducive to the overgrowth of [anaerobic](../glossary#anaerobic) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) in the stomach, which further interferes with vitamin B12 absorption [(3)](#reference3). Because vitamin B12 in [supplements](../glossary#supplement) is not bound to protein, and because intrinsic factor (IF) is still available, the absorption of supplemental vitamin B12 is not reduced as it is in [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia). Thus, individuals with food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption do not have an increased requirement for vitamin B12; they simply need it in the crystalline form found in [fortified](../glossary#fortification) foods and dietary supplements. Other causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include surgical resection of the stomach or portions of the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine) where [receptors](../glossary#receptor) for the IF-B12 complex are located. Conditions affecting the small intestine, such as [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) ( [celiac disease](../glossary#celiac-disease) and tropical sprue), may also result in vitamin B12 deficiency. Because the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) provides critical [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), as well as calcium required for vitamin B12 absorption, pancreatic insufficiency may contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency. Since vitamin B12 is found only in foods of animal origin, a strict vegetarian (vegan) diet has resulted in cases of vitamin B12 deficiency. Moreover, alcoholics may experience reduced intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 [(2)](#reference2), and individuals with [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)](../glossary#AIDS) appear to be at increased risk of deficiency, possibly related to a failure of the IF-B12 receptor to take up the IF-B12 complex [(3)](#reference3). Further, long-term use of acid-reducing drugs has also been implicated in vitamin B12 deficiency (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Rare cases of inborn errors of vitamin B12 [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) have been reported in the literature (reviewed in [5](#reference5)). Imerslund-Gr\u00e4sbeck syndrome is an inherited vitamin B12 [malabsorption syndrome](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) that causes [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) and [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disorders of variable severity in affected subjects. Similar clinical symptoms are found in individuals with hereditary IF deficiency (also called congenital pernicious anemia) in whom the lack of IF results in the defective absorption of vitamin B12. Additionally, [mutations](../glossary#mutation) affecting vitamin B12 transport in the body have been identified [(14)](#reference14). Vitamin B12 deficiency results in impairment of the activities of vitamin B12-requiring [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme). Impaired activity of methionine synthase results in elevated [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels, while impaired activity of L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase results in increased levels of a [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) of methylmalonyl-CoA called methylmalonic acid (MMA). While individuals with mild vitamin B12 deficiency may not experience symptoms, blood levels of homocysteine and/or MMA may be elevated [(15)](#reference15). Diminished activity of methionine synthase in vitamin B12 deficiency inhibits the regeneration of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and traps [folate](../vitamins/folate) in a form that is not usable by the body (Figure 3), resulting in symptoms of folate deficiency even in the presence of adequate folate levels. Thus, in both folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies, folate is unavailable to participate in [DNA](../glossary#DNA) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis). This impairment of DNA synthesis affects the rapidly dividing cells of the bone marrow earlier than other cells, resulting in the production of large, immature, [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin)-poor red blood cells. The resulting [anemia](../glossary#anemia) is known as [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) and is the symptom for which the disease, [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia), was named [(3)](#reference3). Supplementation with folic acid will provide enough usable folate to restore normal red blood cell formation. However, if vitamin B12 deficiency is the cause, it will persist despite the resolution of the anemia. Thus, megaloblastic anemia should not be treated with folic acid until the underlying cause has been determined [(16)](#reference16). The [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency include numbness and tingling of the hands and, more commonly, the feet; difficulty walking; memory loss; disorientation; and [dementia](../glossary#dementia) with or without mood changes. Although the progression of neurologic complications is generally gradual, such symptoms may not be reversed with treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency, especially if they have been present for a long time. Neurologic complications are not always associated with [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) and are the only clinical symptom of vitamin B12 deficiency in about 25% of cases [(17)](#reference17). Although vitamin B12 deficiency is known to damage the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath covering cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerves, the biochemical processes leading to neurological damage in vitamin B12 deficiency are not yet fully understood [(18)](#reference18). Tongue soreness, appetite loss, and constipation have also been associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. The origins of these symptoms are unclear, but they may be related to the stomach [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) underlying some cases of vitamin B12 deficiency and to the progressive destruction of the lining of the stomach [(17)](#reference17). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin B12 was revised by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the US Institute of Medicine in 1998 (Table 1). Because of the increased risk of food-bound vitamin B12 [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) in older adults, the FNB recommended that adults over 50 years of age get most of the RDA from [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food or chronic [atrophic gastritis](../glossary#atrophic-gastritis) and infection by H. pylori can cause deficiency in vitamin B12 secondary to [malabsorption](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) disorders (see [Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency](#deficiency-causes)). However, the occurrence of H. pylori infection and chronic atrophic gastritis did not modify the incidence of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) accidents ( [stroke](../glossary#stroke) and [heart attack](../glossary#myocardial-infarction)) or mortality in a large cohort study of nearly 10,000 men and women over 50 years old [(19)](#reference19). Yet, vitamin B12 status was not assessed in this study, despite the high prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in older individuals. [Epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) indicate that even moderately elevated levels of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) in the blood raise the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) [(20)](#reference20), though the mechanism by which homocysteine may increase the CVD risk remains the subject of a great deal of research [(21)](#reference21). The amount of homocysteine in the blood is regulated by at least three vitamins: [folate](../vitamins/folate), [vitamin B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6), and vitamin B12 (see [Figure 1](#figure-1) above). An early analysis of the results of 12 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) showed that folic acid supplementation (0.5-5 mg/day) had the lowering blood homocysteine levels (25% decrease); co-supplementation with folic acid and (500 g/day) provided an additional 7% reduction (32% decrease) in blood homocysteine concentrations [(22)](#reference22). The results of a sequential supplementation trial in 53 men and women indicated that after folic acid supplementation, vitamin B12 became the major determinant of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine levels [(23)](#reference23). It is thought that the elevation of homocysteine levels might be partly due to vitamin B12 deficiency in individuals over 60 years of age. Two studies found blood methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels to be elevated in more than 60% of elderly individuals with elevated homocysteine levels. In the absence of impaired kidney function, an elevated MMA level in conjunction with elevated homocysteine suggests either a vitamin B12 deficiency or a combined vitamin B12 and folate deficiency [(24)](#reference24). Thus, it appears important to evaluate vitamin B12 status, as well as kidney function, in older individuals with elevated homocysteine levels prior to initiating homocysteine-lowering therapy. For more information regarding homocysteine and CVD, see the article on [Folate](folate#homocysteine). Although increased intake of folic acid and vitamin B12 is effective in decreasing [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels, the combined intervention of these B vitamins did not lower risk for [CVD](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). Indeed, several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have been conducted to determine whether homocysteine-lowering through folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 supplementation reduces the incidence of CVD. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of data from 11 trials, including nearly 45,000 participants at risk of CVD, showed that B-vitamin supplementation had no significant effect on risk of [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) (heart attack) or [stroke](../glossary#stroke), nor did it modify the risk of all-cause mortality [(25)](#reference25). Other meta-analyses that included patients with chronic kidney disease have confirmed the lack of effect of homocysteine-lowering on risk of myocardial infarction and death. However, stroke risk was significantly reduced by 7%-12% with the B-vitamin supplementation (FMD; a surrogate marker of vascular health) in response to homocysteine reduction revealed that B-vitamin supplementation was accompanied by an improved FMD in short-term <8 weeks) but not in long-term studies conducted in subjects with preexisting vascular diseases [(28)](#reference28). Yet, some of the studies included in these meta-analyses did not use vitamin B12, and folate administration on its own has shown a protective role on vascular function and stroke risk [(29)](#reference29). Besides, the high prevalence of [malabsorption disorders](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) and vitamin B12 deficiency in elderly individuals might warrant the use of higher doses of vitamin B12 than those used in these trials [(30)](#reference30); in cases of malabsorption, only high-dose oral therapy or intramuscular injections can overcome vitamin B12 deficiency [(4)](#reference4). [Folate](../vitamins/folate) is required for [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [DNA](../glossary#DNA), and there is evidence that decreased availability of folate results in strands of DNA that are more susceptible to damage. Deficiency of vitamin B12 traps folate in a form that is unusable by the body for DNA synthesis. Both vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies result in a diminished capacity for [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions (see [Figure 3](#figure-3) above). Thus, vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to an elevated rate of DNA damage and altered methylation of DNA, both of which are important risk factors for [cancer](../glossary#cancer). A series of studies in young adults and older men indicated that increased levels of [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) and decreased levels of vitamin B12 in the blood were associated with a [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of [chromosome](../glossary#chromosome) breakage in white blood cells (reviewed in [31](#reference31)). In a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, the same biomarker of chromosome breakage was minimized in young adults who were supplemented with 700 g of folic acid and 7 g of vitamin B12 daily in cereal for two months [(32)](#reference32). A compared B6](../vitamins/vitamin-B6), and vitamin B12 in 195 women later diagnosed with breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer) and 195 age-matched, cancer-free women. Among postmenopausal women, the association between blood levels of vitamin B12 and breast cancer suggested a [threshold](../glossary#threshold) effect. The risk of breast cancer was more than doubled in women with [serum](../glossary#serum) vitamin B12 levels in the lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) compared to women in the four highest quintiles [(33)](#reference33). However, the [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of this study with three additional case-control studies found no protection associated with high compared to low vitamin B12 serum levels [(34)](#reference34). A case-control study in Mexican women (475 cases and 1,391 controls) reported that breast cancer risk for women in the highest quartile of vitamin B12 intake (7.3-7.7 g/day) was 68% lower than those in the lowest quartile (2.6 g/day). Stratification of the data revealed that the inverse association between dietary vitamin B12 intake and breast cancer risk was stronger in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women, though both associations were statistically significant. Moreover, among postmenopausal women, the apparent protection conferred by folate was only observed in women with the highest vitamin B12 quartiles of intake [(35)](#reference35). However, more recent case-control and [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have reported weak to no risk reduction with vitamin B12 intakes in different populations, including Hispanic, African American and European American women [(36, 37)](#reference36). A meta-analysis of seven case-control and seven prospective cohort studies concluded that the risk of breast cancer was not modified by high versus low vitamin B12 intakes [(34)](#reference34). There was no joint association between folate and vitamin B12 intakes and breast cancer risk. Presently, there is little evidence to suggest a relationship between vitamin B12 [status](../glossary#status) and breast cancer. In addition, results from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) are not consistently in support of an association between high dietary folate intakes and reduced risk for breast cancer (see the article on [Folate](folate#breast-cancer-prevention)). There is a need to evaluate the effect of folate and vitamin B12 supplementation in well-controlled, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial), while considering various factors that modify breast cancer risk, such as menopausal status, ethnicity, and alcohol intake. [Neural tube defects](../glossary#neural-tube-defect) (NTD) may result in [anencephaly](../glossary#anencephaly) or [spina bifida](../glossary#spina-bifida), which are mostly fatal [congenital malformations](../glossary#congenital-malformation) of the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system). The defects arise from failure of embryonic neural tube to close, which occurs between the 21st and 28th days after conception, a time when many women are unaware of their pregnancy [(38)](#reference38). [Randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have demonstrated 60% to 100% reductions in NTD cases when women consumed folic acid supplements in addition to a varied diet during the month before and the month after conception. Increasing evidence indicates that the [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine)-lowering effect of folic acid plays a critical role in reducing the risk of NTD [(39)](#reference39). Homocysteine may accumulate in the blood when there is inadequate folate and/or vitamin B12 for effective functioning of the methionine synthase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme). Decreased vitamin B12 levels and elevated homocysteine concentrations have been found in the blood and amniotic fluid of pregnant women at high risk of NTD [(40)](#reference40). The recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 12 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), including 567 mothers with current or prior NTD-affected pregnancy and 1,566 unaffected mothers, showed that low maternal vitamin B12 status was associated with an increased risk of NTD [(41)](#reference41). Yet, whether vitamin B12 supplementation may be beneficial in the prevention of NTD has not been evaluated [(42)](#reference42). The occurrence of vitamin B12 deficiency prevails in the elderly population and has been frequently associated with [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (reviewed in [43](#reference43)). One study found lower vitamin B12 levels in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) of patients with Alzheimer's disease than in patients with other types of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), though blood levels of vitamin B12 did not differ [(44)](#reference44). The reason for the association of low vitamin B12 status with Alzheimer's disease is not clear. Vitamin B12 deficiency, like [folate](../vitamins/folate) deficiency, may lead to decreased [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of [methionine](../glossary#methionine) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), thereby adversely affecting [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions. Methylation reactions are essential for the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of components of the [myelin](../glossary#myelin) sheath of nerve cells as well as for synthesis of [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) [(18)](#reference18). Other metabolic implications of vitamin B12 deficiency include the accumulation of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, which might contribute to the neuropathologic features of dementia [(43)](#reference43). A large majority of [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have associated elevated [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) concentrations with measures of poor [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) scores and increased risk of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), including [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (reviewed in [45](#reference45)). A [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) of 164 patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type included 76 cases in which the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was confirmed by examination of brain cells after death. Compared to 108 control subjects without evidence of dementia, subjects with dementia of Alzheimer's type and confirmed Alzheimer's disease had higher blood homocysteine levels and lower blood levels of folate and vitamin B12. Measures of general nutritional status indicated that the association of increased homocysteine levels and diminished vitamin B12 status with Alzheimer's disease was not due to dementia-related malnutrition [(46)](#reference46). In a sample of 1,092 men and women without dementia followed for an average of 10 years, those with higher [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine levels at baseline had a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Specifically, those with plasma homocysteine levels greater than 14 mol/L had nearly double the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease [(47)](#reference47). A study in 650 elderly men and women reported that the risk of elevated plasma homocysteine levels was significantly higher in those with lower cognitive function scores [(48)](#reference48). A prospective study in 816 elderly men and women reported that those with [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) (homocysteine levels >15 mol/L) had a significantly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Although raised homocysteine levels might be partly due to a poor vitamin B12 status, the latter was not related to risk of Alzheimer's disease or dementia in this study [(49)](#reference49). A recent [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) of 35 prospective cohort studies assessing the association between vitamin B12 status and cognitive deterioration in older individuals with or without dementia at baseline did not support a relationship between vitamin B12 serum concentrations and cognitive decline, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease [(50)](#reference50). Nevertheless, studies utilizing more sensitive [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of vitamin B12 [status](../glossary#status), including measures of holo-transcobalamin (holo-TC; a vitamin B12 carrier) and methylmalonic acid, showed more consistent results and a trend toward associations between poor vitamin B12 status and faster cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's disease [(51-55)](#reference51). Besides, it cannot be excluded that the co-occurrence of potential confounders like elevated homocysteine level and poor folate status might mitigate the true contribution of vitamin B12 status to cognitive functioning [(45)](#reference45). High-dose B-vitamin supplementation has been proven effective for treating [hyperhomocysteinemia](../glossary#hyperhomocysteinemia) in elderly individuals with or without [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) impairment. However, [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine)-lowering trials have produced equivocal results regarding the prevention of cognitive deterioration in this population. A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials examining the effect of B-vitamin supplementation did not find that the decrease in homocysteine level prevented or delayed cognitive decline among older subjects [(56)](#reference56). A more recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled clinical trial in 900 older individuals at high risk of cognitive impairment found that daily supplementation of 400 g of folic acid and 100 g of vitamin B12 for two years significantly improved measures of immediate and delayed memory and slowed the rise in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) homocysteine concentrations [(57)](#reference57). However, supplemented subjects had no reduction in homocysteine concentrations compared to baseline, nor did they perform better in processing speed tests compared to placebo. Another two-year, randomized, placebo-controlled study in elderly adults reported that a daily regimen of 800 g of folic acid, 500 g of vitamin B12, and 20 mg of vitamin B6 significantly reduced the rate of brain [atrophy](../glossary#atrophy) compared to placebo treatment (0.5% vs. 3.7%). Interestingly, a greater benefit was seen in those with high compared to low homocysteine concentrations at baseline, suggesting the importance of lowering homocysteine levels in prevention of brain atrophy and cognitive decline [(58, 59)](#reference58). The authors attributed the changes in homocysteine levels primarily to vitamin B12 [(59)](#reference59). Finally, the most recent randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in over 2,500 individuals who suffered a [stroke](../glossary#stroke) showed that the normalization of homocysteine concentrations by B-vitamin supplementation (2 mg of folic acid, 500 g of vitamin B12, and 25 mg of vitamin B6) did not improve cognitive performance or decrease incidence of cognitive decline compared to placebo [(60)](#reference60). Currently, there is a need for larger trials to evaluate the effect of B-vitamin supplementation on long-term outcomes, such as the incidence of [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease). [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found as many as 30% of patients hospitalized for depression are deficient in vitamin B12 [(61)](#reference61). A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 700 community-living, physically disabled women over the age of 65 found that vitamin B12-deficient women were twice as likely to be severely depressed as non-deficient women [(62)](#reference62). A population-based study in 3,884 elderly men and women with depressive disorders found that those with vitamin B12 deficiency were almost 70% more likely to experience depression than those with normal vitamin B12 [status](../glossary#status) [(63)](#reference63). The reasons for the relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency and depression are not clear but may involve a shortage in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM is a methyl group donor for numerous [methylation](../glossary#methylation) reactions in the brain, including those involved in the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of [neurotransmitters](../glossary#neurotransmitter) whose deficiency has been related to depression [(64)](#reference64). Severe vitamin B12 deficiency in a mouse model showed dramatic alterations in the level of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) methylation in the brain, which might lead to [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) impairments [(65)](#reference65). This hypothesis is supported by several studies that have shown supplementation with SAM improves depressive symptoms [(66-69)](#reference66). Increased [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) level is another nonspecific [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of vitamin B12 deficiency that has been linked to depressive symptoms in the elderly [(70)](#reference70). However, in a recent cross-sectional study conducted in 1,677 older individuals, higher vitamin B12 [plasma](../glossary#plasma) levels, but not changes in homocysteine concentrations, were correlated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms [(71)](#reference71). Few studies have examined the relationship of vitamin B12 status, homocysteine levels, and the development of depression over time. In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) with over 900 older participants experiencing psychological distress, daily supplementation with folic acid (400 g) and vitamin B12 (100 g) for two years did not reduce the occurrence of symptoms of depression despite significantly improving blood folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels compared to placebo [(72)](#reference72). However, in a long-term randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled study among sufferers of cerebrovascular accidents at high risk of depression, daily supplementation with 2 mg of folic acid, 25 mg of vitamin B6, and 500 g vitamin B12 significantly lowered the risk of major depressive episodes during a seven-year follow-up period compared to placebo [(73)](#reference73). Although it cannot yet be determined whether vitamin B12 deficiency plays a causal role in depression, it may be beneficial to screen for vitamin B12 deficiency in older individuals as part of a medical evaluation for depression. High [homocysteine](../glossary#homocysteine) levels may affect [bone remodeling](../glossary#bone-remodeling) by increasing bone [resorption](../glossary#resorption) (breakdown), decreasing bone formation, and reducing bone blood flow. Another proposed mechanism involves the binding of homocysteine to the [collagenous matrix](../glossary#collagenous-matrix) of bone, which may modify [collagen](../glossary#collagen) properties and reduce bone strength (reviewed in [74](#reference74)). Alterations of bone biomechanical properties can contribute to [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) and increase the risk of [fractures](../glossary#fracture) in the elderly. Since vitamin B12 is a determinant of homocysteine metabolism, it was suggested that the risk of osteoporotic fractures in older subjects might be enhanced by vitamin B12 deficiency. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), following a total of 7,475 older individuals for 3 to 16 years, found a weak association between an elevation in vitamin B12 of 50 picomoles/L in blood and a reduction in fracture risk [(75)](#reference75). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 559 elderly individuals with low [serum](../glossary#serum) levels of folate and vitamin B12 and at increased risk of fracture evaluated the combined supplementation of very high doses of folic acid (5 mg/day) and vitamin B12 (1.5 mg/day). The two-year study found that the supplementation improved B-vitamin status, decreased homocysteine concentrations, and reduced risk of total fractures compared to placebo [(76)](#reference76). However, a multicenter study in 5,485 subjects with [cardiovascular or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) showed that daily supplementation with folic acid (2.5 mg), vitamin B12 (1 mg), and vitamin B6 (50 mg) lowered homocysteine concentrations but had no effect on fracture risk compared to placebo [(77)](#reference77). Another small, randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind) trial in 93 individuals with low vitamin D status found no additional benefit of B-vitamin supplementation (50 mg/day of vitamin B6, 0.5 mg/day of folic acid, and 0.5 mg/day of vitamin B12) on markers of bone health over a one-year period beyond that associated with vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Yet, the short length of the study did not permit a conclusion on whether the lowering of homocysteine through B-vitamin supplementation could have long-term benefits on bone strength and fracture risk [(78)](#reference78). A large [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) conducted in older people with no preexisting conditions is under way to evaluate the effect of B-vitamin supplementation on markers of bone health and incidence of fracture; this trial might clarify whether B vitamins could have a protective effect on bone health in the elderly population [(79)](#reference79). Only [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin B12 [(80)](#reference80). Vitamin B12 is present in animal products, such as meat, poultry, fish (including shellfish), and to a lesser extent dairy products and eggs [(1)](#references). Fresh pasteurized milk contains 0.9 g per cup and is an important source of vitamin B12 for some vegetarians [(17)](#reference17). Those strict vegetarians who eat no animal products (vegans) need [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin B12 to meet their requirements. Recent analyses revealed that some plant-source foods, such as certain fermented beans and vegetables and edible algae and mushrooms, contain substantial amounts of bioactive vitamin B12 [(81)](#reference81). Together with B-vitamin [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food and supplements, these foods may contribute, though modestly, to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency in individuals consuming vegetarian diets. Also, individuals over the age of 50 should obtain their vitamin B12 in supplements or fortified foods (e.g., fortified cereals) because of the increased likelihood of food-bound vitamin B12 malabsorption with increasing age. Most people do not have a problem obtaining the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of 2.4 g/day of vitamin B12 in food. According to a US national survey, the average dietary intake of vitamin B12 is 5.4 g/day for adult men and 3.4 g/day for adult women. Adults over the age of 60 had an average dietary intake of 4.8 g/day [(42)](#reference42). However, consumption of any type of vegetarian diet dramatically increases the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in individuals across all age groups [(82)](#reference82). Some foods with substantial amounts of vitamin B12 are listed in Table 2, along with their vitamin B12 content in micrograms (g). For more information on the nutrient content of three-ounce serving of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.| Cyanocobalamin is the principal form of vitamin B12 used in oral [supplements](../glossary#supplement), but methylcobalamin is also available as a supplement. Cyanocobalamin is available by prescription in an injectable form and as a nasal gel for the treatment of [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia). Over-the-counter preparations containing cyanocobalamin include and single-nutrient, vitamin B12 supplements [(83)](#reference83). No toxic or adverse effects have been associated with large intakes of vitamin B12 from food or supplements in healthy people. Doses as high as 2 mg (2,000 g) daily by mouth or 1 mg monthly by intramuscular (IM) injection have been used to treat [pernicious anemia](../glossary#pernicious-anemia) without significant side effects [(84)](#reference84). When high doses of vitamin B12 are given orally, only a small percentage can be absorbed, which may explain the low toxicity [(4)](#reference4). Because of the low toxicity of vitamin B12, no tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) has been set by the US Food and Nutrition Board [(17)](#reference17). A number of drugs reduce the absorption of vitamin B12. Proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole and lansoprazole), used for therapy of [Zollinger-Ellison syndrome](../glossary#Zollinger-Ellison-syndrome) and [gastroesophageal reflux disease](../glossary#gastroesophageal-reflux-disease) (GERD), markedly decrease stomach acid secretion required for the release of vitamin B12 from food but not from [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors has been found to decrease blood vitamin B12 levels. However, vitamin B12 deficiency does not generally develop until after at least three years of continuous therapy [(85, 86)](#reference85). Another class of gastric acid inhibitors known as histamine2 (H2)-receptor antagonists (e.g., cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine), often used to treat [peptic ulcer disease](../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease), has also been found to decrease the absorption of vitamin B12 from food. It is not clear whether the long-term use of H2-receptor antagonists could cause overt vitamin B12 deficiency [(87, 88)](#reference87). Individuals taking drugs that inhibit [gastric](../glossary#gastric) acid secretion should consider taking vitamin B12 in the form of a supplement because gastric acid is not required for its absorption. Other drugs found to inhibit vitamin B12 absorption from food include cholestyramine (a [bile acid](../glossary#bile-acids)-binding resin used in the treatment of high [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)), chloramphenicol and neomycin (antibiotics), and colchicine (medicine for [gout](../glossary#gout) treatment). Metformin, a medication for individuals with type 2 [diabetes](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), was found to decrease vitamin B12 absorption by tying up free calcium required for absorption of the IF-B12 complex [(89)](#reference89). However, the clinical significance of this is unclear [(90)](#reference90). It is not known whether calcium supplementation can reverse vitamin B12 malabsorption; therefore, calcium supplementation is not currently prescribed for the prevention or treatment of metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency [(91)](#reference91). Previous reports that megadoses of vitamin C destroy vitamin B12 have not been supported [(92)](#reference92) and may have been an artifact of the assay used to measure vitamin B12 levels [(17)](#reference17). Nitrous oxide, a commonly used anesthetic, oxidizes and inactivates vitamin B12, thus inhibiting both of the vitamin B12-dependent [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), and can produce many of the clinical features of vitamin B12 deficiency, such as [megaloblastic anemia](../glossary#megaloblastic-anemia) or [neuropathy](../glossary#neuropathy). Since nitrous oxide is commonly used for surgery in the elderly, some experts feel vitamin B12 deficiency should be ruled out prior to its use [(6](#reference6), [15)](#reference15). Large doses of folic acid given to an individual with an undiagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency could correct megaloblastic anemia without correcting the underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, leaving the individual at risk of developing irreversible [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) damage [(17)](#reference17). For this reason, the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine advises that all adults limit their intake of folic acid (supplements and [fortification](../glossary#fortification)) to 1,000 g (1 mg) daily. A varied diet should provide enough vitamin B12 to prevent deficiency in most individuals 50 years of age and younger. Strict vegetarians and women planning to become pregnant should take a multivitamin [supplement](../glossary#supplement) daily or eat [fortified](../glossary#fortification) cereal, which would ensure a daily intake of 6 to 30 g of vitamin B12 in a form that is easily absorbed. Higher doses of vitamin B12 supplements are recommended for patients taking medications that interfere with its absorption (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Because vitamin B12 malabsorption and vitamin B12 deficiency are more common in older adults, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends that adults older than 50 years take 100 to 400 g/day of supplemental vitamin B12.

Arch Intern Med. 1999;159(6):619-624. ] [(PubMed)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10090119) Contents Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is a potent [reducing](../glossary#reduction) agent, meaning that it readily donates [electrons](../glossary#electron) to recipient molecules (Figure 1). Related to this [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation)-reduction ( [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction)) potential, two major functions of vitamin C are as an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) and as an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) [(1)](#references). Vitamin C is the primary water-soluble, non-enzymatic antioxidant in [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and tissues. Even in small amounts, vitamin C can protect indispensable molecules in the body, such as [proteins](../glossary#protein), [lipids](../glossary#lipid) (fats), [carbohydrates](../glossary#carbohydrate), and and [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) that are generated during normal [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), by active immune cells, and through exposure to toxins and pollutants (e.g., certain [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) drugs and cigarette smoke). Vitamin C also participates in redox recycling of other important antioxidants; for example, vitamin C is known to regenerate [vitamin E](vitamin-E) from its [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) form (see the article on [Vitamin E](vitamin-E#nutrient-interactions-vitamin-C)). The role of vitamin C as a cofactor is also related to its redox potential. By maintaining enzyme-bound metals in their reduced forms, vitamin C assists mixed-function oxidases in the [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of several critical biomolecules [(1)](#references). enzymes are either monooxygenases or dioxygenases (see [Table 1](#table-1)). Symptoms of vitamin C deficiency, such as poor wound healing and lethargy, likely result from the impairment of these vitamin C-dependent enzymatic reactions leading to the insufficient synthesis of [collagen](../glossary#collagen), [carnitine](../glossary#carnitine), and [catecholamines](../glossary#catecholamine) (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). Moreover, several dioxygenases involved in the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genome integrity require vitamin C as a cofactor. Indeed, research has recently uncovered the crucial role played by enzymes, such as the TET dioxygenases and Jumonji domain-containing [histone](../glossary#histone) demethylases, in the fate of cells and tissues (see [Table 1](#table-1)). These enzymes contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by catalyzing reactions involved in the demethylation whereas dioxygenases catalyze a reaction that couples the hydroxylation of a specific substrate with the conversion (decarboxylation) of -ketoglutarate into succinate.| The capacity of vitamin C to influence the [methylation](../glossary#methylation) status of DNA and histones in mammalian cells supports a role for the vitamin in health and disease beyond what was previously understood, in particular by safeguarding genome integrity [(3, 4)](#reference3). Vitamin C affects several components of the human immune system [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro); for example, vitamin C has been shown to stimulate both the production [(5-9)](#reference5) and function [(10, 11)](#reference10) of [leukocytes](../glossary#leukocyte) (white blood cells), especially [neutrophils](../glossary#neutrophil), [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte), and [phagocytes](../glossary#phagocyte). Specific measures of functions stimulated by vitamin C include accumulate vitamin C to high concentrations, which can protect these cell types from [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) [(12-14)](#reference12). In response to invading microorganisms, such these [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) kill [pathogens](../glossary#pathogen) and, in the process, can damage the leukocytes themselves [(15)](#reference15). Vitamin C, through its [antioxidant ](../glossary#antioxidant)functions, has been shown protect leukocytes from self-inflicted damage [(14)](#reference14). Phagocytic leukocytes also produce release [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine), including interferons, which have antiviral activity [(16)](#reference16). Vitamin C has been shown to increase interferon production in vitro [(17)](#reference17). Additional studies have reported that vitamin C enhances the chemotactic and microbial killing capacities of neutrophils and stimulates the [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) of B- and T-lymphocytes (reviewed in [18](#reference18)). It is widely thought by the general public that vitamin C boosts immune function, yet human studies published to date are conflicting. Disparate results are likely due to study design issues, often linked to a lack of understanding of vitamin C [pharmacokinetics](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) and requirements [(19, 20)](#reference19). Finally, vitamin C increases the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of iron from foods by enhancing intestinal absorption of non- [heme](../glossary#heme) iron (see the article on [Iron](../minerals/iron#food-sources)) [(21)](#reference21). [Depletion-repletion](../glossary#depletion-repletion-study) [pharmacokinetic](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) experiments demonstrated that [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C concentration is tightly controlled by three primary mechanisms: intestinal absorption, tissue transport, and [renal](../glossary#renal) reabsorption [(22)](#reference22). In response to increasing oral doses of vitamin C, plasma vitamin C concentration rises steeply at intakes between 30 and 100 mg/day. Plasma concentrations of ascorbate reach steady-state at concentrations between 60 and 80 micromoles/L (mol/L). This is typically observed at doses between 200 to 400 mg/day in healthy young adults, with some degree of individual variation [(23, 24)](#reference23). One hundred percent absorption efficiency is observed when ingesting vitamin C at doses up to 200 mg at a time. Higher doses (>500 mg) result in fractionally less vitamin C being absorbed as the dose increases. Once plasma vitamin C concentrations reach saturation, additional vitamin C is largely [excreted](../glossary#excretion) in the urine. Notably, [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of vitamin C bypasses absorptive control in the intestine such that very high concentrations of vitamin C can be achieved in the plasma; within a few hours, renal excretion restores vitamin C to baseline plasma concentrations (see [Cancer Treatment](#cancer-treatment)) [(25)](#reference25). While plasma vitamin C concentration reflects recent dietary intake, [leukocyte](../glossary#leukocyte) (white blood cell) vitamin C is thought to be an indicator of body stores. However, leukocyte vitamin C concentration does not accurately reflect vitamin C in several tissues and may specifically underestimate vitamin C uptake into skeletal muscle [(26)](#reference26). Yet, plasma concentrations of vitamin C 50 mol/L are sufficient to saturate muscle tissue vitamin C. There is also some limited evidence suggesting that individuals who carry certain [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in vitamin C transport and detoxification mechanisms may have lower plasma vitamin C concentrations even with high vitamin C intakes (see also [Vascular complications of diabetes mellitus](#vascular-complications-diabetes-mellitus)) (reviewed in [27](#reference27)). Due to the pharmacokinetics and tight regulation of plasma vitamin C, supplementation with vitamin C will have variable effects in vitamin C- [replete](../glossary#replete) (plasma concentrations near saturation) versus sub-optimal (plasma concentrations <50 mol/L), marginally deficient (plasma concentrations <23 mol/L), or severely deficient (plasma concentrations <11 mol/L) individuals [(28)](#reference28). Scientific studies investigating vitamin C efficacy to prevent or treat disease need to assess baseline vitamin C [status](../glossary#status) before embarking on an intervention or statistical analysis [(22](#reference22), [29-31)](#reference29). For a more detailed discussion on the bioavailability of different forms of vitamin C, see the article, [The Bioavailability of Different Forms of Vitamin C](vitamin-C/supplemental-forms). Severe vitamin C deficiency has been known for many centuries as the potentially fatal disease, [scurvy](../glossary#scurvy). By the late 1700s, the British navy was aware that scurvy could be cured by eating oranges or lemons, even though vitamin C would not be isolated until the early 1930s. Symptoms of scurvy include [subcutaneous](../glossary#subcutaneous) bleeding, poor wound closure, and bruising easily, hair and tooth loss, and joint pain and swelling. Such symptoms appear to be related to the weakening of blood vessels, connective tissue, and bone, which all contain [collagen](../glossary#collagen). Early symptoms of scurvy like fatigue may result from diminished levels of [carnitine](../glossary#carnitine), which is needed to derive energy from fat, or from decreased [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) of the [catecholamine](../glossary#catecholamine) norepinephrine (see [Function](#function)). Scurvy is rare in developed countries because it can be prevented by as little as 10 mg of vitamin C daily [(32)](#reference32). However, cases have occurred in children and the elderly on very restricted diets [(33, 34)](#reference33). The recommended dietary allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for vitamin C is based on the amount of vitamin C intake necessary to maintain [neutrophil](../glossary#neutrophil) vitamin C concentration with minimal urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of vitamin C and is proposed to provide sufficient [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) protection (Table 2) [(35)](#reference35). The recommended intake for smokers is 35 mg/day higher than for nonsmokers, because smokers are under increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) from the toxins in cigarette smoke and generally have lower blood concentrations of vitamin C [(36)](#reference36). |Life Stage||Age||Males (mg/day)||Females (mg/day)| |Infants||0-6 months|| 40 ( | of vitamin C required to help prevent [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) is higher than the amount required for prevention of [scurvy](../glossary#scurvy). Information regarding vitamin C and the prevention of chronic disease is based on both observational [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(29](#reference29), [37)](#reference37). Prospective cohort studies can examine the incidence of a specific disease in relation to vitamin C intake or body status in a cohort of participants who are followed over time. In contrast, trials are [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study) that can establish a causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome, e.g., by evaluating the effect of vitamin C supplementation on the incidence of chronic disease in participants randomly assigned to receive either vitamin C or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for a given length of time. [Endothelial](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction is considered to be an early step in the development of [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis). Alterations in the structure and function of the [vascular endothelium](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) that lines the inner surface of all blood vessels are associated with the loss of normal [nitric oxide](../glossary#nitric-oxide)-mediated endothelium-dependent [vasodilation](../glossary#vasodilation). Endothelial dysfunction results in widespread The measurement of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is often used as a marker of endothelial function; FMD values are [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events [(38)](#reference38). A 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 44 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in subjects with or without [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) summarized the effect of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C on endothelial function by measuring FMD (19 studies), assessing forearm blood flow (20 studies), or by pulse wave analysis (5 trials) [(39)](#reference39). Short-term supplementation with vitamin C was found to reduce endothelial dysfunction in subjects with [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure), atherosclerosis, or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), but it had no effect in those with [hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure). Vitamin C also limited endothelial dysfunction that was experimentally induced in healthy volunteers [(39)](#reference39). Improved endothelial function was observed with daily vitamin C doses above 500 mg [(39)](#reference39). [Hypertension](../health-disease/high-blood-pressure) is a major [risk](../glossary#risk) factor heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), and [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation). An analysis that combined data from three, large, independent prospective cohorts, (1) Nurses' Health Study 1 (NHS1; 88,540 women, median age 49 years); (2) Nurses' Health Study 2 (NHS2; 97,315 women, median age 36 years); and (3) Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; 37,375 men, median age 52 years), found no association between the level of vitamin C intake and risk of developing hypertension [(40)](#reference40). On the other hand, when [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C concentration was measured, [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have consistently indicated an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between plasma vitamin C concentration and blood pressure in both men and women [(41-43)](#reference41). A 15-year follow-up of about 2,500 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study found that higher plasma vitamin C and a higher diet quality score were independently associated with a reduced risk of developing hypertension [(44)](#reference44). Interestingly, there was no relationship between diet score and risk of hypertension in those with the lowest plasma vitamin C, and plasma vitamin C was positively associated with risk of hypertension in those with low diet scores [(44)](#reference44). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 29 small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of short durations (median duration, 8 weeks) in 1,407 participants (10 to 120 subjects per trial; including both normotensive and hypertensive subjects) found that daily supplementation with 60 to 4,000 mg of vitamin C (median dose, 500 mg) reduced [systolic blood pressure](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) by 3.84 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) and [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) by 1.48 mm Hg [(45)](#reference45). Good quality long-term trials are needed to examine whether the anti-hypertensive effect of vitamin C is sustained over time and eventually results in a reduced risk of cardiovascular events. It is important for individuals with significantly elevated blood pressure not to rely on vitamin C supplementation alone to reduce their hypertension. They should instead seek or continue treatment with anti-hypertensive medication and make dietary and lifestyle changes in consultation with their health care provider. [Coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) is characterized by the buildup of plaque inside the arteries that supply blood to the heart ( [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis)). Over years of buildup and accumulated damage to the [coronary arteries](../glossary#coronary-artery), CHD may culminate in a [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or heart attack. Many [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have examined the relationship between vitamin C intake from diet and [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and CHD [risk](../glossary#risk), the results of which have been pooled and analyzed in two separate analyses [(46, 47)](#reference46). In 2004, a pooled analysis of nine prospective cohort studies found that supplemental vitamin C intake (400 mg/day for a mean of 10 years), but not dietary vitamin C intake, was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with CHD risk [(46)](#reference46). Conversely, a 2008 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 cohort studies concluded that dietary, but not supplemental, vitamin C intake was inversely related to CHD risk [(47)](#reference47). The most recent large prospective cohort study found an inverse association between dietary vitamin C intake and CHD mortality in Japanese women, but not in men [(48)](#reference48). In spite of the variable association depending on source, these analyses indicate an overall inverse association between higher vitamin C intakes and CHD risk. Limitations inherent to dietary assessment methodology, such as [recall bias](../glossary#recall-bias), [measurement error](../glossary#measurement-error), and [residual confounding](../glossary#residual-confounding), may account for some of the inconsistent associations between vitamin C intake and CHD risk. In order to overcome such limitations, some prospective studies measured [plasma](../glossary#plasma) or [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of vitamin C as a more reliable index of vitamin C intake and [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) of body vitamin C [status](../glossary#status). The European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk prospective cohort study investigated the relationship between vitamin C status and incident [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) in healthy adults (9,187 men and 11,112 women, aged 58.1+/-9.2 years) [(49)](#reference49). After a mean follow-up of 12.8 years, plasma vitamin C was inversely associated with incident cases of heart failure. Specifically, plasma vitamin C ranged from approximately 23 to 70 mol/L in men and 33 to 82 mol/L in women; across this range, every 20 mol/L increase in plasma vitamin C was associated with a 9% reduction in risk of heart failure. Although a primary source of dietary vitamin C, consumption of fruit and vegetables \u2014 assessed by [food frequency questionnaire](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) \u2014 was not found to be associated with a lower risk of congestive heart failure [(49)](#reference49). This highlights the fact that limitations associated with dietary assessment methods such as food frequency questionnaires may be overcome by using biomarkers of nutrient intake [(50, 51)](#reference50). A 2017 review of eight published [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found inconsistent results from seven trials reporting on the effect of vitamin C supplementation on serum [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides), established risk factors for [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) [(52)](#reference52). Only one large trial in more than 14,000 older men participating in the Physicians' Health Study II (PHS II) reported on cardiovascular outcomes. PHS II found that vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for an average of eight years had no significant effect on major cardiovascular events, total myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular mortality [(53)](#reference53). Notably, this study had several limitations [(54)](#reference54), including no measurement of vitamin C status and the recruitment of a well-nourished study population. There is a need for better quality studies to examine the effect of vitamin C on cardiovascular endpoints in participants with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. A cerebrovascular event, or [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), can be classified as [hemorrhagic](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) or [ischemic](../glossary#ischemic-stroke). Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain tissue. Ischemic stroke occurs when an obstruction within a blood vessel blocks blood flow to the brain. Most (~80%) cerebrovascular events in high-income countries are ischemic in nature and associated with [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) as an underlying condition [(55, 56)](#reference55). With respect to vitamin C and [cerebrovascular disease](../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease), a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed more than 2,000 residents of a rural Japanese community for 20 years found that the [risk](../glossary#risk) of stroke in those with the highest [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of vitamin C was 29% lower than in those with the lowest serum concentrations of vitamin C [(57)](#reference57). Similarly, the EPIC-Norfolk study, a 10-year prospective cohort study in 20,649 adults, found that individuals with [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C concentrations in the top [quartile](../glossary#quartile) (25%) had a 42% lower risk of stroke compared to those in the lowest quartile (66 mol/L vs. <41 mol/L) [(58)](#reference58). In both the Japanese [(57)](#reference57) and EPIC-Norfolk [(58)](#reference58) populations, blood vitamin C concentrations were highly correlated with fruit and vegetable intake. Therefore, as in many studies of vitamin C intake and [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) risk, it is difficult to separate the effects of vitamin C from the effects of other components of fruit and vegetables. For example, [potassium](../minerals/potassium) \u2014 found at high levels in bananas, potatoes, and other fruit and vegetables \u2014 is known to be important in blood pressure regulation, and elevated blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke (see the article on [Potassium](../minerals/potassium)). A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 prospective cohort studies reported a 19% lower risk of stroke with the highest versus lowest dietary vitamin C intakes and a 38% lower risk with the highest versus lowest circulating vitamin C concentrations [(59)](#reference59). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in more than 14,000 older men participating in the Physicians' Health Study II (PHS II) found that vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for an average of eight years had no significant effect on the incidence of or mortality from any type of stroke [(53)](#reference53). Other trials also failed to show any evidence of an effect of vitamin C on the risk of stroke. A meta-analysis of 10 trials that examined [antioxidant ](../glossary#antioxidant)vitamins, of which five included vitamin C, found no association between any antioxidant vitamin (vitamin C, vitamin E, or -carotene), administered alone or in combination, and risk of stroke [(60)](#reference60). Overall, [observational](../glossary#observational-study) [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have reported no or modest [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin C intake and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing a given type of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(37](#reference37), [61-63)](#reference61). Additional detail is provided below for those cancer subtypes with substantial scientific information obtained from prospective cohort studies. [Randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials that have tested the effect of vitamin C supplementation (alone or in combination with other [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients) on cancer incidence or mortality have shown no effect [(64)](#reference64). Two large [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) found dietary vitamin C intake to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with breast cancer incidence in certain subgroups. In the Nurses' Health Study, premenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer who consumed an average of 205 mg/day of vitamin C from food had a 63% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of breast cancer than those who consumed an average of 70 mg/day [(65)](#reference65). In the Swedish Mammography Cohort, overweight women who consumed an average of 110 mg/day of vitamin C had a 39% lower risk of breast cancer compared to overweight women who consumed an average of 31 mg/day [(66)](#reference66). More recent prospective cohort studies have reported no association between dietary and/or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C intake and breast cancer [(67-69)](#reference67). A number of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found increased dietary vitamin C intake to be associated with decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of gastric (stomach) [cancer](../glossary#cancer), and laboratory experiments indicate that vitamin C inhibits the formation of [carcinogenic](../glossary#carcinogen) N-nitroso compounds in the stomach [(70-72)](#reference70). A [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) in the EPIC study found a 45% lower risk of [gastric](../glossary#gastric) cancer incidence in individuals in the highest (51 mol/L) versus lowest (<29 mol/L) [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of plasma vitamin C concentration; no association was observed between dietary vitamin C intake and gastric cancer [(73)](#reference73). Infection with the [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), is known to increase the risk of stomach cancer and is associated with lower vitamin C content of stomach secretions [(74, 75)](#reference74). Although two [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study) failed to show a reduction in stomach cancer incidence with vitamin C [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) [(35)](#reference35), some research suggests that vitamin C supplementation may be a useful addition to standard H. pylori eradication therapy in reducing the risk of gastric cancer [(76)](#reference76). Because vitamin C can inactivate urease (an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that facilitates H. pylori survival and of the [gastric mucosa](../glossary#gastric-mucosa) at low [pH](../glossary#pH)) [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro), vitamin C may be most effective as a [prophylactic ](../glossary#prophylaxis)agent in those without [achlorhydria](../glossary#achlorhydria) [(77, 78)](#reference77). By pooling data from 13 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) comprising 676,141 participants, it was determined that dietary intake of vitamin C was not associated with [colon](../glossary#colon) [cancer](../glossary#cancer), while total intake of vitamin C (i.e., from food and [supplements](../glossary#supplement)) was associated with a 19% reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of colon cancer [(79)](#reference79). Each of the cohort studies used self-administered [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire) at baseline to assess vitamin C intake. Although the analysis adjusted for several lifestyle and known risk factors, the authors noted that other healthy behaviors and/or folate intake may have [confounded](../glossary#confounder) the association. A population-based, [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), the Iowa Women's Health Study, collected baseline data on diet and [supplement](../glossary#supplement) use in 35,159 women (aged 55-69 years) and evaluated the [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) over 19 years of follow-up [(80)](#reference81). Overall, an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of NHL was observed. Additionally, dietary, but not supplemental, intake of vitamin C and other [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients ( [carotenoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids), proanthocyanidins, and [manganese](../minerals/manganese)) was inversely associated with NHL risk. Another large, multi-center, prospective study \u2014 the Women's Health Initiative \u2014 that followed 154,363 postmenopausal women for 11 years found that dietary and supplemental vitamin C intake at baseline was inversely associated with diffuse B-cell lymphoma, a subtype of NHL [(81)](#reference81). The Physicians' Health Study II was a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial that examined the effect of [vitamin E](../vitamins/vitamin-E) (400 IU/day), vitamin C (500 mg/day), and on the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) in 14,641 middle-aged male physicians over 10.3 years (7.6 years of active treatment plus 2.8 years post-treatment follow-up) [(82)](#reference82). Supplementation with vitamin C had no effect on the overall risk of cancer or on the risk of [prostate](../glossary#prostate), bladder, or [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) cancer; there was a marginal reduction in [colorectal cancer](../glossary#colorectal-cancer) incidence with vitamin C compared to placebo [(82)](#reference82). In the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Diet and Health study that included 232,007 participants, the use of vitamin C [supplements](../glossary#supplement) for at least seven times a week was associated with a 9% lower risk of developing type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) compared to non-supplement use [(83)](#reference83). In a cohort of 21,831 adults followed for 12 years in the EPIC-Norfolk study, high [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C was found to be strongly associated with a reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of diabetes [(84)](#reference84). Additionally, several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) reported [inverse associations](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating vitamin C concentrations and markers of resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) or have found no effect of vitamin C supplementation on fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA1c concentrations in healthy individuals [(87)](#reference87). It is not known whether supplemental vitamin C could improve markers of glycemic control in subjects at risk of diabetes. A 2015 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 29 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that administration of vitamin C during pregnancy, alone or in combination with a few other [supplements](../glossary#supplement), failed to reduce the risks of stillbirth, perinatal death, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia) [(88)](#reference88). Nonetheless, vitamin C supplementation led to a 36% lower risk of [placental abruption](../glossary#placental-abruption) and to a significant increase in [gestational](../glossary#gestation) age at birth [(88)](#reference88). Another meta-analysis of 40 randomized controlled trials in 276,820 women found no effect of vitamin C, alone or combined with [vitamin E](vitamin-E) or multivitamins, when supplemented during pregnancy (starting prior to 20 weeks' gestation), on the risks of overall fetal loss, miscarriage, stillbirth, and [congenital malformation](../glossary#congenital-malformation) [(89)](#reference89). Cigarette smoking during pregnancy causes intrauterine growth restriction and preterm birth, among other pregnancy complications [(90, 91)](#reference90), and is the primary cause of childhood respiratory illness [(92)](#reference92). For some still unclear reasons, smoking has been associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy [(93)](#reference93). A secondary analysis of a multicenter, randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in nearly 10,000 pregnant women found no reduction in the risk of preeclampsia with supplemental vitamin C (1,000 mg/day) and vitamin E (400 IU/day), regardless of women's smoking status during pregnancy. However, [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) supplementation resulted in reduced risks of placental abruption and preterm birth in women who smoked during pregnancy but not in non-smokers [(94)](#reference94). Another [pilot](../glossary#pilot-study) multicenter trial found better lung function during the first week of life and lower risk of wheezing through one year of age in infants whose smoking mothers were randomized to receive vitamin C (500 mg/day) rather than a placebo during pregnancy [(95)](#reference95). The Vitamin C to Decrease the Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function [VCSIP] study is an ongoing trial designed to confirm these preliminary observations using more accurate measurements of pulmonary function in a larger sample of women randomized to receive supplemental vitamin C or placebo [(96)](#reference96). In the US, [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) (AD) is the most common form of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), affecting 5.5 million individuals 65 years and over [(97)](#reference97). stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), and [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) cell death in the brain of subjects affected by AD have been associated with [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) decline and memory loss. Lower vitamin C concentrations in the [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) (CSF) and brain extracellular matrix of a mouse model of AD were found to increase oxidative stress and accelerate amyloid deposition and disease progression [(98)](#reference98). In another AD mouse model that was lacking the ability to [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin C, supplementation with a high versus low dose of vitamin C reduced amyloid deposition in the cortex and hippocampus and limited blood-brain barrier impairments and [mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction [(99)](#reference99). The majority of large, population-based studies examining the relationship of vitamin C intake or supplementation with AD incidence have reported null results [(100)](#reference100). In contrast, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) reported lower [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C concentrations in AD patients compared to cognitively healthy subjects [(101)](#reference101) and found better cognitive function or lower risk of cognitive impairment with higher plasma vitamin C [(100)](#reference100). Few studies have measured vitamin C concentration in the CSF, which more closely reflects the vitamin C status of the brain. Vitamin C is concentrated in the brain through a combination of active transport into brain tissue and retention via the blood-brain barrier [(100)](#reference100). Although CSF vitamin C is maintained at concentrations several-fold higher than plasma vitamin C, the precise function of vitamin C in cognitive function and AD [etiology](../glossary#etiology) is not yet fully understood [(102)](#reference102). In a small, longitudinal [biomarker](../glossary#biomarker) study in 32 individuals with probable AD, a higher CSF-to-plasma vitamin C ratio at baseline was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline at one year of follow-up [(103)](#reference103). Impaired blood-brain barrier integrity may affect the brain's ability to retain vitamin C and thus to maintain a high CSF-to-plasma vitamin C ratio. The significance of the CSF-to-plasma vitamin C ratio in AD progression requires further study. The effect of vitamin C supplementation, in combination with other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), on CSF biomarkers and cognitive function has been examined in only a few trials involving AD patients. In a small (n=23), [open-label trial](../glossary#open-label-trial), combined supplementation with vitamin C (1,000 mg/day) and vitamin E (400 IU/day) to AD patients taking a cholinesterase inhibitor significantly increased antioxidant levels and decreased [lipoprotein](../glossary#lipoprotein) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) in CSF after one year, but had no effect on the clinical course of AD compared to controls [(104)](#reference104). A similar finding was obtained in a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in which combined supplementation with vitamin C (500 mg/day), vitamin E (800 IU/day), and [-lipoic acid](../dietary-factors/lipoic-acid) (900 mg/day) for 16 weeks reduced lipoprotein oxidation in CSF but elicited no clinical benefit in individuals with mild-to-moderate AD (n=78) [(105)](#reference105). In this latter trial, a greater decline in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was observed in the supplemented group, however, the significance of this observation remains unclear. A third [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in mildly cognitively impaired older adults (ages, 60-75 years) found that one-year supplementation with vitamin C (400 mg/day) and vitamin E (300 mg/day) improved antioxidant blood capacity but had no effect on MMSE scores [(106)](#reference106). At this time, avoidance of vitamin C deficiency or insufficiency, rather than supplementation in [replete](../glossary#replete) individuals, seems prudent for the promotion of healthy brain aging [(101)](#reference101). The [lens](../glossary#lens) of the eye focuses light, producing a clear, sharp image on the [retina](../glossary#retina), a layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eyeball. Age-related changes to the lens (thickening, loss of flexibility) and [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) contribute to the formation of [cataract](../glossary#cataract), i.e., cloudiness or opacity in the lens that interferes with the clear focusing of images on the retina. In humans, vitamin C concentration is about 15 to 20 times higher in the aqueous humor \u2014 fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye \u2014 than in [plasma](../glossary#plasma), suggesting that the vitamin may be playing an important role in the eye [(107)](#reference107). Decreased vitamin C concentrations in the lens of the eye have been associated with increased severity of cataracts [(108)](#reference108). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found that a reduced [risk](../glossary#risk) of age-related cataract with higher dietary vitamin C intakes in [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) and with higher circulating vitamin C concentrations in [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study). However, no such associations were found in pooled analyses of [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) [(109)](#reference109). In fact, two prospective cohort studies in Swedish men [(110)](#reference110) and women [(111)](#reference111) reported that high-dose single nutrient [supplements](../glossary#supplement) of vitamin C were associated with an increased risk of cataract, especially in those on [corticosteroid](../glossary#corticosteroid) therapy. A 2012 review of nine [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found no substantial effect of -carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, administered individually or in combination over 2.1 to 12 years, on the risk of cataracts or cataract surgery [(112)](#reference112). Although trials do not currently support the use of high-dose supplementation with vitamin C in cataract prevention, there is a consistent [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) observed between high daily intake of fruit and/or vegetables (>5 servings/day) and risk of cataract [(113)](#reference113). [Gout](../glossary#gout), a condition that afflicts more than 4% of US adults [(114)](#reference114), is characterized by abnormally high blood concentrations of [uric acid](../glossary#uric-acid) (urate) [(115)](#reference115). Urate crystals may form in joints, resulting in [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and pain, as well as in the kidneys and urinary tract, resulting in [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones). The tendency to exhibit elevated blood uric acid concentrations and develop gout is often inherited; however, dietary and lifestyle modification may be helpful in both the prevention and treatment of gout [(116)](#reference116). In an [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) that included 1,387 men, higher intakes of vitamin C were associated with lower [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of uric acid [(117)](#reference117). In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) conducted in 4,576 African Americans, the odds of having hyperuricemia was associated with dietary intakes high in fructose, low in vitamin C, or with high fructose-to-vitamin C ratios [(118)](#reference118). A [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed a cohort of 46,994 men for 20 years found that total daily vitamin C intake was [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with incidence of gout, with higher intakes being associated with greater [risk](../glossary#risk) reductions [(119)](#reference119). The results of this study also indicated that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C may be helpful in the prevention of gout [(119)](#reference119). A 2011 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 13 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in healthy individuals with elevated serum uric acid revealed that vitamin C supplementation (a median dose of 500 mg/day for a median duration of 30 days) modestly reduced serum uric acid concentrations by 0.35 mg/dL compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(120)](#reference120). Such a reduction falls within the range of assay variability and is unlikely to be clinically significant [(121)](#reference121). An eight-week, [open-label](../glossary#open-label-trial), controlled trial randomized 40 subjects with gout to receive either allopurinol (standard-of-care), vitamin C, or both treatments [(122)](#reference122). The effect of vitamin C, alone or with allopurinol, decreasing serum uric acid was modest and much less than that of allopurinol alone. The trial did not examine the effect of vitamin C on other outcomes associated with gout [(122)](#reference122). Although observational studies suggested that supplemental vitamin C may be helpful to prevent incident and recurrent gout, this has not been demonstrated by [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-study) undertaken thus far. In addition, there is currently little evidence to support a role for vitamin C in the management of patients with gout [(123)](#reference123). Two large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) assessed the relationship between dietary and [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C intakes and mortality. In the Vitamins and Lifestyle Study, 77,719 men and women (ages 50-76 years) were questioned at baseline on their use of dietary supplements during the previous 10 years [(124)](#reference124). After five years of follow-up, vitamin C supplement use was associated with a small decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of total mortality, although no association was found with [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease)- or [cancer](../glossary#cancer)-specific mortality. In the second prospective cohort study, the Diet, Cancer and Health Study, 55,543 Danish adults (ages 50-64 years) were questioned at baseline about their lifestyle, diet, and supplement use during the previous 12 months [(125)](#reference125). No association between dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin C and mortality was found after approximately 14 years of follow-up. In contrast, a 2014 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 prospective cohort studies in 17,696 women with breast cancer found a lower risk of total and breast cancer-specific mortality with higher supplemental and dietary vitamin C intakes [(126)](#reference126). A 2012 meta-analysis of 29 trials found no effect of oral vitamin C, given alone or in combination with other antioxidants, on all-cause mortality [(127)](#reference127). In parallel to these dietary assessment studies, a strong [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin C and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease (and cancer in men only) was observed in the EPIC-Norfolk multicenter, prospective cohort study [(128)](#reference128). After approximately four years of follow-up in 19,496 men and women (ages 45-79 years), a dose-response relationship was observed such that each 20 mol/L increase in plasma vitamin C was associated with an estimated 20% risk reduction in all-cause mortality. Similarly, higher [serum](../glossary#serum) vitamin C concentrations were associated with decreased risks of cancer-specific and all-cause mortality in 16,008 adults from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES) III nonsurgical procedure for treating obstructive [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) (CHD), including [angina pectoris](../health-disease/angina-pectoris), acute [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack), and multivessel CHD. Angioplasty involves temporarily inserting and inflating a tiny balloon into the clogged artery to help restore the blood flow to the heart. Periprocedural myocardial injury that occurs in up to one-third of patients undergoing otherwise uncomplicated angioplasty increases the [risk](../glossary#risk) of morbidity and mortality at follow-up. One [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial has examined the effect of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C administered to patients with stable angina undergoing elective coronary angioplasty [(130)](#reference130). Administration of a 1-gram (g) vitamin C infusion one hour prior to the angioplasty reduced the concentrations of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) markers and improved microcirculatory perfusion compared to placebo [(130)](#reference130). Another trial randomized 532 patients to receive a 3-g vitamin C infusion or a placebo (saline solution) within six hours prior to coronary angioplasty [(131)](#reference131). Vitamin C treatment substantially reduced the incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury, as assessed by a reduction in the concentrations of two markers of myocardial injury, namely creatine kinase and troponin-I [(131)](#reference131). A recent [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) assessed the effect of vitamin C and vitamin E administration on reperfusion damage in patients who experienced acute myocardial infarction and coronary angioplasty (see below) [(132)](#reference132). Myocardial reperfusion injury: Reperfusion injury refers to tissue damage occurring at the time of blood flow restoration (reperfusion) following transient [ischemia](../glossary#ischemia). The heart muscle may become oxygen-deprived (ischemic) as the result of [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or with aortic clamping during [coronary artery bypass graft](../glossary#coronary-artery-bypass-graft) (CABG) surgery. Increased generation of [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species) (ROS) when the heart muscle's oxygen supply is restored might be an important contributor to myocardial damage occurring at reperfusion [(133)](#reference133). Myocardial reperfusion injury (see [Atrial fibrillation](#atrial-fibrillation)) and [myocardial stunning](../glossary#myocardial-stunning). Vitamin C is depleted during and following cardiac surgery [(134)](#reference134) and this might be due to the direct quenching of ROS, the regeneration of other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), Two [randomized controlled reported a reduction in reperfusion-induced [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and myocardial injury with [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) [(136)](#reference136) or oral [(137)](#reference137) vitamin C administration prior to CABG surgery (reviewed in [135](#reference135)). A more recent randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial has been designed to examine the effect of vitamin C and vitamin E administration on ischemia-reperfusion damage in 99 patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing coronary angioplasty [(132)](#reference132). Vitamin C infusion (sodium ascorbate: 3.20 mmol/min for 1 hour then 0.96 mmol/min for 2 hours) prior to reperfusion followed by oral supplementation with vitamin C (1 g/day) and vitamin E (400 IU/day) for 84 days effectively prevented a reduction in antioxidant capacity at reperfusion and for the next six to eight hours. The protocol also limited microvascular dysfunction (i.e., improved microcirculatory perfusion) and improved left ventricular ejection fraction at discharge (on day 84) [(138, 139)](#reference138). However, no difference in the infarct size between antioxidant vitamin treatment and placebo was seen [(138)](#reference138). [Atrial fibrillation: ] [Atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) is the most common type of [cardiac arrhythmia](../health-disease/arrhythmia). It is also a common post-cardiac surgery complication, leading to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) morbidity (e.g., [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke)) [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) and [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have reported an overall reduction in the risk of post-operative atrial fibrillation following administration of primarily oral vitamin C [(140-142)](#reference140). In most trials, participants received 2 g of vitamin C prior to undergoing CABG or valve replacement surgery and 1 to 2 g/day for five days post-surgery. Although only a minority of trials delivered vitamin C [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous), this administration route appeared to be more effective at reducing the risk of atrial fibrillation \u2014 presumably due to higher [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations achieved [(140)](#reference140). Of note, a subgroup analysis in one of the meta-analyses showed a reduction of post-operative atrial fibrillation with vitamin C in non US-based trials (10 trials) but no effect of vitamin C in US-based trials (5 trials) [(140)](#reference140). A small [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) performed in 60 [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) patients showed that [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C administration (500 mg/day for 10 days, initiated day 1 post-stroke) had no effect on serum markers of [oxidative [(143)](#reference143). [Cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) is the leading cause of death in individuals with [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). The role of increased [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative stress) in the occurrence of vascular complications in subjects with diabetes has led to [hypothesis](../glossary#hypothesis) that higher intakes of [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients could help lower the [risk](../glossary#risk) of CVD in diabetic subjects [(144)](#reference144). A 2018 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) investigating the effect of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes found that most improvement in markers of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and blood [glucose](../glossary#glucose) control could be attributed to [vitamin E](vitamin-E) [(145)](#reference145). Another meta-analysis of trials found no effect of vitamins E and C, alone or in combination, on measures of -cell function and [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance) [(146)](#reference146). Yet, most studies were small and of short duration and thus did not assess the consequence of long-term use of antioxidant vitamins on the risk of vascular complications in diabetic patients. One 12-month randomized [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 456 participants with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin examined the effect of vitamin C (500 mg/day) or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin; 100 mg/day) on risk factors for diabetes-related complications such as CVD [(147)](#reference147). Both vitamin C and aspirin reduced fasting blood glucose and [HbA1c](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) concentrations and improved blood [lipid](../glossary#lipid) profile in metformin-treated patients. Compared to placebo, both treatments were found to be more likely to limit risk factors contributing to diabetes-related complications, as well as to lower the risk of future cardiovascular events over a 10-year period (estimated using the Framingham risk score) [(147)](#reference147). Of note, it is possible that genetic differences among diabetic patients influence the effect of vitamin C supplementation on cardiovascular risk. In particular, a specific [allele](../glossary#allele) of the haptoglobin [gene](../glossary#gene) (Hp), namely Hp2, appears to be associated with an increased risk of diabetic vascular complications. Carriers of two copies of the Hp2 allele (Hp2-2) express a Hp [protein](../glossary#protein) that has a lower capacity to bind and remove [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant), free hemoglobin (Hb) from [plasma](../glossary#plasma), compared to Hp proteins coded by the Hp1-1 and Hp1-2 [genotypes](../glossary#genotype). When the results of the Women's Antioxidant Vitamin Estrogen (WAVE) trial were reanalyzed based on Hp genotype, antioxidant therapy (1,000 mg/day of vitamin C + 800 IU/day of vitamin E) was associated with improvement of coronary [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) in diabetic women with Hp1-1 genotype but worsening of coronary atherosclerosis in those carrying the Hp2-2 genotype [(148)](#reference148). Results from another study by the same investigators suggested that vitamin C could not prevent the [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) of vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) nor restore impaired HDL function in diabetic mice carrying the Hp2-2 genotype [(149)](#reference149). Sepsis and septic shock \u2014 defined as persistent sepsis-induced low blood pressure \u2014 are associated with elevated mortality rates in critically ill patients [(150, 151)](#reference150). Because systemic [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) responses involve excessive [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress), it has been suggested that providing [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) nutrients like vitamin C may improve the outcome of critically ill patients in intensive care units. In addition, hypovitaminosis C is common in critically ill patients, especially in those with septic shock, and persists despite enteral/parenteral nutritional therapy providing recommended amounts of vitamin C [(152)](#reference152). Vitamin C requirements are likely to be increased in this population due to the hypermetabolic response driven by the systemic inflammatory reaction [(152, 153)](#reference152). [Intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) administration of 50 mg or 200 mg of vitamin C per kg per day for 96 hours to patients with sepsis admitted in intensive care unit was found to correct vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C also prevented the rise of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores \u2014 used to assess severity of illness and [risk](../glossary#risk) of mortality \u2014 observed in [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-treated patients [(154)](#reference154). Vitamin C infusion also lowered the concentration of markers of inflammation and endothelial injury in patients compared to placebo [(154)](#reference154). In another [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trial in 28 critically ill patients with septic shock, infusion of 25 mg of vitamin C per kg every six hours for 72 hours significantly limited the requirement to vasopressor norepinephrine \u2014 decreasing both the dose and duration of treatment \u2014 and dramatically improved the 28-day survival rate [(155)](#reference155). Similar results have been reported in septic patients given intravenous vitamin C (1.5 g/6 h), hydrocortisone (50 mg/6 h), and [thiamin](thiamin) (200 mg/12 h) until hospital discharge. Compared to standard-of-care, this intervention cocktail more than halved the mean duration of vasopressor use (18.3 h versus 54.9 h) and reduced the odds of mortality by nearly 90% [(156)](#reference156). Although intravenous vitamin C administration appears to be safe and well tolerated, there is a non-negligible risk of oxalate [nephropathy](../glossary#nephropathy) (a rare cause of kidney failure) in these critically ill patients [(157)](#reference157). See also the section on Sepsis in the [Symposium on Vitamin C \u2014 Part of the LPI's 9th International Conference on Diet and Optimum Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5745504/). Studies in the 1970s and 1980s conducted by Linus Pauling, Ewan Cameron, and colleagues suggested that large doses of vitamin C (10 g/day infused [intravenously](../glossary#intravenous) for 10 days followed by at least 10 g/day orally indefinitely) were helpful in increasing the survival time and improving the quality of life of terminal [cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients [(158)](#reference158). Controversy surrounding the efficacy of vitamin C in cancer treatment ensued, leading to the recognition that the route of vitamin C administration is critical [(22](#reference22), [159)](#reference159). Compared to orally administered vitamin C, intravenous vitamin C can result in 30 to 70-fold higher plasma vitamin C concentrations [(25)](#reference25). Higher plasma concentrations achieved via intravenous vitamin C administration are comparable to those that are toxic to cancer cells in culture. The anticancer mechanism of intravenous vitamin C action is under investigation. It may involve the production of high levels of hydrogen peroxide, selectively toxic to cancer cells [(22](#reference22), [160-162)](#reference160), or the deactivation of hypoxia inducible factor, a prosurvival [transcription factor](../glossary#transcription-factor) that protects cancer cells from various forms of stress [(159](#reference159), [163, 164)](#reference163). Vitamin C likely also plays a role in the maintenance of genome integrity and in the protection against cellular transformation through regulating DNA and histone demethylating enzymes (see [Function](#function)) [(165)](#reference165). Current evidence from controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) indicates that [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C is generally safe and well tolerated in cancer patients. Of note, because intravenous administration of 80 g of vitamin C precipitated [hemolytic anemia](../glossary#hemolytic-anemia) in two subjects with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, patients due to receive high-dose vitamin C infusion are systematically screened for this genetic disorder [(166)](#reference166). Four [phase I clinical trials](../glossary#phase-I-clinical-trial) in patients with advanced cancer found that intravenous administration of vitamin C at doses up to 1.5 g/kg of body weight (equivalent to about 100 g/day for an average weight [70 kg] person) and 70 to 80 g/m2 was well tolerated and safe in pre-screened patients [(167-170)](#reference167). A few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy reported that complementary intravenous vitamin C treatment was associated with a reduction in treatment-associated side effects and an improved quality of life [(171)](#reference171). A phase I study in nine patients with [metastatic](../glossary#metastasize) [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) cancer showed that millimolar concentrations of plasma vitamin C could be reached safely when administered in conjunction with the cancer chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and erlotinib [(168)](#reference168). Retrospective [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) colony formation assays revealed that patient leukemic cells displayed variable sensitivity to vitamin C treatment: leukemic cells from seven out of the nine patients who experienced a significant clinical benefit were sensitive to vitamin C in vitro (i.e., \"responders\"); the leukemic cells from the remaining six patients were not sensitive to vitamin C (i.e., \"non-responders\"). Thus, in vitro vitamin C sensitivity assays may provide predictive value for the clinical response to intravenous vitamin C treatment. The mechanisms underlying differential sensitivity to vitamin C are under investigation. In vitro experiments performed using 11 different cancer cell lines demonstrated that sensitivity to vitamin C correlated with the expression of catalase, an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) involved in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide [(172)](#reference172). Approximately one-half of the cell lines tested were resistant to vitamin C cytotoxicity, a response associated with high levels of catalase activity. Sensitivity to vitamin C may also be determined by the expression of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter-2 (SVCT-2), which transports vitamin C into cells [(173)](#reference173). Higher SVCT-2 levels were associated with enhanced sensitivity to vitamin C in nine different breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, SVCT-2 was significantly expressed in 20 breast cancer tissue samples, but weakly expressed in normal tissues. Finally, mutations in genes coding for vitamin C-dependent TET demethylases, mutations that are common in cancer cells, may also contribute to resistance to vitamin C treatment [(165)](#reference165). Current evidence of the efficacy of [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C in [cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients is limited uncontrolled [interventions](../glossary#intervention-study), and [case reports](../glossary#case-report) need for larger, longer-duration [phase II clinical trials](../glossary#phase-II-clinical-trial) that test the efficacy of intravenous vitamin C in disease progression and overall survival [(176)](#reference176). See also the section on Cancer in the [Symposium on Vitamin C \u2014 Part of the LPI's 9th International Conference on Diet and Optimum Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5745504/). The work of Linus Pauling stimulated public interest in the use of doses greater than 1 g/day of vitamin C to prevent the common cold [(177)](#reference177). In the past 40 years, numerous [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials have examined the effect of vitamin C [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on the prevention and treatment of colds. A 2013 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 53 placebo-controlled trials evaluated the effect of vitamin C supplementation on the incidence, duration, or severity of the common cold when taken as a continuous daily supplement (43 trials) or as therapy upon onset of cold symptoms (10 trials) [(178)](#reference178). Regarding the incidence of colds, a difference was observed between two groups of participants. Regular supplementation with vitamin C (0.25 to 2 g/day) did not reduce the incidence of colds in the general population (23 trials); however, in participants undergoing heavy physical stress (e.g., marathon runners, skiers, or soldiers in subarctic conditions), vitamin C supplementation halved the incidence of colds (5 trials). A benefit of regular vitamin C supplementation was also seen in the duration of colds, with a greater benefit in children than in adults: The pooled effect of vitamin C supplementation was a 14% reduction in cold duration in children and an 8% reduction in adults. Finally, no significant effect of vitamin C supplementation (1-8 g/day) was observed in therapeutic trials in which vitamin C was administered after cold symptoms occurred. In addition, a 2013 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) by the same investigators identified only two small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trials that examined the effect of vitamin C on the incidence of respiratory infection-induced [asthma](../glossary#asthma) [(179)](#reference179). One trial found that vitamin C supplementation (1 g/day) for 14 weeks reduced the [risk](../glossary#risk) of asthma attacks precipitated by respiratory infection. The other trial randomized subjects diagnosed with infection-related asthma to receive 5 g/day of vitamin C or a placebo for one week; a lower proportion of participants was found to present with bronchial hypersensitivity to histamine \u2014 which characterizes chronic asthma \u2014 in the vitamin C group compared to the control group (reviewed in [179](#reference179)). These observations need to be confirmed in larger, well-designed trials. A 2013 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) identified 11 [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) that evaluated the effect of vitamin C on [asthma](../glossary#asthma) (eight trials) or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (three trials) [(180)](#reference180). Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is a transient narrowing of the airways that occurs after exercise and is indicated by a 10% decline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). In the three trials that included a total of 40 participants with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, vitamin C administration before exercise (a 0.5-g dose on two subsequent days in one trial, a single dose of 2 g in the second trial, and 1.5 g daily for two weeks in the third trial) significantly reduced the exercise-induced decline in FEV1. Among the five out of eight trials in asthmatic subjects that reported on FEV1 outcomes, none found a difference between vitamin C [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) and [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(180)](#reference180). Although the use of lead paint and leaded gasoline has been discontinued in the US, lead toxicity continues to be a significant health problem, especially in children living in urban areas. Abnormal growth and development have been observed in infants of women exposed to lead during pregnancy, while children who are chronically exposed to lead are more likely to develop learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and to have a low IQ. In adults, lead toxicity may result in kidney damage, high blood pressure, and [anemia](../glossary#anemia). Several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have reported an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin C [status](../glossary#status) and blood lead concentration. For instance, in a study of 747 older men, blood lead concentration was significantly higher in those who reported total dietary vitamin C intakes averaging less than 109 mg/day compared to those with higher vitamin C intakes [(181)](#reference181). A much larger study of 19,578 people, including 4,214 children from 6 to 16 years of age, found higher [serum](../glossary#serum) vitamin C concentrations to be associated with significantly lower blood lead concentrations [(182)](#reference182). A US national survey of more than 10,000 adults found that blood lead concentrations were inversely related to serum vitamin C concentrations [(183)](#reference183). Cigarette smoking or second-hand exposure to cigarette smoke contributes to increased blood lead concentration and a state of chronic low-level lead exposure. An [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-study) in 75 adult male smokers found that supplementation with 1,000 mg/day of vitamin C resulted in significantly lower blood lead concentration over a four-week treatment period compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(184)](#reference184). A lower dose of 200 mg/day did not significantly affect blood lead concentration, although serum vitamin C concentrations were not different from those in the group who took 1,000 mg/day. The mechanism(s) by which vitamin C reduces blood lead concentration is not known, yet it has been proposed that vitamin C could inhibit intestinal absorption [(184)](#reference184) or enhance urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of lead [(185)](#reference185). Unlike plants and most animals, humans have lost the ability to [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin C [endogenously](../glossary#endogenous) and therefore have an essential dietary requirement for this vitamin (see [The Recommended Dietary Allowance](#RDA)). Results from 7,277 participants in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 indicated that an estimated 7.1% of individuals ages 6 years were deficient in vitamin C \u2014 based on serum vitamin C concentrations <11.4 mol/L [(36)](#reference36). The national study identified smokers and those of lower socioeconomic status to both be at higher risk for vitamin C deficiency [(36)](#reference36). As shown in Table 3, different [fruit and vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables) vary in their vitamin C content, but five servings (2\u00bd cup-equivalents) of a variety of fruit and vegetables should average out to about 150 to 200 mg of vitamin C, especially if vitamin C-rich fruits are consumed. If you wish to check foods for their vitamin C content, search [USDA's FoodData acid) is available in many forms, but there is little scientific evidence that any one form is better absorbed or more effective than another. Most experimental and clinical research uses ascorbic acid or its sodium salt, called sodium ascorbate. Natural and synthetic L-ascorbic acid are chemically identical and there are no known differences regarding biological activities or [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) [(186)](#reference186). Mineral salts of vitamin C are considered less acidic than vitamin C and therefore are considered \"buffered.\" Some people find them less irritating to the [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) tract than ascorbic acid. Sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are the most common forms, although a number of other mineral ascorbates are available. Sodium ascorbate provides 111 mg of sodium (889 mg of ascorbic acid) per 1,000 mg of sodium ascorbate, and calcium ascorbate generally provides 90 to 110 mg of calcium (890-910 mg of ascorbic acid) per 1,000 mg of calcium ascorbate. Flavonoids are a class of water-soluble plant pigments that are often found in vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables, especially citrus fruit and berries (see the article on [Flavonoids](../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids#food-sources)). There is little evidence that the flavonoids in most commercial preparations increase the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) or efficacy of vitamin C [(187)](#reference187). Some, yet not all, studies in animal models such as vitamin C-deficient guinea pigs or genetically scorbutic rats found an increased uptake of vitamin C in peripheral circulation and specific organs in the presence of flavonoids. However, studies conducted in humans found no differences in bioavailability of vitamin C from flavonoid-rich whole fruit or fruit juice and synthetic vitamin C (reviewed in [186](#reference186)). One supplement, Ester-C\u00ae, contains mainly calcium ascorbate and includes small amounts of the vitamin C [metabolites](../glossary#metabolite), dehydroascorbic acid ( [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) ascorbic acid), calcium threonate, and trace amounts of xylonate and lyxonate. Although these metabolites are purported to increase the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of vitamin C, the only published study in humans addressing this issue found no difference between Ester-C\u00ae and commercially available vitamin C tablets with respect to the absorption and urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of vitamin C [(187)](#reference187). Ester-C\u00ae should not be confused with ascorbyl palmitate, which is also marketed as \"vitamin C ester\" (see below). Ascorbyl palmitate is a vitamin C ester (i.e., ascorbic acid linked to a [fatty acid](../glossary#fatty-acid)). In this case, vitamin C is esterified to the [saturated fatty acid](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid), palmitic acid, resulting in a fat-soluble form of vitamin C. Ascorbyl palmitate has been added to a number of skin creams due to interest in its [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) properties, as well as its importance in [collagen](../glossary#collagen) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) (see the separate article, [Vitamin C and Skin Health](../health-disease/skin-health/vitamin-C)) [(188)](#reference188). Although ascorbyl palmitate is also available as an oral supplement, most of it is likely [hydrolyzed](../glossary#hydrolysis) to ascorbic acid and palmitic acid in the digestive tract before it is absorbed [(189)](#reference189). Ascorbyl palmitate is marketed as \"vitamin C ester,\" which should not be confused with Ester-C\u00ae (see above). One small [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled, [cross-over trial](../glossary#cross-over-trial) in 11 men showed that the oral administration of 4 g of vitamin C resulted in a greater vitamin C concentration in plasma over a four-hour period when vitamin C was encapsulated in liposomes compared to unencapsulated vitamin C [(190)](#reference190). Although liposomal encapsulation could increase vitamin C [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability), plasma vitamin C concentrations were much lower than those achieved with [intravenous](../glossary#intravenous) vitamin C administration [(190)](#reference190). For a more detailed review of scientific research on the bioavailability of different forms of vitamin C, see [The Bioavailability of Different Forms of Vitamin C](vitamin-C/supplemental-forms). A number of possible adverse health effects of very large doses of vitamin C have been identified, mainly based on [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) experiments or isolated [case reports](../glossary#case-report), and deficiency, and erosion of dental enamel. However, none of these alleged adverse health effects have been confirmed in subsequent studies, and there is no reliable scientific evidence that doses of vitamin C up to 10 g/day in adults are toxic or detrimental to health. The concern of kidney stone formation with vitamin C supplementation is discussed [below](#kidney-stones). With the latest [RDA](#RDA) published in 2000, a tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for vitamin C was set for the first time (Table 4). A UL of 2 g (2,000 mg) daily was recommended in order to prevent generally healthy adults from experiencing diarrhea and [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) disturbances [(35)](#reference35). Such symptoms are not generally serious, especially if they resolve with temporary discontinuation of vitamin C supplementation. of intake should be from foods or formula only.| Because oxalate is a [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) of vitamin C, there is some concern that high vitamin C intake could increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of calcium oxalate [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones). Some [(24](#reference24), [191, not all have reported that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C increases urinary oxalate concentrations. Whether any increase in oxalate levels would translate to an elevation in risk for kidney stones has been examined in several [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study). Two large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), one following 45,251 men for six years and the other following 85,557 women for 14 years, reported that consumption of 1,500 mg of vitamin C daily did not increase the risk of kidney stone formation compared to those consuming <250 mg daily [(196, 197)](#reference196). On the other hand, two other large prospective studies reported that a high intake of vitamin C was associated with an increased risk of kidney stone formation in men [(198, 199)](#reference198). Specifically, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study collected data on dietary and supplemental vitamin C intake every four years in 45,619 male health professionals (ages 40-75 years) [(198)](#reference198). After 14 years of follow-up, it was found that men who consumed 1,000 mg/day of vitamin C had a 41% higher risk of kidney stones compared to men consuming <90 mg of vitamin C daily. In the Cohort of Swedish Men study, self-reported use of single-nutrient vitamin C supplements (taken seven or more times per week) at baseline was associated with a two-fold higher risk of incident kidney stones among 48,840 men (ages 45-79 years) followed for 11 years [(199)](#reference199). Despite conflicting results, it may be prudent for individuals predisposed to oxalate kidney stone formation to avoid high-dose vitamin C supplementation. Overall, evidence suggesting specific drugs can lower blood vitamin C concentrations in humans is limited. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., nicardipine, nifedipine) can inhibit vitamin C uptake by intestinal cells [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro). However, a reduction in blood vitamin C concentrations with these drugs has not been reported in humans [(200)](#reference200). Aspirin can impair vitamin C [status](../glossary#status) if taken frequently [(201)](#reference201). Conversely, there are [case reports](../glossary#case-report) suggesting that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin C may lower blood concentrations of some medications, such as fluphenazine (the antipsychotic drug, Prolixin) and indinavir (the antiretroviral drug, Crixivan) [(200)](#reference200). There is some evidence, though controversial, that vitamin C interacts with [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) medications like warfarin (Coumadin). Large doses of vitamin C may block the action of warfarin and thus lower its effectiveness. Individuals on anticoagulants should limit their vitamin C intake to <1 g/day and have their prothrombin time monitored by the clinician following their anticoagulant therapy [(200)](#reference200). In addition, vitamin C may bind aluminum in the gut and increase the absorption of aluminum-containing compounds (e.g., aluminum-containing antacids, aluminum-containing phosphate binders). People with impaired kidney function may be at [risk](../glossary#risk) for aluminum toxicity when supplemental vitamin C is taken at the same time as these compounds [(200, 201)](#reference200). Finally, supplemental vitamin C may increase blood [estrogen](../glossary#estrogen) concentrations in women using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy [(200)](#reference200). The potential effect of [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) during [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) is not well understood, yet only likely to be an issue if a specific chemotherapeutic agent acts through an [oxidative](../glossary#oxidation) mechanism, which is uncommon [(171)](#reference171). It is not clear whether vitamin C given parenterally could diminish or increase the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs \u2014 in particular, akylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, busulfan), antitumor antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, bleomycin), and arsenic trioxide. Patients are advised to discuss with their oncologist before using vitamin C supplements [(200, 201)](#reference200). Because high doses of vitamin C have also been found to interfere with the interpretation of certain laboratory tests (e.g., [serum](../glossary#serum) bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the stool guaiac assay for occult blood), it is important to inform one's health care provider of any recent supplement use. A three-year [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 160 patients with documented [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease) and low blood [HDL](../glossary#HDL) concentrations found that a combination of simvastatin (Zocor) and [niacin](niacin) increased HDL concentration, inhibited the progression of [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing), and decreased the frequency of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, such as [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) [(202)](#reference202). Surprisingly, when an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) combination (1,000 mg vitamin C, 800 IU vitamin E, 100 \u00b5g selenium, and 25 mg -carotene daily) was taken with the simvastatin-niacin combination, the protective effects were diminished. Since the antioxidants were taken together in this trial, the individual contribution of vitamin C cannot be determined. In contrast, a much larger trial in more than 20,000 men and women with coronary heart disease or [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) found that simvastatin and an antioxidant combination (600 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C, and 20 mg -carotene daily) did not diminish the cardioprotective effects of simvastatin therapy over a five-year period [(203)](#reference203). These contradictory findings indicate that further research is needed on potential interactions between antioxidant supplements and [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering drugs, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Vitamin C is known to function as a highly effective [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) in living organisms. However, in test tube experiments, vitamin C can interact with some free metal [ions](../glossary#ion) and lead to the generation of potentially damaging [free radicals](../glossary#free-radical). Although free metal ions are not generally found under physiological conditions, the idea that high doses of vitamin C might be able to promote [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) [in vivo](../glossary#in-vivo) has received a great deal of attention. Widespread publicity has been given to a few studies suggesting a [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant) effect of vitamin C [(204, 205)](#reference204), but these studies turned out to be either flawed or of no physiological relevance. A comprehensive review of the literature found no credible scientific evidence that supplemental vitamin C promotes oxidative damage under physiological conditions or in humans [(206)](#reference206). Combined evidence from [metabolic](../glossary#metabolism), [pharmacokinetic](../glossary#pharmacokinetics), and [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), and from [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) supports consuming sufficient vitamin C to achieve plasma concentrations of at least 60 mol/L. While most generally healthy young adults can achieve these plasma concentrations with daily vitamin C intake of at least 200 mg/day, some individuals may have a lower vitamin C absorptive capacity than what is currently documented. Thus, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends a vitamin C intake of 400 mg daily for adults to ensure replete tissue concentrations [(29)](#reference29) \u2014 an amount substantially higher than the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) yet with minimal risk of side effects. This recommendation can be met through food if the diet includes at least several servings of vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables (e.g., citrus fruit, kiwifruit, peppers; see [Food sources](#food-sources)) as part of the daily recommended fruit and vegetable intake (see article on [Fruit and Vegetables](../food-beverages/fruit-vegetables#intake-recommendations)). Most multivitamin supplements provide at least 60 mg of vitamin C. Whether older adults have higher requirements for vitamin C is not yet known with certainty, yet some older populations have been found to have vitamin C intakes considerably below the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of 75 and 90 mg/day for women and men, respectively [(207)](#reference207). A vitamin C intake of at least 400 mg daily may be particularly important for older adults who are at higher [risk](../glossary#risk) for age-related [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease). [Pharmacokinetic](../glossary#pharmacokinetics) studies in older adults have not yet been conducted, but there is some evidence suggesting that the efficiency of one of the molecular mechanisms for the cellular uptake of vitamin C declines with age [(208)](#reference208). Because maximizing blood concentrations of vitamin C may be important in protecting against [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to cells and biological molecules, a vitamin C intake of at least 400 mg daily might benefit older adults who are at higher risk for chronic diseases caused, in part, by oxidative damage, such as heart disease, [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), certain [cancers](../glossary#cancer), and [cataract](../glossary#cataract).

Bioavailability refers to the degree to which a nutrient (or drug) becomes available to the target tissue after it has been administered. We reviewed the literature for the results of scientific research on the bioavailability of different forms of vitamin C. Natural and synthetic L-ascorbic acid are chemically identical, and there are no known differences in their biological activity. The possibility that the bioavailability of L-ascorbic acid from natural sources might differ from that of synthetic ascorbic acid was investigated in at least two human studies, and no clinically significant differences were observed. A study of 12 males (6 smokers and 6 nonsmokers) found the bioavailability of synthetic ascorbic acid (powder administered in water) to be slightly superior to that of orange juice, based on blood levels of ascorbic acid, and not different based on ascorbic acid in [leukocytes](../../glossary#leukocyte) (white blood cells) [(1)](#references). A study in 68 male nonsmokers found that ascorbic acid consumed in cooked broccoli, orange juice, orange slices, and as synthetic ascorbic acid tablets are equally bioavailable, as measured by [ plasma](../../glossary#plasma) ascorbic acid levels [(2, 3)](#reference2). The [ gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) absorption of ascorbic acid occurs through an active transport process, as well as through passive diffusion. At low gastrointestinal concentrations of ascorbic acid active transport predominates, while at high gastrointestinal concentrations active transport becomes saturated, leaving only passive diffusion. In theory, slowing down the rate of stomach emptying (e.g., by taking ascorbic acid with food or taking a slow-release form of ascorbic acid) should increase its absorption. While the bioavailability of ascorbic acid appears equivalent whether it is in the form of powder, chewable tablets, or non-chewable tablets, the bioavailability of ascorbic acid from slow-release preparations is less certain. A study of three men and one woman found 1 gram of ascorbic acid to be equally well absorbed from solution, tablets, and chewable tablets, but the absorption from a timed-release capsule was 50% lower. Absorption was assessed by measuring urinary excretion of ascorbic acid after an intravenous dose of ascorbic acid and then comparing it to urinary excretion after the oral dosage forms [(4)](#reference4). A more recent study examined the plasma levels of ascorbic acid in 59 male smokers supplemented for two months with either 500 mg/day of slow-release ascorbic acid, 500 mg/day of plain ascorbic acid, or a [placebo](../../glossary#placebo). After two months of supplementation no significant differences in plasma ascorbic acid levels between the slow-release and plain ascorbic acid groups were found [(5)](#reference5). A second placebo-controlled trial also evaluated plain ascorbic acid versus slow-release ascorbic acid in 48 male smokers [(6)](#reference6). Participants were supplemented with either 250 mg plain ascorbic acid, 250 mg slow-release ascorbic acid, or placebo twice daily for four weeks. No differences were observed in the change in plasma ascorbate concentration or area under the curve following ingestion of either formulation. [Mineral](../../glossary#mineral) salts of ascorbic acid (mineral ascorbates) are less [acidic](../../glossary#acidic), and therefore, considered \"buffered.\" Thus, mineral ascorbates are often recommended to people who experience [gastrointestinal](../../glossary#gastrointestinal) problems (upset stomach or diarrhea) with plain ascorbic acid. There appears to be little scientific research to support or refute the claim that mineral ascorbates are less irritating to the gastrointestinal tract. When mineral salts of ascorbic acid are taken, both the ascorbic acid and the mineral appear to be well absorbed, so it is important to consider the dose of the mineral accompanying the ascorbic acid when taking large doses of mineral ascorbates. For the following discussion, it should be noted that 1 gram (g)= 1,000 milligrams (mg) and 1 milligram (mg) = 1,000 micrograms (g). Mineral ascorbates are available in the following forms: The following mineral ascorbates are more likely to be found in combination with other mineral ascorbates, as well as other minerals. It's a good idea to check the labels of dietary supplements for the ascorbic acid dose as well as the dose of each mineral. Recommended dietary intakes and maximum upper levels of intake (when available) are listed after the individual mineral ascorbates below: Bioflavonoids or [flavonoids](../../dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids) are polyphenolic compounds found in plants. Vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables, especially citrus fruit, are often rich sources of flavonoids as well. The effect of bioflavonoids on the bioavailability of ascorbic acid has been recently reviewed [(7)](#reference7). Results from the 10 clinical studies comparing the absorption of vitamin C alone or vitamin C in flavonoid-containing foods showed no appreciable differences in bioavailability of ascorbic acid. Only one study, which included five men and three women, found that a 500-mg supplement of synthetic ascorbic acid, given in a natural citrus extract containing bioflavonoids, proteins, and carbohydrates, was more slowly absorbed and 35% more bioavailable than synthetic ascorbic acid alone, when based on plasma levels of ascorbic acid [(8)](#reference8). The remaining studies showed either no change or slightly lower plasma ascorbate levels in subjects who consumed vitamin C with flavonoids compared to flavonoids alone [(7)](#reference7). Another assessment of vitamin C bioavailability is measuring urinary ascorbate levels to approximate rates of vitamin C excretion. One study in six young Japanese males (22-26 years old) showed a significant reduction in urinary excretion of ascorbic acid in the presence of acerola juice, a natural source of both vitamin C and flavonoids [(9)](#reference9). However, three separate studies showed that urinary levels of vitamin C were increased after consumption of kiwifruit [(10)](#reference10), blackcurrant juice [(11)](#reference11), or orange juice [(1)](#references). Overall, the impact of flavonoids on the bioavailability of vitamin C seems to be negligible; however, there is a need for carefully controlled studies using specific flavonoid extracts [(7)](#reference7). Ester-C\u00ae contains mainly calcium ascorbate, but also contains small amounts of the vitamin C metabolites, dehydroascorbic acid (oxidized ascorbic acid), calcium threonate, and trace levels of xylonate and lyxonate. In their literature, the manufacturers state that the metabolites, especially threonate, increase the bioavailability of the vitamin C in this product, and they indicate that they have performed a study in humans that demonstrates the increased bioavailability of vitamin C in Ester-C\u00ae. This study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. A small published study of vitamin C bioavailability in eight women and one man found no difference between Ester-C\u00ae and commercially available ascorbic acid tablets with respect to the absorption and urinary excretion of vitamin C [(12)](#reference12). Ester-C\u00ae should not be confused with ascorbyl palmitate, which is also marketed as \"vitamin C ester\" (see below). Ascorbyl palmitate is a fat-soluble [antioxidant](../../glossary#antioxidant) used to increase the shelf life of vegetable oils and potato chips [(13)](#reference13). It is an amphipathic molecule, meaning one end is water-soluble and the other end is fat-soluble. This dual solubility allows it to be incorporated into [cell membranes](../../glossary#cell-membrane). When incorporated into the cell membranes of human red blood cells, ascorbyl palmitate has been found to protect them from oxidative damage and to protect -tocopherol (a fat-soluble antioxidant) from oxidation by free radicals [(14)](#reference14). However, the protective effects of ascorbyl palmitate on cell membranes have only been demonstrated in the test tube. Taking ascorbyl palmitate orally probably doesn't result in any significant incorporation into cell membranes because most of it appears to be hydrolyzed (broken apart into palmitate and ascorbic acid) in the human digestive tract before it is absorbed. The ascorbic acid released by the hydrolysis of ascorbyl palmitate appears to be as bioavailable as ascorbic acid alone [(15)](#reference15). The presence of ascorbyl palmitate in oral supplements contributes to the ascorbic acid content of the supplement and probably helps protect fat-soluble antioxidants in the supplement. The roles of vitamin C in promoting collagen synthesis and as an antioxidant have generated interest in its use on the skin (see the article, [Vitamin C and Skin Health](../../micronutrients-health/skin-health/nutrient-index/vitamin-C)). Ascorbyl palmitate is frequently used in topical preparations because it is more stable than some aqueous (water-soluble) forms of vitamin C [(16)](#reference16). Ascorbyl palmitate is also marketed as vitamin C ester,\" which should not be confused with Ester-C\u00ae (see above). Erythorbic acid is an [isomer](../../glossary#isomer) of ascorbic acid. Isomers are compounds that have the same kinds and numbers of atoms, but different molecular arrangements. The difference in molecular arrangement among isomers may result in different chemical properties. Erythorbic acid is used in the US as an antioxidant food additive and is generally recognized as safe. It has been estimated that more than 200 mg erythorbic acid per capita is introduced daily into the US food system. Unlike ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid does not appear to exert vitamin C activity, for example, it did not prevent scurvy in guinea pigs (one of the few animal species other than humans that does not synthesize ascorbic acid). However, guinea pig studies also indicated that increased erythorbic acid intake reduced the bioavailability of ascorbic acid by up to 50%. In contrast, a series of studies in young women found that up to 1,000 mg/day of erythorbic acid for as long as 40 days was rapidly cleared from the body and had little effect on the bioavailability of ascorbic acid, indicating that erythorbic acid does not diminish the bioavailability of ascorbic acid in humans at nutritionally relevant levels of intake [(17)](#reference17). PureWay-C\u00ae is composed of vitamin C and [lipid](../../glossary#lipid) [metabolites](../../glossary#metabolite). Two cell culture studies using PureWay-C\u00ae have been published by the same investigators [(18, 19)](#reference18), but [in vivo](../../glossary#in-vivo) data are currently lacking. A small study in healthy adults found that [serum](../../glossary#serum) levels of vitamin C did not differ when a single oral dose (1 gram) of either PureWay-C\u00ae or ascorbic acid was administered [(20)](#reference20). Another formulation of vitamin C, liposomal-encapsulated vitamin C (e.g., Lypo-spheric vitamin C) is now commercially available. One report suggested that liposomal-encapsulated vitamin C may be better absorbed than the vitamin in a non-encapsulated form [(21)](#reference21). Large-scale, [pharmacokinetic](../../glossary#pharmacokinetics) studies are needed to determine how the bioavailability of these vitamin C formulations compares to that of ascorbic acid. 1.

In developing his recommendations, he used cross-species comparisons, evolutionary arguments, the concept of biochemical individuality, and the amount of vitamin C likely consumed in a raw plant food diet. Using this approach, Dr. Pauling suggested in the early 1970s that the optimum daily intake may be about 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C and that everyone should get at least 200 to 250 mg/day. In a 1974 radio interview, he noted that \"the first 250 mg is more important than any later 250 mg. The first 250 mg leads you up to the level where the blood is saturated. You can achieve a higher volume [concentration] in the blood by a larger intake, but you get much better improvement for the first 250 mg than for additional grams.\" Dr. Pauling significantly increased his recommendation in his 1986 book How To Live Longer and Feel Better. At the Linus Pauling Institute, we have based our vitamin C recommendations on the current body of scientific evidence, which is significantly greater than it was at Pauling's time but remains incomplete owing to the many diverse functions of vitamin C in the human body that have yet to be fully understood. In this context, it is important to note that data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have indicated that vitamin C levels in plasma and circulating cells become fully saturated at intakes of about 400 mg/day in young, healthy nonsmokers. These observations are consistent with other data that intakes of about 400 mg/day are associated with reduced risk of heart disease. While these NIH studies are the best we currently have regarding the pharmacokinetics of vitamin C in the human body, they have numerous limitations, including the fact that they are based on a small number of young, healthy men and women. We currently do not know how much vitamin C is required to achieve saturation of cells and tissues in children, older adults, and diseased or stressed individuals. A meta-analysis of 36 studies on the relationship between vitamin C intake and plasma concentrations found that the elderly require a substantially higher daily intake of vitamin C to attain plasma concentrations that younger adults achieve at a lower intake. Additionally, work by Linus Pauling Institute investigators has shown that cellular uptake of vitamin C declines with age, supporting the notion that vitamin C requirements are increased in the elderly. Therefore, the Linus Pauling Institute's intake recommendation of 400 mg/day of vitamin C for generally healthy adults takes into account the currently available epidemiological, biochemical, and clinical evidence, while acknowledging the extremely low toxicity of vitamin C and the incomplete information regarding optimum intake. It should also be noted that the Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation is strictly directed towards prevention of disease in healthy individuals, not treatment of disease. Thus, individuals suffering from certain diseases may require substantially larger amounts of vitamin C to achieve optimum body levels or derive therapeutic benefits, areas that were of great interest to Linus Pauling and need to be further explored. Contents Vitamin D is a fat-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin) that regulates [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) and is vital for bone health [(1)](#references). While it can also be obtained from dietary sources or [supplements](../glossary#supplement), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) in the human skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol upon exposure to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation from sunlight (see the separate article on [Vitamin D and Skin Health](../health-disease/skin-health/vitamin-D)). Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is a vitamin D [analog](../glossary#analog) photosynthesized in plants, mushrooms, and yeasts; vitamin D2 is also sometimes used in vitamin D food [fortification](../glossary#fortification) [(2)](#reference2). When vitamin D3 in skin is inadequate due to insufficient exposure to UVB radiation, oral intake of vitamin D is necessary to meet vitamin D requirements. Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol are biologically inactive [precursors](../glossary#precursor) of vitamin D and must be converted to biologically active forms in the liver and kidneys (Figure 1). Indeed, following dietary intake or [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) in the [epidermis](../glossary#epidermis) of skin after UVB exposure, both forms of vitamin D enter the circulation and are transported to the liver by the vitamin D-binding [protein](../glossary#protein) (and to a lesser extent by albumin). In [hepatocytes](../glossary#hepatocyte) (liver cells), vitamin D is [hydroxylated](../glossary#hydroxylation) to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol; calcifediol). Exposure to sunlight or dietary intake of vitamin D increases [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D constitutes the major circulating form of vitamin D, and the sum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations in serum is used as an indicator of vitamin D nutritional status [(3)](#reference3). The [renal](../glossary#renal) 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) (also known hydroxylation that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). The production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidneys is regulated by several factors, including serum [phosphorus](../minerals/phosphorus), [calcium](../minerals/calcium), parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D itself. While the kidney is the main source of 1-hydroxylase activity, extra-renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has also been demonstrated in a variety of tissues, including skin, [parathyroid gland](../glossary#parathyroid-glands), breast, [colon](../glossary#colon), [prostate](../glossary#prostate), as well as cells of the immune system and bone cells [(2)](#reference2). Most of the physiological effects of vitamin D in the body are related to the activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [(4)](#reference4). Various forms of vitamin D are listed in Figure 1. Most, if not all, actions of vitamin D are mediated through a nuclear [transcription factor](../glossary#transcription-factor) known as the vitamin D [receptor](../glossary#receptor) (VDR) (Figure 2) [(5)](#reference5). Upon entering the [nucleus](../glossary#nucleus) of a cell, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D binds to the VDR and recruits another nuclear receptor known as retinoid X receptor (RXR). In the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the VDR/RXR complex binds small sequences of [DNA](../glossary#DNA) known as vitamin D [response elements](../glossary#response-element) (VDREs) and initiates a cascade of molecular interactions that modulate the [transcription](../glossary#transcription) of specific [genes](../glossary#gene). Thousands of VDREs have been identified throughout the [genome](../glossary#genome), and VDR activation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is thought to directly and/or indirectly regulate 100 to 1,250 genes [(6)](#reference6). Maintenance of [serum](../glossary#serum) [calcium](../minerals/calcium) concentrations within a narrow range is vital for normal functioning of the nervous system, as well as for bone growth and maintenance of bone density. Vitamin D is essential for the efficient utilization of calcium by the body [(1)](#references). The [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands) sense serum calcium concentrations and secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) if calcium concentrations decrease below normal (Figure 3). Elevations in PTH stimulate the activity of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) in the kidney, resulting in the increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The active vitamin D form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, is released into the circulation and transported to target tissues. Within target cells, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D binds to and induces the activation of VDR, which leads to changes in [gene expression](../glossary#gene-expression) that normalize serum calcium by (1) increasing the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, (2) increasing the reabsorption of calcium filtered by the kidneys, and (3) mobilizing calcium from bone when there is insufficient dietary calcium to maintain normal serum calcium concentrations [(7)](#reference7). The regulations of calcium and [phosphorus](../minerals/phosphorus) [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) are closely related, and the calciotropic hormones, PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, can also control [serum](../glossary#serum) phosphorus. Specifically, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D increases [intestinal](../glossary#small-intestine) phosphorus absorption by stimulating the expression of a sodium-phosphate cotransporter in the [small intestine](../glossary#small-intestine). While PTH increases urinary [excretion](../glossary#excretion) of phosphorus by reducing reabsorption in the kidney, it is not yet clear whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D can directly regulate renal phosphorus transport. The fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast) (bone-forming production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by inhibiting 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1-hydroxylase (Figure 3) (reviewed in [8](#reference8)). Cells that are dividing rapidly are said to be [proliferating](../glossary#proliferation). [Differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) results in the specialization of cells for specific functions. In general, differentiation of cells leads to a decrease in proliferation. While cellular proliferation is essential for growth and wound healing, uncontrolled proliferation of cells with certain [mutations](../glossary#mutation) may lead to [cancer](../glossary#cancer). The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, inhibits proliferation and stimulates the differentiation of cells through binding to the VDR [(1)](#references). Acting through the VDR, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is a potent immune system modulator. The VDR is expressed by most cells of the immune system, including regulatory T cells and [antigen](../glossary#antigen)-presenting cells, such as [dendritic cells](../glossary#dendritic-cell) and [macrophages](../glossary#macrophage) [(9)](#reference9). Under specific circumstances, [monocytes](../glossary#monocyte), T cells can express the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) and produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which acts locally to regulate the immune response [(10, 11)](#reference10). There is considerable scientific evidence that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has a variety of effects on immune system function, which may enhance [innate immunity](../health-disease/immunity#innate-immunity) and inhibit the development of [autoimmunity](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) [(12)](#reference12). Conversely, vitamin D deficiency may compromise the integrity of the immune system and lead to inappropriate immune responses (see [Autoimmune diseases](#autoimmune-diseases-prevention)). The VDR is expressed by [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-secreting cells of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), and the results of animal studies suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D plays a role in insulin secretion under conditions of increased insulin demand [(13, 14)](#reference13). [Cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) suggest that insufficient vitamin D status may have an adverse effect on insulin secretion and [glucose tolerance](../glossary#glucose-tolerance) in type 2 mellitus) (reviewed in [15](#reference15)). The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure [(16)](#reference16). Renin is an [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) that [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the cleavage (splitting) of a small [peptide](../glossary#peptide) (angiotensin I) from a larger [protein](../glossary#protein) (angiotensinogen) produced in liver. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin I to form angiotensin II, a peptide that can increase blood pressure by inducing the constriction of small arteries and by increasing [sodium](../minerals/sodium) and water retention. The rate of angiotensin II [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) is dependent on renin [(17)](#reference17). Research in mice lacking the [gene](../glossary#gene) encoding the VDR indicates that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreases the [expression](../glossary#gene-expression) of the gene encoding renin through its interaction with the VDR [(18)](#reference18). Since inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin system can contribute to the development of [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), achieving adequate vitamin D status may be important for decreasing the [risk](../glossary#risk) of high blood pressure (see [Hypertension](#hypertension-prevention)). In vitamin D deficiency, [calcium](../minerals/calcium) absorption cannot be increased enough to satisfy the body's calcium needs [(4)](#reference4). Consequently, PTH production by the [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands) is increased and calcium is mobilized from the skeleton to maintain normal [serum](../glossary#serum) calcium concentrations \u2014 a condition known as secondary [hyperparathyroidism](../glossary#hyperparathyroidism). Although it has long been known that severe vitamin D deficiency has serious consequences for bone health, research suggests that less obvious states of vitamin D deficiency are common and increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) and various other health problems (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)). In infants and children, severe vitamin D deficiency results in the failure of bone to mineralize. The process of mineralization, which involves the production of crystals of calcium phosphate by bone-forming cells, determines the hardness and strength of bones. Vitamin D deficiency severely affects rapidly growing bones. The growth plates of bones continue to enlarge, but in the absence of adequate mineralization, weight-bearing limbs (arms and legs) become bowed. In infants, [rickets](../glossary#rickets) may result in delayed closure of the fontanels (soft spots) in the skull, and the rib cage may become deformed due to the pulling action of the diaphragm. In severe cases, low [serum](../glossary#serum) calcium concentrations (hypocalcemia) may cause [seizures](../glossary#seizure). Although [fortification](../glossary#fortification) of food has led to complacency regarding vitamin D deficiency, nutritional rickets is still being reported throughout the world [(19, 20)](#reference19). Although adult bones are no longer growing, they are in a constant state of turnover, or \" [remodeling](../glossary#bone-remodeling).\" In adults with severe vitamin D deficiency, the [collagenous bone matrix](../glossary#collagenous-matrix) is preserved, but bone mineral is progressively lost, resulting in a softening of bones ( [osteomalacia](../glossary#osteomalacia)), bone pain, and increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) [(21)](#reference21). Vitamin D deficiency causes muscle weakness and pain in children and adults. Muscle pain and weakness were prominent symptoms of vitamin D deficiency in a study of Arab and Danish Muslim women living in Denmark [(22)](#reference22). In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 150 consecutive patients referred to a clinic in Minnesota for the evaluation of persistent, nonspecific musculoskeletal pain, 93% had [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations equal to or below 20 ng/mL, with a mean concentration of 12.1 ng/mL, which is indicative of vitamin D insufficiency [(23)](#reference23). Loss of muscle strength greatly contributes to increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of falling and bone [fractures](../glossary#fracture), especially in older people [(24)](#reference24). In addition, long-term vitamin D insufficiency may be a contributing factor to [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) in the elderly (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)). Both environmental factors and cultural practices result in variations in vitamin D status: The efficiency of vitamin D [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis), absorption, and [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) also depends on a variety of biological factors: Growing awareness that vitamin D insufficiency has serious health consequences beyond [rickets](../glossary#rickets) and [osteomalacia](../glossary#osteomalacia) highlights the need for accurate assessment of vitamin D nutritional status. It is currently agreed that the measurement of total [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (1 ng/mL corresponding to 2.5 nmol/L) is the best indicator to evaluate vitamin D status. However, high-quality evidence is still needed to ensure that the current cutoff values are optimal to define states of insufficiency and deficiency [(40)](#reference40). Moreover, only recently, efforts have been made toward the standardization of commercially and laboratory-developed 25-hydroxyvitamin D assays, such that guidelines have been developed using largely unstandardized research data [(49)](#reference49). Although laboratory reference values for sufficient vitamin D status were initially based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations from cohorts of healthy individuals, additional studies have suggested that health-based cutoff values aimed at preventing secondary [hyperparathyroidism](../glossary#hyperparathyroidism) and bone loss should be considerably higher. Indeed, while it is considered that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 8 to 10 ng/mL (20 to 25 nmol/L) indicate severe deficiency associated with rickets and osteomalacia, several studies have observed that PTH concentrations [(50, 51)](#reference50) and [calcium](../minerals/calcium) absorption [(52)](#reference52) were not optimized with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations below 32 ng/mL (80 nmol/L). Yet, more recent studies have failed to find threshold values of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in relation to PTH suppression and optimal calcium absorption. On the one hand, a [cross-sectional analysis](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 312,962 clinical samples did not find any evidence of threshold for PTH suppression in the well-fitted curve displaying the [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between paired measurements of serum PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, even with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations beyond 70 ng/mL (175 nmol/L) [(53)](#reference53). This contradicted an analysis of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2003-2006) that estimated maximum PTH suppression for 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 40 ng/mL (100 nmol/L) and above [(54)](#reference54). In addition, both studies identified evidence of mild hyperparathyroidism (serum PTH >65 pg/mL) in individuals with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations well beyond 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), questioning the use of serum PTH as a sensible indicator of vitamin D insufficiency [(53, 54)](#reference53). On the other hand, a randomized, placebo-controlled in postmenopausal women D <20 ng/mL) supplemented with daily vitamin D3 doses from 400 to 4,800 IU found little change (6%) in calcium absorption over a normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration range of 20 to 66 ng/mL [(55)](#reference55). The current cutoffs proposed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) are as follows: deficiency as serum D 12 to 19 ng/mL (30 to 49 nmol/L), and sufficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values of 20 to 50 ng/mL (50 to 125 nmol/L) [(56)](#reference56). The dietary reference intakes ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR), [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) set by the IOM are based on achieving circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (20 to 50 ng/mL) that are adequate to maintain bone health and optimal calcium absorption [(57)](#reference57). Yet, considering the potential role of circulating concentrations lower than 30 ng/mL in the burden of many chronic diseases [(6)](#reference6), the US Endocrine Society has suggested to define cutoff values as follows: deficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), insufficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values of 21 to 29 ng/mL (51 to 74 nmol/L), and sufficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values of 30 to 100 ng/mL (75 to 250 nmol/L) [(40)](#reference40). This alternate target range is supported by some [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study), but it is not based on data from [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(47)](#reference47). With these latter cutoff values, studies from across the world have estimated that hypovitaminosis D is widespread and that children and adults of all ages are equally at [risk](../glossary#risk) of insufficiency and deficiency [(58)](#reference58). Data from supplementation studies indicate that vitamin D intakes of at least 800 to 1,000 IU/day are required by adults living in temperate latitudes to achieve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) [(40)](#reference40). Finally, total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations may not always adequately reflect vitamin D [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) [(59)](#reference59), and additional evidence is needed to improve the determination of vitamin D status in different ethnic populations. In 2010, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the IOM set a Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) based on the amount of vitamin D needed for bone health. While the RDA was increased from the adequate intake (AI) set in 1997, the optimal levels of recommended intakes and [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D to minimize [hyperthyroidism](../glossary#hyperthyroidism) and maximize bone health in the general population remain controversial [(40)](#reference40). The RDA for vitamin D is listed in Table 1 by life stage and gender. |Life Stage||Age||Males||Females| |g/day||IU/day||g/day||IU/day| | Infants ( | In a nine-year follow-up analysis of the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) that included 15,099 participants (of which 77% were Caucasians), [serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D \u2014 standardized as per the methodology developed by the Vitamin D Standardization Program [VDSP] \u2014 were examined in relation to mortality. The analysis suggested an increase in all-cause mortality with decreasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <16 ng/mL [(60)](#reference60). In contrast, the of all-cause mortality varied little for baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in the range of 16 to 40 ng/mL [(60)](#reference60). Similar results were obtained in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that considered the relationship between standardized 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and mortality during a median follow-up period of 10.5 years. The risk of death was found to be 19% higher with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations between 12 and 15.99 ng/mL and 56% higher with concentrations <12 ng/mL compared to the risk associated with concentrations between 30 and 39.99 ng/mL [(61)](#reference61). A meta-analysis of 73 prospective cohort studies, including >800,000 participants, found that the lowest versus highest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was associated with greater risks of all-cause mortality (+35%), mortality due to [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (+35%), randomization to [confounding](../glossary#confounder) and [reverse causation](../glossary#reverse-causation) [(63)](#reference63) \u2014 of data from three large Danish cohorts of 95,766 adults found a significant association of genetically low [plasma](../glossary#plasma) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with all-cause and cancer-related mortality, but not with cardiovascular disease-related mortality [(64)](#reference64). Finally, two meta-analyses of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have suggested a modest reduction in all-cause mortality in older people supplemented with vitamin D and calcium, but not vitamin D alone [(62, 65)](#reference62). Additional [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trials need to examine further whether supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium might help prevent premature death in [replete](../glossary#replete) individuals. Although the causes of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) are [multifactorial](../glossary#multifactorial), vitamin D insufficiency can be an important [etiological](../glossary#etiology) factor in older adults. Osteoporosis affects one-third of women aged 60 to 70 years and two-thirds of women aged 80 years and above [(66)](#reference66). A multinational (18 different countries with latitudes ranging from 64 degrees north to 38 degrees south) survey of more than 2,600 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis revealed that 31% of subjects had 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) [(67)](#reference67). In addition, a [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) that included 111 hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) patients and 73 controls (median age, 83 years) found that lower serum concentrations of both 25-hydroxyvitamin D and vitamin K1 in patients compared to controls were associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip fracture [(68)](#reference68). Without sufficient vitamin D from sun exposure or dietary intake, intestinal calcium absorption can be significantly reduced. This increases PTH secretion by the [parathyroid glands](../glossary#parathyroid-glands); sustained PTH elevation may result in increased [bone resorption](../glossary#bone-resorption), which in turn may increase the risk of osteoporotic fracture [(69)](#reference69). The progressive loss of [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) leading to [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia) (pre-osteoporosis) and [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) is commonly observed in older adults, especially the elderly. The results of a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 23 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) with more than 4,000 participants (mean age, 59 years) showed little evidence for an effect of vitamin D supplementation on BMD at any of the five skeletal sites examined, including lumbar spine, femoral neck, trochanter, forearm, and total body. A significant increase in BMD was reported only at the femoral neck [(70)](#reference70). It was, however, suggested that individuals in this age group would have adequate calcium intake and thus normal bone [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism), explaining the lack of an effect of vitamin D in strengthening bone mass [(71)](#reference71). Conversely, in older individuals, vitamin D supplementation is essential to correct and maintain adequate concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and to prevent secondary [hyperparathyroidism](../glossary#hyperparathyroidism) and BMD loss [(72)](#reference72). A [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed more than 72,000 postmenopausal women in the US for 18 years found that those who consumed at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D from diet and [supplements](../glossary#supplement) had a 37% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporotic](../glossary#osteoporosis) hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) than women who consumed less than 140 IU/day of vitamin D [(73)](#reference73). However, daily supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D3, in combination with 1,000 mg calcium, did not significantly reduce risk of hip fracture compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in 36,282 postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative trial [(74)](#reference74), suggesting that there might be a threshold of vitamin D intake that is necessary to observe reductions in fracture risk. Results of a genetic analysis of data from this trial also suggested that beneficial effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on fracture risk might be limited to women with the lowest genetic risk of low [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) [(75)](#reference75). Yet, this trial has been questioned for reasons that include poor adherence and the fact that participants were allowed to take additional vitamin D and calcium supplements that might have [confounded](../glossary#confounder) the results. In addition, use of hormone replacement therapy was not considered in the study of the effect of vitamin D and calcium on skeletal health in postmenopausal women despite being a major confounding factor in this population [(57](#reference57), [76)](#reference76). Another trial, the Randomised Evaluation of Calcium Or vitamin D (RECORD) study, reported that oral supplemental vitamin D3 (800 IU/day) alone, or in combination with calcium (1,000 mg/day), did not prevent the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures in elderly adults who had already experienced a low-trauma, osteoporotic fracture [(77)](#reference77). In this latter study as well, a number of limitations, including poor adherence and/or the fact that vitamin D supplementation did not raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations to a level that would protect against fractures, might explain the lack of an effect [(78)](#reference78). Despite high adherence to treatment, the incidence of non-vertebral fracture was similar in postmenopausal women supplemented with vitamin D3 (initial dose of 200,000 IU followed by 100,000/month) or placebo for over three years in the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) trial [(79)](#reference79). Nevertheless, the US Preventive Services Task Force that conducted the [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 11 [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trials, including 52,915 older people (of whom 69% were postmenopausal women), found that the supplementation of vitamin D (300-1,000 IU/day) and calcium (500-1,200 mg/day) for up to seven years resulted in a 12% reduction in the risk of any new fracture [(80)](#reference80). Another meta-analysis of 11 randomized, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trials on the effect of vitamin D supplementation in 31,022 individuals (91% women) 65 years and older indicated that those with the highest vitamin D intake (792-2,000 IU/day) had a 30% lower risk of hip fracture and a 14% lower risk of any non-spine fracture [(81)](#reference81). Finally, a third meta-analysis of trials that examined the effect of combined vitamin D and calcium in preventing fractures in older men and postmenopausal women also concluded that the risk of new fractures, including hip fractures, was significantly reduced in those supplemented compared to controls [(82)](#reference82). Interestingly, the three meta-analyses have found that the prevention of fractures by supplemental vitamin D and calcium was limited to institutionalized, older people. Indeed, the risk of fracture was not significantly reduced by vitamin D in community-dwelling seniors [(80-82)](#reference80). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) 1,330 found significantly 25-hydroxyvitamin D in fallers than in non-fallers [(83)](#reference83). Moreover, another meta-analysis of four cohorts from three observational studies reported a modest yet significant [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin D status and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of fall [(83)](#reference83). Several [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined the impact of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength, postural balance, or risk of fall in older subjects. A meta-analysis of these trials found limited evidence of an effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength and mobility, based on only one type of test for each outcome. Nevertheless, in a recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 160 postmenopausal women (ages, 50-65 years) with suboptimal vitamin D status (mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration <20 ng/mL), supplementation with 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 significantly improved vitamin D status, as well as upper and lower limb muscle strength and postural balance parameters [(84, 85)](#reference84). The risks of fall and recurrent falls were found to be two- to three-fold greater in women in the control group than in those supplemented with vitamin D3 [(85)](#reference85). In contrast, another 12-month randomized controlled study in 200 older adults (of which 58% had a baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration <20 ng/mL) showed no benefits regarding lower extremity function or odds of falling in those supplemented with 2,000 IU/day (+/- 10 \u00b5g of calcidiol) compared to those who received 800 IU/day [(86)](#reference86). The recently published post-hoc analysis of the ViDA trial found no differences in odds of falling and number of falls reported by 5,108 community-dwelling participants (ages, 50-84 years) regardless of whether they were randomized to receive supplemental vitamin D (100,000 IU/month, i.e. ~3,350 IU/day) or a placebo for a mean 3.4 years [(79)](#reference79). Most ViDA participants had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations 20 ng/mL, which might at least partly explain the lack of an effect of vitamin D on falls [(87)](#reference87). Overall, the current evidence suggests that vitamin D3 supplements of 800-1,000 IU/day may be helpful in reducing falls and fracture rates in older adults. In order for vitamin D supplementation to be effective in preserving bone health, adequate dietary calcium (1,000 to 1,200 mg/day) should be consumed (see the article on [Calcium](../minerals/calcium)) [(88)](#reference88). [Ecologic studies](../glossary#ecologic-study) first suggested an association between Northern latitudes, vitamin D deficiency, and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) incidence [(89)](#reference89). Since the 1980s, several [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have examined the association of vitamin D intake or status and various types of cancer. A 2013 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 16 prospective studies, including 137,567 subjects, reported an 11% reduction in total cancer incidence and a 17% reduction in cancer mortality with each 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) increase in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Yet, a sex-based subgroup analysis of eight studies found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating vitamin D and cancer mortality in women, but not in men [(90)](#reference90). In addition, increasing evidence suggests that a few variations in the [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for the vitamin D [receptor](../glossary#receptor) (VDR) might influence individual vitamin D status and subsequently modify the susceptibility to site-specific cancers [(91)](#reference91) and influence cancer survival [(92)](#reference92). Finally, many [malignant](../glossary#malignant) tumors have been found to express the VDR, including breast, lung, skin (melanoma), [colon](../glossary#colon), and bone [(93)](#reference93), suggesting that they might be susceptible to the effects of vitamin D. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that biologically active forms of vitamin D, such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and its [analogs](../glossary#analog), upon binding to the VDR, can control cell fate by inhibiting [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and/or inducing cell [differentiation](../glossary#differentiation) or death ( [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis)) of a number of cancerous cell types [(94)](#reference94). The geographic distribution of [colon](../glossary#colon) [cancer](../glossary#cancer) mortality resembles the historical geographic distribution of [rickets](../glossary#rickets) [(95)](#reference95), providing circumstantial evidence that decreased sunlight exposure and diminished vitamin D nutritional status may be related to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of colon cancer. Evidence from observational studies has largely supported this hypothesis. A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), four [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating vitamin D and incidence of [colorectal adenoma](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma) \u2014 a benign tumor that may transform to become [malignant](../glossary#malignant) [(96)](#reference96). The analysis identified a 32% risk reduction between top versus bottom quantiles of [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [(96)](#reference96). Additionally, there is strong evidence from meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies to suggest that higher vitamin D intakes and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are associated with reductions in colorectal cancer risk [(97-99)](#reference97). The most recent meta-analysis of four prospective cohort, 17 [nested case-control](../glossary#nested-case-control-study), and three case-control studies found a 38% reduced risk of colorectal cancer with high versus low quantiles of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [(100)](#reference100). A dose-response analysis estimated that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of ~20 to 30 ng/mL (compared to 12 ng/mL) were associated with a 17% lower risk of colorectal cancer, and the risk was even lower (-35%) with a serum concentration of 55 ng/mL [(100)](#reference100). An earlier dose-response analysis based on five nested case-control studies had estimated that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations 33 ng/mL (compared to 12 ng/mL) were associated with a 50% lower risk of colorectal cancer [(101)](#reference101). However, in a seven-year, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 36,282 postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative study, a combination of supplemental vitamin D3 (400 IU/day) and calcium (1,000 mg/day) did not lower incidence of colorectal cancer [(102)](#reference102). Another [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of vitamin D3 (1,000 IU/day), with or without calcium supplementation (1,200 mg/day), found no reduction in the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence over a three-to-five year period, compared to placebo, after initial adenoma removal in participants [(103)](#reference103). Whether these daily vitamin D doses are too low to detect any effect on cancer incidence is not clear [(101, 104)](#reference101). Additional randomized [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) are needed to assess whether vitamin D supplementation could help prevent colorectal cancer. Moreover, it is uncertain whether genetic variations ( [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism)) in the sequence of [genes](../glossary#gene) involved in vitamin D [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and function can influence the relationship between vitamin D status and risk of colorectal adenoma or colorectal cancer [(105-107)](#reference105). Finally, growing evidence suggests that adequate vitamin D status may be linked to better survival of colorectal cancer patients. A meta-analysis of five prospective studies found a 35% reduced risk of colorectal cancer-specific mortality in cancer patients with higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. A dose-response analysis estimated that every 8 ng/mL increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with a 10% decrease in colorectal cancer mortality [(108)](#reference108). Although [ecologic](../glossary#ecologic-study) evidence suggests that breast [cancer](../glossary#cancer) mortality rises with increasing latitudes and decreasing sunlight exposure [(109)](#reference109), the most current [observational](../glossary#observational-study) data provide little support for an association between vitamin D nutritional status and risk of breast cancer. An early [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of women who participated in the First US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) found that Caucasian women with adequate sunlight exposure and dietary vitamin D intake had a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer 20 years later [(110)](#reference110). Nonetheless, when this study was included in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) with nine more recent prospective studies, there was no significant difference in the risk of developing breast cancer between the highest and lowest levels of vitamin D intakes [(111)](#reference111). Moreover, whether an association exists between circulating vitamin D concentrations and risk of breast cancer is unclear. One meta-analysis of 14 observational studies (9,110 cases and 16,244 controls) reported an overall risk reduction of 16% when the highest quantile of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations was compared to the lowest. This [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) was statistically significant in postmenopausal women but not in premenopausal women [(112)](#reference112). Yet, another meta-analysis that included a similar set of 14 prospective studies (two studies were different) found no overall association [(111)](#reference111). Additionally, a meta-analysis of studies conducted in patients in the early stage of breast cancer identified associations between inadequate vitamin D status and increased risks of recurrence and death [(113)](#reference113). Evidence from [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) is currently too limited to conclude whether vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may reduce breast cancer incidence (reviewed in [114](#reference114)). Nonetheless, three meta-analyses have found an inverse association between circulating vitamin D concentrations and breast cancer-related mortality [(111](#reference111), [115, 116)](#reference115). In one meta-analysis of one [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) and five prospective cohort studies, the highest versus lowest categories of serum vitamin D concentrations was associated with a 33% reduction in mortality; a dose-response analysis found a 12% reduction per 8 ng/mL increase in serum vitamin D [(115)](#reference115). Finally, current evidence does not suggest that specific genetic variations in the [gene](../glossary#gene) coding for the VDR may influence the risk of breast cancer [(117, 118)](#reference117). Evidence associating vitamin D status with other types of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) is currently limited. While incidence of [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer appears to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with the availability of sunlight, [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have not generally found significant relationships between [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and subsequent [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing prostate cancer [(119, 120)](#reference119). In fact, some studies have suggested an increased risk of prostate cancer with higher circulating vitamin D concentrations. For example, a [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) of men (622 cases and 1,451 controls) from Scandinavia found a U-shaped relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and prostate cancer risk. In that study, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 7.6 ng/mL or lower, or 32 ng/mL or higher, were associated with increased prostate cancer risk [(121)](#reference121). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 17 nested case-control studies, three prospective cohort studies, and one retrospective cohort study found a 17% increased risk of prostate cancer in individuals in the highest versus lowest categories of blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations [(122)](#reference122). Potential [confounding](../glossary#confounder) factors that might explain the detection of a slight increase in prostate cancer cases in men with high circulating vitamin D concentrations have been highlighted in a recent publication [(123)](#reference123). Finally, recent meta-analyses of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found an inverse relationship between vitamin D status and risk of lung cancer [(124, 125)](#reference124) and bladder cancer [(126, 127)](#reference126). Yet, in the few and often [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) studies published to date, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were not associated with other cancer types, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [(128)](#reference128), ovarian cancer are examples of [autoimmune diseases](../glossary#autoimmune-disease). Autoimmune diseases occur when the body mounts an immune response against its own tissue, rather than a foreign [pathogen](../glossary#pathogen). In type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin-producing -cells of the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas) are the target of an inappropriate immune response. In MS, the targets are the [myelin](../glossary#myelin)-producing cells of the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system), and in RA, the targets are the [collagen](../glossary#collagen)-producing cells of the joints [(132)](#reference132). SLE is characterized by the presence of a large spectrum of autoantibodies resulting in potential damage to multiple tissues [(133)](#reference133). Autoimmune responses are mediated by immune cells called T cells. The biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has been found to modulate T cell responses, such that the autoimmune responses are diminished. [Ecologic studies](../glossary#ecologic-study) have found that the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of autoimmune diseases (particularly for MS; [134](#reference134)) increases as latitude increases, suggesting that lower exposure to UVB radiation and associated decreases in skin vitamin D [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) may play a role in the [pathology](../glossary#pathology) of these diseases. Results of several [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) also suggest that adequate vitamin D status at different ages (including in utero, early childhood, and during adolescence) could possibly decrease the [risk](../glossary#risk) of autoimmune diseases. Lower levels of circulating vitamin D have been reported in patients newly diagnosed with type 1 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) compared to age- and sex-matched non-diabetic A greater [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency has also been observed in prediabetic children who developed multiple islet autoantibodies (antibodies against [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-secreting [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) cells) compared to autoantibody-negative children. However, a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed the cohort of prediabetic children found that their vitamin D status, defined as either insufficient, deficient, or sufficient, was not associated with rate of progression to type 1 diabetes after 5 or 10 years of follow up [(137)](#reference137). An earlier prospective cohort study of children born in Finland during the year 1966 and followed for 30 years found that children supplemented with vitamin D during the first year of life had an 88% lower [risk](../glossary#risk) of developing type 1 diabetes compared to those receiving no supplementation. Moreover, children suspected of having had [rickets](../glossary#rickets) (severe vitamin D deficiency) during the first year of life showed a significantly higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes [(138)](#reference138). Thus, vitamin D supplementation appears protective against type 1 diabetes onset, and suboptimal vitamin D status in infancy may have long-term effects on immune responses later in life. There are also limited data suggesting that maternal vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy may influence the risk of type 1 diabetes in offspring. In a recent [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study), the risk of childhood onset of type 1 diabetes was more than two-fold greater in children whose mothers had [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <21.6 ng/mL (54 nmol/L) during the last trimester of pregnancy compared to children born from women with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D >35.6 ng/mL (89 nmol/L) [(139)](#reference139). Other case-control studies have found that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of their children developing diabetes-related autoantibodies [(140, 141)](#reference140). However, a larger study conducted in mothers of children at increased genetic risk for diabetes reported no association between the appearance of islet autoantibodies and/or diabetes onset in offspring in the first year of life and maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy [(142)](#reference142). Another case-control study failed to observe a relationship between serum 25-dihydroxyvitamin D during early pregnancy and type 1 diabetes diagnosis in offspring [(143)](#reference143). Large prospective studies are needed to establish whether maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy can influence the risk of type 1 diabetes in offspring. Finally, the relationship of [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in vitamin D [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism)-related [genes](../glossary#gene) and type 1 diabetes is currently under investigation. It has been proposed that specific polymorphisms in genes, such as CYP27B1 (coding for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase) and VDR, may be functionally relevant to the action of vitamin D and may thus affect disease susceptibility. In a study conducted in 8,517 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and 7,320 control subjects, polymorphisms in genes involved in [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) and vitamin D [hydroxylation](../glossary#hydroxylation) were linked to circulating vitamin D concentrations and diabetic status [(26)](#reference26). Low levels of sun exposure and vitamin D deficiency appear to be associated with the development of [multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) (MS). Poor vitamin D status may compromise the function of specific immune cells critical in the regulation of various immune responses and help trigger autoimmunity in MS [(144)](#reference144). Genetic determinants of low vitamin D status have been recently linked to an increased susceptibility to adult-onset MS in a [Mendelian randomization analysis](../glossary#Mendelian-randomization-study) of data from the Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium [(145)](#reference145). This echoed the results of several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that suggested an association between vitamin D sufficiency and decreased MS [risk](../glossary#risk). A [retrospective study](../glossary#retrospective-study) of levels of ambient UV radiation and cases of MS conducted in Australia revealed that MS incidence in offspring was [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) to maternal exposure to UV during early pregnancy [(146)](#reference146). Sun exposure was also used as a surrogate marker for vitamin D exposure in a recent [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) that included 1,660 MS patients and 3,050 controls. The authors found that infrequent outdoor activities and the use of sunscreen during early childhood and adolescence were associated with an increased risk of developing MS later in life [(147)](#reference147). In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study), sun exposure and intake of cod liver oil (rich in vitamin D) during childhood were linked to later symptom onset among veterans with relapsing MS [(148)](#reference148). Additionally, a case-control study in US military personnel, including 257 cases of diagnosed MS, found that Caucasian subjects in the highest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D (>39.6 ng/mL) had a 62% lower risk of developing MS compared to the lowest quintile (<25.3 ng/mL) (149). Further, in two large cohorts of over 187,000 US women followed for at least 10 years, vitamin D [supplement](../glossary#supplement) use (400 IU/day) was associated with a 41% reduction in the risk of developing MS [(150)](#reference150). Another prospective, uncontrolled study monitored incidence of relapse in relation to vitamin D status in 156 patients with relapsing-remitting MS before and after they were given supplemental vitamin D (100,000 IU/month; 6-42 months, median of 31 months), in addition to first-line immunomodulatory therapy [(151)](#reference151). Each 4 ng/mL increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with a 14.9% decrease in incidence of relapse [(151)](#reference151). In a multicenter study conducted in patients newly diagnosed with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and treated with interferon (IFN)-, vitamin D status was predictive of MS disease activity and progression. Higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (20 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L) in the first year following CIS diagnosis predicted a longer time to MS diagnosis, lower number of new lesions, and lower changes in lesion and brain volume during the subsequent four years of follow-up [(152)](#reference152). However, a retrospective study suggested that vitamin D status in patients with relapsing-remitting MS had no predictive value regarding the time to conversion to secondary progressive MS, which is characterized by a worsening of disability [(153)](#reference153). [Clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have failed to demonstrate any benefit of vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination with IFN- treatment, with respect to relapse rates and disability-related symptoms in MS patients [(154, 155)](#reference154). In other trials, supplemental vitamin D3 also failed to demonstrate immunomodulary activities [(156-159)](#reference156). In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 53 IFN--treated patients with relapsing-remitting MS, supplementation with vitamin D3 (7,000 IU/day for four weeks, followed by 14,000 IU/day until week 48) showed little effect on the proportion of some regulatory T and B [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) over the 48-week study period. Vitamin D3 only appeared to help maintain the proportion of anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cells \u2014 which decreased in patients given placebo \u2014 but failed to enhance their reactivity when stimulated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) trial, supplementation with vitamin D3 (10,400 IU/day for three months) to patients with relapsing-remitting MS was found to reduce the proportion of pro-inflammatory IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells, which are thought to play a central role in MS development [(160)](#reference160). Vitamin D deficiency may also be implicated in the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) and/or progression of [rheumatoid arthritis](../glossary#rheumatoid-arthritis) (RA), although evidence is mainly from animal studies. The absence of vitamin D [receptors](../glossary#receptor) (VDR) in genetically modified mice has been linked to higher levels of [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) and increased susceptibility to [autoimmunity](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) [(161)](#reference161). When transgenic mice that spontaneously develop inflammatory arthritis are also deficient in VDR, they develop a more aggressive form of chronic arthritis [(162)](#reference162). Also, specific [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) in the VDR [gene](../glossary#gene) have been linked to an increased susceptibility to RA in certain populations, although how these genetic variants influence vitamin D functionality is not fully understood [(163-165)](#reference163). The current data, however, point to a role for vitamin D in modulating the inflammatory process that underlies many [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease), including RA. Several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in individuals with moderate-to-high levels of inflammation have reported either no association or an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and markers of inflammation. Nonetheless, there is a lack of [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) to show whether vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) could limit inflammation and reduce disease [risk](../glossary#risk) (including RA) in subjects with high inflammation levels [(166)](#reference166). At this time, it remains unclear whether the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin D deficiency is linked to RA incidence. In a large cohort study of nearly 30,000 postmenopausal US women, subjects with the highest total vitamin D intakes (467.7 IU/day) had a 33% lower risk of developing RA after 11 years of follow-up than those with the lowest intakes (<221.4 IU/day) [(167)](#reference167). Yet, more recent analyses of two large cohorts of nearly 200,000 US women followed for several decades found no association between reported vitamin D dietary intakes (using [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire)) during adolescence or adulthood and incidence of RA later in life [(168, 169)](#reference168). Moreover, several studies that explored the relationship between circulating vitamin D and disease activity in RA patients have reported mixed results (reviewed in [170](#reference170)). Yet, two recent meta-analyses of observational studies found an inverse relationship between vitamin D status and disease activity in RA patients, assessed using the Disease Activity Score 28 ( [DAS28](http://www.nras.org.uk/the-das28-score)) [(171, 172)](#reference171). Finally, there is a dearth of studies exploring the effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease activity in arthritis subjects. A small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 22 RA patients failed to demonstrate improvements in disease activity and inflammation level in subjects supplemented with [calcium](../minerals/calcium) (1,500 mg/day) and high doses of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol; averaging over 4,500 IU/day) for a year compared to placebo [(173)](#reference173). Another three-month, randomized controlled trial in 41 women with early RA found no additional benefits of supplemental vitamin D3 (one bolus dose of 300,000 IU) to standard care (methotrexate and glucocorticoids) regarding T-helper lymphocyte enumeration, cytokine production, or clinical parameters including disease activity [(174)](#reference174). Supplemental vitamin D also failed to reduce disease recurrence rate in RA patients enrolled in two small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) [(175, 176)](#reference175). Since these studies have several limitations, including small sample size, additional research is warranted. More [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) and severe in non-Caucasian populations (Hispanics, African descendants, and Asians) [(177)](#reference177), [systemic lupus erythematosus](../glossary#systemic-lupus-erythematosus) (SLE) is an [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) with [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) clinical manifestations. The disease can potentially affect most tissues and organs, including skin (skin rash and photosensitivity), kidneys (nephritis), and joints (arthritis). There is evidence of a role for vitamin D in the prevention of SLE in animal models [(178)](#reference178). Interestingly, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 11 [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) found that specific VDR [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) were linked to SLE in Asians particularly [(179)](#reference179). However, the functional relevance of such genetic variants is not known [(180)](#reference180). Analyses of two large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of nearly 200,000 US women failed to show an association between dietary vitamin D intake (measured by [food frequency questionnaire](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire)) during adolescence or adulthood and incidence of SLE later in life [(168, 169)](#reference168). Yet, a suboptimal vitamin D status is commonly observed in subjects with SLE, and this is partly explained by the lack of sunlight exposure, which tends to aggravate disease symptoms [(181, 182)](#reference181). [Serum](../glossary#serum) concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with measures of disease activity in a cohort of 378 patients with SLE [(183)](#reference183). The correction of vitamin D insufficiency with high levels of vitamin D3 (100,000 IU/week for one month followed by 100,000 IU/month for six months) in 20 subjects with SLE was linked to a reduction in signs of immune imbalance and in levels of autoantibodies typically detected in SLE, suggesting a therapeutic value for vitamin D in disease treatment [(184)](#reference184). Another prospective study conducted in 52 vitamin D-deficient patients with [cutaneous](../glossary#cutaneous) lupus erythematosus (a type of lupus with skin disorders only) reported a reduction in disease severity in the group [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) with vitamin D3 (1,400 IU/day initially, followed by 800 IU/day) and [calcium](../minerals/calcium) for one year compared to untreated patients [(185)](#reference185). Supplementation with vitamin D3 (200 IU/day for one year) was also able to reduce the level of inflammatory [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine) in a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study conducted in 267 patients with SLE [(186)](#reference186). In another randomized, placebo-controlled trial, supplementation with vitamin D3 (50,000 IU/week for six months) improved SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) scores, as well as some measures of fatigue in young adults with juvenile-onset SLE [(187)](#reference187). However, in two other recent studies, supplementation with vitamin D3 (weekly/monthly bolus doses equivalent to ~800 to 7,000 IU/day for 6 to 24 months) improved vitamin D status in SLE patients but failed to show any benefit regarding disease activity [(188, 189)](#reference188). While oral vitamin D administration to SLE patients is well tolerated, its efficacy remains questionable and deserves further investigation in [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial). Thus, evidence from human [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) suggests that while it cannot yet be concluded that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in prevention or treatment of [autoimmune disease](../glossary#autoimmune-disease), it is reasonable to assume that correcting vitamin D insufficiency and maintaining sufficient levels could possibly help decrease disease [risk](../glossary#risk) [(190)](#reference190). [Hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) [observational](../glossary#observational-study) and [clinical studies](../glossary#clinical-trial) suggest a role for vitamin D in lowering blood pressure, which may be partly explained by the fact that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D inhibits renin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) (see [Function](#function)). Thus, vitamin D deficiency and subsequent upregulation of the renin-angiotensin system may contribute to high blood pressure and CVD risk. It has also been suggested that elevated PTH concentrations may increase the risk of [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) and CVD [(6)](#reference6). Yet, in a recent [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 3,002 individuals (mean age, 59 years at baseline), the incidence of hypertension, which affected 41% of participants during the nine year follow-up period, was not higher in those with [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations lower than 20 ng/mL and was only marginally associated with elevated PTH concentrations [(192)](#reference192). Nevertheless, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven prospective studies, including a total of 48,633 participants with nearly 5,000 incident hypertension cases, found a 30% lower risk of hypertension in those in the top versus bottom [tertiles](../glossary#tertile) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The dose-response analysis estimated that every 10 ng/mL increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with a 12% lower risk of hypertension [(193)](#reference193). Another meta-analysis of four prospective and 14 [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) also reported an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and hypertension [(194)](#reference194). [Vascular endothelium](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction, which contributes to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD), is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [(195)](#reference195). In CKD patients, abnormal endothelial function is associated with low values of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, a surrogate marker of vascular health. In a recent study conducted in subjects with mild-to-moderate CKD, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were positively associated with FMD values, suggesting a link between suboptimal vitamin D status and endothelial dysfunction [(196)](#reference196). In a preliminary [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial), 26 patients with moderate CKD and vitamin D insufficiency (mean value, 17.2 ng/mL) were supplemented twice with 300,000 IU of vitamin D3 (at weeks 1 and 8) and followed for a total of 16 weeks. Vitamin D supplementation nearly doubled [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and decreased PTH concentrations by 68.5%; improved vitamin D status was accompanied by increased FMD values and reduced levels of endothelial dysfunction markers [(197)](#reference197). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 12 small [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in participants at high risk for CVD found a significant increase in FMD with vitamin D supplementation (daily doses, 2,500-5,000 IU; weekly dose, 50,000 IU; monthly dose, 60,000 IU; single-bolus doses, 100,000-200,000 IU) for eight weeks to six months [(198)](#reference198). To date, the many [epidemiological studies](../glossary#epidemiological-study) investigating the relationship between vitamin D and outcomes of CVD have provided mixed results (reviewed in [199](#reference199)). Recent [Mendelian randomization studies](../glossary#Mendelian-randomization-study) found no association between genetically low [serum](../glossary#serum) D concentrations and [risks](../glossary#risk) of disease, or suggesting that associations reported in may be due to [confounding](../glossary#confounder) or [reverse causation](../glossary#reverse-causation). In the RECORD trial in 5,292 older people (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)), supplementation with 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 (\u00b1 calcium) reduced the risk of first cardiac failure but had no effect on the risk of myocardial infarction and [stroke](../health-disease/stroke) compared to supplementation with calcium alone or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(202)](#reference202). Data on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular events were collected from 21 [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (including the RECORD trial) in 13,033 participants (60 years old) and combined in a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) [(202)](#reference202). No effect of vitamin D (including vitamin D [analogs](../glossary#analog)) was found for major [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, including [heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure), myocardial infarction, and stroke over follow-up periods of 1 to 6.2 years [(202)](#reference202). However, caution is advised when interpreting these results since the trials were initially designed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D on bone health, and cardiovascular outcomes were not primary endpoints. Several randomized controlled trials exploring the effect of vitamin D supplementation on CVD risk are currently underway [(203)](#reference203), including two large trials, the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL) in the US [(204)](#reference204) and the D-Health trial in Australia [(205)](#reference205). The results of one randomized controlled trial, the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) trial in New Zealand, were recently published. The total number of CVD events and time to first CVD event during follow-up did not differ between those supplemented with vitamin D3 (initial dose of 200,000 IU for the first month followed by monthly doses of 100,000 IU) and those given a placebo for a median 3.3 years [(206)](#reference206). People with [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), and [obesity](../glossary#obesity). A recent study found that the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of type 2 diabetes was associated with low levels of [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D (<30 ng/mL) in 1,801 patients with metabolic During an eight-year follow-up period, lower risks of all-cause mortality (72% lower risk) and CVD-specific mortality (64% lower risk) were reported in individuals with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations over 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) when compared to those with concentrations below 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) [(207)](#reference207). In healthy people, vitamin D sufficiency is positively correlated with [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) and adequate [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) -cell function. Conversely, vitamin D deficiency might affect [glucose](../glossary#glucose) [homeostasis](../glossary#homeostasis) and cause [impaired glucose tolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance) and insulin resistance [(208)](#reference208). In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) conducted in 12,719 adults, of whom 4,057 had prediabetes (i.e., an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes), the prevalence of prediabetes was associated with lower concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (32.4 ng/mL). Subjects with the lowest concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (17.7 ng/mL) were more likely to be current smokers, obese, and have hypertension [(209)](#reference209). Vitamin D insufficiency in high-risk individuals may accelerate the progression to overt diabetes. In a prospective study of 2,378 middle-aged men and women followed for 8 to 10 years, the risk for progression to type 2 diabetes from prediabetes was 62% lower in women and 60% lower in men in the highest compared to the lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of circulating vitamin D (>28.4 ng/mL vs. <18.5 ng/mL). A dose-response analysis measured an average 23% reduction in the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes for every 4 ng/mL (10 nmol/L) increment in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration [(210)](#reference210). A recent review and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 18 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including over 210,000 participants followed for a median period of 10 years, found that individuals in the top third of vitamin D levels (reported as either circulating vitamin D or dietary intakes) had lower risks of developing type 2 diabetes (19% lower risk) and metabolic syndrome (14% lower risk) compared to those in the bottom third [(211)](#reference211). In another meta-analysis of nine prospective studies, including 28,258 older people (mean age, 67.7 years), lower versus higher circulating vitamin D concentrations at baseline were found to be associated with a 17% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes over a median follow-up period of 7.3 years [(212)](#reference212). Currently, limited evidence suggests that vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with glucose intolerance or manifest type 2 diabetes [(213-216)](#reference213). There is a need for well-designed [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) to examine whether maintaining adequate vitamin D levels can prevent adverse metabolic outcomes in healthy and at-risk individuals. [Alzheimer's disease](../health-disease/alzheimer-disease) (AD) is the most common form of [dementia](../glossary#dementia), characterized by the presence of extra- [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) - [amyloid and intra-neuronal Tau [protein](../glossary#protein) aggregates (known as neurofibrillary tangles) in the brain. Mechanistic models currently investigated in animal research suggest that vitamin D deficiency or disorders of vitamin D [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) and/or the disruption of the vitamin D-VDR pathway in the [cerebral](../glossary#cerebral) regions of the cortex and hippocampus may be involved in the degeneration of [neurons](../glossary#neuron) and loss of [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) functions [(217)](#reference217). Experimental evidence supporting a role for vitamin D in calcium channel regulation, neuroprotection, and immunomodulation in the [central nervous system](../glossary#central-nervous-system) also implies that low vitamin D status may precede or contribute to cognitive dysfunction with age [(218)](#reference218). A number of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined cognitive decline and degenerative brain disease in the elderly in relation to dietary intake of vitamin D and [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. In a large French cohort study on [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) and hip [fractures](../glossary#fracture) in postmenopausal women, impairments in global cognitive performance, assessed with the Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire (SPMSQ), were associated with lower dietary intakes of vitamin D (<1,400 IU/week vs. 1,400 IU/week) in 5,596 elderly women (mean age, 80.5 years) [(219)](#reference219). A seven-year follow-up study of a subgroup of 498 women indicated that the [risk](../glossary#risk) of Alzheimer's disease (but not other types of dementia) was 77% lower in those in the highest versus the lowest [quintiles](../glossary#quintile) of vitamin D dietary intakes at baseline [(220)](#reference220). Some, but not all, observational studies have found an association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and mild cognitive impairment in older adults [(219, 221, 222)](#reference219). The [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) and longitudinal analysis of two [prospective studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), which included 1,604 men [(223)](#reference223) and 6,257 women [(224)](#reference224) aged 65 and over, reported a 60% greater odds of cognitive impairment at baseline and a 58% increased risk of cognitive decline during a four-year follow-up period in women, but not in men, with vitamin D deficiency (circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D <10 ng/mL vs. 30 ng/mL). In the [nested case-control](../glossary#nested-case-control-study), multiethnic, Singapore Kidney Eye Study, which included 2,273 individuals (mean age, 70.4 years), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were [inversely correlated](../glossary#inverse-association) with cognitive deficits affecting retrograde episodic memory, semantic memory, and orientation in time, as assessed by the Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) [(225)](#reference225). Yet, [systematic reviews](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) of observational studies have given mixed results regarding the association of vitamin D status with cognitive performance and AD [(226-230)](#reference226). Moreover, the recent analysis of data from 1,182 men followed for 18 years in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) failed to find associations of genetic determinants of vitamin D synthesis, vitamin D intakes, and [plasma](../glossary#plasma) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with risks of cognitive impairments, AD, vascular dementia, or all-cause dementia [(231)](#reference231). In contrast, another [Mendelian randomization study](../glossary#Mendelian-randomization-study) associated genetic determinants of low vitamin D status to higher risk of AD in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project dataset (17,008 AD cases and 37,154 healthy cases) [(232)](#reference232). Nevertheless, the [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency ranges between 70% and 90% in older adults, and correcting low concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D may help improve cognitive processes, in particular [executive functions](../glossary#executive-function) [(233)](#reference233). In a small, non-randomized controlled study in an outpatient clinic, global cognitive function was assessed at baseline and after 16 months in 20 patients [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) with 800 IU/day (or 100,000 IU/month) of vitamin D and in 24 control subjects. The supplementation of outpatients with vitamin D resulted in the correction of low vitamin D status (average serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 16.8 ng/mL at baseline and 30 ng/mL at 16 months) and was associated with a significantly improved scoring in cognition tests compared to the non-supplemented group [(234)](#reference234). In a small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled 32 mild-to-moderate AD patients receiving nasal [insulin](../glossary#insulin), high doses of vitamin D2 supplementation for eight weeks (up to 36,000 IU/day) did not significantly improve cognitive performance compared to low doses (1,000 IU/day) [(235)](#reference235). More research is needed to investigate a causal relationship between vitamin D [repletion](../glossary#replete) and potential long-term cognitive benefits in older adults. Further, it is of great importance to evaluate whether correcting vitamin D deficiency in cognitively impaired subjects can improve the impact of anti-dementia therapy [(236)](#reference236). [Parkinson's disease](../glossary#parkinson-disease) (PD) has been associated with a high [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of vitamin D insufficiency among patients, especially those with greater mobility problems [(237)](#reference237). A [case-control study](../glossary#case-control-study) of 296 outpatients with a mean age of 65 years indicated that 23% of PD subjects had [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations lower than 20 ng/mL compared to 16% and 10% of AD and healthy individuals, respectively [(238)](#reference238). In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted among 3,173 men and women aged 50-79 years and free of PD at baseline, individuals in the highest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (20 ng/mL for women and 22.8 ng/mL for men) had a 67% lower risk of PD compared to those in the lowest quartile (10 ng/mL for women and 11.2 ng/mL for men) [(239)](#reference239). [Meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) pooling data from [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) all showed that vitamin D inadequacy was more likely reported in subjects with PD than in healthy controls [(240-242)](#reference240). In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, 112 PD patients (mean age, 72 years) on standard PD treatment were [supplemented](../glossary#supplement) with 1,200 IU/day of vitamin D or a placebo for 12 months. Vitamin D supplementation nearly doubled serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (from mean of 22.5 ng/mL to 41.7 ng/mL) in supplemented subjects and limited the progression of PD, as indicated by a greater proportion of patients who showed no worsening (as assessed by the Hoehn and Yahr stage and the United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part II) in the supplemented group compared to the placebo group [(243)](#reference243). It is not known whether vitamin D insufficiency has a role in the [pathogenesis](../glossary#pathogenesis) of the disease, but the [repletion](../glossary#replete) of vitamin D may provide health benefits that go beyond the prevention and/or the treatment of PD. For example, vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the increased risk of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) and bone [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in individuals with [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) disorders, including PD and [multiple sclerosis](../glossary#multiple-sclerosis) [(244-246)](#reference244). Interestingly, sunlight exposure was found to be associated with improved vitamin D status, higher [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) of the second metacarpal bone, and lower incidence of hip fracture in a prospective study conducted in 324 elderly people with PD [(247)](#reference247). A [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 31 [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) on maternal vitamin D status and pregnancy outcomes indicated that vitamin D insufficiency may be associated with [gestational](../glossary#gestation) [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus), [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), and [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) vaginosis in pregnant women. Low maternal serum vitamin D during pregnancy was also linked to an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for small-for-gestational age infants and low-birth-weight infants, but not for Cesarean section [(248)](#reference248). However, the number of [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) is currently too limited to draw conclusions as to whether vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) during pregnancy might reduce the incidence of the above-mentioned adverse outcomes [(249)](#reference249). Abnormal [hyperglycemia](../glossary#hyperglycemia) due to [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) characterizes the onset of [gestational](../glossary#gestation) [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) (GDM) in pregnant women without known type 2 diabetes mellitus. This condition is associated with serious adverse maternal outcomes, including [preeclampsia](../glossary#preeclampsia), high [risk](../glossary#risk) of Cesarean delivery, and life-long increased risk of developing [metabolic syndrome](../glossary#metabolic-syndrome) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. GDM may also contribute to increased risks of fetal macrosomia (excessive birth weight), neonatal [hypoglycemia](../glossary#hypoglycemia), infant respiratory distress, and increased life-long risk for [glucose intolerance](../glossary#impaired-glucose-tolerance), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and [cardiovascular disease](../health-disease/cardiovascular-disease) the offspring (reviewed in [250](#reference250)). A recent [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) conducted in 655 pregnant women found that the mean [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration during the first trimester of pregnancy was significantly lower in 54 women who developed incident GDM compared to the rest of the cohort (23 ng/mL vs. 25.4 ng/mL). After multiple adjustments for [confounding](../glossary#confounder) factors of vitamin D status and GDM risk (including overweight/obesity and prior history of type 2 diabetes and GDM), the study found each 7.5 ng/mL decrease in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration during early pregnancy was associated with a 48% higher risk of developing GDM [(251)](#reference251). Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (<29.4 ng/mL) during the second trimester of pregnancy were also associated with GDM incidence in a [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) of 118 women with GDM and 219 subjects [(252)](#reference252). Five [meta-analyses](../glossary#meta-analysis) [(248](#reference248), [253-256)](#reference253), including [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) of moderate-to-high quality, also reported that maternal serum vitamin D concentrations during pregnancy were [inversely related](../glossary#inverse-association) to the risk of developing GDM despite evidence of [bias](../glossary#bias) amongst studies, such as the use of different methods for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, measures done in different trimesters, and different criteria to assess GDM (reviewed in [257](#reference257)). Further, evidence for the role of vitamin D in [glucose](../glossary#glucose) regulation during pregnancy was reported in a small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 54 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM. The [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 twice during a six-week period (at day 1 and day 21) resulted in significantly lower fasting [plasma](../glossary#plasma) glucose and serum [insulin](../glossary#insulin) concentration, reduced [insulin resistance](../glossary#insulin-resistance), and improved [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) compared to placebo [(258)](#reference258). This suggests that vitamin D deficiency may adversely affect glucose tolerance during pregnancy and contribute to the onset of GDM. Yet, the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of glucose intolerance and GDM during pregnancy have not been assessed. A multicentered, [randomized controlled trial ](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial)(DALI) is ongoing in Europe to evaluate the effects of vitamin D and lifestyle interventions (healthy eating and physical activity) on the metabolic status of pregnant women at risk of GDM (inclusion criteria: pre-pregnancy BMI 29 kg/m2) [(259)](#reference259). Preliminary findings suggest that healthy eating and physical activity can help lower gestational weight gain, when compared to standard-of-care; however, these lifestyle changes are unlikely to reduce the risk of GDM among obese pregnant women [(260)](#reference260). The results regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the DALI study are yet to be published. During pregnancy, increased [intestinal](../glossary#small-intestine) [calcium](../minerals/calcium) absorption and mobilization of calcium from the skeleton allows accretion of calcium within the fetal skeleton. Yet, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that examined the relationship between maternal vitamin D status and measures of fetal bone growth have not provided consistent results [(261, 262)](#reference261). In addition, recent data from the Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study (MAVIDOS) suggested no difference in whole-body bone mineral content (BMC) of newborns from mothers randomized to daily supplementation with either vitamin D3 (1,000 IU) or [placebo](../glossary#placebo) from <17 weeks' gestation until delivery [(263)](#reference263). Further, the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in Danish children ages 10 to 18 years was similar regardless of whether their mothers were exposed to extra vitamin D from [fortification](../glossary#fortification) during pregnancy [(264)](#reference264). While maternal vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy effectively prevents the neonate's risk of vitamin D deficiency at birth [(265)](#reference265), there is little evidence that neonatal vitamin D status influences the risk of fracture later during childhood [(266)](#reference266). A few observational studies have given rather weak evidence in support of a relationship between maternal vitamin D sufficiency during pregnancy and incidence of respiratory conditions and allergies in children [(267)](#reference267). A [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that the supplementation of 108 pregnant women in the third trimester (at week 27 of gestation until delivery) with either 800 IU/day or a bolus dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 did not decrease the risk of wheezing, allergic rhinitis, food allergy diagnosis, lower respiratory tract infections, or eczema in offspring at three years of age compared to placebo (N=50) [(268)](#reference268). A more recent [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), randomized controlled trial found that vitamin D3 supplementation of 295 Danish pregnant women, from weeks 22 to 26 of gestation until delivery, with 2,800 IU/day (70 g/day) \u2014 compared to 400 IU/day (10 g/day) of vitamin D3 (i.e., the current recommendation in Denmark) (N=286) \u2014 reduced the risk of troublesome episodes of lung symptoms by 17% in offspring during the first three years of life [(269)](#reference269). However, no differences were reported regarding the risk of persistent wheeze, [asthma](../glossary#asthma), allergic sensitization, respiratory tract infections, or eczema between treatment and control groups [(269)](#reference269). In a similar randomized, double-blind, controlled trial \u2014 the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial \u2014 conducted in 777 US pregnant women with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema (or whose partner had such an history), supplementation with 2,400 IU/day (60 g/day) or 400 IU/day (10 g/day) did not result in differences in the risk of developing asthma or recurrent wheezing in their children at age three years [(270)](#reference270). Despite the lack of significance reported in individual studies, the pooled analysis of the three trials found a 19% reduction in the risk of recurrent wheeze in children whose mothers received high-dose versus low-dose vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy [(271)](#reference271). In a cohort of 378 mother-child pairs, high [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations measured in the 34th week of pregnancy were associated with an increase in food allergy of the child during the first two years of life, warranting careful evaluation of the safety of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy [(272)](#reference272). Since vitamin D insufficiency has been linked to [autoimmunity](../glossary#autoimmune-disease) (see [Autoimmune diseases](#autoimmune-diseases-prevention)), it has also been proposed that poor maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy may contribute to an increased risk of autoimmune diabetes ( [insulin](../glossary#insulin)-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus) in the offspring. Yet, the results of a study of 3,723 children at high genetic risk for type 1 diabetes and followed for a mean 4.3 year-period found that maternal intake of vitamin D (from food and/or supplements) during the third trimester of pregnancy (assessed through [food frequency questionnaires](../glossary#food-frequency-questionnaire)) was not associated with advanced -cell autoimmunity or clinical diabetes [(142)](#reference142). In a [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study), there was no difference in mean serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D during the first trimester of pregnancy between 343 mothers of children with type 1 diabetes and 343 control mothers [(143)](#reference143). A follow-up study suggested that specific maternal VDR polymorphisms, rather than vitamin D status, may be linked to an increased susceptibility to developing type 1 diabetes in children [(273)](#reference273). Another nested case-control study (119 mothers of children with type 1 diabetes and 129 control mothers) found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between maternal vitamin D-binding protein \u2014 but not 25-hydroxyvitamin D \u2014 concentration during the third trimester of pregnancy and the risk of type 1 diabetes in children [(274)](#reference274). At present, there is no established causality between maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and risk of autoimmune disease in offspring. More than 200 [viruses](../glossary#virus) are responsible for causing familiar infections of the upper respiratory tract (URT), known as the [common cold](../health-disease/common-cold), resulting in symptoms of nasal congestion and discharge, cough, sore throat, and sneezing [(275)](#reference275). The analysis of [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) data from 18,883 participants (ages 12 years and older) of the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reported an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and recent (self-reported) URT infection (URTI). Compared to levels of circulating vitamin D of 30 ng/mL or above, the [risk](../glossary#risk) of URTI was 24% higher in individuals with concentrations between 10 and 29 ng/mL and 36% higher in those with levels below 10 ng/mL [(276)](#reference276). A subgroup analysis indicated that low concentrations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in subjects with [asthma](../glossary#asthma) and [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](../glossary#chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease) (COPD) were linked to a greater susceptibility to URTI when compared to people without pulmonary disease. In a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial conducted in 322 healthy adults (ages 18 years), supplementation with monthly doses of vitamin D3 (200,000 IU for the first two months and 100,000 IU for the following 16 months) significantly raised the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (from 29 ng/mL to 48 ng/mL) in the intervention group but did not decrease the occurrence of URTI compared to placebo [(277)](#reference277). Moreover, in a larger, multicenter, four-arm [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) in 2,259 subjects (aged 45-75 history of [colorectal adenoma](../glossary#colorectal-adenoma), daily vitamin D3 supplementation of 1,000 IU did not reduce the number or the duration of URTI episodes during winter or the rest of the year, even among participants with the lowest serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at baseline [(278)](#reference278). In addition, the post-hoc analysis of data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 644 individuals (ages 60-84 years) found that monthly supplementation with 30,000 IU or 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 for a maximum period of one year did not significantly decrease the rate of antibiotic prescriptions for [bacterial](../glossary#bacteria) airway infections. The stratified analysis, however, found that doses of 60,000 IU/month reduced the risk of using antibiotics in participants 70 years old by 47% [(279)](#reference279). In addition, compared to placebo, the supplementation of pregnant women with vitamin D3 (with 2,000 IU/day) for three months until birth followed by the supplementation of their infants (800 IU/day) from birth to six months of age significantly reduced the number of acute respiratory infections after the intervention period in children 6 to 18 months old [(280)](#reference280). Interestingly, despite significant [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) among trials, the pooled analysis of these data with that of 21 additional trials suggested an overall 12% reduction in incidence of URTI with vitamin D3 given as bolus doses (every week, month, or every three months), daily doses, or a combination of bolus and daily doses [(281)](#reference281). Subgroup analyses revealed a 42% reduction in URTI risk with vitamin D3 supplementation in subjects with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <10 ng/mL, while there was no protective effect of vitamin D3 in those with concentrations 10 ng/mL. Moreover, large bolus doses (30,000 IU) were found to be ineffective compared to daily or weekly doses such that, in subgroup analyses that excluded bolus doses, daily and weekly vitamin D3 regimens appeared to be protective against URTI regardless of baseline vitamin D status. Finally, the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on URTI did not appear to vary with age, [BMI](../glossary#body-mass-index), the presence of asthma or COPD, and flu vaccination status [(281)](#reference281). The findings of a large clinical trial in New Zealand, the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study, confirmed the ineffectiveness of large bolus doses of vitamin D in reducing the risk of acute respiratory infections [(282)](#reference282). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 5,110 older adults (ages 50-84 at baseline), supplementation with an initial dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin D3 followed by 100,000 IU/month of vitamin D3 for a median of 3.3 years had no effect on the incidence of (self-reported) acute respiratory infections (HR, 1.01; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval), 0.94-1.07). Upon data stratification by vitamin D status, a similar null result (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.95-1.23) was seen in study participants with blood vitamin D concentrations 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L; [282](#reference282)). The recently completed VITAL (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial) may provide additional evidence of an effect of daily dosing (2,000 IU/day of vitamin D) on risk of airway infections in older adults, although the prevention of infectious disease is a secondary outcome in the trial [(204](#reference204), [283, 284)](#reference283). In a trial in preschool-age children, vitamin D supplementation with 2,000 IU/day for at least four months did not decrease the incidence [(285)](#reference285) or severity [(286)](#reference286) of URTI in winter compared to supplementation with 400 IU/day for at least four months. Supplementation with 2,000 IU/day led to significantly higher mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations compared to the lower dose (48.7 ng/mL vs. 36.8 ng/mL), but the 400 IU dose may have been sufficient to prevent URTI in these young children [(285)](#reference285). In a placebo-controlled trial in 1,300 healthy children and adolescents in rural Vietnam (baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 26 ng/mL for both the control and intervention group), supplementation with 14,000 IU/week of vitamin D for eight months significantly reduced the incidence of non-influenza viral respiratory infections by 24%, but not the incidence of influenza A or B infection [(287)](#reference287). The coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world causing a global pandemic. Flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, fatigue, and difficulty breathing, as well as several other diverse symptoms characterize COVID-19 (see the websites of the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and the [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)). The effects of the disease vary widely, with the most severe resulting in pneumonia, respiratory distress, and death. Some individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, however, are asymptomatic but can transmit virus to others [(288)](#reference288). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals can spread disease before they experience symptoms (i.e., presymptomatic transmission) [(289)](#reference289), placing importance on public health measures like hand washing, face mask wearing, social distancing, and testing and contact tracing to curtail the pandemic. A number of [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have examined the correlation of vitamin D status and COVID-19 incidence, with most \u2014 but not all [(290-292)](#reference290) \u2014 finding vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency associated with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a [retrospective](../glossary#retrospective-study) cohort study of more than 191,000 US residents administered a SARS-CoV-2 test during a three-month period in spring 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was strongly associated with a lower [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, measured at a single point in the 12 months prior to the viral test [(293)](#reference293). In this study, each 1 ng/mL increment of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was linked to a 1.6% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with the risk being the lowest at serum concentrations of 55 ng/mL and above [(293)](#reference293). In a retrospective, population-based study among 7,807 people in Israel, including 782 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, [plasma](../glossary#plasma) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations below 30 ng/mL were associated with a 50% higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to higher vitamin D concentrations [(294)](#reference294). The vitamin D status assessment in this study was done prior to the viral testing, but details on the time frame are lacking. The temporal relationship of the vitamin D status measure and COVID diagnostic test is also a concern in an analysis of a large dataset from the UK Biobank, which found vitamin D status was not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: the study utilized vitamin D status assessments done 10 to 14 years prior to the COVID-19 diagnostic test [(291)](#reference291). Consistent with findings of most available studies, a small retrospective cohort study [(295)](#reference295) and five [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) [(296-300)](#reference296) reported an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) vitamin D status and SARS-CoV-2 infection. A 2021 [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 10 observational studies, including 361,934 participants, reported an association between vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency and increased risk of COVID-19 ( [OR](../glossary#odds-ratio), 1.43; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval): 1.00-2.05), although [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) across studies was high [(301)](#reference301). Further, in an analysis of data from the UK Biobank, regular use of vitamin D supplements was found to be associated with a 34% lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared nonusers of vitamin D supplements [(292)](#reference292). Additionally, most of the available observational research suggests an association between low vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity, with studies finding vitamin D deficiency linked to an increased risk of disease severity, as measured by need for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission [(302)](#reference302), stage of pneumonia (in men but not in women; [303](#reference303)), need for non-invasive ventilation [(304)](#reference304), need for invasive mechanical ventilation [(305)](#reference305), or a combination of these and other indicators [(297)](#reference297). Another study found that insufficient vitamin D status, defined as plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations below 30 ng/mL, was associated with an increased likelihood of COVID-related hospitalization, but the association failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.061) except in a subanalysis of individuals over 50 years of age (OR, 2.71; 95% CI: 1.55-4.78; p<0.001) [(294)](#reference294). In contrast to most of the evidence to date, one case-control study found vitamin D deficiency was not linked to COVID-19 severity [(298)](#reference298). Further, a few studies have looked at the relationship of vitamin D status and COVID-19 mortality, with three finding vitamin D deficiency to be associated with an increased risk of death [(303](#reference303), [305, 306)](#reference305) and two finding no association [(304](#reference304), [307)](#reference307), although one of the studies finding no association used vitamin D status measurements more than 10 years prior to the COVID-19 diagnostic testing [(307)](#reference307). Since there are several known risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19, including advanced age, obesity, and preexisting type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease [(308)](#reference308), it is important for observational studies to control for potential [confounders](../glossary#confounder). Two quasi-experimental studies reported that bolus supplementation with vitamin D3 (either 50,000 IU per month or 80,000-100,000 IU every two to three months) prior to or during SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a less severe illness and improved survival in frail elderly COVID-19 patients [(309, 310)](#reference309). A number of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 prevention and treatment are currently underway; the results of these trials will inform on the causality of the association. Nevertheless, the currently available data indicate that improving vitamin D status through supplementation represents a modifiable risk factor for COVID-19. Atopic dermatitis or eczema is particularly [prevalent](../glossary#prevalence) in industrialized countries, affecting 10%-20% of children and 1%-3% of adults. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) skin disorder characterized by dry and pruritus (itchy) areas of the skin in affected subjects. Local skin inflammation and immune dysfunction can damage the [epidermal](../glossary#epidermis) barrier and increase the susceptibility to skin infections and atopic reactions in affected individuals. The disease is often associated with other atopic diseases, including food allergies, [asthma](../glossary#asthma), and allergic rhinitis [(311)](#reference311). While the [etiology](../glossary#etiology) of the disease is not fully elucidated, it has been suggested that vitamin D deficiency might contribute to the onset and/or the severity of the disease [(312)](#reference312). Recently, using large-scale datasets from Caucasian people of European descent, including the UK Biobank resource [(313)](#reference313) and the SUNLIGHT [(35)](#reference35), the GABRIEL asthma and EAGLE eczema [(315)](#reference315) consortia, a [Mendelian randomization study](../glossary#Mendelian-randomization-study) found no association between genetically low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and [risks](../glossary#risk) of number of [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have examined whether vitamin D might be an effective [adjunct](../glossary#adjunct) tool in disease management, possibly through regulating local inflammatory reactions and stimulating [antimicrobial](../glossary#antimicrobial) activities in the skin. Moreover, the beneficial effect of phototherapy observed in specific cases of atopic dermatitis may be partly mediated by the action of vitamin D [(311)](#reference311). In a small [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in 45 patients with atopic dermatitis and low vitamin D status (70% of subjects had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <20 ng/mL), daily administration of 1,600 IU of oral vitamin D3, alone or together with 600 IU/day of [vitamin E](vitamin-E), for a period of 60 days significantly reduced the extent and intensity of eczema, as assessed by the SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) score [(317)](#reference317). Vitamin D3 (1,600 IU/day for 60 days) also improved vitamin D status and reduced disease severity in 53 patients with atopic dermatitis in another small randomized trial [(318)](#reference318). More recently, vitamin D3 (1,000 IU/day for one month) improved the severity of winter-related atopic dermatitis in Mongolian children, as shown by changes in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores [(319)](#reference319). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of four small trials (including those cited above) confirmed that supplemental vitamin D can lead to measurable clinical improvements in affected individuals [(320)](#reference320). Larger trials are needed to strengthen these preliminary findings and determine the most appropriate and effective supplementation regimen. Of note, [topical](../glossary#topical) treatment of [psoriasis](../glossary#psoriasis) with vitamin D [analogs](../glossary#analog) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and may be effective in the management of other skin disorders [(321)](#reference321). Several ill-defined environmental and genetic factors are thought to contribute to the development of the inappropriate immune response to the [intestinal microbiota](../glossary#intenstinal-microbiota) that causes [ulcerative colitis](../glossary#ulcerative-colitis) (UC) and [Crohn's disease](../glossary#crohn-disease) (CD). While specific VDR [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism) may be linked to an increased susceptibility to developing UC and CD [(322)](#reference322), higher vitamin D intakes and predicted circulating levels were found to be associated with a reduced incidence of UC and CD in a large cohort of 72,719 women [(323)](#reference323). A meta-analysis of six [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) found an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin D status and severity of CD [(324)](#reference324). Three studies have investigated whether vitamin D3 could benefit patients with CD, possibly through reducing intestinal [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation). In one multicenter, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, the relapse rate in CD patients in remission after one year of treatment was significantly lower in those supplemented daily with 1,200 IU of vitamin D3 and 1,200 mg of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) compared to those who received calcium alone (13% vs. 29%) [(325)](#reference325). In a second [pilot study](../glossary#pilot-study), incremental daily doses of vitamin D3, from 1,000 IU up to 5,000 IU, were administrated over a 24-week period to 18 CD patients in order to achieve circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations >40 ng/mL. Although half of the patients failed to achieve 40 ng/mL, the mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was raised to 45 ng/mL (from a baseline mean of 16 ng/mL), and the overall improvement in vitamin D status was associated with a significant decrease in disease severity as assessed by Crohn's Disease Activity (CDAI) scores [(326)](#reference326). In a three-month, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 27 CD patients in remission, daily supplementation with vitamin D3 (2,000 IU) improved vitamin D status but had no significant effect on intestinal permeability ('leaky gut') or measures of inflammation and disease activity [(327)](#reference327). Yet, the study suggested that achieving serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations 30 ng/mL might help reduce intestinal inflammation and improve patients' quality of life. Additional studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin D in [inflammatory bowel diseases](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease). The [prospective](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) analysis of 41,504 electronic medical records in the Intermountain Heart Collaborative study found that only one-third of patients had adequate [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (>30 ng/mL); vitamin D insufficiency (serum D concentrations 30 ng/mL) was associated with increased [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) and incidence of many [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) conditions, [(328)](#reference328). D status also been linked to arterial stiffness and [vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) dysfunction \u2014 strong determinants of incident hypertension and adverse cardiovascular outcomes [(329)](#reference329). Several [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) have evaluated the effect of vitamin D [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on blood pressure. An early controlled [clinical trial](../glossary#clinical-trial) in 18 men and women with untreated mild [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension) living in the Netherlands found that exposure to UVB radiation three times weekly for six weeks during the winter increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations by 162%, lowered PTH concentrations by 15%, and decreased 24-hour ambulatory [systolic](../glossary#systolic-blood-pressure) and [diastolic blood pressure](../glossary#diastolic-blood-pressure) measurements by an average of 6 mm Hg [(330)](#reference330). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 16 [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) involving 1,879 participants, either healthy or with pre-existing cardiometabolic conditions (including hypertension), found no significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures with vitamin D supplementation (800-8,571 IU/day for five weeks to one year). However, a subgroup analysis of six trials found a significant reduction of 1.31 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure in individuals with preexisting conditions. While improvements in blood pressure may be expected in cases of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency, the authors noted that suboptimal vitamin D status in participants was not exclusively observed in those with cardiometabolic conditions [(331)](#reference331). In contrast, in two recent intervention studies \u2014 the Styrian vitamin D hypertension trial [(332)](#reference332) and the Vitamin D therapy in individuals at high risk of hypertension trial [DAYLIGHT] [(333)](#reference333) \u2014 subjects with (pre)hypertension supplemented with vitamin D3 (400 to 4,000 IU/day for two to six months) showed no evidence of blood pressure lowering, regardless of their baseline vitamin D status (insufficient or adequate, according to the IOM's current cutoffs). Conditions that decrease vitamin D [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) in the skin, such as having dark-colored skin, living in temperate latitudes, and aging, are associated with increased [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of hypertension [(334)](#reference334), suggesting that vitamin D may reduce blood pressure levels in selected groups of individuals. In the above-mentioned meta-analysis, one four-arm, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 283 African Americans randomized to receive daily vitamin D3 supplements of 1,000 IU, 2,000 IU, or 4,000 IU for a period of three months. Systolic blood pressure was decreased by 0.66 mm Hg with 1,000 IU/day, 3.4 mm Hg with 2,000 IU/day, and by 4 mm Hg with 4,000 IU/day while it increased by 1.7 mm Hg in the placebo group when compared to baseline. A significant reduction of 0.2 [mm Hg](../glossary#mm-Hg) in systolic blood pressure was detected per 1 ng/mL incremental increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. However, there was no statistical difference on three-month change in blood pressure between vitamin D3 and placebo [(335)](#reference335). Another randomized, placebo-controlled study in 150 elderly participants (mean age, 77 years) showed that supplementation with 100,000 IU of vitamin D3 every three months for one year did not significantly lower blood pressure compared to placebo [(336)](#reference336). Further research is needed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation is helpful in the prevention or management of hypertension. [Congestive heart failure](../health-disease/heart-failure) (also called cardiac insufficiency) is characterized by increased heart rate and subsequent [hypertrophy](../glossary#hypertrophy) of the left heart [ventricle](../glossary#ventricles). Cardiac insufficiency is associated with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), assessed by [echocardiography](../glossary#echocardiography). Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (see [Blood pressure regulation](#blood-pressure-regulation)) are currently used as first-line therapy for patients with heart failure. In a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) in healthy patients who underwent [coronary](../glossary#coronary-artery) angiography, [serum](../glossary#serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <30 ng/mL were associated with poorer coronary flow rates [(337)](#reference337). Suboptimal vitamin D status has also been linked to poorer [prognosis](../glossary#prognosis) in patients with heart failure [(338)](#reference338). Over the past several years, a number of [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) have examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation in those with cardiac insufficiency. In a 12-week [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study, daily supplementation with 1,200 IU of vitamin D3 in children with chronic congestive heart failure led to a significant increase in vitamin D status accompanied by an improved heart muscle performance (increased LVEF), as well as by lower levels of PTH and pro- [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) [cytokines](../glossary#cytokine) [(339)](#reference339). In another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 64 elderly patients with heart failure, participants receiving 800 mg/day of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) and 50,000 IU/week of vitamin D3 did not perform significantly better at physical performance tasks (used as proxy to assess aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle strength) compared to those supplemented with calcium only [(340)](#reference340). A recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven small randomized placebo-controlled trials in 573 subjects with heart failure showed that vitamin D supplementation (from 1,000 IU/day to 50,000 IU/week) for six weeks to nine months could reduce serum concentrations of PTH, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), and [C-reactive protein](../glossary#c-reactive-protein) (CRP). Yet, there were no differences in LVEF, circulating interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentration, and renin concentration between patients treated with vitamin D and those given a placebo [(341)](#reference341). Finally, in the EVITA (Effect of vitamin D on all-cause mortality) trial in patients with end-stage heart failure and inadequate vitamin D status (baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values, 8.6-19.7 ng/mL), supplementation with 4,000 IU/day for three years did not reduce the risk of mortality compared to placebo [(342)](#reference342). Solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB; wavelengths of 290 to 315 nanometers) stimulates the production of vitamin D3 in the [epidermis](../glossary#epidermis) of the skin [(343)](#reference343). Sunlight exposure can provide most people with their entire vitamin D requirement. Children and young adults who spend a short time outside two or three times a week will generally [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) all the vitamin D they need to prevent deficiency. One study reported that [serum](../glossary#serum) vitamin D concentrations following exposure to one [minimal erythemal dose](../glossary#minimal-erythemal-dose) of simulated sunlight (the amount required to cause a slight pinkness of the skin) to the whole body was equivalent to ingesting approximately 10,000 to 25,000 IU of vitamin D [(344)](#reference344). People with dark-colored skin synthesize markedly less vitamin D on exposure to sunlight than those with lighter complexion [(34)](#reference34). Additionally, older adults have diminished capacity to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight exposure and frequently use sunscreen or protective clothing in order to prevent skin [cancer](../glossary#cancer) and sun damage. The application of sunscreen with an SPF factor of 10 reduces production of vitamin D by 90% [(30)](#reference30). In latitudes around 40 degrees north or 40 degrees south (Boston is 42 degrees north), there is insufficient UVB radiation available for vitamin D synthesis from November to early March. Ten degrees farther north or south (Edmonton, Canada), the \"vitamin D winter\" extends from mid-October to mid-March. It has been estimated that up to 15 minutes of daily sun exposure on the hands, arms, and face around 12 pm throughout the year at 25 degrees latitude (Miami, FL) and during the spring, summer, and fall at 42 degrees (Boston, MA) latitude may provide a light-skinned individual with 1,000 IU of vitamin D [(345)](#reference345). Vitamin D is found naturally in only a few foods, such as some fatty fish (mackerel, salmon, sardines), fish liver oils, eggs from hens that have been fed vitamin D, and mushrooms exposed to sunlight or UV light. In the US, milk and infant formula are [fortified](../glossary#fortification) with vitamin D so that they contain 400 IU (10 g) per quart. However, other dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, are not always fortified with vitamin D. Some cereal, bread, and fruit juices may also be fortified with vitamin D. Accurate estimates of average dietary intakes of vitamin D are difficult because of the high variability of the vitamin D content of fortified foods [(346)](#reference346). The vitamin D content (sum of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3) of some vitamin D-rich foods is listed in Table 2 in both international units (IU) and micrograms (g). For more information on the nutrient content of specific foods, search [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). The 25-hydroxyvitamin D [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) is also present at low levels is certain foods, including meats, dairy products, and eggs [(347, 348)](#reference347). with vitamin large||37||0.9| vitamin D [supplements](../glossary#supplement) available without a prescription contain cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Multivitamin supplements generally provide 400 IU-1,000 IU (10 g-25 g) of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3. Single-ingredient vitamin D supplements may provide 400 to 50,000 IU of vitamin D3, but 400 IU is the most commonly available dose [(66)](#reference66). A number of [calcium](../minerals/calcium) supplements may also provide vitamin D. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) suggested that bolus doses of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) may not always be as effective as vitamin D3 in raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, yet no difference in efficacy was found with daily supplementation with vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 [(349)](#reference349). Nonetheless, a 25-week, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled supplementation with 1,000 IU of vitamin D3 initiated at the end of summer to be more efficacious than vitamin D2 in maintaining summertime concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D during fall and winter months [(350)](#reference350). There is growing interest in using the [hydroxylated](../glossary#hydroxylation) form of cholecalciferol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcidiol; calcifediol), as a supplement. This vitamin D [metabolite](../glossary#metabolite) is synthesized by the liver of humans and animals from cholecalciferol produced in skin or consumed in the diet, and is present in some foods (e.g., meats, milk, eggs) at low levels [(347, 348)](#reference347). In general, clinical studies have found calcifediol is two to five times more potent at increasing blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared to supplementation with equivalent doses of cholecalciferol [(351-359)](#reference351). Supplementation with calcifediol may thus represent a means to improve vitamin D status rapidly and consistently with lower doses than cholecalciferol and may benefit those individuals with conditions that decrease intestinal absorption of cholecalciferol [(359)](#reference359). However, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 form is presently not available as an over-the-counter supplement in the United States. Vitamin D toxicity (hypervitaminosis D) has not been observed to result from sun exposure. The reason is that excessive sunlight exposure generates a number of biologically inert photoproducts from 7-dehydrocholesterol and induces abnormally high [serum](../glossary#risk) [calcium](../minerals/calcium) concentration (hypercalcemia), which could result in bone loss, [kidney stones](../glossary#kidney-stones), and calcification of organs like the heart and kidneys if untreated over a long period of time. Hypercalcemia has been observed following daily doses of greater than 50,000 IU of vitamin D [(360)](#reference360). Overall, research suggests that vitamin D toxicity is very unlikely in healthy people at intake levels lower than 10,000 IU/day [(361-363)](#reference361). However, the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM conservatively set the tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) at 4,000 IU/day (100 g/day) for all adults (Table 3). Certain medical conditions can increase the [risk](../glossary#risk) of hypercalcemia in response to vitamin D, including primary [hyperparathyroidism](../glossary#hyperparathyroidism), sarcoidosis, [tuberculosis](../glossary#tuberculosis), and lymphoma [(361)](#reference361). People with these conditions may develop hypercalcemia in response to any increase in vitamin D nutrition and should consult a qualified health care provider regarding any increase in vitamin D older||100||4,000| The following medications should not be taken at the same time as vitamin D because they can decrease the intestinal absorption of vitamin D: cholestyramine (Questran), colestipol (Colestid), orlistat (Xenical), and The following medications increase the [metabolism](../glossary#metabolism) of vitamin D and may suppresses stomach acid secretion, inhibits the [hydroxylation](../glossary#hydroxylation) of vitamin D in the liver [(366)](#reference366). Treating acid reflux, [gastroesophageal reflux disease](../glossary#gastrointestinal-reflux-disease) (GERD), or ulcers with proton-pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole) might interfere with calcium absorption and increase the risk of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) such that patients are advised to take calcium and vitamin D supplements [(367)](#reference367). The oral antifungal medication, ketoconazole, inhibits the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1-hydroxylase [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) and has been found to reduce serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations in healthy men [(368)](#reference368). The Endocrine Society also recommends monitoring vitamin D status of patients on glucocorticoids and [HIV](../glossary#HIV) treatment drugs because these medications increase the [catabolism](../glossary#catabolism) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [(40)](#reference40). The use of some cytostatic agents (cell growth inhibitors) may also increase the degradation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in [cancer](../glossary#cancer) patients under [chemotherapy](../glossary#chemotherapy) [(6)](#reference6). The induction of hypercalcemia by toxic levels of vitamin D may precipitate cardiac arrhythmia in patients on digoxin (Lanoxin) [(366)](#reference366). Hypercalcemia (Cardizem) in [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) [(366)](#reference366). The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that generally healthy adults take 2,000 IU (50 g) of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin D daily. Most multivitamins contain 400 IU (10 g) of vitamin D, and single-ingredient vitamin D supplements are available for additional supplementation. Sun exposure, diet, skin color, and [body mass index](../glossary#body-mass-index) (BMI) have variable, substantial impact on body vitamin D levels. To adjust for individual differences and ensure adequate body vitamin D status, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends aiming for a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) suggest that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations between 30 ng/mL and 60 ng/mL are associated with lower [risks](../glossary#risk) of adverse health outcomes, including [cancers](../glossary#cancer) and [autoimmune diseases](../glossary#autoimmune-disease). The American Academy of Pediatrics currently suggests that all infants, children, and adolescents receive 400 IU of supplemental vitamin D daily [(19)](#reference19). Consistent with the recommendations of the Endocrine Society [(40)](#reference40), the Linus Pauling Institute recommends daily intakes of 400 to 1,000 IU (10 to 25 g) of vitamin D in infants and 600 to 1,000 IU (15 to 25 g) of vitamin D in children and adolescents. Given the average vitamin D content of breast milk, infant formula, and the diets of children and adolescents, supplementation may be necessary to meet these recommendations. Daily supplementation with 2,000 IU (50 g) of vitamin D is especially important for older adults because aging is associated with a reduced capacity to [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) vitamin D in the skin upon sun exposure.

Accessed Gona Adv Musculoskelet ] [(PubMed)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25342997) J the vitamin E by Maret G. Traber, Ph.D. [The term vitamin E describes a family of eight fat-soluble molecules with ] [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) activities: four tocopherol isoforms (-, -, -, and -tocopherol) and four tocotrienol isoforms (-, -, -, and -tocotrienol) (Figure 1). Only one form, -tocopherol, meets human vitamin E requirements (see [The RDA](#RDA)). In the human liver, -tocopherol is the form of vitamin E that is preferentially bound to -tocopherol transfer protein (-TTP) and incorporated into [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) that transport -tocopherol in the blood for delivery to extrahepatic tissues. Therefore, it is the predominant form of vitamin E found in the blood and tissues [(1)](#references). In addition, -tocopherol appears to be the form of vitamin E with the greatest nutritional significance, such that it will be the primary topic of the following discussion. Natural -tocopherol made by plants found in food has an RRR-configuration at the 2, 4', and 8'-position of the -tocopherol molecule (wrongly referred to as d--tocopherol) (see [Figure 1](#figure-1)). Chemically synthesized all-rac--tocopherol (all-racemic--tocopherol; incorrectly labeled dl--tocopherol) is a mixture of eight stereoisomers of -tocopherol, which arose from the three chiral equal [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) activity, only the forms in the R-conformation at position 2 (noted 2R) meet the vitamin E requirements in humans [(2)](#reference2). The main function of -tocopherol in humans is that of a fat-soluble [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant). Fats, which are an integral part of all [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane), are vulnerable to damage through [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) by [free radicals](../glossary#free-radical). -Tocopherol is uniquely suited to intercept peroxyl radicals and thus prevent a chain reaction of [lipid](../glossary#lipid) [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) (Figure 2). When a molecule of -tocopherol neutralizes a free radical, it is oxidized and its antioxidant capacity is lost. Other antioxidants, such as [vitamin C](vitamin-C), are capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of -tocopherol (Figure 2) (reviewed in [1](#references)). Aside from maintaining the integrity of cell membranes throughout the body, -tocopherol protects the fats in low-density lipoproteins ( [LDLs](../glossary#LDL)) from oxidation. Lipoproteins are particles composed of lipids and [proteins](../glossary#protein) that transport fats through the bloodstream. LDLs specifically transport [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) from the liver to the tissues of the body. Oxidized LDLs have been implicated in the development of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(3)](#reference3). Other functions of -tocopherol are likely to be related to its [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) capacity [(1)](#references). For instance, -tocopherol can protect the physiological properties of [lipid](../glossary#lipid) bilayer membranes and may influence the activity of membrane [proteins](../glossary#protein) and [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) [(4)](#reference4). In cell culture studies, -tocopherol was found to improve the formation of an adhesive junction (known as immune synapse) between na\u00efve T [lymphocytes](../glossary#lymphocyte) and [antigen](../glossary#antigen)-presenting cells (APC), which eventually prompted cell activation and [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) (see [Disease Prevention](#aging-immune-function)) [(5, 6)](#reference5). Vitamin E forms other than -tocopherol are also known to be potent [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant). Tocotrienols and -tocopherol are thought to be better scavengers of peroxyl radicals and [reactive nitrogen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species), respectively, than -tocopherol [(7)](#reference7). Yet, in the body, (1) -tocopherol is preferentially retained in the liver by the binding to -tocopherol transfer protein (-TTP), which incorporates -tocopherol into [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) for delivery to extrahepatic tissues; and (2) forms of vitamin E other than -tocopherol are actively [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) and [excreted](../glossary#excretion). Hence, while -tocopherol is the most common form of vitamin E in the American diet [(8)](#reference8), its [plasma](../glossary#plasma) and tissue concentrations are generally significantly lower than those of -tocopherol, and more -tocopherol is excreted in urine than -tocopherol, suggesting less -tocopherol is needed for use by the body [(1)](#references). Studies conducted [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) and in animals have indicated that -tocopherol and its major metabolite, -carboxyethyl hydroxychroman (-CEHC), may play a role in protecting the body from [free radical](../glossary#free-radical)-induced damage in various conditions of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and (reviewed in [7](#reference7)). Limited [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial) (highlighted in [7](#reference7)) have not convincingly demonstrated a potential anti-inflammatory effect of -tocopherol in humans. Yet, in two recent [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled studies, the supplementation of smokers with -tocopherol potentiated short-term benefits of smoking cessation (with or without nicotine replacement therapy) on [vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) function [(9, 10)](#reference9). Numerous preclinical studies have also suggested that tocotrienols might be beneficial in the prevention of [chronic diseases](../glossary#chronic-disease) [(11)](#reference11). For instance, tocotrienols (especially -tocotrienol) have [proliferative](../glossary#proliferation) and pro- [apoptotic](../glossary#apoptosis) effects than tocopherols in [malignant](../glossary#malignant) cell lines [(12)](#reference12). However, a number of factors, including dose, formulation, and type of study population, affect the [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of tocotrienols and may undermine their putative efficacy in humans [(13)](#reference13). There are currently no data available on the effectiveness of [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) tocotrienols in humans [(11)](#reference11). The mechanism of vitamin E digestion and uptake into intestinal cells ( [enterocytes](../glossary#enterocyte)) is unclear but requires [bile acids](../glossary#bile-acids) and [pancreatic](../glossary#pancreas) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), and the packaging along with dietary fat into [chylomicrons](../glossary#chylomicron). The efficiency of vitamin E absorption increases with the amount of fat in ingested food, such that vitamin E absorption from supplements is likely to be minimal with low-fat meals [(14, 15)](#reference14). In the circulation, all [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein) (i.e., VLDLs, [LDLs](../glossary#LDL), and [HDLs](../glossary#HDL)) are involved in the transport and tissue distribution of -tocopherol [(1)](#references). Increased concentrations of [lipids](../glossary#lipid) ( [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol) and [triglycerides](../glossary#triglycerides)) the blood have been correlated to higher [serum](../glossary#serum) -tocopherol concentrations. However, if a high blood concentration of lipids is associated with a slower turnover of lipoproteins, then the distribution of -tocopherol to tissues may be substantially altered [(16)](#reference16). A few human studies using conditions of [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) have demonstrated the importance of [vitamin C](vitamin-C) (ascorbic acid) in the recycling of [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) -tocopherol back to its reduced state (see [Figure 2](#figure-2)). Oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking accelerates the depletion of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) -tocopherol in smokers compared to nonsmokers [(17)](#reference17). In a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial in 11 smokers and 13 nonsmokers given -tocopherol and -tocopherol that was labeled with deuterium (hence traceable), supplementation with vitamin C reduced the rate of vitamin E loss in plasma, most probably by regenerating tocopheryl radicals back to nonoxidized forms [(18)](#reference18). One study in adults with normal coagulation (clotting) status found that daily supplementation with 1,000 IU (670 mg) of RRR--tocopherol for 12 weeks decreased -carboxylation of prothrombin, a [vitamin K](vitamin-K)-dependent factor in the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) cascade [(19)](#reference19). Individuals taking [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs like warfarin and those who are vitamin K deficient should not take vitamin E [supplements](../glossary#supplement) without medical supervision because of the increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of bleeding (see [Safety](#safety)) [(20)](#reference20). Severe vitamin E deficiency rarely occurs in humans but has been observed as a result of malnutrition [(21)](#reference21). Severe vitamin E deficiency has been associated with specific genetic defects affecting the transport of -tocopherol by -tocopherol transfer protein (-TTP) and [lipoproteins](../glossary#lipoprotein). Vitamin E deficiency has also been observed in individuals with fat [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome), which impair the absorption of dietary fats and therefore fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin E (see [Nutrient interactions](#nutrient-interactions)) [(21)](#reference21). Severe vitamin E deficiency results mainly in [neurologic](../glossary#neurologic) symptoms, including impaired balance and coordination (spinocerebellar [ataxia](../glossary#ataxia)), injury to the sensory nerves ( [peripheral neuropathy](../glossary#peripheral-neuropathy)), muscle weakness ( [myopathy](../glossary#myopathy)), and damage to the [retina](../glossary#retina) of the eye (retinopathy). For this reason, people who develop peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, or retinitis pigmentosa (RP) of unknown causes should be screened for vitamin E deficiency [(21)](#reference21). The results of one [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 601 patients with common forms of RP indicated that daily [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 400 IU of all-rac--tocopherol (180 mg of RRR--tocopherol) modestly but significantly increased the loss of retinal function [(22)](#reference22). In contrast, daily supplementation with 15,000 IU of vitamin A (4,500 g RAE) significantly slowed the loss of retinal function over a period of four to six years, suggesting that patients with common forms of RP may benefit from long-term vitamin A supplementation but should avoid high-dose supplemental vitamin E. Inherited defects in -TTP are associated with a characteristic syndrome called AVED (Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency). A recent case study reported that visual impairment in a middle-age patient with AVED was caused by both RP and early-onset macular degeneration [(23)](#reference23). Supplementation with high-dose vitamin E used to prevent neurologic deterioration in AVED subjects [(21)](#reference21). Moreover, the developing nervous system appears to be especially vulnerable to vitamin E deficiency. For instance, children with severe vitamin E deficiency at birth rapidly experience irreversible neurologic symptoms if not treated with vitamin E. In contrast, individuals who develop [gastrointestinal](../glossary#gastrointestinal) disorders affecting vitamin E absorption in adulthood may not develop neurologic symptoms for 10-20 years [(21)](#reference21). It should also be noted that neurologic symptoms caused by vitamin E deficiency have not been reported in healthy individuals who consume diets low in vitamin E. Although frank vitamin E deficiency is rare, marginal intake of vitamin E is relatively common. Between 1988 and 1994, the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) examined the dietary intake and blood concentrations of -tocopherol in 16,295 adults. The study reported that about one-third of all participants had blood concentrations of -tocopherol below 20 micromoles/liter (mol/L) \u2014 a cutoff value chosen because of its initial association with an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) [(24)](#reference24). More recent data from 18,063 participants in NHANES 2003-2006 indicated an average dietary intake of -tocopherol from food (including enriched and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) sources) among Americans adults of 7.2 mg/day [(25)](#reference25). This intake is well below the current recommended dietary allowance of 15 mg/day (see [the RDA](#RDA)). At this level of dietary intake, more than 93% of American adults do not meet the estimated average requirement ( [EAR](../glossary#EAR)) of 12 mg/day for vitamin E [(25)](#reference25). In addition, a recent [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) in Bangladeshi women suggested that inadequate vitamin E status during early pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage [(26)](#reference26). Cigarette smoking is thought to increase the utilization of -tocopherol such that smokers might be at increased risk of deficiency compared with nonsmokers [(17)](#reference17). Also, the 19-year follow-up analysis of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene cancer (ATBC) trial in older, male smokers indicated that participants in the highest versus lowest [quintile](../glossary#quintile) of [serum](../glossary#serum) -tocopherol concentrations (>31 mol/L vs. <23 mol/L) at baseline had reduced risks of total and cause-specific mortality [(27)](#reference27). It is not known whether marginal vitamin E deficiency increases the risk of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease) [(1)](#references). The [RDA](../glossary#RDA) for vitamin E was last revised by the Food and Nutrition Board of the US Institute of Medicine in 2000 (Table 1) [(2)](#reference2). The RDA is based largely on the results of studies done in the 1950s in men fed vitamin E-deficient diets. In a test-tube analysis, vitamin E suppresses the breakdown of red blood cells (known as [hemolysis](../glossary#hemolysis)) induced by hydrogen peroxide. Because hemolysis has also been reported in children with severe vitamin E deficiency, the preventive effect of vitamin E against oxidative damage-induced hemolysis was considered to be a clinically relevant [in vitro](../glossary#in-vitro) analysis to assess vitamin E status. Importantly, this means that the latest RDA for vitamin E continues to be based on the prevention of deficiency symptoms rather than on health promotion and prevention of [chronic disease](../glossary#chronic-disease). The forms of -tocopherol that meet the recommended intakes are RRR--tocopherol \u2014 the only naturally occurring form of vitamin E \u2014 and the three synthetic isomers, RRS-, RSR-, and RSS--tocopherol, which are found in nutritional [supplements](../glossary#supplement) and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food. Table 1 lists the RDA for -tocopherol expressed in both milligrams (mg) and international units (IU). Stage||Age||Males||Females| |mg/day||IU/day||mg/day||IU/day| | ( | to 2R-stereoisomeric forms of -tocopherol. #One mg of 2R--tocopherol is equivalent to 1.5 IU, and one IU is equivalent to 0.67 mg of 2R--tocopherol. The natural age-related decline of the immune function is accompanied by an increased susceptibility to infections, a poorer response to immunization, and higher [risks](../glossary#risk) of developing [cancers](../glossary#cancer) and [autoimmune diseases](../glossary#autoimmune-disease). -Tocopherol has been shown to enhance specifically the T cell-mediated immune response that declines with advancing age (reviewed in [28](#reference28)). T cell impaired response has been partly associated with a reduced capacity of na\u00efve T cells to be activated during [antigen](../glossary#antigen) presentation, and to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) and [proliferate](../glossary#proliferation) as a result [(6)](#reference6). However, very few studies have addressed the potential association between -tocopherol and immune function in humans [(28)](#reference28). In a small [intervention study](../glossary#intervention-trial) in older adults (mean age, 70 years), supplementation with 200 mg/day of all-rac--tocopherol (equivalent to 100 mg of RRR--tocopherol) for three months improved [natural killer](../glossary#natural-killer-cells) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production compared to baseline [(29)](#reference29). In an earlier trial, daily supplementation of healthy older adults (65 years of age) with 200 mg of all-rac--tocopherol for 235 days also improved T lymphocyte-mediated immunity \u2014 as measured with the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test \u2014 and increased the production of [antibodies](../glossary#antibody) in response to [hepatitis](../glossary#hepatitis) B and tetanus vaccines [(30)](#reference30). Lower -tocopherol doses failed to improve the DTH response compared to a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) in another study in healthy participants (ages, 65-80 years) [(31)](#reference31). A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), placebo-controlled trial in 617 nursing home residents (65 years of age) reported that daily supplementation with 200 IU of synthetic -tocopherol (90 mg of RRR--tocopherol) for one year significantly lowered the risk of contracting upper respiratory tract infections, especially the common cold, but had no effect on lower respiratory tract (lung) infections [(32)](#reference32). More research is needed to examine whether supplemental vitamin E might enhance immune function and reduce risk of infection in older adults. Observational studies: Results of several large [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) in both men and women have suggested an [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin E consumption and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) or death from heart disease. Each study had a [prospective](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) design that measured vitamin E intake in generally healthy people who were followed over a period of time to determine the onset of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events and analyze the association between the exposure and the outcome(s). In two of the studies, individuals who consumed more than 7 mg/day of dietary -tocopherol were 35% less likely to die from heart disease than those who consumed less than 3-5 mg/day of -tocopherol [(33, 34)](#reference33). Two other large studies observed a significantly reduced risk of heart disease only in women and men who consumed at least 100 IU (67 mg)/day of 39,876 women (aged 45 years) participating in the Women's Health Study (WHS) found that supplementation with 600 IU (400 mg) of RRR--tocopherol every other day for 10 years resulted in a 34% reduction in nonfatal [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) and a 49% reduction in cardiovascular-related deaths but only in women aged at least 65 years at baseline (representing 10% of study participants) [(37)](#reference37). Further analyses of WHS data showed that women in the vitamin E arm of the study experienced a 21% reduction in [risk](../glossary#risk) of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to placebo: the reduction was of 12% in women younger than 55 years old, 26% in women aged 65 years and older, and 44% in women with a history of VTE [(38, 39)](#reference38). Another large [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) \u2014 the Physicians' Health Study II (PHSII) \u2014 conducted in healthy middle-aged men found no significant effect of 400 IU of synthetic -tocopherol (180 mg of RRR--tocopherol), given every other day for eight years, on the risk of major cardiovascular events in the entire cohort and in subgroup analyses [(40)](#reference40). Besides, concerns were raised regarding a possible harmful effect of high-dose vitamin E supplementation on the risk of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) in this cohort [(40)](#reference40). Conventional risk factors for [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD) include cigarette smoking, physical inactivity, [hypertension](../glossary#hypertension), [dyslipidemia](../glossary#dyslipidemia), and being overweight or [obese](../glossary#obesity). Other factors such as [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) and [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation) are also thought to contribute to increasing CVD risk, especially in patients with chronic conditions like type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and chronic kidney disease. Although trials do not appear to support any [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) benefit in healthy middle-aged and older subjects, vitamin E supplementation might help improve cardiovascular health and/or lower the risk of CVD in specific, higher risk subjects. Observational studies: The presence of [atherosclerotic](../glossary#atherosclerosis) plaques in arterial walls is one of the hallmarks of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). Plaque rupture that causes blood clot formation is the usual cause of myocardial and cerebrovascular infarctions. The [cross-sectional](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) Asymptomatic an [inverse association](../glossary#inverse-association) between [carotid](../glossary#carotid-arteries) intima-media thickness (CIMT) \u2014 a marker of [atherosclerosis](../glossary#atherosclerosis) \u2014 and circulating concentrations of [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), including vitamin E [(41)](#reference41). However, other observational studies found no association between [plasma](../glossary#plasma) vitamin E concentrations and CIMT (reviewed in [42](#reference42)). [Intervention studies: A small ] [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) controlled study assessing the effect of lipid-lowering drugs in men who had previously undergone a coronary artery bypass surgery found that the use of at least 100 IU/day (compared to less than 100 IU/day) of supplemental -tocopherol (45 mg of RRR--tocopherol) was associated with reduced CIMT progression over a two-year period but only among participants in the [placebo](../glossary#placebo) arm of the study (i.e., those who did not receive lipid-lowering drugs) [(43)](#reference43). However, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of seven small placebo-controlled trials found little evidence that vitamin E supplementation may improve flow-mediated vascular dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, a marker of [vascular endothelial](../glossary#vascular-endothelium) health that is adversely affected by CVD risk factors [(44)](#reference44). In the Cambridge Heart AntiOxidant Study (CHAOS), a [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 2,002 patients with [coronary heart daily supplementation with either 400 IU or 800 IU of synthetic -tocopherol (180 mg or 360 mg of RRR--tocopherol) for a median 18 months dramatically reduced the occurrence of nonfatal [myocardial infarctions](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) by 77%. However, vitamin E supplementation did not significantly reduce total or cardiovascular-related deaths [(45)](#reference45). Another small trial in patients with [renal](../glossary#renal) failure \u2014 the Secondary Prevention with Antioxidants of cardiovascular disease in End-stage renal disease (SPACE) \u2014 found that supplementation with 800 IU (536 mg)/day of RRR--tocopherol for an average of 1.4 years significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction compared to placebo [(46)](#reference46). A more recent randomized controlled study suggested that vitamin E supplementation may benefit a subgroup of patients with type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). The multicenter study by Milman et al. [(47)](#reference47) was conducted in 1,434 type 2 diabetics (55 years old) carrying a specific variant of the haptoglobin [protein](../glossary#protein) (Hp), Hp2-2, which has a lower efficacy to bind and remove [pro-oxidant](../glossary#pro-oxidant), free [hemoglobin](../glossary#hemoglobin) from [plasma](../glossary#plasma), compared to Hp1-1 and Hp1-2 variants. The daily supplementation with 400 IU (268 mg) of RRR--tocopherol for 18 months resulted in a lower risk of myocardial infarction compared to placebo [(47)](#reference47). Other larger intervention trials conducted in cigarette smokers (the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene cancer prevention [ATBC] study [(48)](#reference48)), in individuals at-risk of CVD (the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation [HOPE]-The Ongoing Outcomes [HOPE-TOO study] [(49)](#reference49)), or in patients who have suffered a (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della trial [(50)](#reference50)) failed to find significant CVD risk reductions with -tocopherol supplementation. Besides, potentially harmful effects of supplemental vitamin E were reported on the risk of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) in the ATBC trial and on the risk of heart failure in the HOPE and GISSI trials (see [Safety](#safety)) [(48-50)](#reference48). [Oxidative radicals](../glossary#free-radical) [mutations](../glossary#mutation) that may contribute to causing [cancer](../glossary#cancer) [(51)](#reference51). Because of its ability to neutralize free radicals, vitamin E has been suggested to possess anticancer activity by protecting cells against oxidative damage. Yet, several large [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) have failed to find significant associations between vitamin E intake and the incidence of lung or breast cancer [(2)](#reference2). More recently, the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) study prospectively assessed the association between long-term use of supplemental vitamins (10-year intake) and the [risk](../glossary#risk) of lung cancer in a cohort of 77,126 men and women [(52)](#reference52). No relationships were reported between intake of multivitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, or folate and the risk of lung cancer. However, the use of supplemental vitamin E in current but not in former smokers was associated with an 11% increased risk of lung cancer for every 100 mg/day increase, and intakes greater than 215 mg/day were specifically linked to a 29% increase in risk for non-small cell lung cancer [(52)](#reference52). To date, most [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) have failed to find any beneficial effects of vitamin E supplementation on the risk of various cancers. A [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial (RCT) in 39,876 women participating in the Women's Health Study found that supplementation with 600 IU (400 mg) of RRR--tocopherol every other day for 10 years had no effect on overall cancer incidence, tissue-specific cancer incidence, or cancer-related deaths [(37)](#reference37). Yet, the results of a few large [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) have suggested that vitamin E supplementation might affect the risk of [prostate](../glossary#prostate) cancer. The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene cancer (ATBC) prevention study was a four-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to investigate the effect of -tocopherol supplementation on lung cancer development in 29,133 male smokers. The study found a 32% reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer in participants given daily supplements of 50 mg of synthetic -tocopherol (equivalent to 25 mg of RRR--tocopherol) alone or in combination with -carotene compared to those given -carotene alone or a placebo [(53)](#reference53). However, no differences in the incidence of prostate cancer were found between -tocopherol recipients and nonrecipients during the 18-year post-intervention period [(54)](#reference54). In the Physicians' Health Study II (PHS II), which followed 14,641 healthy men aged 50 years and older, supplementation with 400 IU of synthetic vitamin E (equivalent to 180 mg of RRR--tocopherol) every other day for eight years had no effect on the risk of prostate cancer, other site-specific cancers, or total cancer [(55)](#reference55). The supplementation of vitamin E (equivalent to 180 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol), alone or in combination with selenium, in the multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled SELECT trial (SELenium and vitamin E Cancer prevention Trial) was halted because there was no evidence of benefit in preventing prostate cancer in 35,533 healthy men aged 50 years and older [(56)](#reference56). After a median of seven years' follow-up, the risk of prostate cancer was found to be significantly increased by 17% in participants supplemented with vitamin E alone during the trial period \u2014 but not when vitamin E was combined with selenium \u2014 compared to placebo [(57)](#reference57). A study of cases versus subcohort individuals drawn from the SELECT study assessed the effect of vitamin E and/or selenium supplementation on prostate cancer risk in relation to the selenium status of participants at baseline [(58)](#reference58). Supplemental selenium with or without vitamin E was associated with a significant increase in the risk of advanced prostate cancer in individuals with higher versus lower selenium status. In addition, the risks of total and advanced prostate cancer were significantly elevated with vitamin E supplementation in subjects with low versus high selenium status [(58)](#reference58). Recent investigations have suggested that sequence variations ( [polymorphisms](../glossary#polymorphism)) in vitamin E-related [genes](../glossary#gene) and genes coding for [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme), including selenoproteins, might modify the impact of high-dose vitamin E and selenium on the risk of prostate cancer [(59-61)](#reference59). Age-related [cataracts](../glossary#cataract) appear to be the result of [protein](../glossary#protein) in the [lens](../glossary#lens) of the eye; [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) like may protect the lens against [oxidative from [reactive oxygen species](../glossary#reactive-oxygen-species). In a recent [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study), vitamin E concentrations were found to be significantly lower in the lens and blood of subjects with age-related nuclear, but not cortical, cataracts when compared with an age-matched control group [(62)](#reference62). However, earlier studies reported higher vitamin E concentrations in the lenses and blood of patients with cataracts [(63, 64)](#reference63). The results of several [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) that examined the association between vitamin E consumption and the incidence or severity of cataracts are also mixed. Some reported that increased vitamin E intake protected against cataract development, while others found no association [(65)](#reference65). Yet, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of eight studies, including 15,021 participants, found a 17% reduction in the risk of age-related cataract in subjects in the highest versus lowest quantile of dietary vitamin E intake [(66)](#reference66). A recent [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) of 31,120 Swedish men followed for a mean of 8.4 years observed a greater risk of developing cataract in occasional and regular users of high-dose (about 100 mg/day) vitamin E supplements only, when compared with non-supplement users [(67)](#reference67). However, the use of supplemental high-dose vitamin E with additional supplements or the use of low-dose vitamin E-containing multivitamin supplements was not found to be associated with an elevated cataract risk. A meta-analysis based on data from over 350,000 participants in 10 studies \u2014 including the above-cited study by Zheng Selin et al. [(67)](#reference67) \u2014 found no association between supplemental vitamin E and risk of cataract [(66)](#reference66). In clinical settings, the supplementation of high-dose vitamin E \u2014 alone or in addition to other supplements \u2014 was found to be safe, yet the benefits regarding cataract risk or progression were limited. An early intervention trial found that a daily supplement of 50 mg of synthetic -tocopherol (equivalent to 25 mg of RRR--tocopherol) did not alter the incidence of cataract surgery in male smokers [(68)](#reference68). A randomized, placebo-controlled [intervention trial](../glossary#intervention-trial) in 4,629 men and women found that a daily antioxidant supplement containing 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of all-rac--tocopheryl acetate (equivalent to 180 mg of RRR--tocopherol), and 15 mg of -carotene did not affect development and progression of age-related cataracts over a seven-year period [(69)](#reference69). Similarly, a four-armed, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 11,267 men from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer prevention trial (SELECT) failed to observe a reduction in cataract incidence with 400 IU/day of supplemental all-rac--tocopheryl acetate (180 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol), alone or in combination with selenium (200 g/day), during a mean 5.6 years of follow-up [(70)](#reference70). Daily antioxidant supplementation with 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU (268 mg) of RRR--tocopherol, and 15 mg of -carotene did not limit the progression of cataract in a five-year intervention trial [(71)](#reference71). Another four-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial reported that supplements containing 500 IU/day (335 mg/day) of RRR--tocopherol did not reduce the incidence or progression of cataract in older adults [(72)](#reference72). Current available data from [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) do not support a preventative effect of vitamin E on cataracts. A recent pooled analysis of four [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 62,520 subjects found that [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin E or -carotene did not reduce the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a multifactorial disease affecting the central area of the [retina](../glossary#retina) [(73)](#reference73). However, a review of currently available data suggested that supplements of [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant) plus [zinc](../minerals/zinc) may reduce the progression of AMD and vision loss in affected individuals [(74)](#reference74). The main evidence came from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS). In this clinical trial, participants with borderline to advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were randomized to receive (1) [placebo](../glossary#placebo); (2) antioxidant vitamins (15 mg/day -carotene, of acetate); (3) zinc (80 mg/day) and copper (2 mg/day); or (4) both antioxidant vitamins and zinc and copper [(75)](#reference75). The five-year results indicated that the risk of developing advanced AMD was significantly reduced in those taking zinc with or without antioxidant vitamins. Antioxidant vitamins alone failed to prevent the progression to advanced AMD, even in individuals at higher risk. It was concluded from this study that a combination of antioxidant vitamins and minerals may benefit people with intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye [(74, 76)](#reference74). [Oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) contributes to the progression of type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) and causes damage to many organs and tissues, including the [pancreas](../glossary#pancreas), brain, eyes, peripheral nerves, and kidneys. Evidence from animal studies suggests that vitamin E supplementation could mitigate the role of [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) in the occurrence of diabetes complications (reviewed in [77](#reference77)). In the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene cancer prevention (ATBC) trial in male smokers, supplementation with 50 mg/day of synthetic -tocopherol (25 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol) had no effect on the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus during the 19-year post-intervention follow-up. Likewise, supplemental vitamin E intake during the trial made no difference on the incidence of macrovascular complications or mortality in participants with established type 2 diabetes [(78)](#reference78). In addition, a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 14 [heterogeneous](../glossary#heterogeneity) [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial), including 714 type 2 diabetic individuals, found that supplementation with vitamin E (200-1,800 IU/day for 6-27 weeks) had no effect on markers of glycemic control, including [glycated hemoglobin A1c](../glossary#glycated-hemoglobin) (HbA1c) level and measures of fasting glucose and fasting insulin concentrations [(79)](#reference79). Further subgroup analyses indicated that higher doses of vitamin E (>400 IU/day) supplemented for longer periods (>12 weeks) significantly reduced HbA1c level and fasting insulin concentration, suggesting that vitamin E could possibly enhance insulin action and glucose disposal in type 2 diabetic individuals [(79)](#reference79). Another recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that endothelial function in normal-weight and overweight \u2014 but not obese \u2014 patients with type 2 diabetes was significantly improved by supplementation with vitamin E and/or vitamin C [(80)](#reference80). Although there is reason to suspect that vitamin E supplementation may have utility in the management of type 2 diabetes, evidence for benefit from large, well-controlled [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) is still lacking. The increasing incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children and adults in industrialized countries is mainly attributed to the ongoing epidemic of [obesity](../glossary#obesity) and type 2 [diabetes mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus). NAFLD results from the abnormal accumulation of fat (steatosis) in the liver in the absence of heavy alcohol consumption. Although the condition is considered to be largely benign, NAFLD can progress to a more severe disease called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with increased [risks](../glossary#risk) [Oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) is thought to be one of the possible mechanisms responsible for prompting [inflammatory](../glossary#inflammation) processes that can lead to the progression of NAFLD to NASH. There is currently no established treatment for NAFLD and NASH other than interventions that encourage lifestyle changes and the use of medicines to control or treat metabolic disorders [(82)](#reference82). In the multicenter PIVENS (PIoglitazone versus Vitamin E versus placebo for the treatment of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis) trial, 247 nondiabetic subjects with NASH were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to receive 30 mg/day of pioglitazone (an insulin-sensitizing IU/day (536 RRR--tocopherol, or a [placebo](../glossary#placebo) for 96 weeks [(83)](#reference83). Only vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the overall rate of improvement in [histological](../glossary#histology) abnormalities that characterize NASH on liver biopsies (i.e., hepatocellular ballooning, steatosis, and lobular [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation)) [(84)](#reference84). Both active treatments improved some markers of liver function (i.e., alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) [(84)](#reference84). Yet, results from another two-year, [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) \u2014 called TONIC for Treatment Of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease In Children \u2014 in 173 children (ages, 8-17 years) with NAFLD failed to observe any significant reduction in blood concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases either with supplemental vitamin E or with metformin (an anti-diabetic drug; mg/day) compared to placebo [(85)](#reference85). However, vitamin E supplementation significantly improved the overall disease activity score \u2014 used to quantify the severity of the disease. In addition, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of another six trials found that vitamin E significantly lowered circulating aminotransferase concentrations in NAFLD and NASH patients, suggesting liver function improvements [(86)](#reference86). Finally, in a small nonrandomized, unblinded, controlled study in 42 obese children (mean age, 8 years) with NAFLD, lifestyle recommendations combined with 600 mg/day of supplemental RRR--tocopheryl acetate for six months reduced markers of oxidative stress and liver dysfunction and improved [insulin sensitivity](../glossary#insulin-sensitive) and the profile of lipid in the blood, when compared to baseline. No such changes in markers of oxidative stress, liver function, and glucose utilization were reported in the lifestyle intervention only group [(87)](#reference87). Further randomized and well-controlled studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. [Mitochondrial](../glossary#mitochondria) dysfunction and [oxidative stress](../glossary#oxidative-stress) are thought to contribute to the onset and/or progression of several [neurodegenerative diseases](../glossary#neurodegenerative-disease), especially [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease) (AD) [(88)](#reference88). The progressive degeneration of [neuronal](../glossary#neuron) cells that accompanies the decline of memory and other [cognitive](../glossary#cognitive) functions in subjects with Alzheimer's disease is associated with an intracellular aggregation of Tau fibrils, an extraneuronal accumulation [reduction](../glossary#reduction) ( [redox](../glossary#redox-reaction)) imbalance of complex [etiology](../glossary#etiology). In the brain of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and those with AD, the level of markers of oxidative damage to [DNA](../glossary#DNA), [proteins](../glossary#protein), and [lipids](../glossary#lipid) is increased, while the expression and activities of [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione) and [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) [enzymes](../glossary#enzyme) are reduced (reviewed in [88](#reference88)). In addition, a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) reported that circulating concentrations of vitamins, including vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E, were significantly lower in AD patients than in cognitively healthy individuals [(89)](#reference89). Other studies have documented low concentrations of vitamin E in [cerebrospinal fluid](../glossary#cerebrospinal-fluid) of cognitively impaired patients (reviewed in [90](#reference90)). Because a reduction in oxidative stress may help maintain cognitive status and/or prevent deterioration, the effects of vitamin E supplementation have been assessed in a few [intervention studies](../glossary#intervention-trial). An early multicenter, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled study in individuals with AD of moderate severity found that supplementation with 2,000 IU/day of all-rac--tocopherol (equivalent to 900 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol) for two years significantly delayed cognitive decline, slowed disease progression, and increased median survival [(91)](#reference91). However, a placebo-controlled trial in 769 patients with MCI found that the same dosage of vitamin E did not affect the probability of progression from MCI to AD over a three-year period [(92)](#reference92). In another [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), placebo-controlled trial, an improvement in cognitive performance \u2014 measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scoring system \u2014 was reported in AD patients randomized to receive 800 IU/day of all-rac--tocopherol (360 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol) for six months only when the treatment effectively reduced oxidative stress (as assessed by the measure of total glutathione and markers of [lipid peroxidation](../glossary#lipid-peroxidation) in the blood) [(93)](#reference93). Conversely, a failure to reduce oxidative stress resulted in supplemental vitamin E being more detrimental to the cognitive function of AD patients than placebo. In the most recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, supplemental vitamin E (2,000 IU/day; form of vitamin E not mentioned in the publication) for over two years significantly delayed functional decline \u2014 determined by the (in)ability to perform basic activities of daily living \u2014 and reduced the annual mortality rate in mild and moderate AD patients [(94)](#reference94). Yet, vitamin E failed to affect cognitive performance measured with MMSE scores and other cognitive ability tests. While there is currently little evidence to suggest that long-term supplementation of vitamin E provides any cognitive benefits in healthy older adults [(95)](#reference95), additional research needs to confirm whether vitamin E supplementation could benefit the management of patients with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairments. Major sources of -tocopherol in the American diet include vegetable oils (olive, sunflower, and safflower oils), nuts, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables. All eight forms of vitamin E (-, -, -, and -tocopherols and -, -, -, and -tocotrienols) occur naturally in mostly plant-based foods but in varying amounts. Table 2 lists the content of -tocopherol and -tocopherol (in milligrams) in some rich sources of vitamin E. For more information on the vitamin E content of foods, In the US, the average intake of -tocopherol from food (including enriched and [fortified](../glossary#fortification) sources) for adults (19 years of age) is 7.2 mg/day [(25)](#reference25); this level is well below the [RDA](../glossary#RDA) of 15 mg/day of -tocopherol (see [Table 1](#table-1)). While it appears feasible for individuals to meet the RDA from food only, Americans would have to depart from their current dietary practices and include greater intakes of nuts, seeds, fruit, and vegetables without increasing fat intake above recommended levels [(96)](#reference96). RRR--tocopherol is the only stereoisomeric form of -tocopherol found in unfortified foods. The same is not always true for nutritional [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Vitamin E supplements generally contain 100 IU to 1,000 IU of -tocopherol. Supplements made from entirely natural sources contain only RRR--tocopherol (wrongly labeled d--tocopherol). RRR--tocopherol is the most [bioavailable](../glossary#bioavailability) form of -tocopherol in the body. Synthetic -tocopherol, which is often found in [fortified](../glossary#fortification) food and nutritional supplements and usually labeled all-rac--tocopherol or dl--tocopherol, include all eight possible stereoisomers of -tocopherol (see [Function](#Function)). Because half of the [isomers](../glossary#isomer) present as a mixture in synthetic -tocopherol are not usable by the body, synthetic -tocopherol is less bioavailable than natural -tocopherol (see [Figure 1](#figure-1)). To calculate the amount (in milligrams) of -tocopherol bioavailable in a supplement, the conversion factors are as follows: In addition, vitamin E-fortified foods often contain synthetic -tocopherol, and amounts of vitamin E are provided as a percentage of the daily value ( [DV](../glossary#DV)) of 30 IU (approximately 20 mg of RRR--tocopherol). -Tocopheryl succinate and -tocopheryl acetate are the main esterified forms of vitamin E in nutritional [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Tocopherol [esters](../glossary#ester) are more resistant to [oxidation](../glossary#oxidation) during storage than unesterified tocopherols [(1)](#references). When taken orally, the succinate or acetate moieties are removed from -tocopherol in the intestine. The [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) of -tocopherol from -tocopheryl succinate and -tocopheryl acetate is equivalent to that of free -tocopherol [(97)](#reference97). Hence, the conversion factors used to determine the amount of bioavailable -tocopherol provided by -tocopheryl succinate and -tocopheryl acetate are the same as those used for -tocopherol (see [above](#formula)) [(2)](#reference2). Cell culture studies indicated that the vitamin E ester, -tocopheryl succinate, could inhibit [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation) and induce [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) in a number of [cancer](../glossary#cancer) cell lines [(12)](#reference12). Limited data from animal models of cancer found that -tocopheryl succinate administered by injection inhibited tumor growth [(98)](#reference98). There is currently no evidence in humans that taking oral -tocopheryl succinate supplements delivers -tocopheryl succinate to tissues. Of note, current research investigates nanomedicines to increase -tocopheryl succinate bioavailability before exploring putative nicotinate is another acid ( -tocopheryl nicotinate can be prescribed as a [lipid](../glossary#lipid)-lowering agent in Europe and Japan, it is marketed as a supplement only in the US [(99)](#reference99). There is currently no published evidence that [supplements](../glossary#supplement) containing -tocopheryl phosphates are more efficiently absorbed or have greater [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) in humans than those containing -tocopherol [(99)](#reference99). [Supplements](../glossary#supplement) containing -tocopherol, mixed tocopherols, or tocotrienols are also commercially available [(99)](#reference99). The amounts of - and -tocopherol in mixed tocopherol supplements vary, so it is important to read the label to determine the amount of each tocopherol form present in a capsule. Few side effects have been noted in adults taking [supplements](../glossary#supplement) of less than 2,000 mg of -tocopherol daily (either natural or synthetic vitamin E). However, most studies assessing safety issues or toxicity of -tocopherol supplementation have lasted only a few weeks to a few months, and side effects associated with long-term -tocopherol supplementation have not been adequately studied. The most worrisome possibility is that of impaired blood clotting, which increases the likelihood of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) in some individuals. A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) found that daily vitamin E supplementation \u2014 equivalent to 25 to 536 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol \u2014 for several years resulted in a significant, 10% reduction in the [risk](../glossary#risk) of [ischemic stroke](../glossary#ischemic-stroke) (five trials, 91,393 participants) and a nonsignificant trend towards an increased risk of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke) (five trials, 100,748 participants) [(100)](#reference100). A tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) for any form of supplemental -tocopherol (all possible stereoisomers) has been established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine to avoid the potential risk of bleeding (Table 3). Specifically, the UL of 1,000 mg/day of -tocopherol in any supplemental form (equivalent to 1,500 IU/day of RRR--tocopherol or 1,100 IU/day of all-rac--tocopherol) corresponds to the highest dose unlikely to result in hemorrhage in almost all adults [(2)](#reference2). Although only certain [isomers](../glossary#isomer) of -tocopherol are retained in the circulation, all forms are absorbed and [metabolized](../glossary#metabolism) by the liver. Hence, the rationale for a UL that refers to all stereoisomers of -tocopherol is based on the fact that any form of -tocopherol (natural or synthetic) can be absorbed and thus be potentially harmful. |Age for -tocopherol applies to all stereoisomers of -tocopherol (natural and synthetic) found in supplements and fortified food. Some physicians recommend discontinuing high-dose vitamin E supplementation two to four weeks before elective surgery \u2014 including dental procedures \u2014 to decrease the risk of hemorrhage [(99)](#reference99). Because dietary vitamin E is essential to prevent vitamin E deficiency in the newborn, vitamin E must be supplied in [parenteral nutrition](../glossary#total-parenteral-nutrition) solutions in infants who cannot be given enteral feeding, such as prematurely born infants. Yet, preterm infants appear to be especially vulnerable to adverse effects of -tocopherol supplementation, and supplemental vitamin E should be administered only under controlled supervision by a pediatrician [(101)](#reference101). Finally, the results of only one randomized controlled trial in 601 patients with common forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) indicated that supplementation with 400 IU/day of synthetic vitamin E (equivalent to 180 mg/day of RRR--tocopherol) modestly but significantly accelerated the loss of [retinal](../glossary#retina) function compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(22)](#reference22). Patients with common forms of RP should therefore avoid taking high-dose vitamin E supplements if they are not deficient in vitamin E (see [Deficiency](#deficiency)). A [prospective](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) [observational study](../glossary#observational-study) in over 4,000 participants of the Framingham Heart Study and the Framingham Offspring Study \u2014 with or without preexisting [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) \u2014 found no statistically significant association between vitamin E supplement intake and [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) or all-cause mortality after a 10-year follow-up period [(102)](#reference102). However, in addition to reports of increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) and heart failure with supplemental vitamin E in several [randomized controlled studies](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) (see [Cardiovascular disease](#cardiovascular-disease-prevention)), a [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) by Miller et al. [(103)](#reference103) suggested an increased risk of death with the use of large doses of vitamin E, yet lower than the UL. Specifically, this meta-analysis combined the results of 19 clinical trials of vitamin E supplementation that mostly focused on secondary prevention and, as such, included subjects with pre-existing conditions including heart disease, end-stage [renal](../glossary#renal) failure, and [Alzheimer's disease](../glossary#alzheimer-disease). The study found that daily supplementation with at least 400 IU of synthetic vitamin E (equivalent to 180 mg of RRR--tocopherol) resulted in a 4% increase in risk of death from any cause compared to [placebo](../glossary#placebo) [(103)](#reference103). However, further dose-response analysis and adjustment for intake of other vitamin and mineral supplements indicated that all-cause mortality risk was significantly increased by 7% only at a dose of 2,000 IU/day, which is notably higher than the UL for adults (1,100 IU/day of synthetic tocopherol or 1,500 IU/day of natural tocopherol; see [Table 3](#table-3)). Additionally, a more recent meta-analysis of 46 randomized trials, including 171,244 participants, found that supplemental vitamin E, singly or in combination with other [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), did not significantly alter the risk of all-cause mortality [(104)](#reference104). At present, there is no convincing evidence that vitamin E supplementation below the UL increases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease or other causes, especially in generally healthy subjects. Yet, individuals with pre-existing conditions may be at increased risk of serious adverse effects (including death) if one considers the possibility that large doses of supplemental vitamin E might interfere with medications, and possibly lower their efficacy or increase their toxicity [(1)](#references). Large doses of vitamin E may inhibit [vitamin K](vitamin-K)-dependent carboxylase activity and interfere with the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) cascade (see the article on [Vitamin K](vitamin-K#nutrient-interactions)) [(19)](#reference19). Hence, the use of vitamin E [supplements](../glossary#supplement) may increase the risk of bleeding in individuals taking [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs (blood thinners), such as heparin and the vitamin including aspirin, ibuprofen, and others. In addition, individuals who may be vitamin K deficient due to liver failure, those with a propensity to bleed (e.g., bleeding [peptic ulcers](../glossary#peptic-ulcer-disease)), and those with inherited bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia) or a history of [hemorrhagic stroke](../glossary#hemorrhagic-stroke), should not take -tocopherol supplements without close medical supervision because of the increased risk of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) [(20](#reference20), [99)](#reference99). Finally, it cannot be excluded that vitamin E would potentiate the antithrombotic activity of supplemental fish oils and herbal products, such as garlic, curcumin, or Ginkgo biloba [(99)](#reference99). A number of colestipol), as well as orlistat, sucralfate, mineral oil, and the fat substitute, olestra, which interfere with fat absorption, may theoretically decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin E. The [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) drugs phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), and carbamazepine (Tegretol), may also [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations in individuals with [epilepsy](../glossary#epilepsy) [(105)](#reference105). A three-year [randomized controlled trial](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) in 160 heart disease](../glossary#coronary-heart-disease) (CHD) and low high-density-lipoprotein ( [HDL](../glossary#HDL)) levels found that a combination of simvastatin (Zocor) and [niacin](niacin) increased the HDL2 subfraction level (considered most cardioprotective), inhibited the progression of [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing), and decreased the frequency of [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, such as [myocardial infarction](../glossary#myocardial-infarction) and [stroke](../glossary#stroke) [(106)](#reference106). Surprisingly, when an [antioxidant](../glossary#antioxidant) combination of 1,000 mg of vitamin C, 800 IU (536 mg) of RRR--tocopherol, 100 g of selenium, and 25 mg of -carotene daily, was taken with the simvastatin-niacin combination, the protective effects were diminished. However, in a much larger randomized controlled trial of simvastatin and an antioxidant combination of 600 mg of all-rac--tocopherol (297 mg of RRR--tocopherol), 250 mg of vitamin C, and 20 mg of -carotene daily in more than 20,000 men and women with CHD or diabetes, the antioxidant combination did not adversely affect the cardioprotective effects of simvastatin therapy over a five-year period [(107)](#reference107). These contradictory findings indicate that further research is needed on potential interactions between antioxidant supplementation and cholesterol-lowering agents like statins. The Recommended Dietary Allowance ( [RDA](../glossary#RDA)) for vitamin E for adult men and women is 15 mg (22.5 IU) per day. Notably, more than 90% of individuals two years of age and older in the US do not meet the daily requirement for vitamin E from food sources alone. Therefore, LPI recommends that generally healthy adults (aged 19 years and older) take a daily [multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements), which usually contains 30 IU of synthetic vitamin E \u2014 equivalent to 13.5 mg of RRR--tocopherol and 90% of the RDA. The Linus Pauling Institute's recommendation to take a daily [multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplement](../micronutrients-health/multivitamin-mineral-supplements) containing vitamin E is also appropriate for generally healthy older adults. MVMs typically contain 30 IU of synthetic vitamin E, covering 90% of the [RDA](../glossary#RDA).

Vitamin K-dependent -carboxylation that occurs only on specific glutamic acid residues in identified vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDP) is critical for their ability to bind [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [(5)](#reference5). Although vitamin K is a [fat](../glossary#lipid)-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin), the body stores very small amounts that are rapidly depleted without regular dietary intake. Perhaps because of its limited ability to store vitamin K, the body recycles it through a process called the vitamin K-epoxide cycle (Figure 2). The vitamin K cycle allows a small amount of vitamin K to be reused many times for [protein](../glossary#protein) [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation), thus decreasing the dietary requirement. Briefly, vitamin K hydroquinone (reduced form) is [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) to vitamin K epoxide (oxidized form). The reaction enables -glutamylcarboxylase to carboxylate selective glutamic acid residues on vitamin K-dependent proteins. The recycling of vitamin K epoxide (oxidized form) to hydroquinone (reduced form) is carried out by two reactions that reduce vitamin K epoxide (KO) to vitamin K quinone and then to vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2; Figure 2). Additionally, the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) vitamin K-epoxide reductase (VKOR) [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the reduction of KO to vitamin K quinone and may be involved \u2014 as well as another yet-to-defined reductase \u2014 in the production of KH2 from vitamin K quinone [(6, 7)](#reference6). The [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) drug warfarin acts as a vitamin K [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) by inhibiting VKOR activity, hence preventing vitamin K recycling (see [Coagulation](#coagulation)). The ability to bind [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [ions](../glossary#ion) (Ca2+) is required for the activation of the several vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, or [proteins](../glossary#protein), in the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) (clotting) cascade. The term 'coagulation cascade' refers to a series of events, each dependent on the other, that stops bleeding through clot formation. Vitamin K-dependent - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of specific glutamic acid residues in those proteins makes it possible for them to bind calcium. Factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X make up the core of the coagulation cascade. Protein Z appears to enhance the action of thrombin (the activated form of prothrombin) by promoting its association with [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) in [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Protein C and protein S are [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) proteins that provide control and balance in the coagulation cascade; protein Z also has an anticoagulatory function. Control mechanisms for the coagulation cascade exist since uncontrolled clotting may be as life threatening as uncontrolled bleeding. Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors are [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) in the liver. Consequently, severe liver disease results in lower blood levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for uncontrolled bleeding ( [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage)) [(8)](#reference8). Some people are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of forming clots, which could block the flow of blood in arteries of the heart, brain, or lungs, resulting in [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (heart attack), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), or pulmonary embolism, respectively. Abnormal clotting is not related to excessive vitamin K intake, and there is no known toxicity associated with vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 (see [Toxicity](#toxicity)). Some oral [anticoagulants](../glossary#anticoagulant), such as warfarin (Jantoven, formerly known as Coumadin), inhibit [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) by [antagonizing](../glossary#antagonist) the action of vitamin K. Warfarin prevents the recycling of vitamin K by blocking VKOR activity, thus creating a functional vitamin K deficiency (Figure 2). Inadequate -carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins interferes with the coagulation cascade, which inhibits blood clot formation. Large quantities of dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin K can overcome the anticoagulant effect of vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist); thus, patients taking these drugs are cautioned against consuming very large or highly variable quantities of vitamin K (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Experts now advise a reasonably constant dietary intake of vitamin K that meets current dietary recommendations (90-120 g/day) for patients taking vitamin K antagonists like warfarin [(9, 10)](#reference9). Vitamin K-dependent - protein) by [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast) (bone-forming cells); the synthesis of osteocalcin is regulated by the active form of [vitamin D](vitamin-D), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). The calcium-binding vitamin K-dependent -carboxylation of three glutamic acid residues. Although its function in bone mineralization is not fully understood, osteocalcin is required for the growth and maturation of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)) [(11)](#reference11). Protein S appears to play a role in the breakdown of bone mediated by [osteoclasts](../glossary#osteoclast). Individuals with inherited protein S deficiency suffer complications related to increased blood clotting, as well as [osteonecrosis](../glossary#osteonecrosis) [(12, 13)](#reference12). Protein S can bind and activate [receptors](../glossary#receptor) of the TAM family that are involved in [phagocytosis](../glossary#phagocytosis). [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) in TAM receptors can result in visual impairment, defective [spermatogenesis](../glossary#spermatogenesis), [autoimmune disorders](../glossary#autoimmune-disease), and [platelet](../glossary#platelet) disorders [(14)](#reference14). MGP has been found in [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage), bone, and soft tissue, including blood vessel walls, where it is synthesized and secreted by vascular smooth muscle cells. MGP is involved in the inhibition of [calcification](../glossary#calcification) at various sites, including cartilage, vessel wall, skin elastic fibers, and the trabecular meshwork in the eye (see [Vascular calcification](#vascular-calcification-prevention)) [(15, 16)](#reference15). several VKDPs, including MGP, have been associated with calcification sites in arteries, skin, kidneys, and eyes in certain inherited conditions, such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum and beta-thalassemia [(17, 18)](#reference17). The vitamin K-dependent proteins, GRP and periostin, are also synthesized in bone tissue, but their roles in bone metabolism are still unclear [(19, 20)](#reference19). Expressed in normal human skin and vascular tissues, GRP has been colocalized with abnormal mineral deposits in the extracellular matrix in calcified arteries and calcified skin lesions [(21)](#reference21). Expressed in most connective tissues, including skin and bone, periostin was initially associated with cell adhesion and migration. This VKDP also appears to promote [angiogenesis](../glossary#angiogenesis) (formation of new blood vessels) during cardiac valve degeneration and tumor growth [(22, 23)](#reference22). Current research suggests that reduced -glutamylcarboxylase activity and/or lower vitamin K [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) may impair the activity of VKDPs and contribute to bone mineralization defects and abnormal soft tissue calcification (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(24)](#reference24). Growth arrest-specific gene 6 [protein](../glossary#protein) (Gas6) is a vitamin K-dependent protein that was identified in 1993. It has been found throughout the nervous system, as well in the heart, lungs, stomach, kidneys, and [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage). Identified as a ligand of the TAM family of transmembrane tyrosine kinase [receptors](../glossary#receptor), Gas6 appears to be a cellular growth regulation factor with [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) activities. Gas6 has been involved in diverse cellular functions, including [phagocytosis](../glossary#phagocytosis), cell adhesion, cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), and protection against [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) [(5)](#reference5). It may also play important roles in the developing and aging nervous system (reviewed in [25](#reference25)). Further, Gas6 appears to regulate [platelet](../glossary#platelet) signaling and vascular [hemostasis](../glossary#hemostasis) [(26)](#reference26). Expressed in most tissues and involved in many cellular functions, Gas6 has also been linked to several pathological conditions, including clot formation (thrombogenesis), [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis), chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) growth [(27-29)](#reference27). Overt vitamin K deficiency results in impaired blood clotting, usually demonstrated by laboratory tests that measure clotting time. Symptoms include easy bruising and bleeding that may be manifested as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in the urine, blood in the stool, tarry black stools, or extremely heavy menstrual bleeding. In infants, vitamin K deficiency may result in life-threatening bleeding within the skull (intracranial [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage)) [(8)](#reference8). Multiple [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of vitamin K [status](../glossary#status) exist (reviewed in [30](#reference30)), but only impaired blood [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) is used as a measure of clinical vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency is uncommon in healthy adults for a number of reasons: (1) vitamin K is widespread in foods (see [Food sources](#food-sources)); (2) the vitamin K cycle conserves vitamin K (see [Vitamin K oxidation-reduction cycle](#vitamin-K-oxidation-reduction-cycle)); and (3) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) that normally inhabit the large intestine [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) menaquinones (vitamin K2), although it is unclear whether significant amounts are absorbed and utilized (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). Adults at [risk](../glossary#risk) for vitamin K deficiency include those taking vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) and individuals with significant liver damage or disease [(8)](#reference8). Additionally, individuals with [fat](../glossary#lipid) [malabsorption disorders](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome), including [inflammatory bowel disease](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease) and [cystic fibrosis,](../glossary#cystic-fibrosis) may be at increased risk of vitamin K deficiency [(31-34)](#reference31). Newborn babies who are exclusively breast-fed are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for vitamin K deficiency because human milk is relatively low in vitamin K compared to formula. Newborn infants, in general, have low vitamin K [status](../glossary#status) for the following reasons: (1) vitamin K transport across the [placental](../glossary#placenta) barrier is limited; (2) liver storage of vitamin K is very low; (3) the vitamin K cycle may not be fully functional in newborns, especially premature infants; (4) the vitamin K content of breast milk is low, and immature gut flora [(5](#reference5), [35)](#reference35). Infants whose mothers are on [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) medication to prevent [seizures](../glossary#seizure) are also at risk for vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency in newborns may result in a bleeding disorder called vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) of the newborn (reviewed in [36](#reference36)). Because VKDB is life threatening and easily prevented, the American Academy of Pediatrics and a number of similar international organizations recommend that an intramuscular dose of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) be administered to all newborns shortly after birth (reviewed in [37](#reference37)). Vitamin K and childhood leukemia: In the early 1990s, two [retrospective studies](../glossary#retrospective-study) were published suggesting a possible association between phylloquinone injections in newborns and the development of childhood [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia) and other forms of childhood [cancer](../glossary#cancer). However, two large retrospective studies in the US and Sweden, which reviewed the medical records of 54,000 and 1.3 million children, respectively, found no evidence of a relationship between childhood cancers and phylloquinone injections at birth [(38, 39)](#reference38). Moreover, a pooled analysis of six [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), including 2,431 children diagnosed with childhood cancer and 6,338 cancer-free children, found no evidence that phylloquinone injections for newborns increased the [risk](../glossary#risk) of childhood leukemia [(40)](#reference40). In a policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that routine vitamin K [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) for newborns be continued because VKDB is life threatening and the risks of cancer are unproven and unlikely [(41)](#reference41). In the last decade, physicians have reported a rise in late-onset cases of VKDB due to an increasing trend of parental omission or refusal of newborn vitamin K prophylaxis [(42, 43)](#reference42). Lower doses of vitamin K1 for premature infants: The results of two studies of vitamin K levels in premature infants suggest that the standard initial dose of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) for full-term infants (1.0 mg) may be too high for premature infants [(44, 45)](#reference44). These findings have led some experts to suggest the use of an initial phylloquinone dose of 0.3 mg/kg for infants with birth weights of less than 1,000 g (2 lbs, 3 oz), and an initial phylloquinone dose of 0.5 mg would probably prevent hemorrhagic disease in newborns [(44)](#reference44). Yet, additional studies are needed to determine the best vitamin K prophylaxis in premature infants [(46)](#reference46). In 2001, the US Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) established the adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) level for vitamin K based on phylloquinone intake levels in healthy individuals (Table 1). The AI for infants was based on estimated intake of vitamin K from breast milk [(47)](#reference47). The FNB did not consider menaquinone intakes; and younger||-||75| and older||-||90| The discovery of vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) in bone has led to research on the role of vitamin K in maintaining bone health. Vitamin K1: [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found a relationship between phylloquinone and age-related bone loss ( [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis)). The Nurses' Health Study followed more than 72,000 women for 10 years. In an analysis of this cohort, women whose phylloquinone intakes were lower than 109 micrograms/day (g/day) had a 30% higher [risk](../glossary#risk) for hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) compared to women with intakes equal to or above 109 g/day [(49)](#reference49). Another prospective study in over 800 elderly men and women, followed in the Framingham Heart Study for seven years, found that participants with dietary vitamin K intakes in the highest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) (median, 254 g/day) had a 65% lower risk of hip fracture than those with intakes in the lowest quartile (median, 56 g/day) [(50)](#reference50). Osteoporotic fractures are often linked to a reduction in bone mineralization. Yet, the investigators found no association between dietary phylloquinone intake and [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) in the Framingham subjects [(50)](#reference50). While other studies failed to observe associations between dietary phylloquinone intake and measures of bone strength, BMD, or fracture incidence [(51, 52)](#reference51), the [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of a cohort of 3,199 middle-aged women found that subjects in the highest quartile of dietary phylloquinone intake had significantly greater hip and [lumbar spine](../glossary#lumbar-spine) BMD than those in the lowest quartile (162 vs. 59 g/day) [(53)](#reference53). Moreover, cross-sectional and [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) have reported associations between higher phylloquinone intakes and lower incidence of hip fracture [(54, 55)](#reference54). However, because green leafy vegetables are the primary dietary source of phylloquinone and because they are usually part of a balanced diet, high phylloquinone consumption may simply be an indicator of healthy eating habits, which may \u2014 rather than phylloquinone itself \u2014 account for all or part of the association reported in observational studies [(56)](#reference56). The few studies that measured [plasma](../glossary#plasma) phylloquinone generally found that higher circulating levels were associated with lower fracture risk [(15](#reference15), [57, 58)](#reference57). For example, the incidence of [vertebral](../glossary#vertebral) fractures was inversely correlated with lumbar BMD and plasma phylloquinone in a four-year [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that included 379 Japanese women ages 30-88 years [(57)](#reference57). Yet, observational studies are not designed to making causal inferences, and only [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) can evaluate whether phylloquinone may have beneficial effects on bone health (see [Vitamin K supplementation studies and osteoporosis](#vitamin-K-supplementation-osteoporosis)). Vitamin K2: There are few studies on associations between menaquinones (vitamin K2) and bone health, perhaps because of the limited number of dietary sources of menaquinone-4 (MK-4), the main form of vitamin K2 present in Western diets. The Japanese food natto, made of cooked soybeans fermented by Bacillus subtilis natto, is rich in MK-7. In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 944 Japanese women (ages 20-79 years), total hip [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) at baseline was positively associated with natto intake in postmenopausal women [(59)](#reference59). During the three-year follow-up period, the rate of BMD loss at the [femoral neck](../glossary#femoral-neck) was significantly lower in women consuming natto (>200 g/day of MK-7) compared to non-consumers. No association was found between natto intake and BMD in premenopausal women [(59)](#reference59). Total hip and femoral neck BMD was also reportedly higher in nearly 2,000 Japanese men aged 65 years and older who regularly consumed at least of one pack per day of natto (350 g/day of MK-7) compared to those consuming less than one pack per week (<50 g/day of MK-7) [(60)](#reference60). Yet, increasing natto consumption also maximizes the intake of other dietary compounds (e.g., soy isoflavones) that have potential benefits for skeletal health; thus, there is need to find reliable measures of vitamin K [status](../glossary#status). To date, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have failed to unequivocally support an association between circulating menaquinone (MK-7 and MK-4) levels and fracture risk [(15](#reference15), [61)](#reference61). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that pooled the results of four prospective cohort studies and one [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) found higher total dietary vitamin K intakes to be associated with a lower risk of total fracture ( [RR](../glossary#relative-risk), 0.78; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval): 0.56, 0.99) [(62)](#reference62). In a recent Japanese cohort study not included in this meta-analysis (i.e., the Murakami Cohort Study), a protective association of dietary vitamin K intake was seen for vertebral fractures (p=0.005); vitamin K intake was not associated with total fracture in women or with either vertebral or total fracture in men [(63)](#reference63). [Biomarker of vitamin K status and bone health] Total circulating levels of the bone [protein](../glossary#protein), osteocalcin (OC), have been shown to be sensitive markers of bone formation. Several [hormones](../glossary#hormone) and growth factors, including [vitamin D](vitamin-D) but not vitamin K, regulate osteocalcin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast). However, vitamin K is an essential [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for the - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of three glutamic acid residues in osteocalcin. Undercarboxylation of osteocalcin in human bone and [serum](../glossary#serum) has been linked to poor vitamin K [status](../glossary#status). The degree of osteocalcin -carboxylation is responsive to vitamin K nutritional interventions, and thus is used as a relative indicator of vitamin K status [(11)](#reference11). Circulating levels of uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) were found to be higher in postmenopausal women than premenopausal women and markedly higher in women over the age of 70. Also, high ratios of ucOC to total OC (ucOC/OC) appear to be predictive of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) [risk](../glossary#risk) in elderly women [(64, 65)](#reference64). Although vitamin K deficiency would seem the most likely cause of elevated blood ucOC/OC ratio, some investigators have documented an inverse relationship between biochemical measures of vitamin D nutritional status and ucOC levels, as well as a significant lowering of ucOC/OC ratio by vitamin D supplementation [(66)](#reference66). It has been suggested that increased circulating ucOC/OC ratio could reflect a poor overall nutritional status that would include vitamin D inadequacy, which would explain the above-mentioned observations [(67)](#reference67). However, in several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled women [(69)](#reference69), vitamin D supplementation failed to decrease ucOC/OC ratios or show any additive effect on ucOC/OC lowering by supplemental vitamin K. Vitamin K1 supplementation: The review of five [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) that assessed the effect of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on hip [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) using doses ranging from 200 g/day to 5,000 g/day for durations of 12 to 36 months found little promising benefit for bone health [(15)](#reference15). Although supplementation with phylloquinone decreased ucOC levels in all five studies, only one study reported an effect of supplemental phylloquinone on BMD [(70)](#reference70). In this study, 150 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive a [placebo](../glossary#placebo), minerals (500 mg/day of calcium, 150 mg/day of magnesium, and 10 mg/day of zinc) plus vitamin D (320 IU/day), or minerals, vitamin D, and phylloquinone (1,000 g/day). The rate of BMD loss at the [femoral neck](../glossary#femoral-neck), but not at the [lumbar spine](../glossary#lumbar-spine), was significantly lower in subjects with supplemental phylloquinone compared to the other two groups. Thus, evidence of a putative benefit of phylloquinone on bone health in older adults is considered weak. None of the studies were designed to assess the effect of phylloquinone on [osteoporotic](../glossary#osteoporosis)-related [fractures](../glossary#fracture). Further investigation may seek to evaluate whether phylloquinone supplementation could improve skeletal health in subjects at high-risk for vitamin K inadequacy (e.g., individuals with [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) name, menatetrenone) are currently used in Japan in the treatment of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) [(71)](#reference71). Accordingly, most [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) investigating the effect of high-dose MK-4 on bone loss have been conducted in Japanese postmenopausal women. In a three-year [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial among postmenopausal women with [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia), adding a MK-7 supplement (375 g/day) to combined calcium-vitamin D supplementation did not affect BMD or other bone health parameters despite reductions in [serum](../glossary#serum) ucOC [(72)](#reference72). At present, the potential role for supplemental menaquinones on bone health still needs to be established in large, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), and well-controlled trials. A 2019 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) in postmenopausal women or women with osteoporosis found vitamin K supplementation \u2014 of any form \u2014 lowered risk of clinical [fracture](../glossary#fracture) compared to controls (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95; 9 trials varying from 6 months to 2 years: 3 using phylloquinone, 5 using MK-4, and 1 using MK-7) [(73)](#reference73). However, no benefit of vitamin K supplementation was seen for vertebral fractures (7 trials) or BMD (22 trials). The authors of this meta-analysis noted that the high [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) of the included trials (i.e., form and dose of vitamin K, use of other supplements and drugs by participants, and treatment length) makes it difficult to inform clinical recommendations [(73)](#reference73). Certain oral [anticoagulants](../glossary#anticoagulant), such as warfarin, are known to be [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) of vitamin K (see [Coagulation](#coagulation)). Few studies have examined chronic use of warfarin and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in older women. One study reported no association between long-term warfarin treatment and fracture risk [(74)](#reference74), while another one found a significantly higher risk of rib and [vertebral](../glossary#vertebral) fractures in warfarin users compared to nonusers [(75)](#reference75). Additionally, a study in elderly patients with [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) reported that long-term warfarin treatment was associated with a significantly higher risk of [osteoporotic](../health-disease/osteoporosis) fracture in men but not in women [(76)](#reference76). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of the results of 11 published studies found that oral anticoagulation therapy was associated with a very modest reduction in [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) at the wrist and no change in BMD at the hip or spine [(77)](#reference77). The development of new anticoagulants that do not block vitamin K recycling may offer a safer alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists [(78)](#reference78). [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) examining vitamin K intake in relation to cardiovascular-related mortality have found conflicting results [(48)](#reference48). An [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin K intake and mortality was reported in a US national survey (NHANES III) of 3,401 participants [(79)](#reference79). Adequate vs. inadequate vitamin K intakes (based on sex-specific [AI](../glossary#AI): 90 g/day for women and 120 g/day for men) were associated with a 22% lower risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD)-related mortality and a 15% lower risk of all-cause mortality. The report also indicated that, while over two-thirds of individuals with chronic kidney disease had vitamin K intakes below the AI, the risk of CVD mortality was 41% lower in those with adequate compared to suboptimal intakes [(79)](#reference79). However, higher vitamin K intakes were not associated with lower CVD mortality in a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 7,216 older adults at risk for developing CVD [(80)](#reference80). This study associated higher intakes of phylloquinone, but not of menaquinones, with lower risk of all-cause mortality. More recently, in a prospective study that followed a cohort of 33,289 Dutch men and women for an average of 16.8 years (the EPIC-Netherlands), neither phylloquinone intake nor menaquinone intake at baseline was associated with mortality from cardiovascular disease, [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), or all causes [(81)](#reference81). Yet, a prospective study of 56,048 men and women participating in the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort reported higher phylloquinone intakes to be associated with lower risks of both cardiovascular disease-related mortality and all-cause mortality [(82)](#reference82). Moreover, a few studies have examined the association of fasting circulating phylloquinone with cardiovascular-related or all-cause mortality. In a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of individual participant data from three prospective cohort studies (the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, and the Framingham Offspring Study), a blood phylloquinone concentration less than or equal to 0.5 nmol/L (n=1,081) was associated with a 19% higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to a blood concentration >1.0 nmol/L (n=1,698; [83](#reference83)). This analysis did not find circulating phylloquinone to be linked with incident cardiovascular disease [(83)](#reference83). Observational studies offer limited support of an inverse relationship between phylloquinone intake and risk of incident cardiovascular disease, despite high intakes being sometimes regarded as a marker of healthy dietary habits associated with low cardiovascular risk (reviewed in [84](#reference84)). A prospective cohort study of 16,057 Dutch women (ages 49-70 years), followed for a mean period of 8.1 years, found a 9% reduction in risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) per each incremental 10 g/day increase in menaquinone intake [(85)](#reference85). In another earlier Dutch study that examined 4,807 healthy men and women 55 years and older, participants in the highest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of menaquinone intake (>32.7 g/day) had a 41% lower risk of incident CHD and a 26% lower risk of all-cause mortality than those in the lowest tertile (<21.6 g/day) [(86)](#reference86). In addition, menaquinone intake was found to be inversely associated with aortic [calcification](../glossary#calcification), a major risk factor for CVD [(86)](#reference86). A smaller prospective study among 2,987 Norwegian adults, followed for an average of 10.8 years, reported higher dietary intakes of vitamin K2, but not of vitamin K1, were associated with a lower risk of CHD [(87)](#reference87). While these data are interesting, it is important to note that vitamin K2 may solely be a marker of a heart-healthy diet and might not itself be cardioprotective. Most recently, the prospective Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study followed 53,372 older adults for an average of 21 years, finding both phylloquinone and menaquinone intake at baseline to be inversely associated with hospitalizations due to [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) cardiovascular events, including ischemic to determine whether vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 reduces the risk of CHD or cardiovascular-related events like [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or stroke. One of the hallmarks of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) is the presence of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaques in arterial walls. Plaque rupture that causes blood clot formation (thrombogenesis) is the usual cause of a [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (heart attack) or [stroke](../health-disease/stroke). While [calcification](../glossary#calcification) of the plaques occurs as the atherosclerosis progresses, it is unclear whether calcification increases plaque instability and could predict [risk](../glossary#risk) of rupture and thrombogenesis [(89)](#reference89). However, calcification may be predictive of future [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, especially in those with chronic kidney disease [(90)](#reference90). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 30 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including a total of 218,080 participants, found that the presence of vascular calcification was associated with an overall three- to four-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality [(91)](#reference91). An early population-based study of postmenopausal women (ages, 60-79 years) observed that the younger women (60-69 years) with aortic calcifications had lower vitamin K intakes than those without aortic calcifications, but this was not true for older women (70-79 years) [(92)](#reference92). A prospective cohort study in 807 men and women, 39-45 years of age, did not find any correlation between dietary phylloquinone intake and [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) calcification, phylloquinone nor menaquinone intake was associated with calcification of breast arteries in a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 1,689 women ages 49-70 years [(94)](#reference94). However, in another cross-sectional study, the upper vs. lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of menaquinone (MK-4 to MK-10) intake (median intakes, 48.5 g/day vs. 18 g/day) was found to be associated with a 20% reduced [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of coronary artery calcification in 564 postmenopausal women [(95)](#reference95). Research has uncovered possible mechanisms by which vitamin K may inhibit mineralization (calcification) of vessels while promoting bone mineralization. The potential mechanisms, although not yet fully understood, implicate vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein), including matrix [(96-98)](#reference96). Secreted by various cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in arterial vessel walls, MGP appears to be important for the prevention of calcification of soft tissues, including [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage), vasculature, skin, and trabecular meshwork cells in the eye [(15](#reference15), [99)](#reference99). In MGP knockout mice, conversion of VSMCs into bone-like cells and extensive vessel calcification results in large vessel rupture and premature death. In humans, defective MGP [gene](../glossary#gene) has been linked to Keutel syndrome, a rare inherited condition characterized in particular by abnormal cartilage calcification and pulmonary artery [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing). Calcification prevention by MGP involved several mechanisms, including the binding to calcium crystals and the inhibition of proteins (bone morphogenic proteins; BMPs) known to promote ectopic bone formation (reviewed in [100](#reference100)). Calcium-binding activity of MGP is regulated by two types of modifications (known as post-translational modifications since they take place after protein [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis)): the vitamin K-dependent [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of up to five Glu residues and the [phosphorylation](../glossary#phosphorylation) of serine residues. A variation in the sequence ( [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism)) of the gene for MGP leading to a threonine-to-alanine transition in one of the five Gla domains of the protein may possibly prevent carboxylation and elicit a change in MGP ability to bind calcium. This polymorphism, known as MGPThr83Ala, has been associated with the progression of coronary artery calcification over a mean period of 10.6 years in a community-based prospective study that followed 605 middle-aged men and women [(101)](#reference101). This association was only observed among participants without detectable calcification at baseline and not in those who had baseline calcification [(101)](#reference101). Interestingly, MGPThr83Ala was also associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and femoral artery calcification in carriers of the genotype [(102)](#reference102). Additionally, a small study initially found that, while undercarboxylated MGP (ucMGP) was absent from the innermost lining of the [carotid arteries](../glossary#carotid-arteries) in healthy subjects, the majority of MGP in the carotid arterial lining of patients with atherosclerosis was undercarboxylated [(103)](#reference103). In another study that examined the association between circulating MGP and incident cardiovascular events in 577 older men and women followed for a mean period of 5.6 years, the risk of cardiovascular disease (i.e., coronary artery disease, [peripheral arterial disease](../glossary#peripheral-arterial-disease), and [cerebrovascular disease](../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease)) was two- to three-fold greater in subjects in the highest vs. lowest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) dephosphorylated and undercarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) [(104)](#reference104). The results of another prospective study suggested that circulating dp-ucMGP may be predictive of mortality risk in subjects with overt vascular disease [(105)](#reference105). Indeed, the risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality was found to be nearly doubled in subjects with coronary artery disease or stroke in the highest vs. lowest quartile of dp-ucMGP concentrations [(105)](#reference105). Because suboptimal vitamin K nutritional may limit carboxylation and result in biologically inactive ucMGP, it has been speculated that vitamin K [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may protect against vascular calcification. A three-year, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trial investigated the potential effect of vitamin K on the progression of coronary calcification in 401 older, community-dwelling adults (ages, 60-80 years) free of cardiovascular disease at baseline [(106)](#reference106). The participants were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to receive a daily multivitamin plus calcium and vitamin D with or without 500 mg of phylloquinone. Using measurements of coronary artery calcification at baseline and follow up, it was found that phylloquinone supplementation was able to limit the progression of vascular calcification and reduce plasma dp-ucMGP compared to control [(106, 107)](#reference106). Although circulating dp-ucMGP was correlated to various markers of vitamin K status, no association with measures of coronary artery calcification were found [(107)](#reference107). Smaller trials in those at high risk for coronary artery disease [(108)](#reference108) or with existing aortic valve calcification [(109)](#reference109), mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(110)](#reference110), or kidney disease 112)](#reference111) have reported no benefit of vitamin K2 supplementation on progression of vascular calcification. A meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials found that vitamin K supplementation reduced dp-ucMGP (7 trials), reduced ucOC (4 trials), and decreased progression of vascular calcification (3 trials) [(113)](#reference113). Yet, the authors emphasize that any conclusions from their pooled analysis are limited by the high [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) of the trials with respect to the form and dose of vitamin K utilized, as well as the assays that assessed vascular calcification [(113)](#reference113). Thus, further investigations are necessary to examine the role of other vitamin K-dependent proteins (e.g., GRP, periostin, Gas6) in human atherosclerotic plaque calcification and to evaluate the effect of supplemental vitamin K on the progression of vascular calcification and risk of cardiovascular disease. Several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have reported increased vascular calcium scores (a means to quantify vascular calcification) in chronic users of vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) compared to nonusers (reviewed in [114](#reference114)). Warfarin therapy has also been associated with higher circulating concentrations of dp-ucMGP in a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that examined vascular [calcification](../glossary#calcification) in subjects with cardiovascular disease [(105)](#reference105). Newly developed direct inhibitors of [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) factors that do not interfere with VKDP activity may be more suitable than vitamin K antagonists, especially with regards to vascular calcification [(114)](#reference114). [Osteoarthritis](../glossary#osteoarthritis), a degenerative joint condition that affects more than 32 million US adults [(115)](#reference115), is characterized by the breakdown of articular [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage) (i.e., cartilage within the joint). Because several vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) are present in cartilage and in bone [(116)](#reference116), vitamin K inadequacy may have a role in the development of osteoarthritis. A few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have investigated a possible link between vitamin K intake or status and osteoarthritis. A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) among 719 Japanese older adults found dietary intake of vitamin K to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with knee osteoarthritis [(117)](#reference117). In the Framingham Offspring Study (n=672; mean age, 66 years), higher [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of phylloquinone were associated with a lower risk of hand, but not knee, osteoarthritis [(118)](#reference118). A longitudinal study of 1,180 US adults (mean age, 62 years) found that low plasma concentrations of phylloquinone (0.5 nM) at baseline \u2014 indicative of a [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) vitamin K deficiency \u2014 were associated with a 56% increase in risk of knee osteoarthritis after 30 months compared to those with higher plasma concentrations [(119)](#reference119). In a more recent longitudinal study among 523 older US adults participating in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, those with extremely low plasma concentrations of phylloquinone (<0.2 nM) at baseline had increased progression of knee osteoarthritis over three years, assessed by [MRI](../glossary#magnetic-resonance-imaging) of articular cartilage and the meniscus; those with higher plasma concentrations experienced no significant progression of knee osteoarthritis [(120)](#reference120). Moreover, recent studies have associated use of the vitamin K [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) drugs with higher risks of osteoarthritis [(121)](#reference121) and joint replacement [(121)](#reference121) of the knee and hip compared to nonusers. While these observational data are interesting, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to determine whether vitamin K [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in those with low vitamin K status might help prevent or treat osteoarthritis. In an ancillary study of a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trial examining the effects of vitamin K supplementation on bone loss and vascular calcification in older adults, no effects of phylloquinone supplementation (500 g/day) were found on incidence of hand osteoarthritis after three years [(122)](#reference122). Study participants were not screened for vitamin K status, and in a subgroup analysis, those with [serum](../glossary#serum) phylloquinone 1 nM at baseline that reached >1 nM at year 3 had less joint deterioration. These data infer that only those individuals with low vitamin K status benefit from vitamin K supplementation. Unfortunately, no measures were available for knee osteoarthritis, and it is well established that hand and knee osteoarthritis represent different phenotypes. Additional [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) that specifically examine the effect of vitamin K supplementation on osteoarthritis development are needed, especially in those with inadequate vitamin K status. A US national survey, NHANES 2011-2012, found that average dietary intakes of vitamin K (all forms) vary greatly among individuals, with values ranging from 80 to 195 g/day of phylloquinone for men and 78 to 223 g/day of phylloquinone for women [(123)](#reference123). Mean intakes for both men and women were 117 g/day of phylloquinone; however, 57% of men and 37% of women did not meet the Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) level [(123)](#reference123). Phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is the major dietary form of vitamin K in most diets. Green leafy vegetables and some plant oils (soybean, canola, olive, and cottonseed) are major contributors of dietary vitamin K. Mixed dishes have also been found to significantly contribute to vitamin K intake in the US [(123)](#reference123). However, phylloquinone [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) from green vegetables is lower than from oil or [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Also, the phylloquinone content of green vegetables depends on their content in chlorophyll (green pigment), so that outer leaves have more phylloquinone than inner leaves. The efficiency of phylloquinone intestinal absorption varies among plant sources and is increased with the addition of a fat source to a meal. Finally, the hydrogenation of vegetable oils may decrease the absorption and biological effect of dietary phylloquinone (reviewed in [2](#reference2), [9](#reference9)). If you wish to check foods for their nutrient content, including phylloquinone, search [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). A number of phylloquinone-rich foods are listed in Table 2, with their content in phylloquinone expressed in microbial origins and thus commonly found in [fermented](../glossary#fermentation) foods, such as cheese, curds, and natto (fermented soybeans) [(124, 125)](#reference124). MK-4 is menaquinone that is not produced by [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria). MK-4 is formed from menadione (a synthetic form of vitamin K) found in animal feeds or is converted in a tissue-specific way from multiple dietary forms of vitamin K, including phylloquinone and various menaquinones [(4](#reference4), [126)](#reference126). Menaquinone-4 is found in dairy products, including milk, and in some meats [(125)](#reference125). Longer chain menaquinones are found in limited fermented food products. The Japanese fermented soybean-based, natto, is rich in MK-7 (998 g/100 g) and also contains MK-8 (84 g/100 g). Some cheeses contain MK-8 and MK-9 [(2](#reference2), [125)](#reference125). Additionally, animal livers Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/), have limited data on menaquinone content in foods. Thus, menaquinone contribution to total vitamin K intakes is difficult to estimate and likely to vary between populations with different food consumption practices [(2](#reference2), [125)](#reference125). Bacteria that normally colonize the large intestine ( [colon](../glossary#colon)) can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) menaquinones. It was initially thought that up to 50% of the human vitamin K requirement might be met by bacterial synthesis. However, all forms of vitamin K are absorbed in the small intestine via a mechanism requiring [bile](../glossary#bile) salts, while most of the menaquinone production takes place in the colon where bile salts are lacking. Current research suggests that the contribution of bacterial synthesis to vitamin K [status](../glossary#status) is much less than previously thought, although the exact contribution remains unclear [(16](#reference16), [127)](#reference127). In the US, both phylloquinone and menaquinones are available without a prescription in multivitamin, single-nutrient, or multiple-nutrient [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in varying doses; vitamin K content of multivitamins typically range from 20 to 120 g per tablet [(128)](#reference128). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not authorized any health claims for any forms of vitamin K. Although allergic reactions are possible, there is no known toxicity associated with high doses (dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement)) of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K [(47)](#reference47). The same is not true for synthetic menadione (vitamin K3) and its derivatives. Menadione can interfere with the function of [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione), one of the body's natural [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), resulting in [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Menadione given injection has induced liver toxicity, [jaundice](../glossary#jaundice), and [hemolytic anemia](../glossary#hemolytic-anemia) (due to the rupture of red blood cells) in infants; therefore, menadione is no longer used for treatment of vitamin K deficiency [(5)](#reference5). No tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) has been established for vitamin K [(47)](#reference47). Large doses of [vitamin A](vitamin-A) and [vitamin E](vitamin-E) have been found to [antagonize](../glossary#antagonist) vitamin K [(8)](#reference8). Excess vitamin A appears to interfere with vitamin K absorption, whereas vitamin E may inhibit vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity and interfere with the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) cascade [(129)](#reference129). One study in adults with normal coagulation status found that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 1,000 IU/day of vitamin E for 12 weeks decreased - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of prothrombin, a vitamin K-dependent [protein](../glossary#protein) [(130)](#reference130). Individuals taking [anticoagulatory](../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs like warfarin and those who are vitamin K deficient should not take vitamin E supplements without close medical supervision because of the increased risk of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) (excessive bleeding) [(131)](#reference131). The [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) effect of vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) (e.g., warfarin) may be compromised by very high dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin K intake. Moreover, daily phylloquinone supplements of up to 100 g are considered safe for patients taking warfarin, but therapeutic anticoagulant stability may be undermined by daily doses of MK-7 as low as 10 to 20 g [(132)](#reference132). It is generally recommended that individuals using warfarin try to consume the [AI](../glossary#AI) for vitamin K (90-120 g/day) and avoid large fluctuations in vitamin K intake that might interfere with the adjustment of their anticoagulant dose [(9, 10](#reference9), [133)](#reference133). The prescription and anti- [tuberculosis](../glossary#tuberculosis) drugs (e.g., rifampin and isoniazid) to pregnant or breast-feeding women may place the newborn at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of vitamin K deficiency [(134)](#reference134). The drug amiodarone, used in the management of certain cardiac [arrhythmias](../health-disease/arrhythmia) (irregular heartbeat), including [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation), can enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and thus increase the risk of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) [(135, 136)](#reference135). Further, the use of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering medications (like cholestyramine and colestipol), as well as orlistat, mineral oil, and the fat substitute, olestra, may interfere with fat absorption and affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K [(137)](#reference137). It is not clear whether the [AI](../glossary#AI) for vitamin K is enough to optimize the - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) in bone (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)). To consume the amount of vitamin K associated with a decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in the Framingham Heart Study (about 250 g/day) [(50)](#reference50), an individual would need to eat a little more than \u00bd cup of chopped broccoli or a large salad of mixed greens every day. Though the dietary intake of vitamin K required for optimal function of all vitamin K-dependent proteins is not yet known, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends taking a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) and eating at least one cup of dark-green leafy vegetables daily. Replacing dietary [saturated fats](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) like butter and cheese with [monounsaturated fats](../glossary#monounsaturated-fatty-acid) found in olive oil and canola oil will increase dietary vitamin K intake and may decrease the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). Because older adults are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis) and hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture), the above recommendation for a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) and at least one cup of dark green leafy vegetables daily is especially relevant.
