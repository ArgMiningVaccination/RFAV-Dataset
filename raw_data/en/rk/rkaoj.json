Keywords - atherosclerosis - complementary medicine - traditional Chinese medicine 1. Introduction Atherosclerosis is the most common type of arteriosclerosis. It is a disease of the arteries characterized by the deposition of fatty plaques on their inner walls, which hardens or narrows medium to large blood vessels, especially the aorta, coronary arteries, and cerebral arteries [ [1](#B1)]. Atherosclerosis-related diseases often lead to serious outcomes such as sudden cardiac death, unstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and intermittent claudication due to vessel obliteration or plaque rupture with subsequent thrombosis [ [1](#B1), [2](#B2)]. Epidemiological studies indicate that, because of the adoption of Western lifestyle, the prevalence of atherosclerosis is increasing all over the world and will likely reach epidemic proportions in the coming decades [ [2](#B2)]. The earliest visible lesion in the development of atherosclerosis is the fatty streak. It consists of aggregates of foam cells (i.e., lipoprotein-loaded macrophages) in the subendothelial space. Fatty streaks may also include T cells, aggregated platelets, and smooth muscle cells. A fatty streak is the precursor lesion of an atheroma that may become an atheromatous plaque [ [2](#B2)]. In response to plaque growth, the arterial wall can remodel itself by increasing its external diameter to accommodate the plaque without narrowing the lumen. Thrombosis is the last stage in the disease process that is responsible for clinically observable adverse events mentioned previously. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), especially herbal medicine, has been used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases for hundreds of years, as documented in the [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 2. Pathology and risk factors of atherosclerosis The pathology of atherosclerosis is a progressive process with increasing age that is related to some risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cigarette smoking [ [1](#B1)]. Atherosclerosis begins with damage to the endothelium, which results in endothelial vasodilator dysfunction. The endothelium subsequently cannot modulate tone, growth, hemostasis, and inflammation throughout the circulatory system. Injured endothelial cells (EC) produce cell surface adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and thereby cause monocytes and T-lymphocytes to adhere to the endothelium and migrate beneath it [ [1](#B1), [2](#B2)]. Circulating monocytes and T-lymphocytes provoke an inflammatory response. The tight junctions between EC loosen and increase the permeability to lipids, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Once the oxidation of LDL has crossed the damaged endothelium into the intima, monocytes differentiate into macrophages and begin to take up oxidized LDL [ [1](#B1)]. Macrophages bite and retain the lipid, and then become foam cells. The fatty streak consisting of lipid-containing foam cells in the arterial wall can evolve into atherosclerotic plaques or atheromas [ [1](#B1)]. In addition, T-lymphocytes secrete cytokines that induce vascular smooth muscle cells to migrate from the media to the intima and proliferate shortly thereafter [ [1](#B1)]. Over time, a growing lesion consisting of lipid and smooth muscle cells invade and narrow the lumen of the artery. Other extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagen, elastin, glycoprotein, and proteoglycans give tensile strength and viscoelasticity to the arterial wall. Increasing the synthesis of ECM components such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contributes significantly to ECM destruction, which renders the plaque more prone to rupture [ [1](#B1)]. Once a plaque ruptures, it can trigger an acute thrombosis or embolism by activating platelets. It may finally lead to myocardial infarction, stroke, and even death. [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 3. Conventional treatment of atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis treatment usually begins with lifestyle changes such as a low cholesterol diet, regular exercise, and quitting smoking. Depending on the severity of the disease, a person may be prescribed oral medication such as antiplatelets, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or beta-blockers. In patients with advanced disease, certain medical procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery may be necessary. [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 4. Status and purpose Conventional medical costs paid by patients or by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (Taipei, Taiwan) are expensive. The caregiver burden on the patients' families and government has increased yearly. In addition, conventional therapies for atherosclerosis-related diseases have some limitations such as statin-induced rhabdomyolysis or hepatitis, and antiplatelet agent-related gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer. Complementary and alternative therapy is another option for atherosclerosis medication. Traditional Chinese medicine is the primary complementary therapy used in the Chinese community. The aim of this paper is to explore complementary therapy with traditional Chinese medication for treating atherosclerosis-related diseases. [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 5. Atherosclerosis corresponds to blood stasis syndrome According to TCM theory, obstructed circulation of blood results in blood stasis syndrome (Xue Yu), which is an important pattern of slowing or retardation of the blood circulation. The main symptoms may include stabbing pain with a fixed position, tenderness, local purpura, lumps, dark-purple lips and finger nails, a blue-purple tongue, and a thready or hesitant pulse. Blood stasis syndrome in TCM corresponds to atherosclerosis in modern Western medicine. Both blood stasis syndrome and atherosclerosis are the predevelopment or initial stage of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, or stroke ( [Figure 1)](#F1). With early treatment by medication, the progression of cardiovascular or cerebral vascular disease will not worsen. [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 6. Atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular or cerebral vascular diseases [Table 1](#T1) shows atherosclerosis-related thrombosis, ischemia, infarction, stenosis, or occlusion of the arteries. Some Chinese herbs can promote blood circulation or remove blood stasis and may be useful for treating atherosclerosis-related diseases. | | |4140||Coronary heart disease| cerebral arteries|[Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 7. Chinese single herbs and atherosclerosis-related diseases 7.1. Effect of herbal extracts/compounds on the initiation of an atherosclerotic lesion Several strategies exist for the treatment of atherosclerosis and associated diseases such as risk factor modification, antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and antiplatelet accumulation. Hypercholesterolemia, a primary risk factor that leads to atherosclerosis, is associated with the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Hypercholesterolemia and endothelial injury lead to the infiltration of LDL particles into the subendothelial space. Lowering cholesterol can provide the initial blockade [ [2](#B2)]. The 10 traditional Chinese herbs commonly used in clinical practice that reportedly reduce the production of LDL and/or oxidative rice [ [13](#B13)]. Single compounds or crude extracts isolated from [3](#B3)], [14](#B14)], [9](#B9)], [15](#B15)], and red yeast rice [ [16](#B16)] restore epithelial function by regulating the endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide (eNOS/NO) pathway. in the absence of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) can stimulate EC activation and subsequent expression of adhesion molecules such as the vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) the intercellular adhesion These molecules recruit circulating macrophages and T-lymphocytes into the subintima; this action is mediated macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) [ [17](#B17)]. As [Table 2](#T2) shows, single compounds and/or herbal extracts from these 10 TCM herbs inhibit the expression of adhesion molecules (i.e., VCAM-1 and ICAM-1). Among them, [3](#B3)], [4](#B4)], [18](#B18)] can the of MCP-1. Furthermore, ox-LDL can stimulate macrophages and T-lymphocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1-beta (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in the vessel wall, which further activate EC and promote vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration [ [1](#B1)]. [3](#B3)], [19](#B19)], [8](#B8)], and [18](#B18)] suppress the expression of TNF-. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) can regulate the expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as MCP and cell adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) so as to affect the atherogenic process. Most of the 10 TCM herbs can block the NF-B pathway involved in the on the propagation of an atherosclerotic lesion Stimulated by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and TNF-, VSMCs propagate and migrate from the media to the intima and produce collagen, which forms the substance of the fibrous cap of the mature lesion [ [1](#B1), [20](#B20)]. Signaling interactions between CD40- and CD40L-expressing cells result in the formation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade collagens and the thin fibrous cap and lead to the formation of vulnerable plaques and rupture [ [20](#B20)]. Among the 10 TCM herbs, [3](#B3)] and [21](#B21)] reduce the expression of CD40 and the activity of MMP-2. In addition, [22](#B22)], [19](#B19), [23](#B23)] [25](#B25)], and red yeast rice [ effect on MMP-2 and/or MMP-9. [Table 3](#T3) summarizes the target activities of these herbal extracts or compounds in atherosclerosis. | || || TCM theory, [28](#B28), [29](#B29)]. Cryptotanshinone derived Salvianolic VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression TNF--treated human aortic EC, vivo apolipoprotein aorta and in vitro in smooth muscle cells [ [32](#B32), and NF-B activation [ [35](#B35)]. Tanshinine IIA also reduces the CD 40, MMP-2, MMP-9, and suppresses VSMC migration accumulation, and platelet aggregation [ [36](#B36)]. Hung et al. [ [37](#B37)] report that a low dose (0.015 mg/mL) of [37](#B37)]. [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 8. Acupuncture and atherosclerosis-related diseases In addition to herbal medicine, acupuncture has been used for a long time in the treatment of cardiovascular disease in Asia. Acupuncture is applied in the treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are risk factors leading to atherosclerosis. Kim et al. [ [50](#B50)] demonstrated that electroacupuncture on the [Figure 2)](#F2) point reduces hypertension by activating nitric oxide synthase signaling mechanisms [ [50](#B50)]. Tian et al. [ [51](#B51)] report that electroacupuncture on the [52](#B52)] showed that electroacupuncture on the [53](#B53)] showed that electroacupuncture of the [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 9. Mind-body exercise of tai chi and yogi [55](#B55)]. A study conducted in India shows that regular yogic practices can significantly reduce blood pressure, heart rate, body fat, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL.These reactions are beneficial for cardiac and hypertensive patients [ [56](#B56)]. [Advertisement](https://ehealthcaresolutions.com/contact-us/) 10. Meditation, mind, and atherosclerosis Certain mental disorders and stress are conducive to atherosclerosis. Kroenke et al. [ [57](#B57)] revealed that a negative mood is predictive of a greater progression of calcified atherosclerosis, compared to a positive mood. Everson-Rose et al. [ [58](#B58)] found that high levels of stress, hostility, and depressive symptoms are associated with a significantly increased risk of incident stroke or transient ischemic attacks in middle-aged and older adults. Stillman et al. [ [59](#B59)] and Wang et al. [ [60](#B60)] also noted that anxiety can potentially predict a worse outcome through worsening of vascular function in patients with coronary atherosclerotic disease. Meditation is an alternative medicine practice for mental and physical health. It has salutary effects on patients with anxiety [ [61](#B61), [62](#B62)], depression [ [61](#B61), [63](#B63)], and stress [ [64](#B64), [65](#B65)]. Some articles report that meditation can calm the emotions and produce beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, particularly with regard to vascular aspects [ [66](#B66)- [68](#B68)]. Walton et al. [ [68](#B68)] advocate meditation to reduce traditional and novel risk factors for cardiovascular diseases; for example, meditation (1) decreases blood pressure; (2) reduces the use of tobacco and alcohol; (3) lowers the cholesterol level and lipid oxidation; and (4) decreases psychosocial stress. The mechanism and neurobiological effects of mindfulness meditation involve (1) deactivation of the default mode network, which generates spontaneous thoughts, contributes to the maintenance of the autobiographical self, and is associated with anxiety and depression; (2) the anterior cingulate cortex, which underpins attention functions; (3) the anterior insula, which is associated with the perception of visceral sensation, the detection of the heartbeat and respiratory rate, and the affective response to pain; (4) the posterior cingulate cortex, which helps one to understand the context from which a stimulus emerges; (5) the temporoparietal junction, which assumes a central role in empathy and compassion; and (6) the amygdala, which is implicated in fear responses [ [69](#B69)]. 11. Further research There are few studies on formulas or single herbal drugs interaction in the treatment of atherosclerosis. In accordance with evidence-based medicine, well-designed and conducted clinical studies such as randomized control clinical trials will be necessary in the future. 12. Conclusions Atherosclerosis-related diseases are the primary causes of death. In addition to standard treatment, complementary therapy needs to be face up. Traditional Chinese medicine is a popular complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in East Asia and throughout the world. There is increasing scientific evidence demonstrating that TCM has potential for treating atherosclerosis and its associated conditions. Acupuncture, References - 1.
