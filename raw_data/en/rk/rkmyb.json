Energy Healing Working with your body and mind we can help accelerate the healing processes occurring in your life at this time. If you have had trauma, surgery, major life changes, heartbreak, or are ready to shift old patterns, energy healing can bring you a great deal of clarity, lightness, and peace. Energy Healing may also be very useful for releasing blocked emotions and breaking up old patterns of behaviour which can create change on an emotional, spiritual, and cellular level. If you have depression, anxiety, discontent, apathy, fear, jealousy, stagnation, chronic health issues, addiction, or just a sense of something missing, energy healing may be helpful, even after only one session. Energy healing is also useful to restore balance if you just feel off center, overwhelmed, or you wish to release anxiety. Jaclyn works with your body's innate wisdom to release blockages, realign your energy, and reconnect you to yourself. 90 minutes $125 25 Minutes $60 *BOOKING NOTE - Message us with a request 0r "}
