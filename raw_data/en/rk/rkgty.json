One of the aims of meditation is to find inner peace and stillness. Practising techniques to keep calm and centred may have many positive benefits on our health and wellbeing, such as improving concentration and reducing stress. Edward Bach Writes in \"Heal Thyself\": \"It will materially help to set apart a short time each day to think quietly of the beauty of peace and the benefits of calmness, and to realise that it is neither by worrying or hurrying that we accomplish most, but by calm, quiet thought and action we become more efficient in all that we undertake.\" Meditation classes are offered to small groups of adults lasting 45 to 60 mins including: - Visualisation Techniques To Help Focus The mind, - Guided Meditations To Music; - Opportunity To Share Insights; - Explanation Of The Subtle Body & Chakra System; - Q & A Session To Discuss Benefits & Types Of Meditation; Classes Are Held In Areas Close To Muswell Hill, Highgate, Hampstead & Golders Green.
