Question: We present a general structural carbon - nutrient balance hypothesis parallel to Bryant et al.'s defensive chem-istry hypothesis. Our hypothesis suggests that because herbspecies require a lower investment of carbon per unit length ofstem than do woody plants, herbs should be at a competitiveadvantage where the leaf area of plants in the ground layer islimited by light (or fixed carbon, C) rather than soil resources(R) such as nutrients or water. We test the derivative predic-tions that in temperate deciduous forests (1) herb cover andspecies richness increase as soil resources increase, and (2)woody ground-layer cover, density, and species richness in-crease as soil resources decrease.Location: To maximize generality, the eight temperate de- ciduous forest sites were dispersed along an 800 km band fromthe Coastal Plain of eastern North Carolina to the CentralBasin of middle Tennessee, USA.Methods: Soil nutrients and moisture, herb cover and woody stem densities were observed in six plots at each site, ran-domly located in high, medium, and low herb cover areas.Multiple regression, correlation, and Redundancy Analysisordination were used to test predictions.Results: Plants with herbaceous (low C:R) stems are gener- ally abundant where soil moisture and basic cations (Ca, Mg)are high (low C:R environments), and woody (high C:R) plantcover, basal area, stem density, and species richness are allgreatest on dry or nutrient-poor soils (high C:R environ-ments). Plots with intermediate soil resource availability andherb cover have the most species, and maximum herb speciesrichness occurs at higher soil resource levels than maximumwoody species richness.Conclusions: Our observations are consistent with our struc- carbon Kartesz (1999).

(1983) predicts carbon-based defenses to be moreprevalent in plants growing where nutrient supply is lowrelative to light. This prediction derives from two asser- tions: losses to herbivory are more difficult to replace onlow-nutrient sites, and carbon is abundant on such sitesrelative to other resources (Bryant et al. 1983; Coley et al.1985). We extend the carbon - nutrient balance hypoth-esis to plant growth form. This extension, which we callthe structural carbon - nutrient balance hypothesis, pre-dicts that in forest floor environments, as the abundanceof light relative to soil resources (R, including soil nutri-ents and water) increases (C:R ratio increases), the suc-cess of woody relative to herbaceous plant species shouldincrease. In contrast, herbs should be favoured where thesupply of fixed carbon (C) is low (owing to limited light)but soil resources are abundant (low C:R ratio). Herbaceous plants require less carbon per unit height than woody stems, but require cumulatively more soil nutrients per unit biomass because they must annuallyreplace losses of ephemeral tissues. On mesic, nutrient-rich sites, the low carbon investment per unit of stem andrapid extension of stem tissue allows herbs to grow tall quickly each spring, overtop woody plant seedlings, andpre-empt light resources. In contrast, on dry or infertilesites, the nutrient cost of annually discarding stems, or thedemand for continuous water supply to support stems byturgor through the growing season, precludes abundantherb growth with the consequence that herb cover issparse and light is more available to woody plants. So,forest floor plant communities dominated by herbaceousgrowth forms should be found in moist, nutrient-richforests with closed canopies where deep sh ade severely limits fixed carbon available to ground-layer plants(Fig. 1). Further, greater densities of high-carbon woodygrowth forms should be found either in canopy gapswhere light is relatively abundant (higher C), or where asoil resource (nutrient or moisture) is scarce (lower R).218 Graves, J.H. et al. In this study we evaluate the structural carbon - nutrient balance hypothesis in forest ground-layer veg-etation across soil resource gradients under closed forestcanopies within a wide range of temperate deciduousforests distributed across an 800 km east-west band in the southeastern United States. We test two predictions: (1) herb cover and species richness increase as soilresources increase; and, (2) woody ground-layer cover, basal area, density, and species richness increase as soilresources decrease. We limited the range of light condi-tions to closed forest, but any increase in light shouldfavour woody plants more than herbs by increasing theC:R supply ratio. Thus, we also predict that (3) if signifi-cant positive effects of gaps are detected, these effectsare more significant for woody plants than for herbs.Methods We quantified the relationship between soil resource availability and abundance of woody and herbaceousplants at eight temperate deciduous forest sites wherestrong gradients in ground-layer cover occurred under aclosed tree canopy (Apps. 1 and 2). Ground-layer cover ranged from less than 10% to near 100 % within eachsite. Each site was less than 500 m in linear extent,greater than 50 m from canopy openings, and free ofapparent within-site variation in land-use history andbarriers to animal movement. To increase the general-ity of the results, study sites were selected to differsubstantially in elevation, land forms, hydrology, par-ent material, and species composition, and were dis-tributed geographically across an 800 km east-westband from the Coastal Plain of North Carolina to theCentral Basin of Tennessee (Fig. 2; Apps. 1 and 2). Six 10-m 2 plots (3.16 m \u00d7 3.16 m) were sampled at each of the eight sites, for a total of 48. At each site,two plots were randomly located in areas where sum-mer ground-layer cover was high (> 75 %, measured asthe vertical projection of all vegetation < 1.4 m tall),two where cover was intermediate (25-75 %), and twowhere cover was low (< 25 %). The 10-m 2 plot is the principal observational unit, but species richness wasobserved at multiple scales using nested square quadrats(16 0.01 m 2, eight 0.1 m2, four 1 m2, the one 10-m2 plot, and one quadrat of 25 m2, obtained by extending the 10-m2 plot 0.92 m on all sides). Canopy openness (gap index) was measured in each plot with a spherical densiometer (Lemmon 1956).The gap index confirmed that canopy closure wasconsistently greater than 92 %. Several variables related to soil moisture availabil- ity were measured including soil field moisture (%), Fig. 1. Expected relative abundance of herbs and woody plants under combinations of low and high light and soil resources.Arrows indicate changes toward greater relative abundance ofwoody plants. Fig. 2.

Soil and vegetation sampling Soil samples were collected at least four days after rain for each of the four 1-m 2 quadrats. Soil cores 2.5 cm diameter were taken from the top 10 cm of mineralsoil in random locations in each of nine 33 \u00d7 33 cm square sectors within the square meter, and mixed toform one composite sample. The four samples for eachplot were weighed field moist, air dried, and driedagain at 40 \u00b0C to constant weight. Field moisture was calculated as field moist weight minus dry weightdivided by dry weight. Soil samples were analysed byBrookside Laboratories, Inc., New Knoxville, Ohio,for bulk density, particle size distribution (% sand, silt,and clay), cation exchange capacity, percent base satu-ration, pH (1:1 distilled water), percent organic matter(loss on ignition), and Mehlich-3 extractable SO 4, PO4, Ca, Mg, K, Na, B, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Al. Values usedfor data analysis are means of the four samples. Vegetation was sampled in summer (June - August) following a phenological gradient from lower Pied-mont and Coastal Plain sites to upper Piedmont, Cen-tral Basin of Tennessee, Cumberland Highlands, andfinally the North Carolina Blue Ridge Mountains. Ineach 1-m 2 quadrat, we estimated total and species percent cover (percent of horizontal ground surfacearea covered by the vertical projection of above-groundvegetation) for all herb species, herbs > 0.4 m tall, andwoody vegetation < 0.4 m tall. Woody plants tallerthan the herbs have survived competition with herbs toestablish in the understorey. To obtain stem densitiesand basal areas of woody stems established above theherbs, stem diameters were measured just above groundlevel for all living woody stems > 0.4 m tall and < 2.5cm DBH ( diameter at breast height; 1.4 m) in 25-m 2 quadrats. Species richness of herbs and of woody species < 0.4 m tall were determined for 0.01-, 0.1-, 1-, 10- and 25-m 2 quadrats. Species richness of woody vegetation 0.4 - 6.4 m tall was determined for 1-, 10-,and 25-m 2 quadrats.Data analysis To test the predictions we used Spearman rank corre- lation to identify significant monotonic relationships be-tween pairs of resource and vegetation variables, andused multiple linear regression to account for the simulta-neous effects of soil moisture and nutrients (Anon. 1990). Resource variables were log-transformed for use in regression models because plant abundance generallyvaries linearly with log-transformed values of resourcevariables (Palmer 1993). Moisture and available Ca(indices of soil resource supply), and gap index (anindex of carbon supply) were included in all models.Moisture and Ca were selected because these two vari-ables are not collinear and are both strongly correlatedwith herb cover. Calcium is a surrogate for severalnearly collinear basic cations and soil pH. Additionalenvironmental variables were added if significant to themodel with p < 0.10. Interactions and unimodal re- sponses (quadratic terms) are common in many biologi-cal settings (Austin et al. 1990), and were added whengraphs of the data and/or theoretical considerations sug-gested these could be important. We diagnosedcollinearity using the SAS regression procedure, re-moving one or more variables when any variance infla-tion factor exceeded 10, or when one of the principalcomponents in the collinearity diagnosis had two ormore variance proportions greater than 0.5 (Kleinbaumet al. 1988; Anon. 1990). When selecting among collinearvariables, we chose the variable having highest Spearmanrank correlations with other variables in the group. We tested our prediction that herb cover can be explained by soil resources by comparing regressionmodels with and without site (block) effects, predictingthat site effects do not add significantly to a model thatalready contains soil effects. To test the prediction that low supply of either mois- ture or basic cations will result in low herb cover, wetested whether both moisture and Ca have significantpositive effects in a regression model of herb cover.Further, because plant response to Ca should be sup-pressed by low water availability, and vice versa , we predicted the moisture \u00d7 Ca interaction to have a signifi- cant positive effect in the model. Species richness has been suggested to be a unimodal function of resource supply and plant production in her-baceous communities (Al-Mufti et al. 1977; Grime 1979;Willems et al. 1993), but this pattern is not widely re-ported for deciduous forest ground layers (Peet &Christensen 1988; Newell et al. 1999; Dupr\u00e9 et al. 2002).We predicted that herb cover is positively correlated withherb species richness, but checked for a negative effect of(herb cover) 2 in species richness models as an indication of the unimodal 'intermediate stress' response.220 Graves, J.H. et al. We used Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to order the 48 plots based on similarity in the structure of their herba- ceous and woody vegetation along axes that are linearcombinations of environmental variables (CANOCO version 3.12, ter Braak 1988); 15 vegetation variables were treated as 'species': Herb cover; Winter-deciduous herb cover; Herb cover < 0.4 m tall;Herb cover 0.4 - 0.8m tall; Number of herb species / 0.1 m 2; Number of herb species / 25 m2; Woody cover < 0.4 m tall; Canopy tree species cover < 0.4 m tall;Shrub-size woody basal area (> 0.4 m tall and < 2.5 cm DBH);Shrub-size stem density; Shrub-size canopy tree species stem density;Number of woody species / 0.1 m 2; Number of canopy tree species / 25 m2. These broad quantitative measures of vegetation struc-ture are better suited to the linear response model usedby RDA than to the unimodal response model in canoni-cal correspondence analysis. Axes were constrained by14non-collinear environment variables: soil Ca, P, K,Mn, S, clay, silt, bulk density, moisture, organic matter,litter depth, root mat index, and exposed rock; and gapindex.Results Abundant herbs Herb cover is high where soils are moist and nutrient rich (high cation availability; Table 1; Fig. 3), as pre-dicted by the structural carbon - nutrient balance hy-pothesis. These are deep, fine-textured soils found onlower slopes and floodplains with circumneutral pH,high cation exchange capacity, high organic matter, lowbulk density, no tough root mat, and usually thin litterlayers. Moisture, measured as field moisture percent, isa strong contributor to models of vegetation and, alongwith Ca, is strongly associated with herb cover and withRedundancy Analysis (RDA) axis 1 (eigenvalue 0.45,Fig. 3). Ca represents several collinear basic cations inour models. Soils with high available Ca also have highpH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), Mg, B, Zn, Mn,Cu, and low Al (respectively, r = 0.94, 0.94, 0.92, 0.92, 0.75, 0.72, 0.71, -0.78). Table 1.

Each remaining graph is the same analysis, where circle areas represent values of a vegetation variable in the plots. Variables (and values of smallest and larg est circles) are as follows: TREE SEEDLING COVER < 0.4 m tall (0 to 7.9 %); TREE STEM DENSITY of individuals over 0.4 m tall and less than 2.5 cm DBH (0 to 18000 / ha); TREE SPECIES RICHNESS (0 to 13 species / 10 m2); WOODY PLANT COVER less than 0.4 m tall (0 to 19 %); WOODY STEM DENSITY of individuals > 0.4 m tall and < 2.5 cm DBH(0 to 29 000 / ha); WOODY SPECIES RICHNESS (0 to 25 species / 10 m2); TALL HERB COVER 0.4 to 0.8 m in height (0 to 68 %); HERB COVER TOTAL (0 to 96 %);EVERGREEN HERB COVER (0 to 68 %); HERB SPECIES RICHNESS (1 to 36 species / 10 m 2).222 Graves, J.H. et al. Geographically and floristically distant plots with similar resource and light levels have similar plant growthforms, and plots from the same site are widely separatedin the ordination when resource levels are different (Fig. 3). As predicted, site effects do not add signifi-cantly to regre ssion models of herb cover that already include soil resources ( p > 0.05, App. 3). Herb cover is near 100 % only where both Ca and moisture availability are high, whereas low herb coveroccurs where soils are dry or low in Ca, and we see asignificant Ca \u00d7 moisture interaction in the multiple regression analysis (App. 3). Tough root layers nearthe soil surface (with high root mat index), like thoseunder ericaceous shrubs, are never associated withabundant herbs. Similarly, deep litter is strongly asso-ciated with low herb cover (Table 1, Fig. 3). However,three moist and high-nutrient plots have deep litter andabundant herbs, so litter depth alone cannot explainthis response. Herb species richness On all eight sites, herb species richness (at scales > 0.01 m 2) is greatest where resources and plant cover are intermediate (Fig. 3, 4). The unimodal relationshipbetween species richness and cover is modelled inmultiple regression as a strong positive effect of herbcover with a strong negative effect of (herb cover) 2 (App. 3). Unlike herb cover models, herb species richness models are improved by site effects ( r2 improved from 0.78 to 0.92), as would be predicted owing to inherentdifferences in the available species pool (P\u00e4rtel et al.1996; Peet et al. 2003; Zobel 1997). Sites differ inspecies richness, but also differ qualitatively in speciescomposition and in the relative abundance of herbgrowth forms (Graves 1995). For example, groundlayers with abundant herb cover are dominated vari-ously by graminoid, evergreen, tall annual, and robustperennial species at the Haywood Landing, Duke For-est, Taylor Hollow, and Frozen Head sites, respec-tively (App. 2). Woody plant response to soil resources Woody ground-layer cover, understorey basal area, stem density, and species richness are low on moist,Ca-rich plots where herbs are most abundant, and highacross a range of conditions where soils are dry, or wetand base-poor, and where the competing herb cover islower (Table 1; Figs. 3 and 4). Woody plants grow in avariety of conditions, so regression models predictingwoody plant cover have lower r 2-values than herb cover models (App. 3). Measured predictors account Fig. 4. Herb species richness in temperate deciduous forests at three scales in relation to ground layer cover. Study sitelocations are as in Fig. 2.- The influence of carbon - nutrient balance on herb and woody plant abundance - 223 for woody species richness much better ( r2 = 0.84). As predicted, high woody species richness occurs on drier,more nutrient-poor plots than those with highest herbspecies richness, especially on soils low in K and Mn, where herbs and the evergreen shrub Rhododendron maximum are not abundant. Irrespective of Ca, woody species richness is high where soil is dry (Table 1, Fig. 3, App. 3). Response to light Within the narrow range of canopy openness ob- served (1 to 7 %), the gap response of herbs is weakand non-significant (Fig. 3, App. 3). In RDA, thesecond axis represents, in part, a light gradient (associ-ated with the gap index, G), but the eigenvalue is low(0.05) and plots with high herb cover are widely scat-tered along this axis (Fig. 3). High herb cover canoccur in deep shade. At Bat Cave, a plot has 89 % herbcover and a gap index of 1 %, the lowest encounteredin the study. Woody plants are more responsive than herbs to small variations in light. Woody cover < 0.4 m tall ispositively associated with the gap index (App. 3),though owing to the narrow range of light observed,this effect is weak, and not evident in Spearman rankcorrelations (Table 1). Moreover, gap index does nothelp predict stem density, basal area, or diversity oflarger understorey woody plants that established yearsago in gaps that have long been filled. Woody cover is negatively associated with herb cover (Fig. 3). Herb cover is, in part, a surrogate forsoil resource effects, but it is also an index of thereduction by herbs of light available to small woodyplants. Cover of taller herbs (> 0.4 m) is negativelycorrelated with cover and species richness of woodyplants < 0 .4 m tall ( r ranges from -0.45 to -0.72, p < 0.001). Growth form diversity Some herbaceous and some woody plants are not distributed as predicted by the structural carbon -nutri ent balance hypothesis. For example, the ever- green pteridophytes Polystichum acrostichoides and Lycopodium digitatum account for moderately high herb cover (65 to 71%) on two plots in Duke Forestwhere soils are dry and low in Ca. Deciduous herbcover on these plots is under 15 %, consistent withother plots having similar resource availability. Ever-green herbs are nearly absent on high-resource plots(Table 1, Fig. 3). Woody species also vary in habitat preference. Canopy tree species respond to soil resources as pre-dicted by the structural carbon - nutrient balance hypo- thesis with highest stem densities, cover, and speciesrichness occurring on dry or infertile plots where theratio of light to soil resources is highest (Figs. 3, 4).However, certain woody species can occur in rela-tively high densities on resource-rich and/or very shadyplots with abundant herbs (Fig. 3). The forest shrubHydrangea arborescens with hollow stems is success- ful among robust herbs at those Taylor Hollow siteswhere soils are moderately high in moisture and basiccations. Discussion A trade-off between herbs and woody plants We have shown that in forest understories on moist, nutrient-rich soils (low C:R environments), herbs typi-cally form a continuous tall layer and woody plantstend to be scarce. In contrast, woody plants are gener-ally abundant in the understorey on dry or nutrient-poor soils (high C:R environments). There are at leasttwo mechanisms potentially responsible for this pat-tern, both of which derive from the structural carbon -nutrient balance hypothesis. First, where the C:R ratiois low, plants having stems with low C:R demand, suchas herbaceous species, should have faster verticalgrowth rates than plants with high C:R demand rates,such as tree seedlings. In low C:R environments whereabsolute soil resources are high, temperate forestunderstorey herbs can quickly form a nearly continu-ous canopy each spring that overtops tree seedlings.On these rich sites, light competition from herbs shouldreduce survivorship of the slower-growing, woody-plant seedlings, thereby suppressing shifting species seedling bank(Graves 1995; George & Bazzaz 1999a, b). Elsewherewe report experiments that tested the hypotheses thatcompetition with herbs limits tree seedling successwhere C:R supply rate is low, and that an increase inlight supply or a decrease in soil resource supply willincrease tree seedling survivorship (Graves, Peet &White unpubl.; Graves 1995). As a consequence of thisasymmetric competition for light, woody plant densityin the seedling and sapling layers of temperate forestson moist, fertile sites should be rela tively low com- pared to the denser understories on less fertile sites.The second, alternative mechanism is that where theC:R ratio of resource supply is low, levels of phenolicdefenses in tree seedlings are low (Shure & Wilson1993), and vulnerability to herbivory is high, as pre- dicted by the original Bryant et al. (1983) hypothesis.224 Graves, J.H. et al. Species richness Maximum woody species richness occurs at lower soil resource supply than maximum herb species rich-ness, presumably because populations of many woodyspecies cannot persist in competition with tall, denseherb layers. Experiments have shown that many treespecies have lower survival rates under herb cover (e.g.Graves 1995; George & Bazzaz 1999b). At larger scales,woody species diversity could remain high, providedherb cover is discontinuous. For example, tree speciesthat survive poorly within dense clones of ferns can bemaintained in the seedling pool of the forest outsidepatches of ferns (George & Bazzaz 1999b). Only rarely does the supply of soil resources suffi- ciently exceed the demand by canopy trees that herbcover can approach 100% in summer. As a conse-quence, species richness in deciduous forests is gener-ally seen to increase along nearly the entire length of theresource gradient (Peet & Christensen 1988; Grubb1987). The unimodal association between species rich-ness and ground layer cover we observe at all eightstudy sites indicates that this uncommon pattern can beexpected where soils are sufficiently moist and fertile tosupport summer herb cover above 50%. The pattern hasbeen observed in a few other forests where resourcegradients are long and include high resource sites (e.g.Newell et al. 1999; Dupr\u00e9 et al. 2002. Extending the carbon - nutrient balance hypothesis To have broad applicability, the structural carbon - nutrient balance hypothesis should account for responsesto resource environments not examined in this study ofclosed temperate deciduous forests. For example, herbsuperiority over woody plant competitors in closed for-ests on rich sites presents the conundrum of how thecanopy trees can successfully reproduce in these habi-tats. In canopy gaps on high-resource sites, the highlight (carbon) availability shifts the C:R ratio, providingan environment where woody plants can compete effec-tively with herbs. After gap closure, the establishedwoody stems allow the taller woody plants to retain theirvertical advantage over herbs. Plant allocation of carbonto wood in canopy gaps (Canham 1985; Pickett & Platt 1992)parallels the leaf phenolics in gaps(Dustin & Cooper-Driver 1992; Shure & wood soils(Aerts 1995; Bryant et al. 1983; Coley al.1985; Chapin et al. 1993) parallels the allocation ofcarbon to phenolic compounds (Bryant et al. 1983;Dustin & Cooper-Driver 1992; Chapin et al. 1993) or toroots that increase drought tolerance (Latham 1992).Thus, woody-stemmed plants are adapted to a wide range of soil nutrient conditions (Chapin et al. 1996),but total as well as relative supply rates of carbon andsoil resources influence woody plant response (Davis etal. 1998; Fajer et al. 1992). Herbs dominate forest floors in low C:R environ- ments, but some woody plants survive with the herbs,and some herbs survive with the woody plants in highC:R environments. Trade-offs in carbon and nutrientallocation to roots, stems, leaves, carbon-based allelo-chemics, and cell respiration could account for within-site growth form differences between herbs and woodyplants (Grubb 1998; Rusch et al. 2003; Lindroth et al.1993). Shade-tolerant tree seedlings may survive in lowC:R environments by growing woody stems slowly andwaiting for a canopy opening to grow tall, growing rootsslowly and forfeiting drought tolerance, and allocatingmuch of the limited carbon to leaves (Latham 1992). Incontrast, some evergreen herbs (this study), shrubs(Chapin et al. 1996), and trees (Catovsky & Bazzaz2000) are associated with higher C:R environments(nutrient-poor soils) than deciduous forms. Trade-offsamong plant compartments help explain the coexistenceof herbs and small woody plants. Thus, because ofpossible trade-offs, a general carbon - nutrient balancehypothesis must focus on whole plants. Where patterns of allocation to stems appear to be inconsistent with the structural carbon - nutrient balance hypothesis, we pre-dict that total carbon and nutrient budgets will reflect theC:R environment.
