SERVICE SPOTLIGHT IV Infusion Center Intravenous (IV) therapy is a safe and powerful way to introduce high doses of nutrients into the body. Unlike supplements that are taken by mouth, IVs introduce nutrients directly into the bloodstream, which increases the absorption of these nutrients into the body. IV therapy is a great option for both acute and chronic illnesses. It provides healing support for a wide variety of health problems - from fatigue and stress to more complex, chronic illnesses such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. KIND WORDS "}
