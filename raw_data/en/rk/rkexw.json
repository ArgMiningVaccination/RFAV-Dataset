Alchemists called it \"the fifth element\"- besides water, earth, air and fire- because its qualities were comparable only to ether, the actual fifth element. Why are we so drawn to the ocean? Because our subconscious mind instinctively wants to return to the specific vibrational state of the ocean from which we once emerged. This is where we can return to recharge our batteries and regenerate. It was only about 200 years ago, with theadvent of industrialization, that we initiated our disconnection from nature and her ways. Fortunately, we are witnessing a trend to return back to natural, holistic methods for living and caring for our body, including a shift back to utilizing natural salts in this process. People everywhere are reconsidering the healing effects of natural crystal salt. We can find it in skin care lotions and for use as bath salts, and it is even used in inhalation or cleansing treatments for illnesses of the respiratory system and for a variety of other indications. The Neutralizing Effect of Salt The healing properties of salt are also known in allopathic medicine. The largest and oldest salt works in Europe occupies the royal salt mine of Wieliczka, Poland, just 7.5 miles off Krakhow. Here, a hospital was carved out of the expansive salt mountain, 740 feet below the surface, specifically for asthmatics and patients with lung disease and allergies. Several thousand patients have been successfully treated in this hospital. The healing rate is astonishingly over 90%. Recognition of the healing effects of salt chambers has influenced the construction of a similar underground spa located in the salt mine of Berchtesgaden in Germany. The therapeutic benefits of long term residency inside the healing salt chambers are allopathically acknowledged. The healing effects were originally thought to be related to the purity of the air within the mine's chambers. But if it was only a question of the purity of the air, why was the air in the cave so healthy, and the air above the surface so unhealthy? One cause has been determined. Our houses are charged with electromagnetic devices, such as TVs, stereos, computers, microwave ovens and the basic electric currents running through our walls. And, when not at home, we hold cell phones to our ears while driving in our cars and walking through our daily lives. This electro-smog causes an excess of positively charged ions that disturb the balance between the positively and negatively charged particles. Further, it creates an excess of positively charged, chemically unbound particles in the air. Only thirty seconds on a cell phone are enough to open up our blood-brain-barrier, a natural barrier that protects our brain from toxins, for eight hours. A Swedish study showed that ninety percent of the women who used a copper-T I.U.D. as their birth control method, while simultaneously using cell phones, developed uterine cancer; the cause being that the T.I.U.D. acted as a transmitter and receiver of unnatural, dissonant vibrations. Salt Caves and Chambers- Natural Hospitals Salt has the natural ability to balance the positive charge. In olden times it was customary for farmers to cover newly constructed rooms with salt before they moved in, in an attempt to chase away evil spirits. The evil spirits of yesteryear are today's dissonant electromagnetic vibrations. But the neutralizing force of natural salt can balance the detrimental frequencies of electro-smog. This special characteristic of salt is utilized by the atomic industry where, in the abandoned salt chambers of Gorleben, they store spent atomic fuel cylinders. The salt can neutralize radioactive radiation. It is not just the purity of the air in the salt chambers that has such healing effects, but more so its resonant vibrations, that activate our self-healing and self-regulating powers. When our body is sick and lacking its natural frequency, salt can bring us back into our original, balanced state. Deep in the heart of the Earth, surrounded by millions of tons of salt, patients can encounter the influence of the enormous power of the salt's balancing frequency or vibration, thereby replenishing the body and balancing its energy deficit. In principle, all systems of illness can be therapeutically neutralized through salt. A remarkable study done on patients with liver disease has proven this phenomenon. After two and a half hours in the salt cave, their liver conditions improved drastically. Obviously, the liver patients could not be healed in such a brief period of time, because their illness had already manifested within the physical organ. Unless the healing salt chamber therapy was repeated on a daily basis, the patients would relapse to their original state of vibration twenty-four hours after leaving the salt chamber. On an energetic level, however, as long as the patients remained in the healing salt chamber they maintained a healthy state. An alternative to a lengthy stay in a salt chamber is the crystalline sole drinking therapy, as has been tried and proven hundreds of years ago. The Healing Power of Salt The healing effects of natural crystal salts are based on its specific frequency vibration that balances the body's energy deficit. The neutralizing forces of salt can cancel out or negate harmful electromagnetic vibrations in our environment. Allopathic medicine is also familiar with the healing effects of salt and implements it especially with respiratory ailments and skin diseases. We have this available "}
