A crucial part of a systematic review is to limit the inclusion criteria with regard to the study design. Subsequently, important issues of study designs are described such as explanatory and pragmatic study designs, the evaluation of adverse events, practical or ethical concerns that may arise with certain study designs, and the so-called hierarchy of evidence. Finally, the aim of the research project and the outline of this thesis are addressed. Aim of a systematic review Systematic reviews of health care interven tions aim to summarize evidence in a sys- tematic and transparent manner and by doing so to generate new knowledge that can help people make decisions relevant to health [1,2]. According to the Centre for Re- views and 'Dissemination's guidance for underta king reviews in heal th care, systematic reviews aim to identify, evaluate and summarise the findings of all relevant individual studies, thereby making the available eviden ce more accessible to decisionmakers [3]. According to the Medical Research Council, the evaluation of complex interventions such as change of behavior or prevention is also within the scope of systematic review of interventions [4]. Definition of a systematic review A meaningful definition of a systematic re view is given in the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews of in terventions [5], quote: A systematic review attempts to collate all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria in order to answer a specific research question. It uses explicit, sys- tematic methods that are selected with a vi ew to minimizing bias, thus providing more reliable findings from which conclusions can be drawn and decisions made. The key characteristics of a systematic review are: - a clearly stated set of objectives with pre-defined eligibility criteria for studies; - an explicit, reproducible methodology; - a systematic search that attempts to identify all studies that would meet the eligi- bility criteria; - an assessment of the validity of the findings of the included studies, for example through the assessment of risk of bias; and - a systematic presentation, and synthesis, of the characteristics and findings of the included studies. 10 Ideally, the pre-specified eligibility criteria and the planned method ological approaches are published in a protocol beforehand. Th e Cochrane Collaboration, for example, requires the publication of a protocol as an initial step in conduc ting a Cochrane sys- tematic review. Moher 2013 addressed the problem of duplicate systematic reviews [6]. PROSPERO an internationa l prospective register of systematic reviews [7] aims to avoid unplanned duplication by also providing information about other ongoing sys- tematic reviews. Waugh 2013 enumerated potential barriers that may contest the effectiveness of PROSPERO [8 ]. For instance, people might use the published infor- mation to speed up their own secret review of the same topic or may copy the ideas. Progress may be hampered if the authors who registered their plans lose interest while this refrains others from writing a review on the same topic. The Cochrane Collabora- tion requests registration of all of their systematic reviews and thereafter rejects in- quiries addressing the same topic. For exam ple, the Cochrane Skin Group (CSG) ac- cepted the title 'Balneophototherapy for chroni c plaque type psoriasis' in 2006 [9]. In 2013, the authors withdraw their application after being unable to develop a protocol and the Cochrane Sking Group posted an announcement wanting authors to form a new group [10]. During this 7-year time peri od other persons interested in preparing this review were prevented from doing so. In a systematic review, the applied sear ch strategy and the assessment of studies as well as the analysis of results have to match the procedures pr e-determined in the protocol. Authors should avoid deviations from the protocol or carefully explain the reasons. There may be some difficulties to separate systematic reviews from nonsystematic reviews. First, some use the expression 'n arrative review' to denote nonsystematic reviews. Popay 2006 explains ture of the term 'narrative' [11]. 'Nar- rative' means storytelling and 'narrative review' is used as a phrase by some to de- scribe more traditional literature reviews th at are neither systematic nor transparent. However, a 'narrative synthesis' is an integral part of a systematic review using words and text to summarize the findings/results. According to the Cochrane Handbook, analysis of included studies in a systematic review may be 'narrative' or quantitative and a 'narrative synthesis' may use subjecti ve rather than stat istical methods where meta-analysis may be either not feasible or not sensible [12]. Thus, 'narrative review' may be a misnomer and 'nonsystematic review' should be the preferred term. Second, both publication types 'narrative and nonsystematic review' may appear comprehensive at a first glance. However, they are profoundly different. In a nonsys- tematic review, an expert provides a broad overview of relevant information about a particular field [13]. In general, it lack s methodological information about how and where the included publications were search ed and how they were selected and it lacks the reasons why some studies were given more emphasis than others. An ap- praisal of the risk of bias and a quantitativ e summary of the literature is often absent [14]. The most distinctive char acteristics that are present in a systematic review and 11 that are not present in a nonsystematic re view may be a study protocol, an analysis plan, a literature search strategy, and a description of the selection of suitable studies in accordance with prospectively defined in clusion and exclusion criteria [15]. It is important to know whether a conclusion or recommendation concerning the benefit of a health care intervention is based on data summarized in a systematic or a nonsys- tematic review. The systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is regard- ed as the highest level of evidence available if confined to effects of interventions [16]. Some systematic reviews, called overviews of reviews (umbrella reviews), are designed to compile evidence from multiple system atic reviews without evaluating primary studies [17]. In a previous paper, we applied the following minimal inclusion criteria to distinguish systematic reviews from nonsys tematic reviews: The authors were required to report multiple literature sources incl uding at least MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library and had to report the search strategy including the search date [18]. Difficulties in separating systematic from nonsystema tic reviews may happen with experts in evi- dence-based medicine exemplified by an ev idence report in which the experts classi- fied 10 reviews as systematic although nine of those were in fact nonsystematic [19]. Developing a research question Preparing a systematic review of interventi ons begins with a health care question to clarify which intervention provides more be nefit and less harm to patients than an alternative. The starting point and fundament al component of a systematic review of health care interventions is a structured clin ical question that should include four es- sential constituents, that is, the type of part icipants (P), intervention (I), comparator (C), and outcome (O) commonly denoted as PICO [3,20]. These four items can be sup- plemented by timing (T) and setting (S), tw o other important features of a systematic review, to create the so-called PICOTS typo logy [21]. A further extension embraces the study design (SD) to complete all major item s of a search strategy (PICOTS-SD) [22]. PICOTS-SD also leads to a clear and comprehensive definition of the inclusion criteria relevant to a systematic review. Explanatory and pragmatic study designs A systematic review may evaluate benefit and harm of a health care intervention in the context of 'efficacy' and 'effectiveness' [23]. Both terms sound similar but may be easi- ly mixed up. Therefore, we adopt the terms 'explanatory study design' and 'pragmatic study design' in the present thesis instead [24]. Explanatory stud y designs address the question whether the intervention of interest can work in principle in the ideal study setting (RCT) and typically provides a conclu sion for an average patient only [25]. Con-12 ducting an RCT can mean the exclusion of female gender, persons beyond a certain age, patients not treated in primary care ho spitals, outpatient treatment, participants with co-morbidities, and an allocation to tr eatment groups by discretion of the medical doctor. In some situations RCTs are not feasible, for example, due to ethical concerns or strong patients' preferences and the results may not be applicable to everyday prac- tice [26]. Pragmatic study designs aim to sh ow that interventions will work under every day circumstances, for example, in a general practice [27]. As pragmatic study designs consider a variety of patients' characteristic s, the conclusions base d on the results may typically apply for certain subgroups of patients. The reporting of the range of applica- bility should always accompany the reporting of the estimated effect. Some authors criticized that many public commissioners provide predominantly funding for explana- tory study designs research [27]. To accomm odate the evaluation of various research questions concerning explanatory study de signs and pragmatic study designs, the in- clusion of more than one study design appear s to be necessary. If multiple study de- signs are included in a system atic review then they should be well selected and cus- tomized to provide answers to the questions of interest. Efficiency, also known as cost- effectiveness, addresses the question whether the intervention of interest is value for money and should be paid for. The costs are usually not the issue of systematic re- views but of health te chnology assessments. Adverse events Concerning medical interventions such as su rgery, drugs, or behavioural counselling, adverse events can be crucial for their legal approval or their restriction to particular indications. The detection of severe adverse events may give rise to their discontinua- tion and removal from the market. The co mprehensive detection of adverse events may need a long-term observation of a large number of participants and an experi- mental research design could become a costly and unsuccessful enterprise. Practical or ethical concerns A practical concern may arise when the low number of patients with a specific rare disease such as acquired severe aplastic anemia makes it difficult to conduct an RCT. An ethical con-cern may arise with the treatment of certain severe diseases such as random allocation to a new experimental treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer. Another ethical concern may arise if a short-time survival is expected to differ between test and control intervention. 13 Hierarchy of evidence There appears to be some variation in th e hierarchy among some authors and institu- tions issuing evidence-based guid elines or systematic reviews. All agree that RCTs have the highest level of evidence with respect to minimising risk of bias. The prospective nonrandomized controlled clinical trial (CCT) has an experimental design and its inter- nal validity should be regarded lower than a randomized trial but higher than an ob- servational study. Prospective cohort studies have a potential for a lower risk of bias than retrospective cohort studies because they have lower risk of measurement bias and confounding [28]. In cohort studies groups are defined by exposure whereas in case-control studies groups are defined by disease status. Both points are acknowl- edged in the hiearchy of evidence by some but not all authors. Case series and case reports are descriptions of one or more individual cases. Some authors combine these two designs in one category while others place case series in a higher level. The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), the National Institute of Health and Care Excel- lence (NICE), and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemina tion (CRD) [3,29,30] are some of major institutions that propose study design classification trees. A critical study characteristic is the concurrent versus the historical control group. Concurrent means that the participants in the test and in the control group are treated and followed with- in the same observation period. Historical means that the participants were treated and followed in a different observation period introducing potential bias that results, for example, from different study conditions due to medical progress. Another critical study characteristic is the allocation of part icipants to the test or control arm by ran- dom and concealed allocation versus by discre tion of the study investigator. Single-arm studies such as case series and case repo rts cannot provide information whether the test intervention works better than a co ntrol intervention. Another single-arm study design is called the within group comparison wh ich has also been referred to as before and after study in a previous CRD report. A considerable proportion of researchers appears dichotomized to either accept only the randomized design for sc ientific evidence on health care interventions or to also accept designs without randomization as sufficient [31]. A 'hierarchy of evidence' was established that clearly downgrades de signs other than randomized studies re- gardless of the type of outcome evaluated [16]. Some authors questioned this hierar- chy [32,33]. Advantages and disadvantages of various designs have been reported repeatedly and some authors support the integration of multiple study designs with respect to the outcome of interest [31]. Th e selection of study design is dependent on the research question such as the intended effect under ideal or under daily health care conditions, the adverse event, or the heal th-related quality of life or costs of (the implementation of) an intervention. The effe cts of drug therapy, medical device thera- py, or the treatment of life-threatening rare diseases may be best evaluated by differ- ent study designs. The limitations of exclu sively using data from RCTs to evaluate 14 whether an intervention might work have been discussed [26]. The number of study participants may be too low to detect certai n severe adverse events especially if the events are rare. Therefore, RCTs may not be appropriate to estimate the incidence of rare but important adverse events. Study designs that incorporate the data of a large number of participants of interest such as case control studies, case series, registry analyses, or cross-section or qualitative an alyses may complement the information on severe adverse events. Aim of the research project The aim of this thesis is to in vestigate the advantages and disadvantages of using vari- ous study designs to answer specific clinical research questions within systematic re- views and to develop and pilot test an algori thm to guide systematic reviewers in their decision to choose appropriate study designs. We will discuss the following re search questions in this thesis: 1. What is known in the published literature about the pros and cons of integration of multiple study types in systematic reviews? 2. What can be learnt from conducting systematic reviews about topics that may require the inclusion of multiple study de signs, assuming that more than one study design may be essential to gather sufficien t data for answering the objectives of the review. 3. What is the preferred content and format of a straightforward algorithm for inte- gration of various study designs in a syst ematic review, that incorporates major study characteristics as decision points an d that allows consideration of practical concerns? 4. Can the algorithm hold its promise as a useful guide for choo sing appropriate study designs by testing its feasib ility and applying it to ex isting systematic reviews? Outline of this thesis Chapter 2 includes the main method paper 'U sing multiple types of studies in system- atic reviews of health care interventions - a systematic review' that answers research question 1. It contains the search strategy for literature retrieval about the characteris- tics of various study designs and recommenda tions for integrating them in systematic reviews of health care interventions. The sp ecific abilities of individual study designs to answer particular research questions are presented. The data from studies are summa- rized that evaluated whether the effects reported in RCTs might have a direction or magnitude that vary in general fr om those in nonrandomized trials. 15 Chapter 3 to chapter 6 include papers of sy stematic reviews on various health care interventions that answer research question 2. All systematic reviews concern non- medicinal treatment. Two systematic revi ews address hematopoietic stem cell trans- plantation in two distinct rare and severe diseases with scarce comparative studies. One systematic review concentrates on pati ent-centered outcomes in a low-risk stage of a frequent malignant disease. Another syst ematic review on a surgical intervention relies on RCTs only, but faces the need to co mpensate data on adverse events by other study designs. Chapter 7 includes the method manuscript 'Development of an algorithm to pro- vide awareness in choosing study designs for inclusion in systematic reviews of health care interventions - a method study' that an swers research question 3. In this chapter, the construction of an algorithm is described as well as the reasoning for choosing specific decision points. It is also explaine d that the algorithm needs the consideration of practical or ethical concerns and the need to switch the design chosen at first sight to provide a sufficiently pragmatic and flexible tool that is fit for application in the real world. The manuscript also answers the rese arch question 4. The practical application of the algorithm is described and it is tested whether the potential usefulness of the algorithm can be confirmed in principle by applying it to the four systematic reviews of health care interventions reported in chapters 3 to 6. Chapter 8 accommodates the general disc ussion of this thesis. It contains the summary of the main findings, its strengths and limitations. It also contains the consid- eration of agreements and disagreements ex pressed in other studies or reviews. The concepts of evidence-based medicine and be st available evidence are crucial for inter- preting the findings. Therefore, a separate section was introduc ed to connect these concepts with the results of the thesis. Finally, conclusions a nd recommendations for decision makers and further research are drawn. 16 References 1. Liberati A, Altman DG, Tetzlaff J, Mulrow C, Gotz sche PC, Ioannidis JP et al.

PLoS One. 2013;8(12):e85035. 20 Abstract Background A systematic review may evaluate different aspects of a health care intervention. To accommodate the evaluation of various research questions, the inclu- sion of more than one study design may be necessary. One aim of this study is to find and describe articles on methodological issu es concerning the incorporation of multi- ple types of study designs in systematic revi ews on health care interventions. Another aim is to evaluate methods studies that have assessed whether reported effects differ by study types. Methods and findings We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Methodology Register on 31 March 2012 and identified 42 articles that reported on the integration of single or multiple study designs in system- atic reviews. We summarized the contents of the articles qualitatively and assessed theoretical and empirical evidence. We fou nd that many examples of reviews incorpo- rating multiple types of studies exist and that every study design can serve a specific purpose. The clinical questions of a system atic review determine the types of design that are necessary or sufficient to provide the best possible answers. In a second inde- pendent search, we identified 49 studies , 31 systematic reviews and 18 trials that compared the effect sizes between randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, which were statistically different in 35%, and not different in 53%. Twelve percent of studies reported both, different and non-different effect sizes. Conclusions Different study designs addressing the same question yielded varying results, with differences in about half of all examples. The risk of presenting uncertain results without knowing for sure the directio n and magnitude of the effect holds true for both nonrandomized and randomized controlled trials. The integration of multiple study designs in systematic reviews is require d if patients should be informed on the many facets of patient relevant issu es of health care interventions. 21 Introduction A considerable proportion of researcher s appears dichotomized to either require the randomized design for scientific evidence on health care interventions or to also accept designs without randomization as suffi cient [5]. A 'hierarc hy of evidence' was established that clearly downgrades designs other than randomized studies regardless of the type of outcome evaluated [6]. Some authors questioned this hierarchy [7,8]. Advantages and disadvantages of various designs have been reported repeatedly and some authors support the integration of multiple study designs with respect to the outcome of interest [5]. We did not find a report that systematically summarized methods papers about usefulness and complexit y of integrating various designs in one systematic review. Therefore, we wanted to collect experiences, recommendations, and evidence based on clinical study data reported by others to infer whether one design is superior to others or not and whether alternative or more practical designs could complement or even replace a seemingly favorable design. One aim of this study is to find and describe articles on methodol ogical issues concerning the incorporation of multiple types of study de signs in systematic reviews on health care interventions. Another aim is to evaluate methods studies th at have assessed whether reported effects differ by study types. Finally, we aimed to identify and su mmarize qualitative evidence sufficient enough to guide finding and integrating the right research design for answering various clinical questions within systematic reviews of health care interventions. A systematic review may evaluate different aspects of a health care intervention such efficacy, effectiveness, and adverse events [1]. To accommodate the evaluation of various research questions such as efficacy or effectiveness and outcomes such as survival or severe adverse events, the inclusion of more than one study design appears to be necessary. If multiple study designs are included in a systematic review they should be well selected and customized to answer to the questions of interest. Efficacy addresses the question whether the i ntervention of interest can work in the ideal study setting (randomized controlled trial) and typically provides a conclusion for an average patient only [2]. In some situations , RCTs are not feasible due to ethical co n- cerns or due to strong patients ' preferences and the results may not be applicable to everyday practice [3]. Some nonrandomized studies are designed to evaluate effe c- tiveness and may show that interventions will work under every day circumstances, for example in a general practice [4]. Ef fectiveness typically provides a conclusion for a subgroup of patients that can be applied to individual patients. Adverse events can be crucial for approval, the restriction of application to particular indications, or the di s- continuation of drugs or othe r interventions. The comprehensive detection of adverse events may need a long -term observation of a large number of participants and an experimental research design could become a costly and unsuccessful enterprise. It appears that many public commissione rs provide predominantly funding for efficacy research [4]. 22 Methods While preparing this systematic review, we endorsed the PRISMA statement, adhered to its principles and conformed to its checklist (Table S1; online at doi: 10.1371/jour- nal.pone.0085035). Inclusion criteria We included articles reporting on how to integrate different study designs in systemat- ic reviews of health care interventions. We did not include articles merely describing advantages and disadvantages of various designs. We also included articles reporting different results of a particular outcome that depend on the type of design such as in a comparison of a randomized vs. a nonrandomized controlled design. Since we concen- trated on the reporting of various study designs, we did not specify on the type of participants, intervention s, comparisons, outcomes. Search strategy We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Methodology Register on 31 March 2012. The search strategy is detailed in Table 1. Terms and syntax used for the search in PubMed were also used for the Cochrane Libarary. The MeSH term \"Rando mized Controlled Trials as Topic\"[MeSH] aims to specifically identify RCTs [9] while the MeSH term \"Epidemiologic Stud- ies\"[Mesh] comprises nonrandomized study designs [10]. We combined terms of the controlled vocabulary MeSH with text words. We searched PubMed and the Related citations function in PubMed tool to find some pertinent articles that appeared to represent the topic of the present revew. We adopted candidate text words reported by those articles in the title or the abstra ct to build a search strategy for nonrandom- ized or observational studies [11-13]. Study selection We imported the bibliographic data of the se arch results into an EndNote X4 database. Two reviewers assessed independently title and/or abstract whether randomized con- trolled trials and nonrandomized studies were addressed at the same time in any type of article. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Full texts were ordered if we agreed on potentially relevant references and if disagreements could not be resolved. The full text papers were assessed to see whether the methodology of how to inte- grate specific study designs in systematic reviews was addressed. We also marked studies that compared the results of randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized 23 studies on the same clinical topic to esti mate possible effect size differences between the two design categories.

We worked with 2 types of reviews, systematic reviews and other reviews. The systematic review catego ry included Cochrane systematic reviews, other systematic reviews not issued by Coch rane, and health tech nology assessments. The other review category included non-syst ematic reviews, editorials, comments, and letters. We based the rationale to include non-systematic type papers on the following reflections. We wanted to build a comprehe nsive review of available methods papers. We wanted to acknowledge experience-based thoughts and reasonings and we want- ed to include rationales and recommendation s with respect to integrate various de- signs in systematic reviews that have been developed by others. We did not expect a large number of systematic reviews and we apprehended a limited scope of topics if we would have confined the data collection to systematic reviews only. Nevertheless, we stratified the results presenta tion by the two review types. 24 We identified 16 separately reported clinical fields and we used one additional catego- ry for articles that combined two or more clinical fields. The 17 categories were: - Acupuncture: Intervention regarding acupuncture type of complementary and alternative medicine) - Cardiology: Interventional procedures to reopen coronary arteries as opposed to surgical interventions - Genetics: Genetic diseases and rare diseases - HRT: Hormone replacement therapy for women - Mental: Intervention to treat a me ntal disease such as depression - Nephrology: Intevention regarding renal disease - Nutrition: Influence of food on health - Orthopedics: Intervention re garding orthopedic disease - Palliation: Intervention rega palliative treatment - Pediatrics: Intervention regarding children - Pharma: Drugs to treat patients - Pregnancy: Intervention regarding pregnant women - Social: Complex social interventions - Surgery: Surgical intervention regarding various diseases - Tele: Intervention regarding telehealth issues - Transplant: Autologous or allogeneic transplantation of organs - Various: Two or more different clinical fields We created 8 distinct categories for classifying the type of study design: - RCT: Randomized controlled trial - NRCT: pros pective comparative trial with alloca- tion of patients by physician - Cohort study: Prospective or retrospectiv e observational study with a control group without allocation of patients by physician, start is intervention - CCS: Case-control study: retros pective study, start is events - Regist: Registry of data from patients wi th particular diseases or interventions - Admin: Administrative databases such as data from health care providers - Survey: Survey or audit as well as postmarketing analysis Cases: Single case or case series We identified a considerable number of different methodological topics relevant for the integration of various study designs in systematic reviews. As some of the topics were similar, we assigned these topics to 15 methodological categories. All major is- sues such as validity, applicability, and confounding were addressed in the papers. - Adherence: Patients may adhere to the prescription or may not take drugs or doses as wanted 25 - Adverse events: Patients may experience un wanted effects or events that are asso- ciated with the intervention - Applicability: Results may not be generalized to patients that have different charac- teristics than the study population - Case load: The number of patients with a particular disease or intervention admit- ted to a hospital or treated by a physician - Confounding: A known or unknown factor th at is associated with the intervention and influences the outcome - Exclusions: Certain patients are excluded from the recruitment such as elderly, pregnant women, children, pa tients with comorbidities - Heterogeneity: Patients within one trea tment group differ in baseline characteris- tics such as severity of disease - Long term: Follow up more than 12 months after the intervention - Participation: Eligible individuals who did not participate in trials - Pathophysiol: Pathophysiological issues such as bacterial cause or various genetic constitution - Preferences: Patients and physicians may have preferences about what treatment is best - Rare disease: Rare diseases may not be re presented in clinical trials and rare ad- verse events may not be detected by small studies - Specialisation: The level of education and experience of a physician may influence the outcome - Survival: Proportion of patients that sustai n a specific wanted status after a certain time period - Validity: To measure what should be measured; minimizing uncertainty and sys- tematic error; dealing with selection bias Results Search results We included 42 articles that report about th e integration of study designs in systemat- ic reviews (Figure 1) [5,7,8,14- 52]. In the first step of the study selection process, we retrieved 6994 records from electronic databases including 6141 citations from Pub- Med and 803 citations from the Cochrane Library. The Cochrane Library citations were made of 188 systematic reviews and 526 methods studies. After excluding 6555 rec- ords not relevant to the topic of interest or duplicates, we assessed the fulltexts of 439 different articles. After a first screening process, we excluded 355 articles and after a repeated screening of the remaining potent ially relevant fulltexts, we excluded anoth- er 42 articles. The reasons for ex clusion are shown in Figure 1. 26 Figure 1. Literature retrieval and study selection. Characteristics of included articles The characteristics of included articles are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. We identified 8 systematic reviews [14,17-20,33,34,38] and 34 non-systematic reviews including editorials, comments, or letters. The articles containing concepts relevant to our re- search question were published between 1995 and 2012. Most of the articles were published between 2005 and 2012: 73% (31 of 42 ) of all reviews, 62% (5 of 8) system- atic reviews and 76% (26 of 34) non-systemat ic reviews (Table 2). The systematic re- views covered 4 of 16 distinct clinical field categories with 5 of 8 reviews reporting on surgery and with 1 review reporting on ac upuncture, cardiology, and various clinical fields, respectively (Table 2). 27 Table 2.

Ref: reference. 30 The non-systematic reviews covered 15 of 16 categories with 12 reporting on various topics, 4 reporting on surgery, no report on acupuncture, and 1 to 2 reporting on each of the rest of clinical entities. Of the 15 methodological topics, which are relevant for the integration of various study designs in systematic reviews, 5 topics were frequently repo rted by more than 10 articles (Table 3). The rest were addressed by 1 article or up to 6 articles. Validity was reported by 30 reviews (systematic 3, non- systematic 27), applicab ility by 21 reviews (systematic 6, non-systematic 15), confounding by 21 reviews (systematic 2, non- systematic 19), adverse events by 18 review s (systematic 4, non-systematic 14), and long-term follow up by 15 reviews (systematic 4, non-systematic 11). Systematic reviews reported 13 categories leaving pathogenesis and rare diseases out. Non-systematic re- views reported 12 categories and did not refer to case load, specialisation, and survival. Key messages We qualitatively summarized the key message s of the 42 include d methods studies based on the extraction of major statements (Table S2). We identified a clear tendency in the message that nonrandomized studies should be conducted and integrated in systematic reviews to complement available RC Ts or replace lacking RCTs in 85% (36 of 42) of all reviews. We judged the differenc e between systematic reviews 75% (6 of 8) and non-systematic reviews 88% (30 of 34) as not considerable. Thus the majority of identified reviews supported the view that nonrandomized studies are important and should be an integral part of assessing heal th care interventions. Only a minority of reviews regarded RCTs as the sole means of finding reliable answers to clinical re- search questions. Most papers acknowledged the advantages and the disadvantages of RCTs and nonrandomized studies with regard to specific methodologic topics or specif- ic clinical outcomes. Some papers addres sed the problem that RCTs are not possible for assessing certain questions and that case reports may have a considerable impact on safety issues. Comparison of randomized vs. nonrandomized controlled design We identified 49 studies, 18 trials and 31systematic reviews that compared the effect measures found in randomized controlled trials with those in nonrandomized con- trolled trials (Table 4). Of these 49 studies, 39 reported about the same or similar in- tervention in both study designs and 10 studies that included different interventions in the analyses. In 35% (17 of 49) studies, ther e was a different direction or a statistically significant difference of the magnitude of effect between randomized and nonrandom- ized controlled trials. In 53% (26 of 49) stud ies, the effect did not differ considerably between those two designs. In 12% (6 of 49) studies, both results, a difference as well as no difference were reported. 31 Table 4.

CASS: Coronary artery surgery st udy; identified and summarized qualitative evid ence sufficient enough to guide finding and integrating the right research design for answering various clinical questions with- in the conduct of systematic review s of health care interventions. It is obvious that intended effects of inte rventions such as th e physician-reported outcomes of prevention of death and healin g or improving of disease in ideal settings with financially affordable follow up and with ample number of available participants are best investigated in well planned RCTs. There is no equal or better alternative study design. The results may or may not be applicable to the general population. Many people with particular characteristics such as younger or older age, gender, pregnancy, or comorbidity may have been excluded and may have experienced oppos- ing effects or an unfavorable and unwanted balance of benefit and harm. Pediatricians may seek information on drugs from observat ional studies if data on the treatment of children from RCTs are not available. Uninte nded, severe adverse events require long- term observation including postmarketing anal ysis, administrative databases, and case reports to identify harmful drugs that have to be withdrawn from the market. The types of different study design that need to be included in a systematic review depend on the nature of the clinical quest ions that the review addresses. Oxman and collaborators assessed the effects of randomisation and concealment of allocation on the results of healthcare studies and reported their results in three papers within the time period from 1998 to 2011 [53-55]. The authors concluded that \"the results of randomised and non-randomised studies - sometimes - differed\". In many cases the results did not differ. The authors argued \"that it is not generally pos-33 sible to predict the magnitude, or even the direction, of possible selection biases and consequent distortions of treatment effects from studies with non-random allocation or controlled trials with inadequate or unc lear allocation concealment\". We believe that trials with random allocation and ad equate allocation concealment may show contradictory results. We also believe that it is not possible to foresee the magnitude or the direction of bias in those adequately randomized trials with absolute certainty [56]. Nevertheless, the authors stated that \"randomized controlled trials are a safe- guard against biased estimates of treatmen t effects\". Various design prerequisites and adjustment procedures in nonrandomized controlled trials can minimize bias and con- founding, however, it is not kown for certain in a particular trial whether the results reflect the reality or whether they are dist orted. The same principle holds true for trials with adequate randomization and concealm ent of allocation. Even if the risk of a false estimate determined in a series of tria ls would be lower than in trials with inade- quate randomization and concealment of allocation the fact is that the result of the primary outcome measure in a single specific trial cannot be regarded as an absolute and certain proof regardless of the p-values or confidence intervals. Ioannidis 2005 concluded that, quote: \"Controversies are most common with highly cited nonrandom- ized studies, but even the most highly ci ted randomized trials ma y be challenged and refuted over time, especially small ones\" [57]. The authors found that 5 of 6 highly cited nonrandomized studies had been contradicted or had found stronger effects versus 9 of 39 randomized controlled trials (P = 0.008). Our assessment adds to the existing work done by Oxman group and the Ioannidis group that the effect did not differ considerably between the randomized and the nonrandomized designs in more than half of the studies. The general postulate or dogma of the RCT as a safeguard against biased estimates of treatment effects may create deceptive promises and may give researchers a false sense of security. We infer from our findings just the same as Shrier 2007 has expressed before, quote: \"(...) that excluding observational studies in systematic reviews a priori is inappropriate and internally inconsistent with an evi- dence-based approach\" [45]. According focuses particu- larly on systematic reviews of RCTs and co nsiders inclusion of nonrandomized studies mainly if RCTs are lacking. We see a vast num ber of clinical research questions that are not investigated by RCTs. There may be many reasons, for example, patients' and phy- sicians' preferences that prev ent the accumulation of true randomized study data. Our results suggest that the Coch rane Collaboration might be advised to consider more reasons for including nonrandomized studies on the condition of a rigorous risk of bias assessment and confinement to specific interventions and outcomes. In general, a high risk of bias is inherent in all nonrandomized studies. Certain study characteristics such as prospective design, concurrent control group, adjustment of results with respect to different baselin e values, and confounder control can limit additional bias. For example, Ioannidis 2001 [58] reported that discrepancies between 34 RCT and nonrandomized studies were less common when only nonrandomized studies with a prospective design were considered. The Cochrane Collaboration offers a guide for inclusion of nonrandomized studies [59] and it has developed a tool for assessing the risk of bias in both RCT and controlled nonrandomized studies [60]. Conclusions Different study designs addressing the same question yielded varying results, with differences in about half of all examples. The risk of presenting uncertain results with- out knowing for sure the direction and magnitude of the effect holds true for both nonrandomized and randomized controlled trials, though, the risk of bias and con- founding is probably higher in the nonrandomized ones. The integration of multiple study designs in systematic reviews is require d if patients should be informed on the many facets of patient relevant issu es of health care interventions. 35 References 1.

Autologo us hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following high dose chemotherapy for no n-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. Cochrane Database of Systemat ic Reviews. 2013;8:CD008216. 42 Abstract Background Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a highly heterogeneous group of rare malignant solid tumors. Non-rhabdomyosar coma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) com- prise all STS except rhabdomyosarcoma. In patients with advanced local or metastatic disease, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) applied after high- dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is a planned rescue therapy for HDCT-related severe he- matologic toxicity. The rationale for this update is to determine whether any random- ized controlled trials (RCTs) have been co nducted clarify whether HDCT fol- lowed by autologous HSCT has a survival advantage. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of HDCT followed by autologous HSCT for all stages of non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) in children and adults. Search methds For this update we modified the search strategy to improve the precision and reduce the number of irrelevant hits. All studies included in the original review were considered for re-evaluation in the update. We searched the electronic databases CENTRAL (2012, Issue 11) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE (05 December 2012) from their inception u sing the newly developed search strategy. Online trials registers and reference lists of systematic reviews were searched. Selection criteria Terms representing STS and autologous HSCT were required in the title or abstract. In studies with aggregated data, participants with NRSTS and au- tologous HSCT had to constitute at least 80% of the data. Single-arm studies were included in addition to studies with a control arm because the number of comparative studies was expected to be very low. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted study data. Some studies identified in the original review were re-examined and found not to meet the inclusion criteria and were exclude d in this update. For studies with no com- parator group, we synthesized the results for studies reporting aggregate data and conducted a pooled analysis of individual participant data usin g the Kaplan-Meyer method. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and treatment-related mor- tality (TRM). Main results The selection process was carried out from the start of the search dates for the update. We included 57 studies, from 260 full text articles screened, reporting on 275 participants that were allocated to HDCT followed by autologous HSCT. All studies were not comparable due to various subtypes. We identified a single comparative study, an RCT comparing HDCT followed by autologous HSCT versus standard chemotherapy (SDCT). The overall survival (OS) at three years was 32.7% versus 49.4% with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 2.29, P value 0.44) and thus not significantly different between the treatment groups. In a subgroup of patients that had a complete response before treatment, OS was higher in both treatment groups and OS at three years was 42.8% versus 83.9% with a 43 HR of 2.92 (95% CI 1.1 to 7.6, P value 0.02 8) and thus was statistically significantly better in the SDCT group. We did not identify any other comparative studies. We in- cluded six single-arm studies reporting aggregat e data of cases; three reported the OS at two years as 20%, 48%, and 51.4%. One other study reported the OS at three years as 40% and one further study reported a median OS of 13 months (range 3 to 19 months). In two of the single-arm studie s with aggregate data , subgroup analysis showed a better OS in patients with versus without a complete response before treatment. In a survival analysis of pooled individual data of 80 participants, OS at two years was estimated as 50.6% (95% CI 38.7 to 62.5) and at three years as 36.7% (95% C I 2 4 . 4 t o 4 9 . 0 ) . D a t a o n T R M , s e c o n d a r y n e o p l a s i a a n d s e v e r e t o x i c i t y g r a d e 3 t o 4 after transplantation were sparse. The one in cluded RCT had a low risk of bias and the remaining 56 studies had a high risk of bias. Authors' conclusions A single RCT with a low risk of bias shows that OS after HDCT followed by autologous HSCT is not statistica lly significantly different from standard- dose chemotherapy. Therefore, HDCT followed by autologous HSCT for patients with NRSTS may not improve the survival of patients and should only be used within con- trolled trials if ever considered. 44 Plain Language Summary High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation compared to standard-dose chemotherapy on overall survival in peop le with non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. We found one randomized controlle d trial (RCT) comparing both treatments and 48 studies with results from transplantation only. Background Non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas are a group of rare cancers. People with inoperable or metastatic disease have a poor prognosis. It was believed that higher doses of chemotherapy might improve patients' survival. However, high doses of chemotherapy stop the pro duction of blood cells in th e bone marrow and are not compatible with life. Stem cells collected fr om people before highdose chemotherapy can be transplanted back to the patient if the blood cell count gets too low. Due to a lack of research studies, it has not been proven that patients treated with this proce- dure live any longer than patients treated with standard chemotherapy. We wanted to determine whether using high-dose chemothera py followed by autologous hematopoiet- ic stem cell transplantation was better or worse than standard-dose chemotherapy. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 5 December 20 12. The single RCT that was identified com- pared 38 patients in the transplantation group versus 45 patients in the chemotherapy only group and was judged to have a low risk of bias (high methodological quality). The participants were 18 to 65 years old, had various types of non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas and were observed for a median follow-up time of 55 months. The rest of the studies reported results for a se ries of or individual transplanted patients only, with various ages, tumor types and follo w up times; they all had a high risk of bias. The treatment period among studies ra nged from 1994 to 2008. The single RCT and some of the other studies were funded by non-profit organizations. Three studies reported financial support by biopharmaceutical companies. Most studies did not give details of funding.

There was one case of treatmen t-related mortality in the transplantation group and none in the chemotherapy only group. Quality of evidence The overall quality of the data was based on a single RCT, which had a low risk of bias. The rest of the studies had a high risk of bias due to single-arm and retrospective study design and were not useful for comparing two treatments. Currently the research evidence indicates that patients with non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas should not be treated with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hemato- poietic stem cell transplantation. If this tr eatment is offered it should be done only within clinical controlled trials and after careful consideration. Background Description of the condition Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a highly he terogeneous group of rare malignant solid tumors of non-epithelial extraskeletal body tissue and are classified on a histogenetic basis [Enzinger 2001]. STS have a significant risk of distant metastasis in addition to the potential for locally destructive growth and recurrence. Non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) comprise all STS except rhabdomyosarco ma, which primarily affects children and young adul ts. In this review we invest igated NRSTS which are cat- egorized as malignant according to the Worl d Health Organization (WHO) 2002 classifi- cation [Fletcher 2002] as adopted by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Guidelines Working Group [ESMO 20 12]. This latter classification excludes the Ewing family of tumors (EFT). NRSTS usually originate de novo and rarely from benign tumors. In most cases the pathogenesis is unknown; however, some fact ors have been found to be associated with the development of NRSTS [Enzinger 20 01]. These include exposure to ionizing radiation, environmental carcinogenic substances, oncogenic viruses and immunologic factors. Genetic factors can also play a role since some inherited diseases such as neu- rofibromatosis type 1 are associated with a higher risk of NRSTS [Tsao 2000]. In Western countries about four new cases of NRSTS are estimated per 100,000 population every year [ESMO 2012], with rhabdomyosarcoma and the Ewing family of tumors excluded from this statistic. STS constitute about 1% of malignancies in adults and 7% in children [NCI 2009a]. Rhabdomyosarcoma represents about 50% of STS in 47 children [Gurney 1997; Miller 1995]. NRSTS are rare in both child ren and adults and the distribution of NRSTS differs significantly between children and adults (Table 1) according to [Spunt 2006]. Table 1. Frequency of subtypes of included NRSTS in patients of young versus advanced age Young age (< 20 years) Advanced age (>= 20 [Spunt 2006] Abbreviations. NRSTS: non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) ca ncer statistics re- view (1975 to 2007) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), in the US 10,520 new cases and 3920 deaths from STS were estimated for the year 2010 [NCI 2010a]. Separate data were not available for rhabdomyosarcoma and NRSTS. The distribution of STS increased with age according to SEER data from 2001 to 2005. Of all STS cases, 10.3% were in children and young adults less than 20 years of age [NCI 2008a]. The median age at diagnosis of STS, including tumors of the heart, was 57 years [NCI 2008b]. Staging Disease progression may be dichotomized into the two categories of limited and ex- tensive disease. Limited disease is typica lly a localized, small-sized, low-grade and operable and accessible tumor that has no regional lymph node involvement and no distant metastases. Extensive disease can a lso be denoted as advanced disease, de- fined as localized, large-sized and high-grade tumor that may not be completely re- moved by surgery, may be invasive and may have regional lymph node involvement or distant metastases. Both categories differ significantly in terms of prognosis and treatment. Where many patients with limited disease may be cured by surgery, exten- sive disease is associated with a poor outc ome and many patients receive chemother- apy as palliative therapy. The American Joint Committee on Canc er (AJCC) tumor-no demetastasis (TNM) staging system combines grad e, depth and size of the tumor as well as regional lymph node involvement and distant metastases and describes the extent of a cancer's spread from stage 0 to IV [AJCC 2002]. A re view reported the five-year overall survival (OS) estimates for stage I (low-grade, superf icial and deep), II (hig h-grade, superficial and deep), III (high-grade, large and deep) and IV (any metastasis to lymph nodes or 48 distant sites) as approximately 90%, 70%, 50% and 10% to 20%, was not [Clark 2005]. A multicenter study a total of 2185 participants with advanced STS revealed a median survival of 12 months [Van Glabbeke 1999]. In the same study, of the 1922 (26%) eligible participants who re- sponded to chemotherapy the five-year OS was 10%; in univariate analyses the re- sponse to chemotherapy was not predic ted by the same factors as was OS. Symptoms The location of the primary tumor can involve any area of the body. The distribution is 40% lower limb and girdle, 20% upper limb and girdle, 20% abdominal sites, and 10% head and neck [Clark 2005]. NRSTS can involve any type of tissue and typically affect muscles, tendons, adipose tissue, blood vessels and joints [Sondak 2001] and commonly present as a painless mass. The sy mptoms depend on the anatomical site of origin, the size of the mass and other aspe cts. Retroperitoneal sarcomas are most often asymptomatic, until the mass grows larg e enough to be clinically obvious or presses on vital organs and causes pain [Dileo 2005]. Patients who relapse or suffer progressiv e disease after therapy or metastasis are commonly called high-risk patients because these signs are associated with shorter survival time. Spontaneous recovery from NRSTS is unknown. Description of the intervention Standard therapy Surgery is the standard treatment for localized NRSTS [ESMO 2012] and can be cura- tive if distant dissemination is not pr esent [Kotilingam 2006]. Chemotherapy is a standard treatment for patients with dist ant metastasis [ESMO 2012] and is regarded mainly as a palliative treatment for high-risk patients who are characterized by inoper- able, locally advanced and 2012]. [Riedel 2012] provides an ov erview of current systemic therapies and discusses possible novel therapeutic agents and treatment strategies. High-dose chemotherapy [HDCT] followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT] Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is defined as the transplan- tation of stem cells that have been collected previously from bone marrow or periph- eral blood of the same person. High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) uses higher doses of chemotherapeutic agents than are usually applied in standarddose chemotherapy. HDCT may be tolerated by the patient or it may ablate the patient's bone marrow reserves and create an absolute requirem ent for stem cell rescue. Instead of HDCT, 49 highdose radiation therapy may be used to treat NRSTS patients. Autologous HSCT applied after HDCT or high-dose radiation is a planned rescue therapy for HDCT-related severe hematologic toxicity [Banna 2007]. Ideally, a mega-therapy regimen should be used consisting of several non-cross resistan t agents that have a steep dose-response curve little extramedullary toxicity [Ladenstein 1997]. HDCT and autologous HSCT treatment options; they are an exper- imental approach mainly used to treat high -risk people with an unfavorable prognosis [stage IV with distant metastases]. HDCT a nd autologous HSCT may be used in special cases after careful consideration, usually for patients who respond well to standard chemotherapy according to Response Evalau ation Criteria in Solid have been used in HDCT regimens. Independent of the disease status, HDCT and autologous HSCT are hazardous interventi ons that carry the risk of life-threatening organ failure. Adverse events Non-hematological adverse events, such as short-term and longterm organ toxicities, must be considered when using HDCT [Ladenstein 1997]. Hematological adverse events as a result of autologous HSCT are usually manageable but life-threatening consequences of pancytopenia. They generally affect all patients and include, for ex- ample, graft failure, severe infections and bleeding. Frequency Of a total of 20,017 autologous HSCTs that were registered in Europe in the year 2010, by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), 45 were indi- cated for STS [Passweg 2012]. How the intervention might work HDCT followed by autologous HSCT was adopted to treat highrisk patients because it was believed that escalating doses in chemot herapy might increase survival by captur- ing putatively remnant malignant cells and might overcome resistance to standarddose chemotherapy [Banna 2007]. High-dose ch toxicity and autologous HSCT is a planned rescue therapy for the HDCT-related demise of hematopoietic stem cells. 50 Why it is important to do this review In the last two decades, from 1986 to 2007, the lack of evidence and need to conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was stated by authors seeking to clarify the rele- vance of HDCT followed by autologous HSCT authors have warned against the use of HDCT followed by autologous HSCT, indicating the possibility of reposit ioning of malignant cells [Woods 1999]. Oth- ers have questioned the use of HDCT with reference to the potential existence of re- fractory cancer stem cells [Banna 2007; Bonnet 1997; Sanchez-Garcia 2007]. The ra- tionale for this review update is to review the latest available evidence and to clarify whether RCTs have been conducted and whether results of any study show evidence of a survival advantage. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous hematopoietic st em cell transplantation (HDCT) for all stages of non- rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcom as (NRSTS) in children and adults. Methods Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies Inclusion criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Since we expected to find few if any RCTs, non- RCTs were also included as follows. Prospective non-randomized controlled trials [de- noted quasi-RCTs in the first version], othe r non-RCTs as prospective and retro- spective cohort studies, case-control studie s, phase I and II prospective studies, case series and case reports. Results from RCTs and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) may provide data for estima- tion of effects on overall survival (OS) an d answer the question: does the intervention provide a significantly better survival than the control and does the quality of the stud- ies fit with the assumption that the intervention is better than the control? Data from non-comparative studies (phase I and II prospective studies, case series and case re- ports) were collected to estimate treatment-related mortality (TRM) within a cohort of 51 participants. Due to the lack of a control group these studies do not provide data for estimation of treatment effect. Exclusion criteria None Rationale for including non-RCTs Authors of studies on HDCT wi th autologous HSCT have stated that RCTs are both nec- essary and feasible. However, NRSTS is a rare disease and, according to the results of a previous literature search, currently there are no published RCTs available. In addition, CCTs or studies with any comparative data may be unlikely or rare. If they do exist they may be of low methodological quality. Based on the assumption that it is unlikely that the intervention has been or will be studied in RCTs in the near future, this systematic report of the findings and the limitations of all available published studies will be use- ful, for example for informing the design of appropriate RCTs and providing a summary of all of the evidence on the topic to date. Types of participants Inclusion criteria We have adopted the World Health Organiza tion (WHO) classification of soft tissue tumors to define the population of patients with NRSTS [Fletcher 2002]. We present the designation of tumors that were regard ed as (malignant) soft tissue sarcomas in the present review in Table 2. The clear delineation of soft tissue sarcomas to be in- cluded in the present report and the grounds for exclusion of some tumor types was hindered by the presence of more than 30 heterogenous tumor entities, the distinc- tion between categories of malignant tumors and categories of intermediate malig- nancies as described in the WHO classificat ion (Fletcher 2002), and a complicated his- tology and terminology. Studies were inclu ded as lon g as at le ast 80% of patients had NRSTS. Children as well as adults were investigated and age limi ts did not apply. Participants were includ- ed regardless of the severity of the disease a nd the clinical staging information, as long as they received autologous (from either a peripheral or bone marrow source, or both) HSCT. Exclusion criteria We present the terms for tumors that were not considered in the present review in Table 3. Whilst the WHO classification of NR STS includes the Ewing family of tumors, that is extraosseous tumor types, we excluded these types because they are primarily bone sarcomas. Because extraosseous types are rarely diagnosed and share common features, they were regarded as one entity with osseous types and were excluded. 52 Table 2. Included non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS) Clear cell myomelanocytic tumor Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue tumor Desmoplastic small round cell tumor of malignant tumors according to the World Heal th Organization Classification of Tumours: Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of Soft Tissue and Bone [Fletcher 2002] 53 Table 3. Excluded tumor types sarcoma sarcoma; extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma; peripheral tumor, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), stem cells from a peripheral source or the bone marr ow, serving as a rescue therapy usually ap- plied after high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT). Comparison: standard-dose chemotherapy, which is defined as chemotherapy at a lower dose than HDCT without the need for stem cell rescue. Types of outcome measures Primary outcomes - Overall survival (OS): the event was death by any cause, from diagnosis or start of HDCT and autologous HSCT. - Treatment-related mortality (TRM): incide nce of deaths that were classified as treatment related or the participants died of treatment complications. Secondary outcomes - Disease-free survival (DFS): time free of d isease after diagnosis or start of HDCT and autologous HSCT. We provided the de finitions reported in the studies. - Progression-free survival (PFS): time stayin g free of disease progression after diag- nosis or start of HDCT and autologous HSCT . We provided the definitions reported in the studies. - Event-free survival (EFS): time staying free of any of a particular group of defined events after diagnosis or start of HDCT a nd autologous HSCT. We provided the def- initions reported in the studies. - Non-hematological toxicity grade 3 to 4: adverse events classified according to the common toxicity criteria [NCI 2009b] within 90 days of start of HDCT and autolo- gous HSCT; grades 3 and 4 of toxicity we re extracted for non-hematological (nau- sea, mucositis, kidney, liver, nervous system, heart, other) toxicities. - Secondary neoplasia: as classified by the study authors. - Health-related quality of life measured by validated questionnaires. Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches We conducted an electronic database sear ch of MEDLINE (Ovid), including articles published between 1946 and 5 December 2012, by using the search strategy shown in Appendix 1. We searched EMBASE (Ovid), including articles published between 1980 and 5 December 2012, by using the search st rategy shown in Appendix 2. We searched The Cochrane Library, including articles pub lished from inception to 5 December 2012, by using the search strategy shown in Appendix 3. The orig inal strategies which were 55 run on 5 February 2010 and are shown in Appendix 4 for MEDLINE (Ovid), in Appendix 5 for EMBASE (Ovid), and in Appendix 6 for The Cochrane Library. For this update we considered all studies that were included in the original review and re-evaluated them. We searched for ongoing trials by scanning the online registries ClinicalTrials.gov [Clini- calTrials.gov 2012] and Trials Reg- istry Platform [ICTRP 2012] on 5 December 2012 for additional completed or ongoing studies using the search strategy \"sarcoma AND chemotherapy AND transplantation\". For the update of the present review we se arched abstracts of annual meetings of the following societies via EMBASE (Ovid): Americ an Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Society of Hematology (ASH), Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Tandem Meeting of the American Society for Bloo d and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), and European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). The search strategies used have been developed and executed by the author team. Searching other resources We located information about trials not regist ered in electronic databases by searching the reference lists of relevant articles and review articles such as [Banna 2007, Ek 2006, Pedrazzoli 2006, and Verma 2008a]. For the update, we did not identify more recent reviews. We contacted author s to replenish m issing information. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies We endorsed the PRISMA statement, adhered to its principles and conformed to its checklist [Moher 2009]. We re-ran the whol e selection process including all records retrieved from the inception of each database . We retrieved all titles and abstracts by electronic searching and downloaded them to the reference management database EndNote Version X3 [Thomson Reuters Co rp 2012]. We removed duplicates and two review authors examined the remaining references independently. We excluded those studies that clearly did not meet the inclusio n criteria and we obtained copies of the full texts of potentially relevant referenc es. Two authors assessed the eligibility of retrieved papers independently. We resolved disagreement by discussion and it was not necessary to consult a third review auth or. We considered studies written in lan- guages other than English and asked peers familiar with the particular language and with the principles of study evaluation to translate major methodological issues. We also used the [Google Translate 2012] prog ram. We documented reasons for the ex- clusion of studies. 56 Data extraction and management We re-extracted the data from all selected studies identified from the inception of each database. Two review authors independently abstracted data on study character- istics, patients and interventions, duration of follow up, outcomes, and deviations from the protocol. In addition, two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias. We resolved differences between review auth ors by discussion or by appeal to a third review author. All included studies were full-text publications. We extracted the following data. - General information on author, title, source, publication date. - Study characteristics: trial design, setting , inclusion and exclusion criteria, compa- rability of patients' characteristics between groups, treatment allocation, blinding, subgroup analysis, length of follow-up. - Participant characteristics: age; gend er; di agnoses; participants lost to follow-up. - Interventions: type of high-dose chemothe rapy, source of stem cells, and type of standard-dose chemotherapy. - Outcomes: overall survival, treatment-rela ted mortality, disease-free survival, pro- gression-free survival, event-free survival in cluding type of event, toxicity, second- ary neoplasia, healthre lated quality of life. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using six criteria. We have used four criteria of The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias [Higgins 2011a]: 1. random sequence generation (selection bias); 2. allocation concealment (selection bias); 3. blinding of outcome a ssessment (detection bias); 4. selective reporting such as not reportin g pre-specified outcomes (reporting bias). We extended the tool for assessing risk of bias with five additional criteria that are specific for the inclusion crit eria for the present review and that are critical for confi- dence in the results: 1. prospective design; 2. comparable baseline characteristics; 3. assignment of patients to treatment groups; 4. concurrent control; 5. loss to follow-up. We applied The Cochrane Collaboration's crit eria for judging of bias [Higgins In general, a 'low risk' of bias is judg ed if the bias is unlikely to seriously alter 57 the results, for example, participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment. A 'high risk' of bias is judged if the bias seriously weakens confi- dence in the results, for example, participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments. 'Unclear r isk' of bias is judged if the bias raises some doubt about the results, for exampl e, the method of concealment is not de- scribed or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement. We judged studies as prospective if an explicit statement was reported or there were clues suggesting a prospective design (f or example prior approval of treatment, informed consent). We judged studies as retrospective if an explicit statement was reported or was implied by a description th a t d a t a w e r e r e v i e w e d f r o m a n e x i s t i n g source. We regarded each of the following items as an indication of a retrospective design: registry reports and re viewing of medical records. Measures of treatment effect The primary effect measure was the hazard ratio (HR) for timeto-event data. If the HR was not directly given in the publication, we planned to estimate HRs according to methods proposed by [Parmar 1998] and [Tierney 2007]. We planned to calculate odds ratios (ORs ) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. In the case of rare events, we planned to use Peto odds ratio instead. We planned to analyze continuous data and to present them as mean differ- ences, if all results were me asured on the same scale (for example length of hospital stay). If this was not the case (for example pain or quality of life), we planned to use standardized mean differences. Studies repo rting aggregate data that combined the results of several participants (including results from se parately reported subpopula- tions that fulfilled the inclusion criteria) we re distinguished from studies with individu- al data of single participants. Data from these studies were described as narrative summaries. In some studies diagnoses of NRSTS were mixed with non-NRSTS solid tumors and rhabdomyosarcomas to such an extent that the proportion of NRSTS par- ticipants was less than 80% of the study popul ation. In this case, if data on single par- ticipants were identified that fulfilled the in clusion criteria of the present review we included the study and data for the indivi dual participant in our data analysis. Estimates of OS were considered for the evaluation if the use of the Kaplan-Meier method was reported in the study. We desc ribed survival estimates from studies re- porting aggregate data independent of the start of the follow-up period on the condi- tion that these estimates were not pooled with those of other studies. A survival analysis was conducted of indivi dual participant level data based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Pooling required binary information on OS [0 = alive; 1 = dead] and on follow-up. In the majority of cases, the starting point of follow-up was the be- ginning of treatment. However, we accepted other starting points such as the time 58 when the diagnosis or indication for treatmen t was established. Statistical analyses of time to event data were performed using SAS Version 9.2 [SAS Institute Corp 2012]. Unit of analysis issues None Dealing with missing data We conformed to The Cochrane Collaboration 's principal options for dealing with miss- ing data and analysed only the available data [Higgins 2011c]. If data were missing or only imputed data were reported we contacted trial authors to request data on the outcomes among participants who were assessed. We contacted the authors of the studies by [Bui-Nguyen 2012, Ivanova 2010, Jordan 2010, Philippe-Chomette 2012, Schlemmer 2006] to ask for missing data ab out the histologic ty pes that were com- bined as 'others'. The authors responded well and as a consequence we could base the inclusion or exclusion of patient data on the additional data. Assessment of heterogeneity We planned to assess heterogeneity between studies by visual inspection of forest plots; by estimation of the percentage heterogeneity between trials which cannot be ascribed to sampling variation (I2 statistic) [Higgins 2003]; by a formal statistical test of the significance of the heterogeneity (Cochran 's Q) [Deeks 2011]; and, if possible, by subgroup analyses [see 'Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity']. We planned to investigate and report possible reasons if there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity. We planned to use the random-effects model with inverse variance weighting for statistical pooling [DerSimonian 1986]. We did not pool estimates. Assessment of reporting biases We conformed to The Cochrane Collaboration's criteria and planned to evaluate re- porting biases such as publication bias, time lag bias, multiple (duplicate) publication bias, location bias, citation bias, language bias and outcome reporting bias [Sterne 2011]. We did not assess reporting bias because of the low number of identified stud- ies. Data synthesis One review author entered the data into [Review Manager 2011]. Another review author checked the entered data. Methods of synthesizing the studies depended on the quality, design and heterogene ity of the studi es identified. We planned to synthesize data on mortality (HDCT and autologous HSCT versus SDCT) by using the hazard ratio (HR) as effect measure in a random-effects model. 59 However, data were too scarce to be reasonably pooled. Aggregate data were synthe- sized as narrative. In contrast, individual data were pooled and available time-to-event data were analyzed in a Kapl an-Meier survival analysis. We used the software GRADEpro 3.2 [GRA DEpro 2008] to create the 'Summary of findings' table as suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of In- terventions [Schunemann 2011]. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We had planned subgroup analyses based on ag e, stage, and time period of treatment. However, we found no appropriate data to conduct these analyses. Sensitivity analysis We had planned sensitivity analyses to comp are the results of studies with low versus high risk of bias. As all included studies had a high risk of bias, no sensitivity analyses were carried out. Results Description of studies Clinical heterogeneity was su bstantial because tumor subdia gnosis varied considerable between patients. Furthermore, tumor stage was not reported for all participants. Study design was tenuously reported due to the identification of either aggregate data or individual patient data in one-arm studies. Overall, the likelihood of bias was very high except in the single randomized controll ed trial (RCT). All studies were not compa- rable due to various subtypes. Results of the search For this update we modified the search st rategy to improve th e precision a nd reduce the number of irrelevant hits. In the original review, we applied a search strategy that was designed to include all solid tumors in cluding the Ewing fam ily of tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma. This strategy resulted in the retrieval of a large number of docu- ments (4782) including a very high fraction of not relevant retrieved documents. We revised the search strategy and this retrie ved a considerably reduced number of re- trieved documents (1035) from the inception of each electronic databases. The new strategy did not identify some single-arm st udies with individual data that were in- cluded in the original review. Some individual cases are hidden in articles that do not mention soft tissue sarcomas and transplantation in the title or abstract. Some of those are missed by the new strategy. It is im possible to identify all published cases of 60 transplanted patients with NRSTS. Therefore, the number of identified relevant cases will vary with different strategies. The retrieval information confirmed that the number of studies with comparative data and aggregate data did not vary and the number of these types of identified studies was robu st. The new search strategy was more eco- nomical in terms of spending resources for study selection for the present review, and also for future updates. We did not ignore the results of the orig inal review and re- evaluated all studies that were identified by the old strategy and were included in the original review. We retrieved 1035 records applying the ne w search strategy. We also retrieved six ongoing studies. We imported 15 studies that were included in the original review but were not identified with the new search st rategy. We screened 773 different articles after removal of duplicates (Figure 1). The titles and abstracts of 513 articles did not fulfil the inclusion criteria or they reported about ongoing studies. A total of 260 of the retrieved articles were evaluated in detail using the full text. Of these, a total of 62 records reporting about 57 studies were included in the present review and the other 198 references were excluded. We identified one randomized controlled trial (RCT), six single-arm studies with aggregate data, and 50 single-arm studies with individual data. Eight studies were published after the original retrieval and were added to the included studies further studies were included in the original review but were not identified by the new search strategy [Fang at doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008216.pub4). These 15 studies were included in the update in addition to the results of the new search strategy. Three studies were included in the original review and identifi ed in the update but were excluded after re-evaluation [Ivanova 2010; Kaminski 2000; Kuehne 2000]. Three studies were excluded in the orig- inal review and identified in the update but re-evaluation [Blay 2000; Fetscher 1996; Mingo 2005]. Six furthe r studies were included in the original review and not identified in the update but were excluded after re-evaluation. Four studies reported about undifferentiated sarcoma, Nakamura 2008]. One study about rhabdoid tumor but without information about the localisation, which is required for identification of the extrarenal and the extracerebral rhabdo id tumors [Ronghe undifferentiated sarcoma tumor without information about the localisation [Shaw 1996]. We retrieved a total of 49 studies in ClinicalTrials.gov 2012 and found 14 potentially relevant studies. We identified six ongoing studies, whereof two studies are currently recruiting [NCT00638898; NCT01288573] and four studies are not recruiting participants [NCT00002601; NCT00002854; NCT00141765; NCT00623077]. We identified three complete d studies, one terminated study that was withdrawn due to slow accrual, and four studies with unknown status and information 61 that has not been verified recently. The investigators did not provide results via the registry and we did not found a publication in PubMed 2012 matching the data shown in the registry. Of the rest of the 35 studies, 15 studies did not include the diagnosis of interest, 15 studies did not include the interven tion of interest, and five did not include the outcome of interest. We did not identify other relevant studies searching in the two trials registries [ICTRP 2012] and [ISRCTN 2012]. We did not identify any additional studies from screening the reference list s of included studies and reviews. Figure 1. Literature search and study flow. 62 Included studies We identified 57 studies including a total of 275 participants that received HDCT and autologous HSCT. The characteristics of the individual 57 included studies are de- scribed in the section Characteristics of included studies (online at doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008216.pub4). We have provided a tabulated overview of the seminal characteristics of the included studies in Table 5. Table 5.

All patients received the same baselin e treatment. Patients were eligible for randomization if they had responded to chemotherapy or, for stable disease, if a com- plete surgical resection of all disease sites could be carried out. Randomization was carried out centrally. The intention-to-treat (ITT) modified population included all ran- domly assigned patients excluding patients fo und to be ineligible at central histology review. We included six single-arm studies that reported aggregate data of participants that received HDCT and autologous HSCT and that consisted studies comprised single-arm stud- ies without appropriate aggregate data. Relevant participants were considered in the survival analysis of pooled individual data. Sample sizes The authors of the RCT [Bui-Nguyen 2012] co nducted an ITT analysis of 38 participants in the HDCT arm versus 41 participants in the SDCT arm. Six single-arm studies report- ed aggregate data who received HDCT and autologous HS CT. Fifty studies reported on 123 individ- ual relevant participants. Overall survival and follow-up data were reported for 80 participants in 41 studies and subsequently those data could be considered in survival analysis of the pooled individual data. Setting The 57 studies were set in 12 different countries, eight countries in Europe (Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ne therlands, Spain, Unit ed Kingdom), two in North America (Canada, United States), and two in Asia (Korea, Japan). Most of the transplanted patients were studied in the USA (79 of 260) and France (79 of 260). In four countries (France, Germany, Italy, USA) 10 or more patients were studied. The only RCT [Bui-Nguyen 20 12] was set in France. Participants We included 275 patients with 15 different relevant histological diagnoses in 57 stud- ies. Most patients (N = 109) had desmoplastic small round-cell tumor; 10 or more pa- reported the age in the HD CT arm in a range of 18.5 to 65.0 years (median 45.8 years) and a comparable age in th e SDCT arm with a range of 18.7 to 65.0 years (median 43.3 years). Ma les were 58.5% of participants (24 of 41) in the HDCT arm and 50% (23 of 46) in the CDCT arm. [Bertuzzi 2003] reported a range of 15 to 60 years of age (median 29 years) for the 10 male patients that were included. [Bis ogno 2010] included 13 males and one female, the age range was 2 to 17.8 years (median 10.3 years). [Blay 2000] reported on 30 pa- tients of which 17 were males and 13 female s. The age ranged from 17 to 57 years (me- dian 34 years). [Bokemeyer 1997] reported the age range between 25 and 57 years with a median of 45 years. Gender was not specified. [Cook 2012] reported the age range between 8 and 46 years with a median of 19 years; 29 were males and 7 were females. [Philippe-Chomette 2012] reported an age rang e of 4 to 22.6 years for 14 transplanted patients in the HDCT arm; 12 of thos e patients were males and 2 females. Age was provided for 113 of 123 individual patients ranging from 1 to 65 years with a median of 27 years. Gender was provided for 83 individual patients, of which 55 were male and 28 were female. Follow-up was provided for 80 individual patients, ranging from 0 to 120 months with a median of 17 months. Interventions Components and the dosage of various chemotherapeutic regimens are described in the Characteristics of included studie s (shown in the unabridged article). In the study by [Bui-Nguyen 2012], 87 patients received courses one to five of standard-dose chemotherapy. Forty-one patients were randomized to receive HDCT and transplantation of autologous peripheral stem cells as course six in the HDCT arm. Of these, 38 patients were analyzed in a mo dified ITT analysis. Forty-six patients were randomized to again receive standard-dose chemotherapy as course six. Of these, 45 patients were analyzed in a modified ITT analysis. In the study by [Bertuzzi 2003], after a four-course induction phase 10 patients in complete or partial response received HDCT and autologous HSCT using peripheral blood as the stem cell source. In the study by [Bisogno 2010], after an induction phase of nine weeks 14 patients at various clinical stages received three consecutive intensified-dose combinations and autologous HSCT using peripheral blood as the stem cell source. In the study by [Blay 2000], after induction chemothera py for most of the patients 24 patients with an advanced clinical stage including 87% with metastasis received HDCT and autolo- gous HSCT. The stem cell so urce was mainly bo ne marrow (N = 25) and a few patients received stem cells from peri pheral blood (N = 5). In the study by [Bokemeyer 1997], 16 patients received HDCT and autologous HSCT from peripheral blood. In the study by [Cook 2012], 36 patients received HDCT and autologous HSCT mainly from peripheral blood (N = 33) and a few from bone marrow (N = 2), with information missing in one patient. In the study by [Philippe-Chomette 2012], 14 patients received various regimens of HDCT and autologous HSCT. The source of stem cells was not reported. 65 Primary outcome All seven included studies with aggregate da all survival (OS). Among the 50 studies with individual data from 123 patients, OS and follow-up were reported for 80 patients. Ten studies reported treatment-related mortali- ty (TRM), five of seven studies with aggregat e data and five of 50 studies with individual data. There were 13 events in nine and zero events in one study. Secondary outcomes One study reported disease-free survival, five studies reported progression-free sur- vival, nine reported non-hematological toxicity grade 3 to 4, and one study reported secondary neoplasia. Five studies report ed on five severe adverse events. Excluded studies A total of 198 references of the potentially relevant articles were excluded (Figure 1) based on: - not diagnosis of interest, NRSTS according to Table 2 or relevant data not reported separately (n = 95); - not intervention of interest, not HD CT and autologous HSCT (n = 69); - not outcome of interest or not reported separately (n = 2); - not publication type of interest, a review , editorial, letter, duplicate data, or con- gress abstract (n = 32). Excluded studies are described in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies table' (shown in the unabridged article). Risk of bias in included studies We have identified one comparative study with a randomized design [Bui-Nguyen 2012]. We think that this trial stands out and has substantially less risk of bias than the rest of the studies. Fiftysix of 57 studies were single-arm studies that subsequently had a very high risk of bias, see Characteristics of included studies. An overviews of the risk of bias is shown in Figure 2 (online at doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008216.pub4) and the risk of bias for each study is shown in Fi gure 3 (online at doi: 10.1002/14651858. CD008216.pub4). Allocation We have identified true randomization including highly probable adequate random sequence generation for [Bui-Nguyen 2012] and judged a low risk of bias for this study. We judged a high risk of bias for the rest of the studies. 66 Assignment of patients to treatment groups In the study by [Bui-Nguyen 2012], patients were assigned to two different treatment arms in a randomized fashion. Thus we judged a low risk of bias for this study. The rest of the studies were singlearm studies with an observational design and we judged a high risk of bias for these studies. Blinding Blinding of outcome assessment was not addressed in all included studies. Thus, we judged a high risk of bias for all studies. Incomplete outcome data [Bui-Nguyen 2012] cond ucted a modified ITT analysis. Th e exclusion of histologically ineligible patients after randomization affe cted three of 41 patients in the HDCT arm and one of 46 patients in the SDCT arm. All other studies analyzed the patients as treated. Thus we judged a low risk of bias for [Bui-Nguyen 2012] and a high risk of bias for the rest. Selective reporting In the study by [Bui-Nguyen 2012], allocati on was carried out centrally, though mask- ing of allocation was not described in full deta il. Thus we judged an unclear risk of bias for this study. We judged a high risk of bias for the rest of the studies. Other potential sources of bias Prospective design The one RCT was prospective [Bui-Nguyen 20 12], three of the six data [Bertuzzi 2003; Bisogno 2010; Blay 2000] and 12 of the 50 single- arm studies with individual data [Fraser 2006; 1989] had prospective parts. The prospective design may be advantageous for studies that present aggregate data from a series of patients treated in a certain time period. The prospective design is not relevant for individual data. Thus, we judged a low risk of bias for [Bui-Nguyen 2012, Bertuzzi 2003, Bisogno 2010, and Blay 2000] and we judged a high risk of bias for the rest. Comparable baseline characteristics [Bui-Nguyen 2012] had a randomized contro lled design and the baseline characteristics of both treatment groups were comparable. Thus, we judged a low risk of bias for [Bui- Nguyen 2012] and a high risk of bias for the rest. 67 Concurrent control We identified a concurrent control group in [Bui-Nguyen 2012] and judged a low risk of bias. The rest of the studies did not report a control group and we judged a high risk of bias. Note: [Philippe-Chomette 2012] reported the results of some cases with conven- tional chemotherapy. The data for those cases were probably observed and not part of an experimental design, collected retrospectively in different time periods. Loss to follow-up Bui-Nguyen 2012 cond ucted a modified ITT analysis. Th e exclusion of histologically ineligible patients after randomization affe cted three of 41 patients in the HDCT arm and one of 46 patients in the SDCT arm. All other studies analyzed the participants as treated. Thus we judged a low risk of bias for [Bui-Nguyen 2012] and a high risk of bias for the rest. Effects of interventions See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following high-dose chemotherapy for non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma Primary outcome Overall survival Overall survival (OS) was not statistically significantly different between HDCT and autologous HSCT versus SDCT at three RCT by [Bui-Nguyen 2012]: 32.7% versus 49.4% with a HR of 1.26 (95% CI 0. 70 to 2.29, P = 0.44) (Table 6). The authors separately analyzed patients that had achieved a complete response to induction ther- apy before HDCT. OS was higher in the comp lete response patients compared to all patients and OS was statistic ally significantly different between the treatment arms. The OS among the patients that have achieved a complete response at three years before HDCT was 42.8% versus 83.9% with a HR of 2.92 (1.1 to 7.6, P = 0.028) (Table 6). The single-arm studies with aggregate data reported an OS at two years ranging from 20% to 51.4% and at three years ranging from 38.9% to 40% (Table 6). [Blay 2000] and [Cook 2012] compared patients that had achieved versus not achieved a complete response before HDCT. [Blay 2000] reported an OS at two years of 63% versus 27%, and [Cook 2012] reported an OS at three years of 57% versus 28% (Table 6). Again, the achievement of a complete response before HDCT was favorable with respect to OS. We conducted a survival analysis using indivi dual data on the condition that survival status and time to event were reported. Th is was true for 65% (80 of 123) of the pa- tient data; for 43 patients, follow-up data were not available. We estimated an OS at two years of 50.6% (95% CI 38.7 to 62.5) and at three years of 36.7% (95% CI 24.4 to 68 49.0) (Table 6). Both estimates were within the range of the other studies. We provid- ed the OS for each individual case in Table 7 (online at doi: 10.1002/14651858. CD008216.pub4). The graphical presentation of the Kaplan-Meier graph of all 80 in- cluded patients at risk is shown in Figure 4. We also analyzed the subgroup of patients with the diagnosis of desmoplastic small round-cell tumor because this diagnosis con- stituted the largest proportion, 34% (27 out of 80), of individual patients considered for the survival analysis (Fig ure 5; online at doi: 10.10 02/14651858.CD 008216.p ub4). Of the data from patients with desmoplastic small round-cell tumor, 77% (27 of 35) had follow-up information. Both survival curves do not appear to be considera- bly different, though the median survival was 2.8 years within the subgroup of 27 pa- tients with desmoplastic small round-cell tumor versus 2.2 years within the total popu- lation of 80 patients.

The authors separately analyzed patients th at had achieved a complete response to induction therapy before HDCT. PFS was higher in the complete response patients 71 compared to all patients and OS was statist ically significantly different between the treatment arms: PFS among the patients that have achieved complete response at three years before HDCT was 20.0% versus 62.3% wi th a HR of 2.87 (95% CI 1.3 to 6.3, P = 0.009) (Table 10). [Blay 2000] reported a considerable difference between the PFS of patients with complete response before HDCT at two and five ye ars (62% versus 5%). Non-hematological toxicity grade 3 to 4 Non-hematological toxicity grade 3 to 4 was addressed in nine studies and 38 serious adverse event were described for 105 participants in nine studies (Table 11). A con- servative estimate was 13.8% (38 events of no n-hematological toxicity grade 3 to 4 in a total of 275 transplanted patients).

The authors reported a difference in overall survival (OS) after the treatment in favor of SDCT (32.7% versus 49.4%) but the difference was not statistically significant (HR 1.26, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.29, P = 0.44). Pro- gression-free survival was also in favor of SDCT (9.3% versus 21.6%) but again the dif- ference was not significant (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.20, P = 0.25). Therefore, there is evidence that patients may not have a better survival after HDCT followed by autolo- gous HSCT. If at all, this intervention should only be offe red after careful consideration and only within controlled clinical trials. Of the participants, 20% have diagnoses not relevant to the present review and the 80% of participants with relevant diagnoses have 12 different types of NRSTS. The heterogeneity of types of NRSTS may be im- portant because the OS may differ between the tumor types and the results of fre- quent types may overlay those of infrequent types. We identified six case series reporting ag gregate data that represented at least 80% of patients with NRSTS. These results desc ribed observed survival after a single exper- imental treatment. The results do not allow conclusions about an effect or benefit of this treatment that is not established. Of the six studies, four case series reported on transplanted patients with desmoplastic small round-cell tumors. OS at two years ranged between 20% and 51.4%. Two case series had a variety of NRSTS. Unfortunate- ly they did not report Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Our estimated OS of 50.6% at two years for the remaining studies with pa rticipant level data falls slightly below the upper limit of the range of 20% to 51.4% reported for six studies with aggregate data. Follow-up information was available for 65% (80 out of 123) of participants that could be included in the survival analysis. For treatment-related mortality (TRM), even the more conservative estimate of 5.5% (15 ou t of 275 transplanted patients) is considera- bly higher than the 2.0% TRM within the fi rst days following HSCT reported by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Registry [EBMT 2009] for the year 1998 [Rosti 2002]. Secondary neoplasia was reported for just one partici- pant, which was probably an extreme underestimation of the true frequency because of the relatively short follow-up in the included studies and the fact that the included studies were not designed to specifically detect secondary neoplasia. The detection of secondary neoplasia depends on a long follow-up, which might be provided by cancer registers. This reported incidence compares with a frequency of 4.0% for secondary neoplasia based on register data [Neglia 2001] and 6.9% [Baker 2003] after a long observation period of 20 years. Non-hematolo gical severe organ toxicity grade 3 to 4 was reported for 36% (38 of 105) transplanted patients with relevant NRSTS in nine 74 studies. Lower grade and hematological toxici ty were not included and should be ac- counted for to get a full picture of adverse events. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence Many of the studies we identified had to be excluded because they included partici- pants with different heterogenous tumors without separate reporting, or the propor- tion of participants with NRSTS was fewe r than 80%. Furthermore, some treatments were performed 10 to 20 years ago. Thus, th e results may not be applicable to patients who are treated today. It is also a possibility that the results reflect the course of the disease and a consequence of the prior therapy rather than a consequence of the test intervention. Quality of the evidence The one RCT has a low risk of bias, whereas the remaining 48 studies were judged as having a high risk of bias. The characterist ics of these single-arm studies showed that there are many different tumor types of NRSTS treated by transplantation, though each individual NRSTS entity was scarce. We found that a pooled survival analysis of individual participant data was considerably hampered. Specifically, the required fol- low-up information was incomplete or missing for 34% (37 out of 108) of participants and, therefore, corresponding data could not be included in the survival analysis. Each tumor type may carry an individual risk profile and, therefore, ideally should be evalu- ated separately. The body of evidence does not allow robust conclusions to be made in relation to the objectives of the review. Potential biases in the review process Strengths The search strategy was broad and it is very likely that all relevant studies were identi- fied. The WHO classification of NRSTS was adopted and modified to define a clear terminology for the study select ion process. Studies were excluded if the proportion of noneligible participants were greater or e qual to 20% of the total population. Authors were contacted to ask for additional data. Limitations The results of studies may be difficult to compare because followup started at differ- ent time points, that is at diagnosis or at start oftreatment. The delay between diagno- sis and starting high-dose chemotherapy can be considerable. The median delay be- tween diagnosis and intensification was four to 39 months in a study on 22 partici-75 pants with STS including 11 NRSTS and 11 rhabdomyosarcoma patients [Dumontet 1992]. We did a sensitivity analysis restricting the pooled analysis to individual cases that were followed from the start of the treatment and we excluded cases that were followed from diagnosis. However, we found on ly a very marginal difference in survival estimates. We identified one RCT with a low risk of bias. This means that the results of this RCT may be used as evidence for the evaluation of the efficacy of autologous HSCT following HDCT for NRSTS. All other identifi ed studies were single-arm studies with an inherent very high risk of bias. This means that the results of the singlearm studies are not helpful to decide whether autologous HSCT following HDCT for NRSTS is a mean- ingful treatment option. Many studies were excluded because participants with NRSTS were mixed with participants with other malignant diseases. The heterogeneity of NRSTS and the possible different terminology used in publications may have led us to overlook studies with eligible participants . This may be more an issue for case series but it is highly unlikely for controlled trials. The pooled survival analysis of individual data was based on less than half of all the individual data available and the exclusion of these data, whilst intending to reduce bias, may also have introduced bias. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews We agree with [Pedrazzoli 2006] that the potential benefit of this treatment option has not been investigated sufficiently in compar ative studies. A systematic review [Verma 2008a] was performed to determine whether first-line dose-intensive chemotherapy supported by growth factor or autologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantation improves outcomes compared with standa rd-dose chemotherapy in patients with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. [Verma 2008a] includ- ed only with HDCT followed by autologous HSCT, which was excluded from the present review because 40% of patients were not diag- nosed with the disease of interest. [Kaspe r 2005 concluded that the use of HDCT for locally advanced or metastatic adult (soft tissue and bone) sarcomas still remains high- ly investigational and sh ould not be performed outside clinical trials. Authors' Conclusions Implications for practice The evidence base does not support the use of HDCT followed by autologous HSCT in high-risk patients with NRSTS. If this treatmen t is offered it should only be after careful consideration and integrated within a prospective concurrent, preferably randomized, controlled trial. 76 Implications for research It is doubtful whether further studies are necessary to clarify the relevance of HDCT followed by autologous HSCT in patients with NRSTS. If non-randomized controlled studies are conducted, a low risk of bias shou ld be achieved. Single-arm studies are not helpful. Criteria for the incl uded tumor types should adhere to the WHO classification. Differences between protocol and review Differences between the recent version and the updated version of the review It is not clear that the unclassified and the undifferentiated tumor types are non- rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas. Therefore, we did not consider these tumor types for the present review and relocated bo th types from the list of included to the list of excluded tumor types. As a result, the following seven studies were included in the original review but excluded in the 2006]. In contrast to the recent version, we excluded the article by [Ivanova 2007]. Ac- cording to e-mail correspondence with the author AB Shvarova of a related article [Ivanova 2010] and co-worker at the same research institution, the proportion of pa- tients with NRSTS was less than 50%. Most of the retrospectively observed patients were children diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. In contrast to the recent version, we included the study by [Blay 2000] becaus e we accepted the re sults of a subgroup analysis comprising 91% (22 out of 24) relevant patients. In agreement with the recent version, the exclusion of the study by [Schlemmer 2006] based on a proportion of NRSTS patients below 80% was confirmed according to a recent author contact. We complemented PFS estimates. We conducted an updated search and included five further studies [Bisogno 2010; Buerk 2010; Hara 2010; Houet 2010; Jordan 2010] that were identified in the update and therefore not reported in the recent version. One study reported aggregate data of 14 participants [Bisogno 2010] and three studies reported individual data of nine participants which were suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis [Buerk 2010; Hara 2010; Jordan 2010]. by [Kasper 2007a] and [Kasper 2010], we stated in the recent version that some participants were reported in both articles. In the present updated version, we evaluated these duplicate data and identified six participants by coincidental information on age, histolog y, and metastatic sit es. We included eight instead of 14 participants reported by [K asper 2007a] and seven participants reported by [Kasper 2010]. Consequently, we removed the duplicate data of six participants from the pooled analysis. We did not find additional reviews in the updated search. 77 We changed the search strategy to increase the fraction of the identified relevant documents of all identified relevant and not relevant documents (precision). The new search strategy is more economical in term s of spending resources for study selection for the present review and also for future updates. The new search strategy was not only used for the time period to be updated but was used from inception of all elec- tronic databases searched. The screening pr ocess was redone regarding the complete retrieved records. All identified studies we re evaluated in detail regardless of being part of the original review. We considered and re-evaluated all studies that were in- cluded in the original review. Therefore, the search strategy is composed of two parts. The new more narrow strategy is spanning the time from inception to 5 December 2012. The old more broad strategy is spanning from inception to 5 February 2010. 78 References References to studies included in this review Al Balushi Z, Bulduc S, Mulleur C, Lallier M.

First-line matched related donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation compared to immunosuppres- sive therapy in acquired severe aplastic anemia. PLoS One. 2011;6(4):e18572. 86 Abstract Introduction Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare and progressive dis- ease characterized by an immune-mediated functional impairment of hematopoietic stem cells. Transplantation of these cells is a first-line treatment option if HLA-matched related donors are available. First-line immunosuppressive therapy may be offered as alternative. The aim was to compare the outc ome of these patients in controlled trials. Methods A systematic search was performed in the bibliographic databases MED- LINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library. To show an overview of various outcomes by treatment group we conducted a meta-analysis on overall survival. We evaluated whether studies reported statistically sig nificant factors for improved survival. Results 26 non-randomized controlled trials (7,955 patients enrolled from 1970 to 2001) were identified. We did not identify any RCTs. Risk of bias was high except in 4 studies. Young age and recent year of treatment were identified as factors for im- proved survival in the HSCT group. Advanced age, SAA without very severe aplastic anemia, and combination of anti-lymphocyte gl obulin with cyclosporine A were factors for improved survival in the IST group. In 19 studies (4,855 pati ents), summary statis- tics were sufficient to be included in meta-analysis. Considerable heterogeneity did not justify a pooled estimate. Adverse events were inconsistently reported and varied significantly across studies. Conclusions Young age and recent year of treatm ent were identified as factors for improved survival in the transplant group. Advanced age, SAA without very severe aplastic anemia, and combination of anti-l ymphocyte globulin with cyclosporine A were factors for improved survival in the immunosuppressive group. Considerable heterogeneity of non-randomized controlled studies did not justify a pooled estimate. Adverse events were inconsistently reported and varied significantly across studies. 87 Introduction Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a ra re [1] and potentially fatal disease which is characterized by hypocellular bone marrow and pancytopenia, and mainly affects young adults. The incidence rate was estima ted at less than 4 per million people per year [2]. The major signs and symptoms are severe infections, bleeding, and exhaus- tion. The underlying pathophy siology is thought to be an aberrant immune response involving the T-cell mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. In most cases, the cause is unknown, although various triggers such as drugs, toxins, and viruses have been reported [3,4]. The treatment of SAA mainly includes immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with an- tithymocyte globulin (ATG)/antilymphocyte and ation (HSCT) [3,4,5]. Allogeneic HSCT is seen as the treatment of choice for selected patients with an HLA-matched related donor [6,7]. Allogeneic HSCT is associated with graft failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and organ toxicities. On the other hand, patients may not respond to IST and long-term IST is associated with the developm ent of clonal diseases [8]. Clinical treat- ment algorithms have been suggested to find a decision that meets individual condi- tions, personal preferences, and prognostic factors [9]. The present systematic review and meta-analysis compares the outcome after first- line HLA-matched related donor HSCT vs. IST in SAA patients in published controlled trials. Methods While preparing this systematic review and meta-analysis, we e ndorsed the PRISMA statement, adhered to its principles a nd conformed to its checklist [10,11]. Study inclusion criteria We included patients with acquired severe ap lastic anemia who received, as first-line treatment, allogeneic HSCT from HLA-matche d related donors (MRD) as the test inter- vention and IST as the control interventi on. Study design was limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized in tervention studies [12]. We did not set a minimum sample size to be considered. Fullt ext publications in English language were considered. We set no limits on year of pub lication or year of treatment. A protocol is not available. 88 Search strategy MEDLINE (1950 to 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010) and The Cochrane Library (to 2010) were searched without restrictions on stud y design and publication year (final search 10 January 2010). The first database search was conducted 24 January 2006. The final search 10 January 2010 included a modified strategy to consider MeSH changes and to render the exclusion of animal studies more precisely. The MeSH term BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION was deleted from one category [13]. For MeSH 2008 there was a major revision of Publication Types (PT) an d the phrase \"as Topic\" was added [14]. We introduced (ANIMALS not (ANIMALS and HUMANS)).sh. and replaced (ANIMALS not HUMANS).sh. To account for these changes, bo th searches were not restricted to any publication year. The terms and the syntax used for the search in MEDLINE via Ovid as shown in Table 1 were tailored to the requirements of the other 2 databases. Refer- ence lists of all included original articl es and 5 recent reviews (2007 to 2009) [8,9,15,16,17] were handsearched. Abstracts of the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting 2004 to 2009 [18] and inform ation on studies registered at ClinicalTri- als.gov [19] were searched online (April 2010). Study selection First, articles were excluded if the title and/or the abstract clearly referred to other diagnoses than severe aplastic anemia and in addition clearly referred to other inter- ventions than allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Second, articles not excluded in the first step were evaluated whether patients were analyzed in a test group after first-line allogeneic HSCT from a MRD and were compared with patients after first-line IST in a control group. Repo rting of extractable information about over- all survival was required for all included studi es. For each excluded study, an appropri- ate reason was documented. All steps of the literature screening process were per- formed by two independent reviewers. Any disagreements were resolved by discus- sion. Criteria for classification of severity of aplastic anemia and quality of response after immunosuppressive treatment were applied according to the EBMT [20]. Risk of bias Risk of bias within studies was evaluated by assessing study design, such as retroor prospective planning, concurrent control gro up, criteria for assignment of patients to treatment arms, control for confounding fact ors, and other criteria, such as unclear selection of patients and analysis of the same patients in both treatment groups, that may increase the risk of bias especially in non-randomized trials [21]. A low risk of bias required a 'yes' for all three of the following topics: concurrent control group, control for confounding factors, and no other risk of bias factors. 89 Table 1.

If the hazard ratio was not directly given in the publication, we extracted summary statistics from Kaplan Meier survival functions and estimated haza rd ratios according to methods proposed by Parmar 1998 [22]. For estimation, we app lied a tool which uses p values of the ap- propriate log-rank test comparing the two survival functions of interest, number of patients analyzed, and number of events on each arm [23]. If this information was not available, hazard ratios were deduced from the graphical display of the survival curves, if possible. Meta-analyses were conducted using the generic varian ce approach [24,25] and the random effects model [26]. Calculations were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, US A). The results of the meta-analyses were graphically displayed by means of a forest plot. Heterogeneity of the results was visual- ly assessed and quantified using the I2 value [27]. A funnel plot was prepared by using The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Mana ger 5 (http://www.cc-ims.net/ revman). In the case of considerab le heterogeneity (I2 50%), a pooled estimate is not reasonable and, therefore, was not calculated [28]. Subgroup analysis Sensitivity analysis: We tried to explain hete rogeneity identified in the meta-analysis of overall survival by evaluating dichotomized subpopulations of study and patients char- acteristics in several sensitivity analyses [29]. Subgroups in individual studies: We ex- tracted overall survival data of subgroups to reproduce survival functions from some individual studies if reported for both treatments. Data on subgroup analyses were extracted if available. The difference between the estimates of 2 subgroups was evalu- ated by conducting a test of interaction based on meta-regression models [30]. Calcu- lations were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). Factors for improved survival We extracted statistically significant results from multivariate analyses on factors for improved survival, such as age, disease seve rity, treatment period, and type of IST, if reported in the included studies. Data collection and analysis All steps of the data collection process were performed by two independent reviewers. Any disagreements were resolv ed by discussion. We collected study characteristics s u c h a s t h e n u m b e r a n d r e g i o n o f p a r t i c ipating centers, the treatment period, the 91 number of analyzed patients per treatment ar m, the proportion of patients with dis- eases other then SAA, a regimen other than firstline treatment, and median follow-up. Median age, gender, and time interval from diagnosis to treatment were extracted as patients' characteristics. For the HSCT ar m we extracted the number of patients who were treated with conditioning irradiation and conditioning ATG or ALG. For the IST arm we extracted the number of patients treated with ATG or ALG alone or in combi- nation with CSA. The primary outcome was overall survival from the beginning of HSCT or IST. Kaplan Meier estimates were extracted directly from the text or deduced from survival curves given in the publication. The principal summary measure was the hazard ratio as specified in the meta-analysis section. We extracted the p value of the log-rank test of the overall survival functions and the 5- year estimate of both treatment arms. Re- sults from subgroup analys es were also extracted. The secondary outcomes were overall mort ality, graft failure, GVHD, no response to IST, and health-related quality of life. Graft failure included both primary and secondary types; acute GVHD was consid- ered if grade II-IV was reported and chronic GVHD was considered if an extensive course was reported. Results Search results Of 3,085 retrieved publicatio ns, 358 full-text papers were obtained for further assess- ment, and 26 non-randomized controlled clinic al trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were included in th e present study [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38, 39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56] (Figure 1). We did not identify any RCTs. An overview of the study characteristics is presented in Table 2. Patients were recruited between 1970 and 2002 in 24 studi es, whereas in 2 studies, year of treat- ment was not reported. In 13 studies [31,34,35,39,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,49,54], dis- ease severity (SAA or VSAA) or first-line tr eatment was clearly classified for all patients. The proportion of patients with moderate aplastic anemia, unknown disease severity, or second-line treatment was less than 20% in 6 studies [32,36,38,40,50,52] and was 20% or more in 7 studies [33,37,48,51,53, 55,56]. 25 included trials used information about the availability of MRD to allocate patients to comparison groups, called Mende- lian (genetic) randomization [57,58]. In 3 studies [41,52,53], relevant data were not reported for the total study population but were reported separately for subgroups. 92 Figure 1. Literature search and study flow. Abbreviations: HSCT: hematopoieti severe aplastic anemia. overview of characteristics of 7,955 anal yzed patients in 26 studies is presented in Table 3. Median age (HSCT vs. IST: 9-24 vs. 5-55 years) was reported in 15 of 26 stud- ies and the difference between groups was not statistically different (sign test: p = 0.119). Gender (HSCT vs. IST: 44-76 vs. 43-78 percent males) was reported in 19 of 26 studies and median of the time from diag nosis to treatment (HSCT vs. IST: 27-300 vs. 12-150 days) was reported in 15 of 26 studies. An overview of the treatment character istics is presented in Table 4. Conditioning irradiation was reported in 22 of 26 studies (0%-100%) and ATG or ALG was used in 9 studies (2%-100%) in the HSCT arms. In the IST arms, ATG or ALG (8%-100%) and CSA (0%-100%) was reported in 25 of 26 studies. IST was composed of ATG or ALG in 25 studies and was combined with CSA in 13 studies. Table 2.

We included 19 studies (4,855 patients) [31,32,33,35,37,38,39,40,42,43,45,46,47, 48,49,50,51,54,55] in a meta-analysis on ov erall survival, which provided summary statistics required for estimating the hazard ratio. The pooled hazard ratio was statisti- cally not significant and was characterized by a considerable heterogeneity indicated by an I2 value of 75% (Figure 2). A pooled estimate was not justified. Figure 2. Meta-analysis of all studi es with available data. Meta-analysis of overall survival using hazard-ratio as effect measure after first-line HSCT vs. first-line IST.

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis The difference between the estimates was no t statistically significant in both ap- proaches and for all evaluated items, except for age, which was statistically significant in the evaluation of subgroups from individual studies and not statistically significant in the sensitivity analysis (Table 7). Factors for improved overall survival We evaluated patient characteristics that were evaluated in multivariate regression analyses (Table 8). 11 studies reported statistically significant factors for improved survival and 15 studies did not. Frequency of reporting the main factors, that is, age, year of transplant and type of IST is presented in Table 9. Young age was identified as a statistically significant factor for improved overall survival for patients in the HSCT group in 5 studies. The results fo r patients in the IST group were less clear because advanced age was a favorable factor in 3 studies and 103 young age a favorable factor in 2 studies. Th e actual age limit, which was used to di- chotomize participants into young vs. adva nced age varied across studies. Level of polymorphonuclear neutroph granulocytes (PMN) be tween 0.2 G/L and 0.5 G/L was found to be an important factor for improved survival after IST in 5 studies. Only 1 study found an advantage with less than 0.2 G/L in patients who were younger than 17 years. Recent year of treatment wa s an important factor for improved survival after HSCT in 4 studies and after IST in 1 study. Improvement of outcome over time was accompanied with treatment refinement , such as combination of methotrexate with CSA for GVHD prophylaxis and reduction of conditioning irradiation. Another example of improvement of outcome with treatment refinement is the combination of ALG and CSA instead of monotherapy of ALG. This combination was identified as factor for improved survival in 2 studies. Table 7.

Considerable heterogeneity of 19 studies incl uded in a meta-analysis of overall survival did not justify a pooled estimate. The ai m to compare the primary outcome between treatment groups in an overall synthesis of available data was not achieved. We were able to identify statistically significant fact ors for improved overall survival reported in the studies. Young age (rather than advanced age) and recent (rather than earlier) year of treatment were associated with a better overall survival in the HSCT group. Ad- vanced age (rather than young age), SAA without VSAA (rather than VSAA), and com- bination of ALG and CSA (rather than ALG alone) were associated with a better overall survival in the IST group. While pooling data on overall survival of all participating pa- tients did not appear sensible, we conducte d sensitivity meta-ana lysis of subgroups to explain heterogeneity and of subgroups reported in individual studies. Unfortunately, these evaluations were hampered by the fact that individual patient data were not available and instead of that we relied on published aggregate data if reported. It should be mentioned that ALG is no longer available. Although young age was recognized as a ma jor influence factor on overall survival, the appropriate definition for young age vari es considerably across studies. For exam- ple, the cut-off for young vs. advanced age was 16 years in the study of Bacigalupo 2008 [16], 30 years in the study of Ljungman 2009 [59], and 40 years in the study of Marsh 2009 [9]. Bacigalupo 2008 [16] reported that the outcome has improved since 1996 for HSCT but not for IST. This result was supported by 4 studies whereas 1 study did find an improvement for the IST group as well. Several factors may have contributed to recent improvements for HSCT, such as detailed HLA-matching, less irradiation-based condi- tioning, less GVHD with methotrexate plus CSA instead of methotrexate alone [34], refinement of the type and dosage of conditioning drugs, and general advancement of me dical and nursing c linical science. We found that a combination therapy of ALG plus CSA favored overall survival in the IST group, underscoring that refinement of therapy obviously has also improved the outcome with IST. Gafter-Gvili 2008 [60] concluded in a systematic review and metaanalysis that combination of ALG plus CSA should be considered the gold stand- ard for IST for patients with SAA. 6 studies [33,37,38,39,41,50] evaluated whether the disease severity of VSAA (PMN < 0.2 G/L) vs. SAA (without VSAA; PMN 0.2 to < 0.5 G/L) had an impact on overall survival. 5 studies [33,37,38, 39,50] consistently found that SAA without VSAA favored the outcome in IST group when compared to VSAA. 2 studies [39,50] included only children and 3 studies [33,37,38] included a lso adults. These results may suggest that 108 HSCT may be the preferred treatment option for patients with VSAA and that IST may be the preferred option for patients with SAA without VSAA. However, Fuhrer 2005 [41] reported contradictory results that VSAA favored the outcome in IST group. The results may be relevant for children only be cause all analyzed patients were younger than 17 years of age. We did not find another study confirming the results, especially not in 2 studies mentioned above. We believe that this is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis about studies comparing first-line HSCT vers us first-line IST in patients with SAA. Secondary outcomes Studies inconsistently reported adverse events and their frequencies varied significant- ly across studies. Graft failure was highest in early studies but could affect up to 18% of patients in recent studies. Rates for acute GVHD grade III to IV reached up to 40% and for extensive chronic GVHD reached up to 24% in recent studies. A considerable num- ber of patients not responding to IST may indicate the importance of unrelated donor transplantation. Duplicate publication bias Identical data may have been included tw ice in the present systematic review. We searched for follow-up papers of a single study to include the update version and ex- clude former presentations. Register anal yses can provide results based on a large number of patients but regist ers may use data that may have been published previous- ly by the contributing study centers. We iden tified 5 studies published on behalf of the EBMT [33,34,50,51] which are probably based on overla pping data. Locasciulli 2007 [51] presented an update of the EBMT data and, therefore, invest igated considerably more patients (2,479 patients) than Locasciu lli 1990 [50] (304 patients). The courses of the survival functions are clearly different between the 2 studies. In Locasciulli 1990 [50] (Figure 1 of the article), in the majority of the follow-up period the course of the Kaplan-Meier curve after HSCT is above that after IST (congruent in the first 12 months), indicating an advantage from HSCT. In Locasciulli 2007 [51] (Figure 1 of the article), in the majority of the follow-up period the course of the Kaplan-Meier curve after HSCT is below that after IST (in the firs t 60 months). Only at the very end of the follow-up period (from 100 to 120 months) is the HSCT curve above the IST curve. The difference between the 2 survival functions was assessed by a log-rank test. The au- thors stated that 10-year surv ival was significantly superior in patients treated with BMT than in those in whom immunos uppression was used (73% versus 68%, p = 0.002). On the contrary, we are convinced that the survival functions clearly show that IST was statistica lly significantly better than HSCT . Our interpretation of the re- sults is supported by Linden 2007 [61], who addressed the specific problem of inter-109 preting the crossing of the surv ival functions using Locasciulli 2007 [51] as an example. Locasciulli 1990 [50] clearly repo rted that only data from SA A patient were included. In contrast, Locasciulli 2007 [51] included a con siderable proportion of patients with moderate aplastic anemia or with unknown severity of disease. A study population with different patients' characteristics with respect to disease severity might have contributed to the different results. Medica l advancement after a time difference of 17 years between publication dates of both studies might have had a greater impact on improved survival after HSCT than on survival after IST. Outcome reporting bias Outcome reporting bias [62] is defined as th e selection of a subset of the originally recorded outcome variables for publication. Systematic reviews need to address the issue of missing outcome data because outcome reporting bias can a ffect their conclu- sions [63]. We identified considerable outcome reporting bias. A major flaw of all stud- ies was the lack of statistical summary data such as standard error or confidence interval for point estimates and p values of logrank test. To pool as many studies as possible, we estimated the hazard ratio. The number of patients at risk was scarcely reported. Study publication bias Study publication bias is defined as publication of research results depending on their results [64]. Funnel plots of both reported meta-analyses show moderate asymmetry and do not indicate considerable publication bias. The strengths of the present sys- tematic review are the broadness of the sear ch strategy and the comprehensiveness of the published data included. Nevertheless, there may be a slight possibility that an unknown number of studies were not registered and not published. Language bias Results in English language articles could be different from those of articles written in other languages [65]. Non-English language articles require expensive translations to prevent selective outcome extraction and m isinterpretation of results. Funding for translation was not provided and we excluded all non-English language articles, includ- ing German articles. Restricting the inclusio n of studies to English articles may have little effect on summary treatment effect estimates [66,67] and German language articles may not play a preeminent role in the dissemination of medical research [68]. 110 Internal validity We identified a high risk of bias within all non-randomized controlled studies except for 4 studies. Assignment of patients to trea tment groups was report ed to be based on availability of MRD in all 26 studies, althou gh, in 7 studies an upper age limit was ap- plied as additional assignment criteria. This type of allocation has specific require- ments, such as allelic vs. serologic typing, number of analyzed loci, time spent search- ing for donors, documentation of all indivi duals analyzed including families of IST pa- tients, number of analyzed individuals per family, intent-totreat analysis. However, these requirements were not reported in the included studies. Heterogeneity We included as many contro lled studies as possible in order to not miss any valuable outcome information. Consequently, we acce pted studies that considered a consider- able number of patients with moderate aplastic anemia or unknown disease severity. Pooling of data from patients with varyin g characteristics may have compromised the generalizability of results. Furthermore, important subgroups such as young and ad- vanced age were confused in the meta-analysis. In an attempt to reduce heterogeneity we strictly confined the meta-analysis to studies that clearly included at least 80% of patients with SAA and first-line treatment (data not shown). We found a moderate heterogeneity and a statistically significant pooled estimate that favored HSCT. Many studies including large and recently pub- lished ones were excluded. The result suggest ed a global preference for one treatment disregarding conditions other than the treatment that might have a determined impact on the outcome. We believe that this procedure would have introduced a study selec- tion bias and a misleading conclu sion and was therefore not pursued. Strengths and limitations of the present review The strengths of this review are the broadne ss of the search strategy and the compre- hensiveness of the published data included. Significant factors that may influence the survival of the patients were considered in the present systematic review. We estimat- ed hazard ratios from published aggregate su rvival functions and did not use individual patient data. Subgroup analysis was not helpfu l to explain considerable heterogeneity found in meta-analysis. While the results of the meta-analysis may not be conclusive, they can provide useful summaries of the state of knowledge. 111 Conclusions Young age and recent year of treatment were identified as factors for improved sur- vival in the transplant group. Advanced age, SAA without ve ry severe aplastic anemia, and combination of anti-lymphocyte globulin with cyclosporine A were factors for improved survival in the immunosuppressive group. Considerable heterogeneity of non-randomized controlled studies did not justify a pooled estimate. Adverse events were inconsistently reported and va ried significantly across studies. 112 References 1. Office of Rare Diseases Term s: Aplastic anemia.

European Ur ology. 2011;60(5):881-93. 118 Abstract Context Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men. Permanent interstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR -BT) is a short-distance radiation therapy in which low-energy radioactive sources ar e implanted permanently into the prostate. Objective To assess the effectiveness and safety of LDR-BT compared to treatment alternatives in men with localised PCa. Evidence acquisition Bibliographic databa ses (Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) were searched from inception until June 2010 for randomised and nonran- domised controlled trials comparing LDR-BT wi th radical prostatectomy (RP), external- beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or no pr imary therapy (NPT). Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Second ary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS), biochemi- cal recurrence-free survival (b RFS), physician-reported severe adverse events (SAE), and patient-reported outcomes (PRO). Evidence synthesis A total of 31 studie s, including 1 randomised controlled trial (RCT), were identified. Risk of bias was high for all 31 studies. OS was reported in one nonrandomised controlled study; however, these data were not interpretable because of strong residual confounding. DFS was not reported. Comparison of bRFS between treatment groups is not validated; thus, re sults were not interpretable. Physician- reported urogenital late toxicity grade 2 to 3 was more common in the LDR-BT group when compared to the EBRT group. With re spect to PRO, better scores for sexual and urinary function as well as urinary incontinen ce were reported for LDR-BT compared to RP. Better scores for bowel function were reported for LDR-BT compared to EBRT. Conclusions We found a low amount of evidence in studies that exclusively com- pared LDR-BT with other treatment modalities. LDR-BT may have some different physi- cian-reported SAE and patient-reported outc omes. The current evidence is insufficient to allow a definitive conclusion about OS. Randomised trials focusing on long-term survival are needed to clarify the relevance of LDR-BT in patients with localised PCa. 119 1. Introduction Localised prostate cancer (PCa) is defined by the categories T1 to T2 of the TNM stag- ing system [1] if combined with an absenc e of both regional lymph node metastasis (N0) and distant metastasis (M0). The European Association of Urology suggested four different treatment concepts for localised PCa [2]. Brachytherapy [2] is short-d istance radiation therapy (RT) that places radiation sources with different durations and rates of dose delivery in or near tumours [3]. Permanent interstitial low-dose rate brachy therapy (LDR-BT) refers to implanting low- energy radioactive sources that emit radiatio n at a rate < 2 Gy/h [4]. The radioisotopes iodine125 or palladium-103 are contained in ti tanium pellets of the size of rice grains, which are called seeds. Sixty to 100 seeds are typically inserted into the prostate through a transperineal route guided by transrectal ultrasound. LDRBT is a minimally invasive procedure that can be carried out as an outpatient treatment and is complet- ed in 45-90 min under spinal or general anaesthesia. However, a large prostate vol- ume ( 60 ml) can be technically challenging and basically represents a relative contra- indication to LDRBT. LDR-BT has to be distinguished from high-dose brachytherapy (HDR-BT), which uses the radioisotope iridium 192 as a high-energy-emitting radiation source with a rate of 12 Gy/h [4]. The source is plac ed temporarily in the prostate using needles as applicators. The term primary (rather than definitive ) therapy was suggested to convey a clear message concerning both the intent and the nature of RT and surgical operation, in- cluding LDR-BT, radical prostatectomy (RP), and external-beam RT (EBRT) [5]. The term no primary therapy (NPT) is used in the present systematic review to accommodate all types of observation, including active surv eillance, watchful wa iting, and observing without distinctive management. LDR-BT, as compared to RP and EBRT, ma y have similar survival outcomes but may reduce the incidence of local adverse events and may provide better health-related quality of life (HRQL) [6,7]. However, rand omised controlled trials (RCT) are lacking [8,9]. The aim of this systematic review wa s to assess the benefit and harm of LDR-BT relative to RP, EBRT, or NPT in men with localised PCa. 2. Evidence Acquisiton While preparing this systematic review, we endorsed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses statem ent, adhered to its principles, and con- formed to its checklist [10]. Data are based on works conducted by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care and commissioned by the Federal Joint Commit- tee of the selfgoverning statutory health insurance system in Germany [11,12]. 120 2.1. Study inclusion criteria We included RCTs and nonrandomised contro lled trials evaluating LDR-BT as mono- therapy in patients with localised PCa. The pr oportion of relevant patients had to be at least 80% of the study population, and the response rate of questionnaires was ex- pected to be at least 70%. For nonrandomised studies to be included, comparable baseline characteristics between treatment gr oups or adjustment for imbalances of these data were required. Limits on year of publication or language were not applied. 2.2. Search strategy Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library we re searched without restrictions on study design, publication year, or language. The last database searches were conducted in June 2010. Terms and syntax used for the search in Medline via Ovid (Table S1; online at doi: 10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.044) were tailored to the requirements of the other two data- bases. Reference lists of all included primary articles and two recent reviews [8,9] were handsearched for further information. Informat ion on studies registered at ClinicalTri- als.gov [13], World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform [14], International Standard Ra ndomised Controlled Trial Number Register [15], National Institute for Health Research UK Clinical Research Network's Portfolio Database [16], and National Cancer Institute Physician Data Query Clinical Trial [17] were searched online (June 2010) for RCTs. 2.3. Study selection The study population in cluded patients (no age limit) with localised PCa as classified by the TNM classification system [1]. Test in tervention was LDR-BT; HDR-BT was not in- cluded. The control intervention was RP, EBRT, or NPT. In the first step of study selection, bib liographic records were excluded if the title or the abstract clearly referred to other diagnoses than localised PCa or if a single-arm study was reported. In the second step, articles not excluded in the first step were evaluated to determine whether the test intervention were compared to at least one of the defined control interventions using an included study design. For each excluded study of the second step, an appropriate re ason was documented (F ig. 1). All steps of the literature screening process were performed by two independent reviewers; any disagreements were resolved by discussion. 121 Figure 1. Literature retrieval and study selection.

Data collection and analysis For included studies, data on study character istics, patients and interventions, risk of bias, duration of follow-up, and outcomes were abstracted independently by two re- view authors. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion or by appeal 122 to a third review author. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary out- comes were clinically defined disease-free survival (DFS), biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), physicianreported severe ad verse events (SAE), and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) such as function and bother scores as well as generic HRQL. BRFS, also called prostate-specific antige n (PSA)-based recurrence-free survival, is a widely used laboratory-reported outcome. We believe that it should not be regarded as a validated surrogate for comparing differ ent treatment groups in patients with a localised PCa\u2014a problem further addressed in the discussion section. SAE included sexual problems, urinary problems such as lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary incontinence, bowel problems such as rectal incontinence, toxicity\u2014for example, uro- genital or gastrointestinal acute or late to xicity according to modified Radiation Thera- py Oncology Group radiation scale [18]\u2014and other SAE such as secondary neoplasia. The questionnaires included in this systematic review to assess function, bother, and generic HRQL are listed in Table 1. The primary effect measure for survival outcomes was the hazard ratio (HR). For nonrandomised studies, either comparability of baseline characteristics or an appropri- ate adjustment from a multiple regression analysis was required. We identified bRFS data qualified for quantitative pooling in a meta-analysis. However, we regard bRFS as an unvalidated surrogate for a pooled estimate may draw conclusions that are too far from reality. We did not identify OS and DFS data a ppropriate for pooling. Therefore, details of planned extraction of summary statistics and estimation of pooled data are not reported. Results were accepted as adjusted if at least one of six predefined confounding factors was considered in a multiple regre ssion model or in a stratified or matched analysis: age, T stage of the TNM classification, PSA, Gleaso n score, prostate size, and comorbidity. Unadjusted results were used from RCTs and from nonrandomised stud- ies if no adjusted analysis were availabl e and baseline characteristics were compara- ble. Other accepted effect measures were r isk difference, risk ratio, odds ratio (OR), and mean difference. The reporting of a statistically significant effect in at least two studies and at the same time no reporting of contradicting results after a follow-up of at least 6 mo were required to determine whether the data were in favour of LDR-BT or the compared treatment. 2.5. Assessment of risk of bias and quality of reporting Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of RCTs. A low risk of bias required a \"yes\" for all five of the following criteria: (1) adequate generation of the randomisation sequence; (2) adequate allocation concealmen t; (3) blinding of outcome assessors; (4) completeness of outcome data, including reporting of dropouts before and losses to follow-up after the beginning of treatment; and (5) an analysis based on intention to treat (ITT) of patients at the time of ra ndomisation. In studies reporting PROs, the presence of baseline scores was evaluated in addition to the other six confounders. Table 1.

To further differentiate risk of bias in these nonrandomised studies, additional flaws were categorised as small or large. The category small addi- tional flaws required a \"yes\" for all four of the following criteria: (1) concurrent control group; (2) consecutive recruitment; (3) cont rol for at least three out of the six prede- fined confounding factors age, T stage, PSA, Gleason score, prostate size, and comor- bidity; and (4) reporting of patient flow or missing data. When there was evidence of multiple publications of the same study popul ation, results were on ly included if they came from a different subpopulation. 3. Evidence synthesis 3.1. Search results After exclusion of duplicates, 3785 bibliographic records were screened for potential eligibility, and 462 full-text papers were obtained for further assessment (Fig. 1). A total of 31 studies [18-48] met the inclusio n criteria. The present systematic review included 1 RCT [30] and 30 nonrandomised studies. 3.2. Baseline data An overview of the study characteristics, such as data obtained from registries, study location, treatment period, follow-up, EBRT dose, and number of included patients, is presented in Table 2. Median age in the EBRT group was up to 7 yr higher than in the LDR- BT group and in the LDR-BT group up to 9 yr high er than in the RP group in the majority of studies. Most studies included only the T1 and T2 categories of TNM classification, with a few studies reporting on patients with T3 or T4 categories (42% per group). Although the majority of patients in the primary studies had a Gleason score < 7 and a PSA level < 10 ng/ml, most studies also included a consider able proportion (about 20-30%) of patients with a PSA level 10 ng/ml. Prostate size and comorbidity were reported only in a few studies. LDR-BT was mo stly performed using iodine-125 as the isotope, but in a few stud- ies, palladium-103 was used instead. EBRT was conducted with different radiation doses between and among studies. Median total dose ranged from 68 Gy to 78 Gy. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy differed among patients. RP was carried out with or without a nerve-sparing technique u sing either a retropubic or perineal route. Of 30 nonrandomised studies, 7 reported results from registries [19,28,31,37, 38,43,48].

The ty pe of brachytherapy, especially the dose, is not specified in the article. According to e-mail contact on 23 May 2011, the authors identified all brachytherapy patients without differentiating specific radiation dose but assumed that over 80% was low-dose rate, as high-dose rate is not prevalent in Ohio. 127 128 3.3. Risk of bias an d quality of studies Risk of bias of the RCT by Giberti 2009 [30] was evaluated as high. Patients were ran- domised, using a computerised blocked random number list, into 2 groups of 100 pa- tients each. Randomisation was performed by a urologist not participating in the surgi- cal operations; however, concealment of allocation was not reported. Outcome as- sessment was performed by another urologist blinded to patient treatment. Further- more, a considerable number of patients were lost to follow-up (15% in the brachy- therapy group and 11% in the RP group), management of the missing data was not addressed, and no ITT analysis was perfor med. There was no information on prior sample size calculation and no statement about funding and competing interests. Risk of bias was high for all 30 nonrandomised studies because of the nonrandom- ised design (Table 3). Additional large flaws were identified in 63% of studies (19 of 30) [18-21, 24-28,32,37-39,41,42,44,45,47,48], and additional small flaws were identified in the other 37% (11 of 30). 3.4. Primary outcome: overall survival An overview of conclusions based on the availa ble data is presented in Table 4. Only one nonrandomised study reported improvement in overall mortality the LDR-BT compared to the NPT group [48] at 7-yr follow-up, as listed in the overview of reported end points in Table 1. Improvement of diseas e-specific mortality (HR: 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23- 0.87) was also reported in this study, but not in any other identified study. As detailed later, results were deemed not interpretable in the present systematic review. 3.5. Secondary outcomes An overview of conclusions based on the ava ilable data is presented in Table 4. Table 1 shows the end points that were reported by the accordant studies. DFS was not identi- fied in the included studies; bRFS was report ed in 14 studies (Table 5). Time-to-event data were in favour of LDR-BT compared to RP in three of seven studies and were not significantly different in four of seven studies. Concerning EBRT, time-toevent data were in favour of LDR-BT compared to EBRT in 3 of 10 studies and were not significant- ly different in 7 of 10 studies. In an additional study, Kupelian 2004 [34] reported re- sults after EBRT for two subgroups stratified by dose level. The ou tcome was in favour of LDR-BT compared to low-dose EBRT and was not significantly different after high- dose EBRT. In all four studies [34,40,41,46 ] applying low-dose EBRT, outcome was in f a v o u r o f L D R - B T , a l t h o u g h W o n g e t a l . e v aluated two different types of EBRT with different dose levels (Table 2).

Result s comprising type of control intervention, proportion of events, HR and p value, and interpretation of effect are listed in Table 6. An effect was defined as a statistically significant difference between intervention groups. A better score was defined as at least two effects in one direction without contrasting effect after a minimum 6-mo follow-up. Urogenital late toxicity grade 2 to 3 was significantly more common in three st udies in the LDR-BT group compared to the EBRT group. The difference between groups of other SAE was not significant. An effect was reported in a single study only , or the results were contradictory among several studies. PROs such as function or bother scores as well as generic HRQL were reported in 13 studies (Table 1) [21,22,24, 27,29-33,35,36,43,44], including the single RCT. Concern- ing sexual function or bother, better scores were reported for the LDR-BT group com- pared with RP (Table S3; online at doi: 10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.04). Concerning uri- nary tract problems, urinary function scores and urinary incontinence scores were better for the LDR-BT group than the RP group (Table S4; online at doi: 10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.04). Concerning bowel scores, better scores were reported for the LDR-BT group than the EBRT group (Table S5; online at doi: 10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.04). Concerning generic HRQL, we fo und only two con- trasting effects (Table S6; online at doi: 10.1016/j.eururo.2011.06.04). Differences be- tween groups that were not statistically diff erent and failure to report results of statis- tical tests were major reasons. 134 Table 6.

Discussion 3.6.1. Outcomes We found a high risk of bias among all 31 id entified studies, incl uding 1 RCT. Recent systematic reviews [8,9,49,50] also addresse d the lack of RCTs investigating brachy- therapy. Wilt 2008 [49] pointed out that long-term, adequately powered randomised trials to provide reliable estimates about the relative effectiveness of treatments are needed. Only one nonrandomised study reported equivalent improvement of overall and disease-specific mortality for localised disease 7 yr after LDR-BT compared to NPT [48]. The mortality-incidence ratio of PCa can be estimated at 15%, and the overall 5-yr relative survival of patients in comparison to the general population was reported at 99.1% [51]. Both statistics are compatible with a long life expectancy compared to other cancers. Thus, even significant improv ement of disease-specific mortality is not expected to have an important impact on ov erall mortality. Yet, a large difference in OS is reported, which strongly indicates structural differences in the patient popula- tions between the treatment groups, possibly resulting in biased effect estimates be- cause of considerable residual confounding. Concerning physician-reported SAE, a statistic ally significant effect in favour of LDR- BT in at least two studies and no contradicting effects in other studies were found for urogenital late toxicity grade 2 to 3 when compared to EBRT. Concerning PROs, a sta- tistically significant effect in favour of LDR- BT in at least two studies and no contradict- ing effects in other studies compared with RP was identified for sexual function, uri- nary function, and urinary incontinence. Some of the results are not unexpected con- sidering the treatment-specific impact on phy sical integrity. An advantage for LDR-BT in urinary and sexual domains was similarly ob served at 5-yr follow-up in the Surgical Prostatectomy Versus Interstitial Radiation In tervention Trial [52]. An analogous effect in favour of LDR-BT was identified for bowel function when compared to EBRT. Some of the results are also not unexpected, because the bowel may be affected by EBRT. The current evidence does not allow a determination of whether LDR-BT has an additional benefit or harm compared to othe r treatment alternatives in patients with localised PCa. Informed decision-making requires detailed and unbiased description of possible benefits and harms for each intervention with respect to the individual needs and health preferences of the patients. Unfortunately, conflicts of interest may ham- per unbiased counselling [53], and experts such as urologists or radiotherapists prefer the modality they deliver [54,55]. Thus, individual preferences by patients and physi- cians play a central role in the decision wh ether to treat or to pursue active surveil- lance [56]. Ethical issues such as patient a nd physician preferences as well as transpar- ent counselling should be considered in stud y designs. RCTs on surgical treatment of cancer are especially threatened by low ra tes of accrual, and physicians offered the 136 following main explanations in questionnaire: concern that the doctor-patient rela- tionship would be affected by an RCT, diffi culty with informed consent, and dislike of open discussions involving uncertainty [57]. 3.6.2. Biochemical recu rrence-free survival We found inconsistent results for bRFS. So me studies found significant differences between LDR-BT versus RP and LDRBT versus EBRT, whereas others reported insignifi- cant differences. All studies in favour of LD R-BT over EBRT reported application of low- dose EBRT. These results are in agreement wi th the results of a meta-analysis by Viani 2009, who concluded that high doses are supe rior to low-dose RT in preventing bio- chemical failure [58]. BRFS is the most commonly used end point in the included studies and may be the best tool available for detecting recurrence of PCa in individuals. However, for the purpose of statistical comparison of different treatments, bRFS is not an appropriate end point. BRFS represents a surrogate end point and is not validated for comparing LDRBT to RP, EBRT, or NPT. Different definitions of this surrogate and serious reserva- tions for interpreting comparative results are in effect. Therefore, this outcome is pre- sented as supporting data only to allow a description of available information. PSA-based recurrence was traditionally co nsidered an attractive surrogate end point for survival [59], but this was mainly ba sed on data after RP. It has not been vali- dated for any treatment of localised PCa. Different definitions exist for bDFS after EBRT (Phoenix definition) [60] and after RP [61] . The term is not defined for follow-up after LDR-BT and is not helpful for comparing two treatment alternatives, especially not for comparing LDR-BT to RP [62]. Sensitivity and specificity of the Phoenix criteria to de- tect late clinical recurrence range between 60% and 80% for patients after EBRT [60]. More than half of the patients who have a biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) according to the Phoenix definition subsequently die from other causes than PCa [63]. The predictive value of a BCR after LDR-BT using the Phoenix definition depends on the duration of follow-up [64]. Short-term studi es focussing on PSA-based RFS, therefore, tend to overestimate the efficacy of LD R-BT compared to RP, because PSA recur- rence\u2014by its very definition\u2014is unlikely to occur within the first months after LDR-BT. The proportion of false-positive values in PS A bounce can be considerable for accurate estimates of treatment efficacy after brachy therapy if the follow-up is < 3 yr [64,65]. All these points raise serious questions abou t the validity of BCR-free survival as an outcome measure. 3.6.3. Strengths and limitations of the present review The strengths of this review are the broadne ss of the search strategy and the compre- hensiveness of the published data included. However, the lack of RCT data and the poor methodologic quality of the included studies imply that the validity and the over-137 all robustness of results are limited. In a ddition, the included studies were heteroge- neous with regard to patient characteristic s, isotopes used in LDR-BT, surgical ap- proaches in RP, and radiation dose in EBRT. As in any systematic review, the limitations in drawing conclusions are directly dependent on the quality and homogeneity of the primary studies. We identified a high risk of bias within all studies. As the different treatment op- tions in localised PCa (LDR-BT, RP, EBRT, and NPT) differ s ubstantially with regard to techniques, possible benefits, and possible ha rms, clinical guidelines recommend these treatments to specific patient subgroups, causing selection bias and covariate imbal- ance in observational studies. Because stat istical adjustment is unable to fully control for such strong confounding factors, this problem may be overcome only by RCTs. 3.6.4. Future prospects We have identified three ongoing RCTs that may provide sufficient evidence in upcom- ing years to allow conclusions about the co mparative effectiveness of LDR-BT. With support from the German statutory health care system, a preference-based multicen- tre RCT comparing LDR-BT, RP, EBRT, and ac tive surveillance is planned to start re- cruitment in 2011 [66]. Standard Treatment Against Restricted Treatment (START) is an international (Canada, United States, Unit ed Kingdom) two-arm multicentre RCT to investigate the outcome of acti ve surveillance in patients with low-risk PCa compared to LDR-BT, EBRT, or RP [67]. Surgery Agai nst Brachytherapy (SABRE 1), a randomised evaluation, is an international (United King dom, Canada) multicentre RCT to compare LDR-BT against RP [68]. 4. Conclusions We found a low amount of evidence in stud ies that exclusively compared LDR-BT with other treatment modalities. LDR-BT may have some different physician-reported SAE and PROs. The current evidence is insufficien t to allow a definitive conclusion about OS. Randomised trials focussing on long-term survival are needed to clarify the rele- vance of LDR-BT in patients with localised PCa. 138 References 1. Ebele JN, Sauter G, Ep stein JI, Sesterhenn IA.

Negative-pressure wound controlled trials. Deutsches Arzt eblatt International. 2011;108(22):381-9. 144 Abstract Background In negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT), a wound is covered with an airtight dressing, and negative pressure is applied. This is thought to promote heal- ing. We evaluated NPWT with an updated, systematic review of the literature. Methods We systematically searched the P ubMed and Cochrane Library databases for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of NPWT for the treatment of acute or chronic wounds. The primary outcome was complete wound closure. Results We found reports of 9 RCTs in addition to the 12 covered by earlier IQWiG reviews of this topic. Five of the 9 new trials involved NPWT systems that are not on the market. The frequency of complete wound closure is stated in only 5 of the 9 new reports; a statistically significant effect in favor of NPWT was found in only two tri- als.The results of 8 of the 9 new trials are ha rd to interpret, both because of apparent bias and because diverse types of wounds were treated. Conclusion Although there may be a positive e ffect of NPWT, we did not find clear evidence that wounds heal any better or wo rse with NPWT than with conventional treatment. Good RCTs are still needed to evaluate NPWT. 145 Introduction Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a sealed wound-care system and is par- ticularly indicated for large chronic persist ent wounds and acute complicated wounds [1, 2]. The system consists of an electronically controlled pump and a foam dressing that drains the wound. An adjustable negative pressure is applied via an airtight adhe- sive film that covers the wound. NPWT drains wound exudate and is thought to pro- mote blood circulation and healing. This systematic review aims to update th e systematic reviews on NPWT previously published by the Institute for Quality and Effici ency in Health Care (Institut f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4t und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen, IQWiG) [3-5]. The aim of these reports was to evaluate wound healing and adverse events following NPWT in comparison to conventional treatment in patients with acute or chronic wounds. Methods The reports within this systematic review were compiled in accordance with the prin- ciples of the PRISMA statement [e1]. Inclusion criteria The research included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with acute and chronic wounds. Because of the increasing number of RCTs conducted in recent years, non-randomized trials were not incl uded in the evaluation. The intervention under examination was NPWT. As in the previous reports, studies of systems not commercially available were included in additi on to commercially available systems. In the systems that were not commercially availa ble, negative pressure was generated by a suction pump for chest drainage, a central vacuum system or Redon bottles, for ex- ample. The comparator treatment was conventional dressings, generally saline-soaked gauze dressings. There was no minimum number of patients per trial. There was no restriction on language or year of publication. However, articles in languages other than English or German were only included in the review if there were translations available that made it possible to assess the trials concerned. Search strategy Unlike the earlier IQWiG reports, this review included only RCTs [3, 4]. The simplified search strategy used (eTable 1) identified all 12 RCTs alre ady included in PubMed and the Cochrane Library's Clinical Trials on No vember 7, 2010. EMBASE and CINAHL were not searched, as they had not yielded any additional relevant results in previous 146 searches [6]. The search results from the two included databases were imported into EndNote X3 (Thomson Reuters) and duplicates were deleted manually. The trial registers ClinicalTria ls.gov (URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov/; regis- tration numbers: NCT and the International Standard Ran- domised ISRCTN followed by eight digits) were searched for completed and ongo- ing trials on January 15, 2011, using the fo llowing search terms: therapy\"; \"npwt\". Study selection First of all, articles were excluded on the basis of their title and abstract if these did not mention NPWT or it was clear that the trials were not randomized. The full text of the remaining articles was then examined. The reasons for excluding each individual study were recorded internally. All stages of st udy selection were performed independently by two separate individuals. Differences of opinion were discussed until a common decision could be made. Potential for bias The risk of bias within trials was examined using the criteria stated in Table 1. A positive answer in all five categories was es tablished at the outset as indicating a low potential for bias. The potential effect of publication bias was assessed by updating a previous study [6] identifying all the trials that were terminated early. Data collection and analysis All stages of data extraction were performed by one person and checked by another. Where there were differences of opinion, consensus was reached following discussion. The results were subjected to descriptive analysis. Study characteristics were extracted as shown in Table 2. Complete wound closure, a variable used both as raw data and as a Kaplan-Meier estimator, was the primary endpoint. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 2006 Guidance for Industry [7] defines comp lete wound closure as \"skin closure with- out drainage or dressing requirements\". No meta-analysis was performed, as the pri- mary trials were highly heterogenous. The following dependent variables were used as secondary endpoints: - Adverse events, such as: - Death - Secondary amputations - Fistula formation - Wound infection - Time to complete wound closure - Reduction in wound size - Health-related quality of life Table 1.

In 137 cases it was clear from the title and/or abstract that the article did not meet the inclusion criteria (eFigure; online at doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2011.0381). A further 30 potentially relevant articles were excluded after they had been read in full. A total of nine new RCTs were identified in the updated search [8-16]. Five of the nine new RCTs examined systems that were not commercially available [12-16]. This left a total of 21 RCTs available for our research: seven [e2-e8] from IQWiG's Final Report N04-03 [3], f i v e R C T s i n f o u r a r t i c l e s [ e 9 - e 1 2 ] f r o m IQWiG's Rapid Report N06-02 [4], and nine RCTs from the updated search. Underlying data An overview of trial characteristics is provid ed in Table 2. The mean age of the partici- pants, most of whom were male, was genera lly over 50. The mean wound surface area was numerically slightly greater in interventi on groups than in co ntrol groups in all trials in which this information was given sepa rately. Detailed descriptions of inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatments under research, comparator treatments, analyzed endpoints, and their definitions can be found in eTables 2 and 3 (online at doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2011.0381). In most trials comorbidities were not reported. The trials examined many different types of acute and chronic wound (eTable 4; online at doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2011.0381). Potential for bias Eight of the nine trials had a high potential for bias (Table 1). The conditions for gener- ating randomization sequences and treatment blinding were unclear in some trials, with the result that random allocation of patients to treatment groups was not tracea- ble in these trials. In eight of the nine trials it was not reported or not clear that end- points had been measured in blinded condit ions, although this was feasible. It should be stressed that quality-of-life results from non-blinded trials are prone to a particular- ly high potential for bias. Only one of the tr ials met all five criteria for low potential for bias. In six of the nine new trials, up to 20% of the data from randomized patients were not included in the evaluation, and there was thus no appropriate intention-to-treat analysis. Investigation of publication bias revealed a further four RCTs that had been termi- nated early, in addition to the five that had already been reported on: NCT00121537, NCT00691821, NCT00837096, and NCT01108276. 149 150 The following reasons were given for terminating trials early: - Inclusion criteria not met - Patient withdrawal - Low recruitment levels - Changes in clinical practice - Errors in study planning Eight ongoing RCTs were also identified among the registered trials NCT01200563, NCT01191567, NCT00548314, and NCT00789659). Primary endpoint The proportion of patients with complete wound closure was reported in only five of the nine new trials [8, 12-15] (Table 3). In four trials the difference between groups was statistically insignificant. Only two trials showed a statist ically significant effect in favor of NPWT [15]. Secondary endpoints Time to wound closure was reported in four of the nine new trials [8, 13, 14, 16] (Table 4). Three trials showed a statistically signifi cant difference between groups in favor of NPWT [8, 14, 16], and in one trial the differ ence was statistically insignificant [13]. There was a statistically significant differenc e in reduction in wound size in favor of NPWT in one of the nine new trials [8]. Adverse events were investigated in eigh t of the nine new trials [8, 9, 11, 12]. Sta- tistically significant differences in favor of NPWT were reported in three trials. The adverse events concerned were secondary amputations [8], the proportion of patients with deep wound infections [11], and the secondary surgery rate [14]. Differences in mortality rates between trea tment groups were statistically insignifi- cant [8, 12, 15, 16]. This was also the case for most of the wound complication rates in four trials [8, 9, 12, 13]. One trial investigated health-related qua lity of life, using questionnaires [11]. The results for the physical comp onent (following treatment) were better in the NPWT group, and the difference was statistically significant. For the mental component, meanwhile, the results were comparable. Another trial revealed more fear of treatment, e.g. due to possible pain, in the NPWT group than in the control group, and the difference was stat istically significant [10]. Table 3.

Effects in favor of NPWT were reported in some trials, and no opposing effects could be detected in other trials. As a result, other systematic reviews also cu rrently conclude that an additional benefit of NPWT in comparison to other types of wound treatment has not been proved [17, 18]. Secondary endpoints Time to wound closure: In terms of the endpoint \"time to wound closure,\" effects in favor of NPWT groups were reported in most cases. However, there were considerable differences between trials in terms of the methods used to measure and evaluate wound closure; particularly problematic is the fact that no blinding was used when this endpoint was measured. In addition, most trials did not investigate whether wounds that had healed successfully actually remain ed closed in the longer term. The results thus cannot be interpreted as showing defi nitively that any one treatment is superior. Adverse events: The results on adverse events were not homogenous. For some specific complications, such as secondary amputations, statistically significant effects in favor of NPWT groups were reported, but for a number of other adverse events no statistically significant difference was detect ed. No opposing results, i.e. statistically significant effects in favor of comparator groups, were recorded. The difference between the number of patients included in trials and the number of patients treated worldwide is particularly striking when describing adverse effects. Data from the RCTs are of only limited us e in evaluating the frequency of adverse events. It would be more appropriate if suff iciently large-scale RC Ts were conducted. The FDA recently issued a report on six deaths and 77 other complications that were reported within a two-year period in connection with NPWT [19]. All the deaths were caused by acute hemorrhages, and known contraindications for NPWT (e.g. a large blood vessel exposed) had clearly been overlooked. Many of the deaths occurred in outpatient care or care ho mes, which highlights the need to monitor therapy. In this regard, it should be noted that trials of NP WT were generally conducted in hospitals. Potential for bias Of the nine included RCTs, eight have a high potential for bias. This limits the value of the results on the endpoints reported on. The difficulties of co nducting RCTs and the 156 arguments for and against including non-randomized trials when assessing medical devices and surgeries have been extensively described [e13, e14]. Heterogeneity Strikingly, almost all the trials of commercially available NPWT systems were conduct- ed in the USA. It seems that in developi ng countries the commercially available sys- tems are very difficult to afford, and as a result such countries have developed their own NPWT systems, sometimes from very simple materials. Trials of these are now being conducted. This wide variety of NP WT systems makes the data considerably more difficult to interpret, although it is still largely unclear whether or not there are genuine differences between commercially av ailable NPWT systems and those that are not commercially available. Also, the treatments administered to comparator groups (conventional dressings) were defined in different ways in different trials, probably as a result of differences between patient populations. This too can cause heterogeneity between trials and so limit the comparability of trial results. Publication bias According to the website of manufacturer KCI (August 2010), NPWT has been pre- scribed to more than 3 millio n patients, and some 600 pe er-reviewed articles have been published on the subject. This and the low total number of RCTs make it astonish- ing that despite the frequency of acute and chronic wounds and the widespread use of NPWT a considerable number of trials have apparently had to be terminated due to recruitment problems. Although it seems that some planned RCTs had not even been started or were terminated soon after they began, the fact that there are RCTs on which nothing has been published casts doubt on the completeness of the data availa- ble for assessment of the benefits of NPWT. Summary Pool of trials As the wounds for which NPWT is used vary greatly in their etiology, chronicity, size, and location, there is considerable variation between trials in the selection and defini- tion of endpoints. This alone makes a quantit ative summary of all trials of questionable value. In trials that provide results on wound healing, these result s are mostly favora- ble for NPWT. These results are partly supported by statistically significant effects regarding the primary endpoint \"complet e wound closure\" and the secondary end-157 points \"time to complete wound closure\", \"reduction in wound size\", and \"amputa- tions\". The results on overall mortality and tota l adverse events are inconsistent. A con- siderable proportion of the total deaths were probably not caused by treatment. Indi- vidual adverse events are reported too infre quently and inconsiste ntly for conclusions to be drawn. Also, the group of adverse events as a whole is highly heterogenous. Some of the few results on quality of life are limited to the endpoint \"fear\" alone. Only a few trials investigated pain (in part icular when dressings were changed). The available pool of only 21 RCTs rema ins too small to provide a clear answer to the question of whether or not NPWT is supe rior to conventional wound treatment. The difficulty of interpreting the RCTs is caus ed essentially by the heterogeneity of the various indications for NPWT on the one ha nd, and the considerable qualitative and quantitative shortcomings of the trials on the other. Outlook Germany's statutory health insurers jointly invited tenders for two RCTs on NPWT in July 2010 [20, e15]. Patients with diabetic foot ulcers or iatrogenic wounds must be randomized to receive NPWT or convention al wound treatment, and patient numbers must be sufficient in each treatment group and for each indication. It is hoped that these trials will provide the further evidence needed for a decision on NPWT to be made. Eight other ongoing register ed RCTs were also identified. Conclusion Although NPWT may have a positive effect on wound healing, there is no proof that it is either superior or inferior to convention al wound treatment. Further RCTs of good methodological quality are required. LC, Morykwas MJ. Vacu um-assisted closure: a new method for wound control and treatment: clinical experience.

Development of an algorithm to provide awareness in choos- ing study designs for inclusion in systematic reviews of health care interventions - a method study. 162 Abstract Objectives We developed an algorithm that aims to provide guidance and aware- ness for various design character istics suitable to answer dist inct research questions in health care interventions. Design In a method study, we tranferred in formation from electronic databases and major institutional handbooks into a non-systematic review. Based on the re- trieved data, we developed an algorithm to provide guidance for allocating various study designs to specif ic research questions. Setting There were no limits on the level of care and the geographical location. Participants There were no limits on the type of diagnosis and the characteristics of patients. Interventions There were no limits on the type of medical treatment or public health intervention. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the devel- opment of an algorithm that incorporates the length of follow up (long, short), the frequency of events (rare, frequent), the ty pes of outcome (death, disease, discomfort, disability, dissatisfaction), co nsiders practical or ethical co ncerns, and unavailable best evidence. The secondary outcome was to show the usefulness of the algorithm while applying it to selected systematic reviews. Results We developed a guidance-support tree and provided examples for explain- ing the critical guidance points and for te sting the usefulness of the algorithm. We could follow and confirm the appropriateness of the pathways for all described exam- ples of four selected systematic reviews. The algorithm cannot be applied without the consideration of disease-specific circ umstances and aims of interventions. Conclusions We are confident that the algorithm can assist to bring seminal fea- tures of a systematic review to the attention of anyone who is planning to conduct a systematic review. It aims to provide awareness not regulation. We think that it may reduce the time burden on review authors and may contribute to the production of a higher quality review. Strengths and limitations of this study - We developed an algorithm to provide guidance for allocating various study de- signs to specific research questions. This ca n be viewed as a response to the lack of comprehensive guidance in major published meth ods documents. - The terms used for defining the critical de cision points of the algorithm, such as short versus long follow-up and rare versus frequent events need to be interpreted in the context of the disease and may be unclear and not useful if used as general terms. 163 - Disease-specific circumstances and aims of interventions always have to be taken into account during application of the algorithm. - We could follow and confirm the appropriateness of the pathways during the ap- plication of the algorithm on four selected systematic reviews. - The testing was conducted retrospectively with systematic reviews that were al- ready completed. This approach is far from the everyday working condition and the approach may be considerably biased by the expectations of the authors.

Some designs have features, which prefera- bly match the requirements of specific parts of a research question. Exclusively using data from randomised trials (RCTs) to eval uate whether an intervention might work has a number of limitations [1]. For example, RCTs may not be appopropriate to esti- mate the incidence of rare (adverse) events. Study designs that incorporate the data of a large number of participants of interest such as case control studies, case series, registry analyses, or cross-sectional analys es may complement the information on such rare, but important events. We have gather ed some examples of research questions that cannot or only with great difficulty be in vestigated in RCTs (Table S1). A practical concern may arise with low numbers of patients with a rare disease. It might be diffi- cult to conduct an RCT to evaluate patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia. An ethical concern may arise with the treatmen t of severe diseases or life-threatening treatments. It might be obsolete to conduct an RCT to evaluate a new experimental treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. The methods of conducting systematic reviews of health care interventions are major components of 'evidence-based' medicine (EBM). In 2000, Sackett et al. defined EBM as the integration of 'best' research evidence with individual clinical expertise, patient values and expectations, and 'best' ex ternal research evidence [2]. This defini- tion may be visualized by three overlapping circles in a Venn diagram [3]. The area of intersection, where all three different reso urces meet, should represent the EBM. To classify more valid and less valid information, the 'levels of evidence' specify a hierar- chical order for various research designs based on their internal validity. The highest level of valid data, that is, the 'best' evidence, however, is not always available. In Ta- ble S2, we present the classification of so me of the major study designs for intended effects of therapy. There appears to be some variation in the hierarchy among some authors and institutions issuing 'evidence-based' guidelines or systematic reviews. All authors agree that RCTs have the highest 'lev el of evidence' with respect to minimising the risk of bias. The prospective nonrandom ised controlled clinical trial (CCT) has an experimental design and its internal validit y should be regarded lower than a random- ised trial but higher than an observationa l study. Prospective cohort studies have a potential for a lower risk of bias than retrospective cohort studies because they have lower risk of recall bias and confounding [4]. In cohort studies groups are defined by exposure whereas in case-control studies gr oups are defined by outcome status. Both points are acknowledged in the 'hiearchy of evidence' by some but not all authors. Case series and case reports are descriptions of one or more individual cases. Some authors combine both designs in one category while others place case series a higher level. Table S1. Research questions that cannot or that can on ly with difficulty be investigated in RCTs. Topic Reason Research questions that in certain circ umstances cannot be investigated in RCTs Life-threatening intervention, for example, in tervention with high early treatment-related mortality. Allocation to intervention group endangers life. Certain second-line interventions reserved for refr actory patients that did not respond to first- line standard therapy Ultimo ratio and therefore no control group by definition. Example: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation from unrelated versus related donor s for patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia Pregnant women Ethical concerns aga inst inclusion in experiments. Infants Ethical concerns against inclusion in experiments. Interventions that have been shown to produce a dramatic effec t. The magnitude of benefit of one particular intervention such a s insulin to treat diabetes mellitus would render any intervention a neglect of health care if insulin would be omitted unless the new treatment does also has a dramatic effect. Lack of consent to participate. Cheating persons is not legal Studies that do not comply with the Declaration of Helsinki. The set of ethical principles regarding human experimentation is r egarded as the cornerstone document of human research ethics. Research questions that can with difficulty be investigated in RCTs Rare adverse events and other rare safety outcomes Number of study participants is too low Allocation of alternative interventions is dominated by patient s' preferences Treatment group is chosen by a patient because of specific expectations of effectiveness, adverse events, or health-related quality of life. 165 Table S2.

Examples of distinguishing study characteristics are the concurrent vs. the historical control group or the participants being or not being allocated to the treatment groups by the investigator. Within group comparison has also been referred to as a before and after study in a previous CRD report. Methods The aim of this paper is to develop an algori thm as a guidance to choose study designs that are most appropriate to answer variou s health care questions and to guide sys- tematic reviewers in considering multiple study designs for evaluation of the many facets of health care interventions. We se arched the internet sites of not-for-profit publishers of systematic reviews and health technology assessments of health care interventions to identify pub lished guidelines on the topic. We developed an algorithm as a guidance for choosing appropriate stud y design using the following decision points (Figure 2): length of follow up (long, short), frequency of events (rare, frequent), types of outcome (death, disease, discomfort, disability, dissatisfaction), and practical or ethical concerns. These decision points foll ow implicitly when considering the main characteristics of frequently used different study designs. E.g. cohort studies are done when randomisation is not practical or ethical, case-control studies are done when cohort studies are not practical due to low frequency of outcomes. Studies without control groups may be done when a disease is extremely rare, or for certain outcomes such as dissatisfaction or for assessing compliance. 169 Figure 1.

The terms short vs. long are relative depend ing on the disease, intervention and out- come of interest. We list some examples wi th a cut-off between short and long follow up that ranges from 30 days to 5 years (Tab le S3). The disease may be invasive, severe and fast progressing and a short follow up ma y capture the majority of the events of interest. Symptoms may aggravate a long time period after the onset of some diseases and a long follow-up is necessary to observe events. A long follow-up is also required if events occur distributed over a wide time range. The intervention of interest might have an instantaneous impact on the patien ts' well-being such as dextrose given to a patient in hypoglycemic coma or acute ca rdioversion and defibr illation in a patient with malignant arrhythmia that can occur after a heart attack. The effects of these events can be detected within a short obse rvation period. Some patients receive life- long medicinal therapies that are inte nded to prevent the appearance of life- threatening symptoms of an underlying disease. In this situation, a long observation will be required to detect a number of bene ficial or adverse events sufficient for com- paring a test with a control intervention. Frequency of events The condition of interest may be rare and hard to encounter at all and may require specific study designs that allow to observing patients with these rare diseases to col- lect sufficient data for analysis and to draw conclusions supported by the data. A rare disease may be defined according to the Offi ce of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR): \"In the United States, a rare disease is generally considered to be a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 people. There are more th an 6,800 rare diseases. Altogether, rare diseases affect an estimated 25 million to 30 million Americans.\" [8]. Disease-specific 171 172 registration of patients may provide information about the number and characteristics of patients that are in need of health care. Multicentre studies may need the infor- mation gathered by these registers and ma y arrange a treatment regimen of interest applicable to all participan ts. An example might be the German neuroblastoma study group [9]. A total of 96% of all German pa tients registered at the German childhood cancer registry with a specific type of neuroblastoma entered one of the trials. Ran- domization may be possible to compare tw o different chemotherapeutic substances but may not be feasible to investigate some other questions. In a retrospective analy- sis, the investigators found that spontaneou s regression is regularly seen in infants with localized neuroblastoma and is not limited to the first year of life and that a wait- and-see strategy is justified in those patien ts [10]. Adverse events after the start of treatment may be rare and can be serious. The number of observed randomized pa- tients may not be sufficient to detect a re presentative number of events. An observa- tion of a large number of patients in single-arm studies or the reco gnition of selected case reports may provide information abou t serious drawbacks of a promising treat- ment. The terms rare vs. frequent events are relative depending on the disease, inter- vention and outcome of intere st. We list some examples with a cut-off between rare and frequent events in Table S4. Types of outcomes We classified the outcomes according to Fl etcher 2005 into the 5 groups of death, disease, discomfort, disability, and dissatisfaction (Table S5) [11]. In case of short fol- low-up and rare events and regarding all types of outcome, data of a large number of participants may be needed to estimate a re alistic event rate (Figure 1; Table 1). Thus, prospectively designed RCT or CCT may not be appropriate because they usually re- cruit a limited number of participants. In ca se of long follow-up and rare events, this might similarly be true for the outcomes death and disease, which might be studied in observational studies that include large num bers of participants including registry analyses (Figure 1; Table 1). Discomfort, disability, and dissatisfaction may be subjec- tive outcomes and may be reported only by participants. These outcomes should be measured with the highest possible validity a nd should be studied in RCTs to prevent a potential high risk of confounding. Alternatively, they might be studied in case control studies nested within prospective cohort studies to retrieve data from a large popula- tion. In case of short follow-up and frequent events, disease should be evaluated in trials with a high internal validity including prospectively design randomised and non- randomised controlled trials (Figure 1; Table 1). Due to the frequent number of events, a realistic event rate can be achieved, thou gh the number of participants may be lim- ited. It might not be appropriate to randomly allocate participants to treatment groups if death occurs frequently primarily in one of the groups. Again, discomfort, disability, and dissatisfaction should be measured wi th the highest possible validity and should 173 be studied only in RCTs. In case of long follow-up and frequent events regarding all outcomes, there is no reason to include othe r study designs than RCTs or alternatively CCTs, if RCTs are not available (Figure 1; Table 1). The RCT is appropriate because of its highest possible validity and a number of events, which can be expected to be suffi- cient high to enable a realistic rate. Study design labels After deciding whether the follow-up is short or long and after deciding whether the event is rare or frequent, one or several appropriate study designs are recommended. We used the following study design labels: RC T, CCT, nested case-control study, cohort study, case-control study, case series, case report, and registry analysis. We provided a description and classification of these and other possible study design labels in Table S2. The prospective design may be considered on two separate levels. This first level concerns the prospective direction of studying the exposure and outcome relationship, which can be call prospective in any RCT, CCT or cohort study (and retrospective in a case control study). The seco nd level of prospective design of any study predefines the timing of the data collection. If data were collected in the past or from the past, the study would be considered retrospective (e.g. a retrospective cohort study), if data are collected in the present or future, the stud y would be considered prospective. It is always important to be explicit which leve l is meant when talking about prospective or retrospective study features to avoid confu sions. Some health interventions are diffi- cult to randomize because they are implemented at a regional-level rather than at a facility- or patient-level. Therefore, it is important to consider multiple study designs including CCT or other nonrandomized study designs for these types of interventions [12]. Practical or ethical concerns Practical or ethical concerns may emerge as reasons to override the earlier decisions or to switch to a more appropriate study design. Therefore, we remind the reader at the bottom of the Figure 2 to reconsider the chosen path. Some study designs may be more suited for answering specific research questions than others. However, availabil- ity of high-quality evidence can only be de termined by searching for it. It does not seem like a sound strategy to apply an algori thm that excludes RCTs from consideration because of ex ante assumptions that relevant RCTs may not exist. Therefore, the practi- cal and ethical concerns provide a flexible handling of the algorithm if required. We pro- vide some examples that follow the outlined structure of the algorithm in Table S6.

We wanted to reproduce the process of deciding what study design would best fit the respective conditions, treatm ents, and patient centered endpoints. We wanted to practice the pathways of the algorithm and to test whether it works for the selected systematic reviews. Thus, the algo rithm has been tested on them. The infor- mation on the PICOTS-SD frame regarding each systematic review is shown in Table 2. We introduced the main topics of each systematic review and discussed whether the algorithm was helpful in choosing the best study designs. We reflected on potential advantages and disadvantages of various study designs in each example. Figure 3 is modified from Figure 2 to delineate the path ways of 6 examples described in detail in the results chapter without altering th e basic structure of the algorithm. Results Statements on research design We looked at a sample of 12 high profile not-for-profit publishers of systematic re- views and health technology assessments of health care interventions, detailed in Table 3. Of those, 10 have published guid ance about their meth odological procedure for preparing the systematic reviews [5-7,13- 19]. A range of other books or guidance documents on systematic reviews exist [20- 25]. We extracted the major statements of their methods guidance with respect to ch oosing the appropriate research design in Table S7. We did not identify an algorith m or a comprehensive guidance focussing on finding the appropriate research design in any of these methods guidance documents. Algorithm to find the appropriate research design We propose an algorithm, which is shown in Figure 2. The algorithm has four decision points. First, it should be decided whether the follow-up is regarded as short or long. Second, it should be decided whether the events of interest are regarded as rare or frequent. Third, the outcome of interest needs to be considered. Fourth, the appropri- ate study design will be assigned. In addition , it should be considered whether it is justified to stay with the chosen study design s or whether it is warranted to switch the study design depending on possible practical and/or ethical reasons. We provide vari- ous specific examples for all outcome catego ries and want to show in detail in what way these outcomes depend on the length of follow up and the frequency of events (Table 1). 177 Table 2.

Major statements in manuals or articles about choosing study designs in systematic reviews ID [Reference] Major statements Institutions AHRQ 2009 [13] Inclusion and exclusion criter ia for studies to be used in the review are determined based on the specific quest ions to be addressed. Criteria may vary for each question in the review. Key Questions Does any single NPWT system or any component of a NPWT system have a substantial therapeutic distinction in terms of wound heal ing outcomes compared to any other NPWT system or any other similar component of a NPWT system for the treatment of acute or chronic wounds? Do patients being treated with one NPWT system have a substantial therapeutic distinction in terms of less pain, bleeding, infe ction, other complicati ons, or mortality than other NPWT systems? What are the reported occurrences of pain, bleeding, infection, other complications, and mortality for NPWT systems? Inclusion Criteria: Study Design: For Key Question 1 and 2, st udy must have been a controlled study comparing one NPWT system o r components of a system to another NPWT system or components. Randomization to a NPWT system group was not required. For Key Question 3, no control group was required, because the focus of the question was simply to identify adverse events rather than compare rates across systems or components. However, because of the potential for bias in case series studies, no analyses were performed using adver se event data from these studies. ASERNIP-S [14] Interpretation of assessments should take into c onsideration the likely robustness of the evidence, as indicated by the type of study design CADTH 2003 [15] If only a limited number of poor quality RCTs can be identified, other st udy designs can be considered. In some cases, even if RCTs are available, studies of other types should be reviewed by the authors, e.g. to identify long-term effectiveness and/or rare or long-term adverse effects. CEBM 2014 [5] The type of study can generally be worked at by looking at three issues: What was the aim of the study, descriptive or analytic? If analytic, was the intervention randomly allocated? Yes: RCT; No: Observational study. If observational, when were the outcomes determined? After the exposur e: prospective (typically cohort study); at the same time as the exposure: cross sectional study; before the exposure: retrospective (typically case-control study). 181 ID [Reference] Major statements Cochrane 2011 [16] Randomization is the only way to prevent systematic differences between baseline characteristics of participa nts in different intervention groups in terms of both known and unknown (or unmeasured) confounders. For some Cochrane reviews, the question of interest cannot be answered by randomized trials, and review authors may be justifie d in including non-randomized studies. Non-randomized studies (NRS) are defined here as any quantitative study estimating the effectiveness of an intervention (harm o r benefit) that does not use randomization to allocate units to comparison groups. There are three main reasons for in cluding NRS in a Cochrane review: To examine the case for undertaking a randomized trial by providi ng an explicit evaluation of the weaknesses of available NRS To provide evidence of the effects (benefit or harm) of interventions that cannot be randomized, or which are extremely unlikel y to be studied in randomized trials. To provide evidence of effects (benefit or harm) that cannot be adequately studied in randomized trials, such as long-term and rare outcomes Key issues about the inclusion of non-randomized studies in a Cochrane review Susceptibility to selection bias (understood in this Handbook to mean differences in the baseline charac teristics of individual s in different intervention groups. Confounding occurs when selection bias give s rise to imbalances between intervention and control groups (or case and control gr oups in case-control studies) on prognostic factors, i.e. the distributions of the factors differ between groups AND the factors are associated with outcome. Determining which of non-randomized study designs to include (C hapter 13.2.1.3 of the Cochrane handbook): The diversity of NRS designs raises two related questions. First, should all NRS designs of a particular effectiveness ques tion be included in a review? Second, if review authors do not include all NRS designs, what criteria should be used to decide which study designs to include and which to exclude? CRD 2009 [7] Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled trials for the objective to assess the clinical effectiveness o f treatments. If information from controlled trials is not available, cohort studies are eligib le for inclusion provided that data from a comparison group are reported. In some cases a range of study designs may be needed to address diffe rent questions within the same review. For example, a review seeking to include information on adverse events will often include case-contro l and/or case-series whilst a review incorporating partici pants' experiences of an intervention is likely to include qualitative studies. In cases where it is unworkable or unethical to randomise par ticipants (e.g. when evaluating the effects of smoking on health), researchers may instead have to use a quasi- experimental or an ob servational design. HAS 2007 [17] Literature search and analysis of scientific data. A level of scientific evidence (HAS grading scheme) is allocat ed to each study.

MRC 2008 [19] There are many study designs to choose from, and di fferent designs suit different questions and different circums tances.45 Awareness of the whole range of experimental and non-experimental approaches should lead to more appropriate methodological choices. You should always consider randomizatio n when assessing effectiveness. An experimental approach may not be feasible or randomization may be unnecessary and other designs preferable. Examples where non- randomised designs have been used successfully: to ban smoking in public places, for studying rare adverse events, to evaluate the impact on the incidence of sud den infant deaths using case-control methods. MSAC No handbook found NICE 2013 [6] RCTs directly comparing the te chnology under appraisal with relevant com parators provide the most valid evidence of relative efficacy. However, such evidence may not always be available and may not be sufficient to quantify the effect of treatment over the course of the disease. Therefore, da ta from non-randomised studies may be required to supplement RCT data. Any potent ial bias arising from the design of the studies used in the assessment should be exp lored and documented. OHTAC No handbook found Authors Black 1996 [20] The view is widely held t hat experimental methods (randomised controlled trials) are the \"gold standard\" for ev aluation and that observational methods (cohort and case control studies) have little or no value. This ignores the lim itations of randomized trials, which may prove unnecessary, inapp ropriate, impossibl e, or inadequate. Deeks 2003 [21] There must be hundreds of examples of intervent ions for which RCTs would be possible but have not yet been carried out, leaving the medical and policy community to rely on nonrandomised evidence. It is therefore essential to have an understanding of the biases that may influence non-randomised s tudies. 183 ID [Reference] Major statements Egger 2006 [22] Etiological hypothesis, however, cannot generally be tested in randomized experiments. Due to the limited size of such trials, less common adverse effects of drugs may only be detected in case-control studies, or in analyses of databases from postm arketing surveillance schemes. Also, because fo llow-up is generally limited, adverse effects occurring later will not be identified. Women, the elderly, and minority ethnic groups are oft en excluded from randomized trial s. Similarly, the university hospital typically participating in clinical trials differ from the settings where most patient s are treated. Finally, both patient and therapist preferences may preclude a randomized controlled experiment. Example: ingesting your own ur ine. Even if adjustments for confounding factors have been made in the analysis, resi dual confounding remains a potentially serious problem in observational research. It is well known that people from le ss favourable social circ umstances are more like ly to be non-responders in studies evaluating patient-reported outcomes. The thorough cons ideration of possible sour ces of heterogeneity between observational study results will provide more insights than the mechanistic calculation of an overall measure of effect, which may often be biased. That different recall of past exposures may introduce bias. Sensitivity analysis is important to test the st ability of findings across different study designs, different approaches to exposure ascertainment and to selection of study participants. Guyatt 2005 [23] Randomized controlled trials to assess treatment. Observational studies to assess harm. Ideally, we would also look to randomized trials to address issues of harm. However, for many potentially harmful exposures, ra ndomly allocating patients is neither practical nor ethical. For instance, one could not suggest to potential study participants that an investigator will decide by the flip o f a coin whether or not they smoke during the next 20 years or whether they will be exposed to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. For exposures lik e smoking and r adiation, t he best one can do is identify studies in which personal choice, or happenstance, determines whether people are exposed or not exposed. Khan 2011 [24] Some reviewers consider cert ain study designs to be superior because they feel that the design has an inherent value in itself. For example, they may focus exclusively on randomized studies when conducting reviews. Such a view ignores the fact that addre ssing different types of questions may requi re the use of different study designs. Assessment of long-term or rare outcomes, particularly when examining the safety of interventions, would be more suited to an o bservational design, not an experimental study. RCTs may be unethical. There may be the case that no RCT has been published. Educational intervent ions are often studied using a range of designs. It is improbable that rare harmful outcomes are detected by RCTs. Reeves 2005 [25] Sources of bias in diff erent study designs should be accounted for. Systematic reviews of NRS may be helpful i n three situations. Abbreviation. ID: Identifier; further abbreviations see Table 3 182 Testing the usefulness of the algorithm Example 1: Non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas The PICOTS-SD frame and the respective refe rences associated with the systematic review on autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT) following tissue sarcomas (NRS TS) are shown in Table 2. In the first version of this systematic review, we assumed a long follow-up and fre- quent events regarding death by disease or complication: NRSTS in Figure 3 [26]. Thus, an RCT would be the best choice for all outcomes. We evaluated patients with a rare disease of interest that are treated ra rely with the intervention of interest. The disease is a malignant tumor and treatment of cancer may frequently be followed up to allow estimation of the 5-year overall survival. Many authors recommended the conducting of RCTs as a requirement for the decision whether HDCT followed by au- toHSCT results in a better survival than standard-dose chemotherapy (SDCT). In the first version of the Cochrane review, we did not find any RCT and we did not find any comparative study [26]. We identified only single-arm studies including a few case series and a lot of individual case data. We decided to include any study design with primary patient data to provide an overview of the available evidence. We were able to estimate overall survival and to descri be adverse events. We were unable to draw conclusions on the benefit of the intervention of interest. We conducted an update 2.5 years after the first version was published and identified a single RCT [27]. There was consensus among the reviewers that we should restrict the study design to RCTs only in a future update under the condition that at least two RCTs are available for evalua- tion. Although the algorithm would have guided us to initially use RCTs, we switched to include observational data in the first ver sion because RCTs were lacking completely. This represents an example of the principle of 'best' available evidence that we de- scribed in the preceding section. We had to downgrade the 'levels of evidence' to find and include data matching the prespecified PICOTS-SD frame. Using different study types provided advantages such as the presention of data from other sources on over- all survival after realizing that RCTs were no t available in the first version. The update showed that we could present data on adverse events beyond the scope of an RCT. We brought to public attention that RCTs were requested for a long time and by many authors and we published the message that a meaningful de cision on the usefulness of the intervention of interest might be im peded until RCTs are available. We were astounded when we identified an RCT dur ing the search for the update. Thus, the presentation of a lack of quality studies mi ght have fostered the conduction of a long desired study. Otherwise, it was not possible to estimate the effect of the intervention of interest because single-arm studies do not provide data that allow comparison be- tween two different interventions. We tried to estimate overall survival from pooled individual data, which created a considerable heterogeneity not to mention the very 185 186 high risk of bias. We pooled different subtypes, which may have diverse courses of disease. The pooled cases were treated in different hospitals and countries and the variation in treatment condition was presumab ly very large. We th ink that the absence of study data was the cause for the inabilit y to draw conclusions but not the use of different study types. We conducted anothe r systematic review addressing the similar PICOTS-SD items but concentrated on meta static rhabdomyosarco ma, the single soft tissue sarcoma entity excluded by the NRSTS review [28]. Again, the algorithm would have guided us to initially use RCTs but we switched to include observational data because RCTs were again lacking completely. Example 2: Acquried severe aplastic anaemia The PICOTS-SD frame and the respective refe rences associated with the systematic review on allogeneic haematopoietic st em cell transplantation (alloHSCT) from matched sibling donors (MSD) versus immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) are shown in Table 2. In this systematic review, we assumed a long follow-up and frequent events regarding death by disease or complication: SAA in Figure 3 [29]. Thus, an RCT would be the best choice for all outcomes. We evaluated patients with a rare disease of interest that are treated fre- quently with the intervention of interest . The disease is acquired severe aplastic anaemia caused by an autodestructive acti on against bone marrow stem cells. Immu- nosuppressive therapy interferes with selfdestruction but some patients may be re- fractory and long-term treatment may result in secondary malignancies. Allogeneic stem cell transplants from HLA-matched siblin g donors is potentially curative opposed to IST and may have a favorable survival compared to IST. We did not find any RCT. We subsequently included any comparative study. We tried to lower the risk of bias by restricting the inclusion criteria to studies that were prospective, that met the re- quirements of 'Mendelian randomization', and that were confined to HLA-mached sibling donors [30]. Three studies were left for the evaluation. Unfortunately, the ex- tracted data were generated more than 10 years ago and hardly applicable to the current medical care status. Although the al gorithm would have guided us to initially use RCTs, we switched to include prospect ive nonrandomized controlled trials that met the criteria for 'Mendelian randomization' because RCTs were lacking completely. A consideral proportion of patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia do not re- spond to immunosuppressive therapy and th ey have neither an HLA-matched sibling donor nor an HLA-matched related donor. The only treatment alternative left is to offer transplantation from an unrelated donor, preferably with a matched HLA status. The inherent practical concern may limit expectations of a control treatment. In our systematic review, we identified, as expect ed, only single-arm studies [31]. Neverthe- less, we were able to quantitatively pool the data and specify estimated survival and adverse effects. Using different study types provided advantages such as the presen- tion of data from a lot of other comparativ e studies on overall survival after realizing 187 that RCTs were not available in the first version. These studies presented a large num- ber of factors that may have influenced the course of the disease, for example age of participants and year of transplantation. We analysed the data qualitatively. The varie- ty of those factors and also the data on adverse events may have been beyond the scope of an RCT. It was possible to estimate the effect of the intervention of interest and put them in context to reports published by others. However, high risk of bias due to the nonrandomized study design limited validity and high level of heterogeneity limited applicability of the study results considerably. Example 3: Localized prostate cancer The PICOTS-SD frame and the respective refe rences associated with the systematic review on permanent interstitial low-dose-r ate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) versus radical prostatectomy (RP) versus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and no primary therapy (NPT) in patients with localised prostate canc er are shown in Table 2. In this systematic review, we assumed a long follow-up and rare events concerning death: PCa: OS in Figure 3 [32]. Localized prostate cancer as opposed to advanced prostate cancer is believed to be associated with a very good overall survival regardless of the interven- tion. According to the algorithm, a cohort study would be appropriate to estimate long-term overall survival. Concerning patien t-reported outcomes such as discomfort, disability and dissatisfaction, we assume that we have short follow-up and frequent events: PCa: HRQL in Figure 3. According to the algorithm, an RCT would be the best choice. The different treatment options might result in non-relevant differences of overall survival, too small to be detected. However, they are believed to have consid- erably different impact on physical and psychological well-being. For example, radical prostatectomy may promise to completely remove the malignant tumor but may also disrupt erectile function in a considerable proportion of patients. Loss of function, increase of bother, and constrained quality of life may be perceived by many men shortly after the intervention. We found that physician-reported urogenital late toxici- ty grade 2 to 3 was more common in the LDR-BT group when compared to the EBRT group. With respect to patient-reported outc omes, better scores for sexual and urinary function as well as urinary incontinence were reported for LDR-BT compared to RP. Better scores for bowel function were reported for LDR-BT compared to EBRT. We think that the algorithm matches well with the study design requirements generated by the research question. Restricting the st udy design to RCTs only resulted in a sys- tematic review reporting the results of on ly a single study because only one RCT was available [33]. The information about discom fort, disability and dissatisfaction report- ed in numerous studies, though, with limited validity, was consequently ignored. Using different study types provided the main advantage to address two different research questions inherent in the systematic review. Evaluating overall survival needed a dif- ferent approach than evaluating patient-reported outcomes. The obvious reluctance of 188 patients and physicians alike to participat e in RCTs corroborated the consideration of other study designs such as nonrandomized controlled clinical trials and/or cohort studies with a set of inclusion criteria pros pectively designed to request a minimal level of quality to meet potential high risk of bias. The single included RCT provided valuable information but was limited to some issues and did not cover all relevant questions. The nonrandomised studies had a high risk of bias due to study design and various additional flaws such as the lack of reporting of a consecutive enrollment, a retrospec- tive design, and no adequate confounder control. Example 4: Negative pressure wound therapy The PICOTS-SD frame and the respective references associated with the systematic review on negative pressure wound therap y (NPWT) versus standard wound dressing in patients with wounds are shown in Table 2. In this systematic review, we assumed a short follow-up and frequent events concerning complete wound closure: NPWT: Closure in Figure 3 and we assumed a long follow-up and rare events concern- ing the outcome of severe adverse events NPWT: AE in Figure 3 [34]. NPWT is be- lieved to facilitate wound closure faster than other treatment options and enable clo- sure of chronic wounds that have failed to heal after other treatments. According to the algorithm, an RCT or a CCT would have been appropriate to evaluate the successful treatment of the disease. Serious adverse ev ents may be detected in study designs of lower hierarchy such as registry analyses or case reports. For instance, in the year 2009, the US Food and Drug Ad ministration issued a report on six deaths and 77 other complications that were repo rted within a two-year period in connection with NPWT. All the deaths were caused by acute hemorrhages, and known contraindications for NPWT (e.g. a large blood vessel exposed) had clearly been overlooked. Many of the deaths occurred in outpatient care or care homes, which highlights the need to moni- tor therapy. In this regard, it should be noted that trials of NPWT were generally con- ducted in hospitals. Using different study types provided the main advantage to ad- dress different research questions inherent in the systematic review. Evaluating com- plete wound closure needed a different appr oach than evaluating adverse events. The consideration of registry analyses and case reports were very helpful to draw attention to possible dangerous and life-threatening even ts and to point the finger at home care where indeed a considerable number of deaths were repo rted. A decision whether the intervention of interest can close wounds better than other alternative treatments apparently relies on the presence of high quality data from RCTs. 189 Discussion We did not identify an existing algorith m or comprehensive gu idance focussing on finding the appropriate research design. Therefore, we developed an algorithm as a guidance, which aims to guide the reasonab le inclusion of various study designs in systematic reviews of health care interv entions. The proposed algorithm cannot be applied without considering d isease-specific circumstances and aims of interventions, in other words, it is not intended to be an absolute guide that in all cases will lead to appropriate study designs. The terms used for defining the critical decision points of the algorithm such as short versus long foll ow-up need to be interpreted in the context of the disease and may be unclear and not useful if used as general terms. We provid- ed examples to show that short versus long follow-up can vary considerably depending on the disease. Similarly, we provided exam ples to show that the definition of rare versus frequent events has to be interpreted in the context of the type of intervention or exposure as well as the type of event. For some research questions, the algorithm may recommend the use of studies with the highest possible validity. For alternative research questions, the algorithm may recommend the use of studies with qualities other than methodological validity. The recommended study design may not be re- ported in the identified studies and, thus, may not be available. In this case, a study design of the next lower level of valid ity may be used as a replacement. We tested the constructed algorithm in four systematic reviews to evaluate wheth- er our reasoning in theory concerning the algorithm may solidify in practice. Each work clearly explained why it was necessary to include multiple study designs. The number of our systematic reviews was limited. Howeve r, we could cover most of the pathways. We judged in a retrospective view, whether the pathways of the algorithm could have been useful at the time of designing the review. We could follow and confirm the ap- propriateness of the pathways for all describe d examples of systematic reviews. In one example, the algorithm selected RCTs as the be st choice but due to the lack of RCTs it was decided to rely on nonrandomized st udies. This example showed that it is im- portant to build a flexibility into the algori thm, which enab les the systematic reviewer to extend or change the inclusion criteria to other study designs in case that certain unexpected conditions may emerge or practical concerns exists. We are confident that the algorithm is a tool helping to bring semina l features of a systematic review to the attention of anyone who is planning to conduct a systematic review. It has the poten- tial to help to reorientate oneself to major features of the studies eligible for an evalu- ation of a health care intervention. The be nefit is the provision of awareness, and it is not a new regulation. The intention is to pr ovide a guide and a decision support that might be used fully or partially by person s who are going to prepare a systematic re- view. While preparing a systematic review, it may be important at an early time point to identify the relevant and the most appropriate study designs necessary to find an- swers for a variety of prespecified outcomes. It might also be of interest for persons 190 who evaluate the quality of systematic re views and might want to check whether the all study designs have been considered that should have been considered. Therefore, we think that it may reduce the time burden on review authors and contribute to the production of a higher quality review. Although it appeared that the algorithm is proper for projection of various research questions on the delineated pathways, we want to draw the attention to some limita- tions of this study. Disease-specific circum stances and aims of interventions always have to be taken into account during application of the algorithm. It is not intended to be an absolute guide always leading to a ppropriate study designs but meant to support systematic reviewers in their decisions. The testing was conducted retrospectively with systematic reviews that were already co mpleted. This approach may have the ad- vantage that potential pitfalls and a compli cated matter are already known. However, this situation is far from the everyday wo rking condition and the approach may be considerably biased by the expectations of the authors, to name just one potential cause. A testing more adapt to the real wo rld should be included prospectively and should start while a systemat ic review is planned. Testing the algorithm prospectively and applying it at the start of a systematic review may have other results than those reported in the present study. Nevertheless, the results of this testing certainly need to be confirmed by other systematic reviewers, in other PICOTS-SD frames, and in a high- er number of applications. Conclusions We are confident that the algorithm can assist to bring seminal features of a systemat- ic review to the attention of anyone who is planning to conduct a systematic review. It aims to provide awareness not regulation. We think that it may reduce the time bur- den on review authors and may contribute to the production of a higher quality re- view. 191 References 1.

Most papers acknowledged the advantages and the disadvantages of RCTs and nonrandomized studies with regard to specific methodologic topics or specific clinical outcomes . In general, it was acknowl- edged that only RCTs can achieve the lowest risk of bias. Many papers highlighted that results of RCTs may not be applicable to a considerable number of the acual target population. Alternative study designs may be needed to confirm that the intervention of interest does work under real everyday conditions. Some papers addressed the problem that RCTs are not possible for assessing certain questions and that case re- ports may have a considerable impact on safety issues. In a Cochrane Review on 'Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation fol- lowing high dose chemotherapy for non- rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas', several single-arm studies were included with aggregate data, and many single arm studies with individual data to complement the results of a single available RCT. A time-to-event analysis was conducted on overa ll survival to incorporate individual data from non-comparative single-arm studies. The required follow-up information was incomplete or missing in a considerable num ber of participants. Neither the individual data, which were used in a time-to-event an alysis on overall survival, nor the aggreg- agte data from single-arm st udies could contribute to the decision-making whether the text intervention was associated with a long er overall survival than the control inter- vention. The number of participants in the RCT was low and the individual data con- tributed to address serious adverse events a ssociated with the test intervention. Some treatments were performed 10 to 20 years ago. Thus, the results may not be applica- ble to patients who are treated today. In a systematic review on 'First-line ma tched related donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation compared to immunosuppre ssive therapy in acquired severe aplastic anemia', nonrandomized controlled trials with a prospective design were included because RCTs on the topic were not identified. The available data enabled a pooled estimate of overall survival for the test and the control intervention. Potential dupli- cate publication bias was identified due to identical data that may have been reported in a hospital-based study and in a registry analysis. Considerable outcome reporting bias, which is defined as the selection of a subset of the originally recorded outcome variables for publication, was a lso identified. A high risk of bias was identified within almost all non-randomized controlled tria ls limiting any mean ingful inferences. In a systematic review on 'Permanent in terstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with localised a review of randomised and non- randomised controlled clinical trials', 30 comparative nonrandomized studies were 198 included in addition to a single RCT because data on health-related quality of life was limited in the RCT. Due to the stage of the condition of interest, health-related quality of life rather than overall survival was the preeminent outcome of interest. The com- parative nonrandomized studies provided useful information for decision-making. Individual preferences by patients and physicians may have played a central role in the decision whether to treat or to pursue active surveillance. In a systematic review on 'Negative-pre ssure wound therapy: systematic review of randomized controlled trials', only RCTs were included because a large number of RCTs were identified. RCTs provided sufficient data on the primary outcome 'complete wound closure'. However, data on treatment-related complications were limited due to a low number of participants. A postmarketing surveillance system was consulted to complement data on a considerable number of serious complications connected with the test intervention. These data changed th e overall picture of the possible benefits and harms of the intervention of interest. The inclusion of various study designs may be required if a systematic review aims to answer different research questions. A decision tree was constructed that may guide systematic reviewers to choose a sin gle design or multiple study designs appro- priate to answer these research questions. For some research questions, the algorithm may recommend the use of studies with the highest possible validity. For alternative research questions, the algorithm may recommend the use of studies with qualities other than methodological validity. The recommended study design may not be re- ported in the identified studies and, thus, may not be available. In this case, a study design of the next lower level of validity ma y be used as a replacement. The usefulness and functionality of the algorithm was evaluated by applying it to four systematic re- views. These systematic reviews were con ducted to evaluate the prospects of using multiple study designs. The systematic re views provided short and long follow-ups, rare and frequent events, and various outcomes , that all suited well for a projection on the various pathways offered by the algorith m. The theoretical algorithm proved to be useful in various practical situations and helped to choose the appropriate study de- signs for inclusion in ea ch systematic review. Strengths and limitations The search for published information on the advantages and disadvantages of various study designs, the correspondi ng data extraction , and data synthesis were performed systematically. For example, the definition of the search strategies, the inclusion crite- ria and study selection, the da ta analyses and result interpretation were independently done by at least two authors. The PRISMA statement were endorsed, adhered to its principles and conformed to its checklist. As in any systematic review, the limitations in 199 drawing conclusions are directly dependent on the quality and homogeneity of the primary studies. One strength of the thesis lies in the broad search strategy. The retrieved infor- mation was designated to provide an object ive view on the possible merits of every individual study design to support decision-ma king in health care. However, different authors and readers may have varying preconceptions about the way, how the term 'objective' should be conceived. It was tried to provide a comprehensive view of the published knowledge concerning the topic of this thesis. The comprehensiveness of the process of data collection required to include not only sy stematic reviews and meta-analyses but also nonsystematic review s, method studies and opinions. The qual- itative data were summarised by extracting the major identified contents. Thus, in every step of acquisition and judgement of data, personal preferences may have influ- enced the results. The documentation of the applied methods enables others to repeat the work. It is possible that another person might come to different results. While reading through hundreds of papers, I perceived a polarized dispute on randomized versus nonrandom- ized and on experimental versus observat ional study designs among some authors. Some put RCTs on a pedestal and claimed that results are only valid and trustworthy if derived from high quality RCTs regarding a ll possible research questions. Others de- manded that only data from observational studies are able to answer some research questions especially in the context of prov ing that an intervention might work under real world conditions. Thus, the inferences made in many included papers may be influenced by the authors' preoccupations. While building the algorithm, I aligned the decision points and paths according to seminal published information. The algorithm follows strict binary decision points and it retains sufficient flexibility to consider cer- tain conditions such as ethical or practical issues or to react if the best possible evi- dence is not available. The proposed algorithm cannot be applied without considering disease-specific circumstances and aims of interventions. The information base included nonsystematic reviews, which some may dislik e as invalid opinions. The te rms used for defining the critical decision points of the algorithm such as short versus long follow-up need to be interpreted in the context of the disease and may be unclear and not useful if used as general terms. We provided examples to sh ow that short versus longterm follow-up can vary considerably dependin g on the disease. Similarly, we provided examples to show that the definition of rare versus fr equent events has to be interpreted in the context of the type of intervention or exposure as well as the type of event. The prospects of using multiple study de signs were evaluated in four systematic reviews. The various characteristics of fo llow-up, frequency of adverse events, and type of outcomes of the included systematic reviews qualified to test almost every pathway of the algorithm. Although it appe ared that the algorithm is proper for pro- jection of various research questions on th e delineated pathways, we wanted to draw 200 the attention to some limitations of this study. Disease-specific circumstances and aims of interventions always have to be taken into account durin g application of the algorithm. It is not intended to be an abso lute guide always leading to appropriate study designs. The testing was conducted retr ospectively with systematic reviews that were already completed. This approach may have the advantage that potential pitfalls and a complicated matter are already known. However, this situation is far from the everyday working condition and the approach may be considerably biased by the ex- pectations of the authors, to name just one potential cause. A testing more adapt to the real world should be included prospect ively and should star t while a systematic review is planned. Testing the algorithm prospe ctively and applying it at the start of a systematic review may have other results th an those reported in the present study. Nevertheless, the results of this testing cert ainly need to be confirmed by other sys- tematic reviewers, in other PICOTS-SD frames , and in a higher number of applications. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews We have not identified another algorithm pub lished by other authors. It appears that our algorithm may be the first comprehensiv e decision tree available. Thus, we cannot compare our guidance tool for systematic reviewers with a similar one. Nevertheless, there are numerous papers reporting about issu es concerning including multiple study designs. We want to address some salient aspects of this topic reported by some re- nowned authors. The view of RCTs as the sole means of fi nding reliable answers to clinical research questions was perpetuated only by a minority of the evaluated reviews [1]. For exam- ple, McCarthy 2008 recommended to perform more RCTs in surgery because they provide the most rigorous way of determining a cause-effect relationship between treatment and outcome [2]. Mitchell 1995 st ated that rigorous and large RCTs are required for valid estimations of rare and serious adverse events [3]. Reeves 2005 refered to the drawbacks of nonrandomized designs and pointed out that they are associated with selection bias, performing bias , detection bias, and attrition bias [4]. It is conceivable that a high level of evidence associated with RCTs certainly prevents a number of major biases considering effects of interventions [5-6]. Therefore, RCTs should be used if feasible. We found that the majority of trials and systematic reviews reported effects that did not differ considerably between randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials [7]. About one third of the trials showed a different direction or a statistically signifi- cant difference of the magnitude of effect between those two designs. The estimated treatment effect may underestimate or over estimate the real effect. For example, Hernan 2012 noticed that the intention-to-treat analyses may underestimate the treatment effect in placebo-controlled randomiz ed clinical trials [8]. A Cochrane review 201 compared RCTs versus historically or conc urrently controlled nonrandomized trials in 2007 [10]. The authors concluded that, on average, the nonrandomized controlled trials tend to result in larger estimates of effect than RCTs. The latest update of this Cochrane review in 2011 amended the research question and compared RCTs versus concurrently controlled nonrandomized trials and excluded historically controlled ones [11]. The authors concluded that the results of randomized and nonrandomized con- trolled trials sometimes differed, namely, in some instances nonrandomized studies yielded larger estimates of effect and in othe r instances vice versa. It appears that the early firm statement expressing larger estimates in the nonrandomized controlled trials changed to a less decided message. Systematic biases can arise from time trends of changing outcomes in hist orically controlled studies in contrast to concurrently controlled studies [12]. Thus, the change wa s probably caused by the exclusion of studies with a historically controlled group and thereby removing a source of addition- al risk of bias. A new Cochrane review is on the way to assess the impact of study de- sign on the effect measures estimated in RCTs compared to various observational study designs such as prospective or retrospective cohorts [13]. However, nonrandom- ized controlled trials may presumably not be included. We want to emphasize the important difference between observationa l comparative studies (no assignment by study investigator to treatment groups) and nonrandomized controlled trials (experi- mental design with assignment). We found that the majority, at least three quarters of relevant identified reviews, inferred that nonrandomized studies should be included in systematic reviews [1]. In a landmark paper, Black 1998 explained that RCTs can be unnecessary (e.g. dramatic effect such as instant healing by insulin), inappropriate (e.g. act of random allocation may reduce the effectiveness), impossible (e .g. some interventions cannot be allocated on a random basis), or inadequate (e.g. limit ed applicability) [14]. Lewsey 2000 provid- ed an example that an RCT is not possible to study early versus late surgery for sub- arachnoid haemorrhage [15]. Hartling 2005 addressed the issue of applicability and noticed that RCTs tend to enroll younger and healthier patients [16] and Hodgson 2007 further added that older patients, women, and patients with comorbid disorders are underrepresented in RCTs [17]. Olivier 2006 stressed the importance of case reports and postmarket monitoring of adverse events and described that case reports lead to the withdrawal of 19 of 21 drugs for safety reasons in a specific ti me period in France [18]. Concato 2010 noticed that contradictio ns among RCTs themselves are well de- scribed [19]. Britton 1998 concluded that a well-designed nonrandomized study may be preferable to a small, poorly designed and exclusive RCT [20]. Studies of lower lev- els may be necessary when RCTs are not fe asible. For example, a considerable number of eligible individuals may be excluded from an RCT that have characteristics different from those of the included ones [20]. Eligib le patients excluded from an RCT are usual- ly not observed further, which may cause important limitations to jugdements about applicability [21]. 202 We concluded that the risk of presenting uncertain results without knowing for sure the direction and magnitude of the effect holds true for both nonrandomized and randomized controlled trials. Vandenbroucke 20 09 elucidated that conflicting results between observational studies and RCTs with respect to hormone replacement thera- py (HRT) finally fell in line mainly by adjust ing different time intervals [22]. He conclud- ed that the discrepancies between RCTs an d observational studies cannot be automat- ically attributed to randomizati on itself but may be related to systematic differences in charateristics of participants. Conflict #1 co ncerns the question whether HRT increases coronary heart disease. HRT caused an initial increased risk, which waned in later years. RCTs truely identified an increased risk because the data were observed since the start of HRT. The time lag caused the difference in risk not the study design. Obser- vational studies falsely showed a reduced r isk for coronary heart disease because the users were observed beyond a time interval since start HRT and were in a phase of decreased incidence. Conflict #2 concerns the question whether HRT increases breast cancer. Observational studies truely identifi ed an increased risk after combined oes- trogen-progestin. RCTs falsely did not iden tify this risk because the users were ob- served beyond a longer time interval afte r menopause than in the observational stud- ies. The varying time interval between me nopause and start of HRT caused the differ- ence in risk not the study design. Hoppe 20 09 acknowledged that RCTs are the most objective design but admitted that RCTs may not provide all of the information a clini- cian might need [23]. We concluded that th e integration of multiple study designs in systematic reviews is required if patients sh o u l d b e i n f o r m e d o n t h e m a n y f a c e t s o f patient relevant issues of health care interventions such as survival, cure of disease, improvement of symptoms, treatment-related complications, other adverse events, health-related quality of life. In a recent methods paper written under contract of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Seida 2013 found a considerable diversity across the comparative effectiveness reviews with respect to methods used to search for, select, appraise, and analyze observatio nal studies [24]. The authors inferred that it was not always clear whether the inclusion of observational studies added value. As mentioned in the introduction chapter of the present thesis, Ijaz 2014 concluded that reporting of nonrandomized studies in Coch rane reviews requires an improved guid- ance [25]. Best available evidence Evidence-based medicine (EBM) was defined as the integration of best research evi- dence with individual clinical expertise, patient values and expectations, and best ex- ternal research evidence [26]. This definiti on of EBM may be appropriately illustrated by the Venn diagram in Figure 1 [27]. 203 Figure 1. Definition of Evidence-Based Medicine [27]. Sackett 1996 judged: \"Without current best evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to the detriment of patients.\" [28]. The term 'best external evidence' may be described as a rigorous analysis of pub lished study data primarily from RCT and quantitative (meta-analysis) and/or qualitative summary of these data within a sys- tematic review. The term 'evidence' means information and the term 'best evidence' means the most valid and reliable informatio n [29]. To classify more valid and less valid information, the 'levels of evidence' specif y a hierarchical order for various research designs based on their internal validity. Th e highest level of valid data, that is, the 'best' evidence, however, is not always availa ble. For instance, if RCTs are lacking and only case reports are available, then, case reports may constitute the best available evidence. EBM proponents who might be inclined to narrow the view down to statistics may always demand RCTs. A spoof systematic re view evaluated whether the imposition of a parachute versus no parachute results in a better survival when jumping out of a plane [30]. The article's effect was probably to contest idealization of RCTs. It is very im- portant to keep the other circles of EBM always in mind. Many aspects of health care depend on individual circumstances and preferences and it may not be possible to evaluate those important issues. The term evidence -based medicine may imply that health care decisions are based solely on the best external evidence circle and not on the individual clinical expertise circle and not on the patient value and expectations circle. Therefore, the term evidence informed healthcare may be more appropriate [31]. Sacket 1996 warned: \"Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannised by evidence, for even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable to or inappropriate 204 for an individual patient.\" [28]. Berguer 2004 criticized that the name 'evidence-based medicine' is self-righteous in that it singles out one approach to th e analysis of clinical data as the one embodying scientific truth [32]. He further pointed out that results from RCT are average numbers referable to an average individual. However, the 'aver- age' risk may be meaningless when you ar e the patient. Feinstein and Horwitz 1997 [33] apprehended: \"The laudable goal of making clinic al decisions based on evidence can be impaired by the restricted quality an d scope of what is collected as 'best availa- ble evidence'. The authoritative aura given to the collection, however, may lead to major abuses that produce inappropriate guidelines or doctrinaire dogmas for clinical practice.\" There may be perceivable hints that dogma and ideology prevail at least in some areas. It is certainly not a scientific characteristic to oppress other opinions in- cluding those by experts in various fields. Sp ence 2014 [34] criticized: \"Today EBM is a loaded gun at clinicians' heads and that you better do as the eviden ce says, leaving no room for discretion or judgment. The cu rrent incarnation of EBM is corrupted, let down by academics and regula tors alike.\" The letters by Hicks 2012 [35] and Hicks 2013 [36] may serve as an example for a heated dispute including the accusation that the authors of an EBM article did not take th e clinical and the patient part sufficiently into account. They noted that the work \"lacks appropriate clinical perspective\", that the authors have \"apparent misunderstanding of the values and principles of EBM\", that the authors \"have presented an analysis that is so lacking in scientific rigor that it can be fairly judged to have provided a prejudiced appraisal of the evidence pertaining to the patient benefits\", and that the auth ors \"potentially misguide policymakers and individuals about appropriate use of this techno logy. In our view, this is a disservice to our patients that must be strenuously resisted and hence the tone of our prior letter.\" In summary, the term 'evidence-informed healthcare' mounts on three different equally important foundations. These three cornerstones comprise the patients and their values and expectations, the clinicians and their expertise and experience, and the epidemiologists and statisticians and th eir interpretation of study data. Subse- quently, the term 'best available evidence' should not be confined to medical biomet- rical views but should include all three aspects. Conclusions The use of multiple study de signs in systematic reviews clearly showed that various study designs increased the information that should be considered in decision-making. The impact of the extra information may no t be foreseen very well. The extra infor- mation may complement the best available evidence adding new important data and may open the horizon to bring attention to issues that may be overlooked but are nevertheless pertinent to health care. So metimes information from multiple study designs can induce prudence in those who decide about an acclaimed new interven-205 tion. RCTs may not be the typical study design to provide sufficient evidence for mar- ket withdrawals. Recommendations for decision makers We recommend decision makers to avoid build ing their decisions only on data emerg- ing from a single study design. Methods gro ups are on their way to improve the bias control and the reporting standards of nonrandomized controlled clinical trials. Other groups bring out suggestions to better search for and find studies on adverse events. Some Cochrane Groups demand two primary outcomes, one associated with the most wanted treatment effect and one associated with a serious unwanted effect. Patient- reported outcomes are important in evaluati ons that apply patient-centered outcomes and invite consumers to participate in cond ucting systematic re views. We recommend considering multiple study de signs to enable Cochrane Re views and other systematic reviews accomplishing these goals more effect ively. The algorithm is foreseen to func- tion as a tool helping to bring seminal featur es of a systematic review to the attention of anyone who is planning to conduct a systematic review. It helps to reorientate one- self to major features of the studies eligible for an evaluation of a health care interven- tion. The benefit is the provision of awarene ss not a new regulation. The intention is to provide a guide that might be used fully or partially by persons who are going to pre- pare a systematic review. While conducting a systematic review, it may be important at an early time point to identify the relevant and the most appropriate study designs necessary to find answers for a variety of prespecified outcomes. It might also be of interest for persons who evaluate the qualit y of systematic reviews and might want to check whether the all study designs have been considered that should have been. The algorithm should be embedded in an articl e, which provides introduction and explana- tion of its target population, aims purposes, and its optimal use. The article should be published in an open access jo urnal, a scholarly journal that is available online world- wide to all potential readers who can use the internet. The article will have a particular internet site, which contains tools for inst ant feedback to the authors, general com- ments, recommendations passed on to others, and links to social networks such as twitter. Recommendations for further research First, we recommend continuing the refinement of requirements for nonrandomized controlled clinical trials. Second, we recommend evaluating whether all Cochrane Re- views should include multiple study designs to cover the various main objectives. Third, we recommend elaborating whether the implementation of an algorithm can support the quality and scope of a systematic review. The algorithm should be applied prospectively and used as a tool for the pr ocess of choosing appropriate study designs 206 for inclusion in a systematic review of he alth-care interventions. We imagine a trial with random allocation of using versus not using the algorithm. The satisfaction of convenience of the users might be evaluate d by a questionnaire and may be used as the effect measure. At least, the algorithm should be tried by more than just one per- son to allow any conclusions on its usefulne ss. Experience with the algorithm should be collected with 10 or more author grou ps. The systematic reviews conducted with the use of the algorithm should have other types of population, intervention, compar- ator, and outcome than those contained in the systematic reviews of this thesis. Recommendations for instructing the algorithm There might be an educational challenge of instructing end users of the algorithm. Persons who are planning to conduct a systematic review and use the algorithm should make themselves acquainted with the scope of possible st udy designs, their purposes, advantages, and drawbacks. Many pathways might lead to choose only RCTs for the evaluation of the efficacy of a health care intervention. Nevertheless, other study de- signs should be kept in mind and considered for additional inclusion depending on the particular disease and intervention of interest. We recommend a flexible and pragmat- ic approach without the obligation to rigidly exclude study designs. In the case that, for example, the RCT should be chosen, we ha ve already implemented a strategy of con- sidering ethical and practical issues. These issu es should not be overlooked and might be reasons to replace RCT with another study design. If available publications do not report the study design of interest, then th e hierarchical structure of study designs should be considered and the next lower level of evidence might be considered. The algorithm will be published pref erably in an open accesss jo urnal. Beginners might find it helpful to find a framework that offers already some potential study designs and objective reasons to favor sp ecific study designs for incl usion. The algorithm is sup- posed to assist a group of experienced sc ientists while gainin g a consensus about choosing study designs for inclu sion in systematic reviews. It is not intended to replace the dialog among those experts. Knowledge and application of general rules and expe- rience in methodological issues relevant for the conduct of systematic reviews de- scribed comprehensively in particular in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Re- views of Interventions is mandatory. 207 References 1.

Jo urnal of Nuclear Medicine. 2013;54(3):492. 209 Summary Background and rationale A systematic review attempts to collate all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria in order to answer a spec ific research question. The most distinctive characteristics that are present in a system atic review and that are not present in a nonsystematic review may be a study protocol, an analy sis plan, a literature search strategy, and a description of the selection of suitable studies in accordance with pro- spectively defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The starting point and fundamental component of a systematic review of health care interventions is a structured clinical question. A systematic review may evaluate benefit and harm of a health care intervention and may include a specific set of studies. Explanatory study designs address the ques- tion whether the intervention of interest ca n work in principle in the ideal study set- ting and typically provide a conclusion for an average pati ent only. The intervention and the control group may differ only with respect to the intervention of interest. Known and unknown characteristics are equally distributed among the two treatment groups. The resulting structural equality fa cilitates a decision whether an observed effect was actually caused by the intervention. Randomization may be the best ap- proach to provide this structural equality and may provide a low risk of bias. However, in some situations, randomization is not fea sible, not appropriate, or the results may not be applicable to everyday practice. Pr agmatic study designs aim to show that in- terventions will work under every day circumst ances but may have a high risk of bias. To accommodate the evaluation of various research questions, the inclusion of more than one study design appears to be necessary. Research questions and answers The aim of this thesis is to in vestigate the advantages and disadvantages of using vari- ous study designs to answer specific clinical research questions within systematic re- views and to develop and pilot test an algori thm to guide systematic reviewers in their 210 decision to choose appropriate study designs . The following research questions are discussed in the present thesis: What is known in the published literature about the pros and cons of integration of multiple study types in systematic reviews? A review of 42 articles about the use of mult iple study designs in systematic reviews of health care interventions showed a tenden cy that nonrandomized studies should be conducted and integrated in systematic re views to complement available randomized controlled trials or replace lacking trials in 85% (36 of 42) of these articles. It was acknowledged that only rand omized controlled trials can achieve the lowest risk of bias. Many papers highlighted that results of randomized trials may not be applicable to a considerable number of the actual target population. The risk of presenting uncer- tain results without knowing for sure the di rection and magnitude of the effect holds true for both nonrandomized and randomized controlled trials. What can be learnt from conducting systemat ic reviews about topics that may require the inclusion of multiple study designs, assuming that more than one study design may be essential to gather sufficient data for answering the objectives of the review. If no comparative study is available, then th e data of single-arm studies might provide, for example, an estimation of overall surviv al. Data on adverse events can be present- ed beyond the scope of a randomized controlle d trial. Discussing the limitations of the results may bring the public attention to a lack of certain data, which might foster the conduction of a long desired trial. In another example, the test but not the control intervention may cure patients, however, the test intervention might be associated with a higher early treatment-related mortality than the control intervention. This situation might create a conflict. Ethical concerns may prevent trials with a random allocation of patients to the treatment groups. The principles of 'Mendelian randomi- zation' could be applied for evaluating transplantation by restricting transplant donors to siblings. Another example shows that pati ents with a localized as opposed to an advanced cancer might have a very good overall survival regardless of the type of in- tervention. Though, the health-related quality of life as measured by patient-reported outcomes may vary considerably among the tr eatment options, which is caused by the varying degrees of their invasiveness. Reluct ance of patients and physicians alike to participate in randomization corroborates th e consideration of alternative approaches. A report on deaths was issued in connecti on with a particular medical device. It showed that the consideration of registry an alyses and case reports can be very helpful to draw attention to possible dangerous and life-threatening events. It was also helpful to point at the home setting where a considerable number of deaths happened. 211 What is the preferred content and format of a straightforward algorithm for integration of various study designs in a systematic review that incorporates major study characteristics as decision points an d that allows consideration of practical concerns? A decision tree was constructed using length of follow-up, frequency of events, and type of outcomes as main decision points. It was ensured that the preset pathways retain sufficient flexibility to consider ethical and practical issues as well as unavailable best evidence. The outcomes may be evaluated after a short or long follow-up. The events of interest may be rare or frequent. The outcomes can be classified into the five major groups of death, disease, discomfort , disability, and dissatisfaction. Then, ap- propriate study designs are recommended with respect to the type of outcome. Practi- cal or ethical concerns or lack of recommended study designs may emerge as reasons to override the earlier decisions or to switch to a more appropriate study design. Therefore, the reader is reminded to reconsider the chosen path. Can the algorithm hold its promise as a useful guide for choosing appropriate study designs by testing its feasib ility and applying it to existing systematic reviews? The appropriateness of the pathways of the decision tree was confirmed during the application of the algorithm on four select ed systematic reviews. These systematic reviews were conducted to evaluate the pros pects of using multiple study designs and were well suited for a projection on the va rious pathways offered by the algorithm. The theory-based algorithm proved to be useful in various practical situations and helped to choose the appropriate study designs for inclu sion in each tested systematic review. Strengths and limitations One strength of the thesis lies in the broad search strategy. The retrieved information was designated to provide an objective view on the possible merits of every individual study design to support decision-making in health care. Nevertheless, personal prefer- ences may have influenced the results in every step of acquisition and judgement of data. While reading through hundreds of papers, I perceived a polarized dispute on randomized versus nonrandomized and on ex perimental versus observational study designs among some authors. Thus, the inferences made in many included papers may be influenced by the authors' preoccupations. The testing of the algorithm was conducted retrospectively by backtracing system- atic reviews that were already completed. This approach is far from the everyday working condition. It may be considerably biased by my expectations that the algo- rithm should have been worked if applied prospectively. Thus, the results of this test- ing need to be confirmed by other systematic reviewers who plan to use the algorithm 212 from the start. The algorithm is not intended to be an absolute guide always leading to appropriate study designs. Disease-specific circumstances and aims of interventions always have to be taken into account during application of the algorithm. Recommendations The algorithm is foreseen to function as a gu ide helping to bring seminal features of a systematic review to the attention of anyo ne who is planning to conduct a systematic review. It is recommended to confirm this a ssumption by its prospective application, possibly within a trial. It is also recommende d to test its usefulness with respect to other types of population, intervention, comparator, and outcome than those con- tained in the systematic reviews of this th esis. The algorithm may help to reorientate oneself to major features of the studies eligib le for an evaluation of a health care in- tervention. There might be an educational challenge of instructing end users of the algorithm. Persons who are planning to conduct a systematic review and use the algo- rithm should make themselves acquainted with the scope of possible study designs, their purposes, advantages, and drawbacks. Persons without extensive practice in conducting systematic reviews might be as ked to share their opinion concerning its usefulness for beginners. In general, a flexible and pragmatic approach without the obligation to rigidly exclude study designs is recommended. 213 Valorisation The work of the thesis gained extensive insight into the using of evidence of multiple study designs in systematic reviews. A revi ew of a comprehensive literature showed a tendency that nonrandomized studies should be conducted and integrated in system- atic reviews to complement available rando mized controlled trials or replace lacking those trials. The risk of presenting uncert ain results without knowing for sure the di- rection and magnitude of the effect holds true for both nonrandomized and random- ized controlled trials. The consideration of registry analyses and case reports can be very helpful to draw attention to possible dangerous and life-threatening events be- yond the scope of a randomized controlled trial. Ethical concerns may prevent trials with a random allocation of patients to treatment groups. Health-related quality of life may vary considerably if the treatment options are characterized by varying degrees of invasiveness. In this case, reluctance of pati ents and physicians alike to participate in randomization corroborates the consideration of alternative approaches. The work showed the importance of using multiple st udy designs in systematic reviews and pro- vided many examples. A decision tree was co nstructed to facilitate the choosing of study designs for particular research questi ons, as shown below. Length of follow-up, frequency of events, and type of outcomes were the main decision points. It was en- sured that the preset pathways retain suffici ent flexibility to consider ethical and prac- tical issues as well as unavailable best evidence. The appropriateness of the pathways of the decision tree was confirmed by backtrac ing four systematic reviews. The theory- based algorithm proved to be useful in various practical situations and helped to choose the appropriate study de signs for inclusion in each tested systematic review. 214 Relevance The use of multiple study de signs in systematic reviews clearly showed that various study designs increased the information that should be considered in decision-making. The impact of the extra information may no t be foreseen very well. The extra infor- mation may complement the best available evidence based on randomized controlled trials by adding new important data and by opening the horizon to bring attention to issues that may be overlooked but are nevertheless pertinent to health care. Some- times information from multiple study desi gns can induce prudence in those who de- cide about an acclaimed new intervention. For example, randomized controlled trials may not be the typical study design to prov ide sufficient evidence for market with- drawals. Target groups The algorithm is foreseen to function as a t ool helping to bring seminal features of a systematic review to the attention of anyo ne who is planning to conduct a systematic review. This includes persons working in organi zations or institutes that prepare health technology assessment reports, evidence report s, or systematic reviews on health care interventions. It helps to reorientate onesel f to major features of the studies eligible for an evaluation of a health care intervention. This is not meant to add a new regula- tion, but the benefit is the provision of awar eness of the value of different study de- signs in systematic reviews. The intention is to provide a guide that might be used fully or partially by persons who are going to pr epare a systematic review. While conducting a systematic review, it may be important at an early time point to identify the relevant and the most appropriate study designs necessary to find answers for a variety of pre- specified outcomes. It might also be of inte rest for persons who evaluate the quality of systematic reviews and might want to chec k whether all study relevant designs have indeed been considered. This may include individual physicians who intend to make evidence-based decisions on the treatment of their patients, although it will not be easy for busy clinicans to do so. It should a lso include persons with positions on a more collective level of evidence synthesis, such as scientists of academ ic institutions and members of guideline committees who crit ically assess the pub lished evidence on various health care interventions, and staff of governmental administrations that make political decisions on the reimbursement of public health care services. 215 216 Activities/Products Five of the six results chapters have been published in article format. The results of one remaining chapter are submitted to a journal and the manuscript will hopefully be accepted for publication in the near future . The publication will provide introduction and explanation of its target population, aims purposes, and its optimal use. The article is planned to published in an open access journal, a scholarly journal that is available online worldwide to all potential readers who can use the internet. In general, an arti- cle published in this way will have a particul ar internet site, which contains tools for instant feedback to the authors, genera l comments, recommendations passed on to others, and links to social networks such as Twitter. The algorithm is embedded in a manuscript and, as mentioned earlier, is subm itted to an open access journal. It is also planned to submit the work to the Cochrane Colloquium, a meeting of persons who are international experts in the field of conducting and assessing systematic reviews. Innovation I looked at the methods guidance documents of high profile not-for-profit publishers of systematic reviews and health technology assessments of health care interventions. I did not find an existing algorithm provid ing guidance for syst ematic reviewers to choose the most appropriate study designs. It appears that the algorithm may be the first comprehensive decision tree available. Subsequently, I developed a decision sup- port tree using length of follow-up, frequency of events, and type of outcomes as main decision points. It was ensured that the pres et pathways retain sufficient flexibility to consider ethical and practical issues as well as unavailable best evidence. The con- structed algorithm was tested in four sy stematic reviews to evaluate whether our reasoning based on theory is applicable in practice. Although it appeared that the algorithm is proper for projection of vari ous research questions on the delineated pathways, disease-specific circ umstances and aims of interventions have always to be taken into account during application of the algorithm. Schedule & Implementation The algorithm should be tried by more than just one person to allow any conclusions on its usefulness. The systematic reviews conducted with the use of the algorithm should have other types of population, intervention, comparator, and outcome than those contained in the systematic reviews of this thesis. First, it is recommend to con- tinue the refinement of requirements for nonrandomized controlled clinical trials. Second, it is recommended to evaluate whether all Cochrane Reviews should include 217 multiple study designs to cover the various main objectives. Third, it is recommended to elaborate whether the implementation of an algorithm can support the quality and scope of a systematic review. Persons who are willing to use the algorithm should be provided with an instruction manual that includes further interpretations and explana- tions. Training needs should be predicted and addressed. Educational seminars should be offered to elucidate the various pathways of the algorithm and the process of choosing the most appropriate study design s required to answer the important re- search questions of a systematic review. 219 Curriculum vitae Frank Peinemann was born on 27 December 1959 in Northeim, Germany. In 1987, he graduated from Medical School and in 1989 he was promoted Dr. med. for his disserta- tion in the field of molecular genetics at the University of Go ttingen, Germany (uni- goettingen.de). He is recipient of two DFG German Research Founda- tion (dfg.de), a 2-year fellowship grant to conduct molecular genetic research at Emory University, Atlanta, USA (emory.edu), and a financial support for laboratory equipment in Gottingen (humangenetik.gwdg.de). During his stay in the USA, he passed the exams of the ECFMG Educational Commission of Fo reign Medical Graduates, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA (ecfmg.org). After various employments in medical care of infants, children, and adolescents (uniklinik-duesseldorf; klinikumfrankfurt.de; herzzentrum.uk-koeln.de/de/kinder- kardiologie), and after continuing medical education, the medical board authorities awarded him certificates in pediatrics, me dical genetics, pediatric cardiology, neona- tology, medical informatics, and medical quality management. During his employment with the BQS German National Institute for Quality Measurement in Health Care, Dusseldorf, Germany (bqs-institut.de), he participated in the development of quality indicators in various fields to conduct ex ternal quality assurance and benchmarking of German hospitals. Then he started his current employment with the IQWiG Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, Koln, Germany (iqwig.de). His main job is to conduct systematic reviews on interventions in health care in various fields, which are commissioned by the G-BA Federal Joint Committee, Berlin, Germany (g-ba.de). He was promoted Master of Science in Epidemiology after completing his studies and master thesis at the universities in Mainz and Essen, Germany (unimedizin- mainz.de/imbei; imibe.de). He is lecturer in Pediatrics at the Child ren's Hospital of the University of Cologne, Germany (kinderklinik.uk- koeln.de). He is also lecturer in Public Health on a freelance basis at FOM University of Applied Science for Economics & Management, Essen, Germany (fom.de). He works with several Cochrane Review Groups to conduct Cochrane systematic revi ews on interventions in health care. He publishes articles in international peer-rev iewed journals (pubmed. gov), presentations at international meetings, and provides peer reviews for prestigious scholarly journals (publons.com). 221 Publications Chapters 2 to 6 are based on the following published articles Peinemann F, Tushabe DA, Kleijnen J.
