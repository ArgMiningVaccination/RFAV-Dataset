Accordingly, the current study aimed to assess the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination and its predictors among the Lebanese population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in February 2021 among Lebanese adults from the 5 main Lebanese districts. The questionnaire included demographic data, questions about COVID-19 experience, COVID-19 anxiety syndrome scale, and attitudes regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Data were analyzed on SPSS, version 23. Statistical significance was considered at a P value 0.05 with a 95% CI. Results: Of 811 participants, 45.4% (95% CI: 41.9-48.9) accepted taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Choices were negatively affected by concerns about the side effects of the vaccine and positively affected by anxiety and seeking COVID-19 news very closely. Moreover, if the COVID-19 vaccination was a requirement for traveling, participants would be more willing to get the vaccine. Conclusions: Since 54.7% of the studied Lebanese adults were either unwilling or undecided to get the vaccine and COVID-19 news was retrieved mainly from the Ministry of Public Health online site and the local news, the existing targeted campaign should be enforced toward encouraging vaccination to reach herd immunity against COVID-19 and revealing the safety of the vaccines.
