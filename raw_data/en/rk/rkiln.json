What happens during a chiropractic adjustment? During a chiropractic adjustment, your chiropractor will offer treatment that is unique to meet your needs. You will lie face down on a chiropractic table that allows certain parts of your body (divided into segments) to lift slightly higher than the rest, which helps your chiropractor apply pressure to a specific area. Your chiropractor will use their hands or small instruments to apply a quick, controlled force (amount of pressure) to a joint or they will gently stretch your joints beyond their normal range of motion. This helps align the vertebrae in your spine if they were slightly off-center and release gases trapped within your joints. What is the popping sound I hear during a chiropractic adjustment? You may feel and hear a popping or cracking sensations during a chiropractic adjustment. These are gases, like oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, released from your joints. Gas gets trapped in small cavities of your joints when you move and stretch.

Recovery and Outlook What is the recovery time for a chiropractic adjustment? Many people feel almost immediate relief from symptoms after a chiropractic adjustment.

They might also recommend incorporating stretches into your daily routine. These long-term tips can help prevent future problems.

Your primary care doctor can rule out potentially serious problems that need treatment beyond a chiropractic adjustment. When to Call the Doctor When should I see my healthcare provider?
