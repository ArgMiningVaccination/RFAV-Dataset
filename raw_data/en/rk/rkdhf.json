Philosophy Yoeme Traditional healing is defined by a practice that is inherently holistic in nature where nothing is compartmentalized or isolated. There is a relationship that develops between a client and healer based on trust and faith in the cultural and spiritual values of traditional healing. There is no fee for services rendered during regular business hours. The Traditional healer's utmost concern is to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the patient. Their practice are based on keeping with cultural values, and similar to other complementary and alternative healing practices, on the relationship that develops between healer and the client. Communication defines this relationship and is a means to diagnosis.
