Health Effects of Loneliness People have had to socially distance because of the pandemic, bringing more attention to the health effects of isolation and loneliness, and there is alarming news: According to the National Institute on Aging, the health risks of prolonged isolation are equivalent to smoking fifteen cigarettes a day (Kroll 2022). Social isolation and loneliness have even been ...This article is available for free to all. Antioxidants: The Hype and the Reality Everyone is talking about antioxidants, but misconceptions abound. For example, I just received an email that described antioxidants as \"the ability to soak up toxins in the body.\" One dictionary definition of an antioxidant is \"(1) a substance that inhibits oxidation, especially one used to counteract the deterioration of stored food products [and] (2) a ... I Don't Know What's in It. A woman who was interviewed on the news explained why she refuses to accept a vaccine for COVID-19: \"I don't know what's in it.\" At first glance, that sounds like a very reasonable stance. Surely it is foolish to ingest or inject something when you don't know what you're getting. If everyone followed that policy, ... Kailo and Other Patches for Pain I keep seeing advertisements and testimonials for Kailo patches to relieve pain. They claim to: Doesn't that sound great? Are you in pain? Just stick on a patch and the pain goes away in one minute. Unfortunately, the \"scientific evidence\" isn't what they think. More about that later. Kailo patches use a patented technology; an array ... Penicillin Allergy? Are you one of the 10 percent of Americans who report being allergic to penicillin? Did you know that less than 1 percent of the population are truly allergic? Did you know that 80 percent of people with true IgE-mediated penicillin allergy lose their sensitivity after ten years? Did you realize that \"the use of ... Understanding Gluten Until a few years ago, few people had even heard of gluten. Now going on a gluten-free diet has become a popular fad. People diagnosed with celiac disease must avoid gluten to prevent symptoms, but others are avoiding gluten for questionable reasons\u2014or for no reason at all. I watched a TV program where the host ... Supplements: Misguided Marketing If marketers want to persuade me to take a dietary supplement, they are going about it the wrong way. A typical recent email said I could fight aging, boost immunity, and feel energized with doctor-endorsed NMN supplement Elevant. They even offered to send me free samples. Probably worth the price! J The claims: \"For today's ... An Explanation for Gulf War Illness When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, a coalition of thirty-nine countries responded. A total of 382 American troops died. Those who survived deployments to the 1990-1991 Gulf War theater of operations and returned to the United States may have been safe from combat, but they were not \"safe and sound.\" Thirty-seven percent of them were ... Does a Baby Aspirin a Day Keep the Doctor Away? For years, we have been told that most adults should take a baby aspirin every day to help prevent heart attacks and strokes. Now we are told not to do that because it doesn't work. What is going on? Why can't science make up its mind? The recommendations are not exactly simple and straightforward; the ... Medical Tests to Avoid When I first started looking into chiropractic, I read about one of its continuing medical education (CME) offerings. CME for physicians is intended to update their knowledge so they can treat patients more effectively. This chiropractic CME course didn't try to inform chiropractors about new knowledge from recent studies (there isn't much new chiropractic research) ...This article is available for free to all. Will Intermittent Fasting Help You Lose Weight? Are you having trouble losing weight? So are a lot of other people. Have you tried intermittent fasting? Should you? According to a survey by the International Food Information Council, intermittent fasting was the most popular weight loss diet in 2018. Some have called it a fad whose adverse effects have not been sufficiently studied, and ... Should I Get a Second Booster? In China, COVID-19 vaccination is required for everyone and sometimes force and coercion are used. In the United States, vaccines are never required. No one is forced to get vaccinated, although consequences have been imposed; for instance, the unvaccinated have been refused employment for certain jobs and not allowed to attend public schools. The CDC ... Misconceptions about Vitamins In 1747, one of the first controlled clinical trials in the history of medical science involved vitamin C, though the researcher had no idea what a vitamin was; the vitamin wasn't discovered until 1912. Scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency, was rampant in the British Royal Navy, disabling and killing more sailors than ...This article is available for free to all. The Prince of Alternative Medicine It's common knowledge that Prince Charles is a persistent and outspoken champion of alternative medicine, but the full story has never been told\u2014until now. Edzard Ernst reveals all the shocking details in this unauthorized biography. The shocks come from Charles's own words, which Ernst quotes extensively. It is ironic that Charles's supporters were responsible for ... Multiple Chemical Sensitivity I have long been skeptical of the diagnosis of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). Here's what I wrote about it four years ago in an article in Skeptic magazine: An episode of ABC's Nightline news show about Dr. Rea's controversial diagnoses and treatments aired in 2009. I was appalled by the interviews with a patient diagnosed by Dr. Rea as ... Can These Eyedrops Replace Reading Glasses? You've probably seen the ads. Vuity is a new prescription eyedrop. An article in Scientific American says, \"These drops could replace your reading glasses.\" Could they really? How can that be? Do they really work? Kind of, sort of ... for some people ... for a few hours ... maybe. It's no panacea. The devil ... Dog Food Is Not Evidence An individual told me in an email that I was wrong about dietary supplements and urged me to read a bag of dog food to get better informed. I get my information from peer-reviewed, randomized, controlled scientific studies, not from dog food bags. I don't have his permission to share his email, and I don't ... The World's Most Deadly Animal Animals can be hazardous to human health. When asked to name the most dangerous animal, many people will give the wrong answer. Sharks have captured the attention of the public, and other animals that kill people may come to mind, such as black widow spiders, rabid dogs, and venomous snakes. And don't forget the human ... Number-One Pharmacist Recommended Some drugs are being marketed with the claim that they are the number-one recommendation of pharmacists. This is unfortunate. A minority of pharmacists have received additional training in clinical pharmacy and provide direct patient care as part of a team of health care providers managing complex cases. Most pharmacists have not had such training and ... The Science (and Pseudoscience) of Aging Some animals (such as hydras and some jellyfish) can apparently live forever, but we humans are all going to die. Longevity is desirable, but aging\u2014a slow process of deterioration\u2014is not. Hearing declines (half of those older than seventy-five have disabling hearing loss), as does visual acuity (by age eighty, 70 percent of white Americans have ...This article is available for free to all. A Disappointing Testimonial for Whole Body Cryotherapy As a longtime subscriber to Reader's Digest, I love the jokes and enjoy the stories, but I don't trust their forays into science. I was particularly disturbed by an \"I tried it\" feature on whole body cryotherapy (WBC) in the latest issue (December 2021/January 2022). The writer starts by saying doctors have known the power ... Two New Promising COVID-19 Drugs - Analysis and Questions The COVID-19 pandemic isn't over yet. Despite the success of vaccines, people continue to get the disease. Most cases are in the unvaccinated, but even those who have been fully vaccinated can have \"breakthrough\" infections. Relief appears to be in sight. Two new antiviral drugs promise effective treatment in pill form. Well-designed randomized controlled clinical ... UPWalker: A $649 Solution for a Non-Problem Sometimes TV commercials are more entertaining than the programs. My husband and I laugh every time we see the commercials for the UPWalker on TV. According to their website: \"Unlike walkers that force you to hunch over putting painful pressure on your wrists and back, the UPWalker is designed to support you in a secure ... Do Surgeons Who Wear N95 Masks Have Lower Oxygen Levels and Make More Mistakes? An individual who was both an anti-vaxxer and anti-masker claimed that \"studies were done that show that surgeons who wore N95 masks for extended periods of time were shown to have decreased oxygen levels and were more prone to mistakes.\" His argument was \"imagine what that would do to kids who were forced to wear masks all day ... Observational Studies and Experimental Studies Medical research studies can be divided into two types: observational and experimental. Observational studies simply observe the effect of a variable in a population. They can assess the strength of a relationship, for instance between dietary factors and disease. Are vegetarians less likely to develop cancer? Are patients treated with a new diabetes drug less ... Living with Uncertainty Uncertainty is uncomfortable. It is only natural to want certainty. It is more comfortable to be certain and wrong than to be uncertain. Like anyone else, I would like to be comfortable, but I think truth matters. I'd rather be uncertain than wrong; wouldn't you? As Voltaire said, \"Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty ... Green-Lipped Mussels for Arthritis What are green-lipped mussels? My imagination conjures up a SpongeBob SquarePants episode featuring a clam-like creature with green lips, and I can't help wondering what would happen if they applied red lipstick? Imagination can be fun; but to get back to reality, green-lipped mussels are a shellfish naturally found in New Zealand and now cultivated ... The FDA Blundered When It Approved Alzheimer Drug The FDA has a difficult job. It is understaffed and underfunded. It has to walk a very fine line between prematurely approving a new drug that may turn out to be useless or even harmful and rejecting or delaying approval of a drug when earlier approval might have been saving lives. On the whole, I ... Illness, Healing, and Other Terms That Can Be Confusing Disease vs. Illness The words disease and illness are often used interchangeably, but their meanings are very different. Diseases are biomedical entities that cause impairment of the normal functioning of the body, while illness refers to the way a patient experiences a sickness. There can be disease without illness and illness without disease. Diseases may ...This article is available for free to all. Vaccine Refusers Are Not Stupid We now have several vaccines for COVID-19. They have been adequately tested. They are safe and effective; and as more people have gotten vaccinated, infection rates, hospitalization rates, and death rates have fallen. Herd immunity may be in sight. Getting vaccinated seems like a no-brainer, but there are still a lot of people who are ... Does Public Water Fluoridation Make Children Less Intelligent? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named community water fluoridation one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century. In a recent statement, the American Dental Association (ADA) stressed that it is \"committed to fluoridation of public water supplies as the single most effective public health measure to help prevent tooth ...This article is available for free to all. COVID-19 Tests: Can You Trust the Results? If your COVID-19 test was negative, can you breathe a sigh of relief? What if it's a false negative? If it was positive, is that reliable evidence of infection or might it be a false positive result? How trustworthy are these tests? As with so much in science, the answer is complicated; it's not a ... Critical Thinking about Sports I found the title of The Skeptic's Guide to Sports Science: Confronting Myths of the Health and Fitness Industry a bit misleading. I was expecting to find a list of sports myths debunked by scientific evidence, but what I found was much better. It does debunk several sports-related myths, but the majority of the book ...This article is available for free to all. No, No, No, NO! Testimonials Are Not Evidence! We are programmed to respond to testimonials. Blame evolution. For most of human history, we had only two ways to learn about the world: our own observations and what other people told us about their experiences. Gathering information from others gave us a survival advantage. Unfortunately, those testimonials can be unreliable. We now have something ... Hypnosis Revisited Is hypnosis for real? Do people actually go into a trance, or is it just a matter of imagination and role playing? Some people swear by it. One website proclaims that your mind power is limitless: The highly focused, yet deeply relaxed state of mind achieved via hypnosis yields many great benefits, digging to the ... 'Clinically Tested'\u2014What Does that Mean? They used to call useless treatments \"snake oil.\" We don't hear that term anymore; now they may be called \"dietary supplements\" or \"natural remedies.\" A dietary supplement may contain a single herb or a combination of several ingredients. The ads frequently say they have been \"clinically tested\" or \"clinically proven.\" Do you believe that? I ... Self Esteem Is Overrated Most people believe that fostering self-esteem in children will have many benefits, from happiness to better school performance, but that belief is not supported by the evidence. We are encouraged to reward children and not punish them, to praise them not only for real accomplishments but also for trivial successes and even failures (\"everybody's a ... Ayurveda: Ancient Superstition, Not Science Alternative medicine includes modalities such as acupuncture and chiropractic that are widely accepted despite the evidence for their effectiveness being far from convincing. It also includes lesser known systems of treatment. In the United States, the practice of Ayurveda is not licensed or regulated by any state, although Deepak Chopra has done much to publicize ...This article is available for free to all. Adele's Sirtfood Diet I recently got an email newsletter from TRC Natural Medicines. One of the articles was \"Understanding the Hype Behind Adele's Sirtfood Diet.\" It's brief enough to quote in its entirety: \"English singer-songwriter Adele has made headlines in recent months for her dramatic weight loss. You might start getting questions about the diet she followed\u2014it's called the ... Don't Ice Sprains Ankle sprains are common; as a family physician, I treated a lot of them. My most memorable ankle sprain patient was a young woman I saw during my residency training. Doctors had diagnosed a sprain.
