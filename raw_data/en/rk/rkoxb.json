Making Acupressure Part Of Your Routine [Read more] Meet The Instructor Paige grew up in Vancouver, Canada and became passionate about Alternative Medicine after having several remarkable experiences with it at a young age. After High School she enrolled in Canada's first Holistic Nutrition program and graduated a Registered Holistic Nutritionist. From there she traveled extensively through Asia where her passion blossomed into studies as she began taking an interest in Ayurveda, ancient East Indian medicine. After living in India for several months she moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico to pursue her Ayurvedic training further studying alongside the famous Dr. Vasant Lad at his Ayurvedic Institute. Following Ayurveda, Paige studied Psychology at the University of Colorado and began to assimilate what she had learned of Eastern Medicine with Western Psychology. Understanding that disease in the body is most often attributed to disharmony within the psyche/emotions, a concept called \"Psychosomatic Illness\", Paige was drawn to the integrative philosophy of Traditional Chinese Medicine where everything is believed to be connected. She started the rigorous 4-year Masters of Science in Traditional Oriental Medicine degree at Pacific College of Oriental Medicine's San Diego campus and finished at their New York City campus, her new found love and home.
