Email: scgeorge@uci.edu Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality around the world. Despite some success, traditional anticancer drugs developed to reduce tumor growth face important limitations primarily due to undesirable bone marrow and cardiovascular toxicity. Many drugs fail in clinical development after showing promise in preclinical trials, suggesting that the available in vitro and animal models are poor predictors of drug efficacy and toxicity in humans. Thus, novel models that more accurately mimic the biology of human organs are necessary for high-throughput drug screening. Three-dimensional (3D) microphysiological systems can utilize induced pluripotent stem cell technology, tissue engineering, and microfabrication techniques to develop tissue models of human tumors, cardiac muscle, and bone marrow on the order of 1 mm3in size. A functional network of human capillaries and microvessels to overcome diffusion limitations in nutrient delivery and waste removal can also nourish the 3D microphysiological tissues. Importantly, the 3D microphysiological tissues are grown on optically clear platforms that offer non-invasive and non- destructive image acquisition with subcellular resolution in real time. Such systems offer a new paradigm for high-throughput drugscreening and will significantly improve the efficiency of identifying new drugs for cancer treatment that minimize cardiac and bone marrow toxicity.

DOI: 10.1177/1535370214525295 Introduction Current drug screening methods usually rely on two- dimensional (2D) systems or animal models for assessment of toxicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and organ system effects. While 2D cell culture lacks the inher-ent complexity of in vivo tissues in three-dimensional (3D) arrangements, the intrinsically different biology of animal models fails to capture the human-specific response todrugs. To more accurately simulate the in vivo physiologic human response to pharmacologic challenge, it is highly desirable to replicate the complex 3D arrangements ofhuman cells, including, preferably, multiple organ systems and a vascular supply. The vasculature not only provides the necessary convective transport of nutrients and waste in3D culture, but it also couples and integrates the response ofthe multiple organ systems. Additionally, most drugs aredelivered to the target tissue through the microcirculation, and thus incorporation of a vasculature best mimics in vivo drug delivery. Drug delivery to a target tissue depends on the function of other organs. To achieve the desired effect of a selected drug on a given tissue, the presence of multiple organ sys- tems may be required. In chemotherapy, for example, the gastrointestinal, circulatory, and urinary systems each con- tribute to determine the pharmacokinetics of a given drug. If a drug possesses useful activity, it will be further studied for possible adverse effects on major organs. While adverse effects on the multiple organ systems throughout the body are important, current anticancer therapies are mostly lim-ited by their undesirable side effects on the immune system, the cardiovascular system, and the liver.

However, in cancer treatment it is well establishedthat the majority of antiproliferative agents used in trad-itional chemotherapy can cause myelosuppression in manner (e.g. pyrimidineanalogs, anthracyclines, methotrexate, 1The use of hematopoietic improvedthe primary acute myelosuppression observed duringanticancer treatments; 2however, in some patients these growth factors can also mask development of a latent resi-dual bone marrow injury manifested by a decrease in hem- atopoietic stem cell (HSC) reserves and an impairment in HSC self-renewal. 3Regarding the cardiovascular system, systemic anticancer therapy can to hypertension,thromboembolic events, left ventricular dysfunction, myo-cardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and pericarditis. 4-6In this regard, two types of cardiotoxicity have been well estab-lished according to the type of damage in the cardiomyo-cyte: type I-induced cardiotoxicity (e.g. induced byanthracycline), which is and myocyte death; and, type II-related cardiotoxicity(e.g. induced by trastuzumab), which is less predictablyassociated with dose, and typically correlated with revers-ible myocardial dysfunction rather than histologicalchanges or myocyte death. However, with the increase ofa wide range of new anticancer agents used in molecularlytargeted therapy, an unintended cardiotoxicity, recentlyclassified as 'off-target,' has arisen from many of these com-pounds. Off-target cardiotoxicity results from the inherentchallenge of targeting molecules such as specific kinaseinhibitors. Although inhibition of specific kinases is effect- ive in treatment of some cancers, kinase inhibitors are a relatively ubiquitous class of molecules that can uninten-tionally affect non-cancerous tissues, especially cardiactissue. This new class of drugs has increased the risk andneed for assessment of chemotherapy-associatedcardiotoxicity. 1-3,6 To address the need for improved preclinical drug tox- icity models, we are developing a system for high-through-put screening of both drug efficacy and organ-specifictoxicity. Our system features 3D tissues made entirely ofhuman cells. The tissues are connected and perfused byhuman microvessels. Initial designs incorporate tumor, car-diac, and bone marrow tissue modules that allow assess-ment of anticancer drug efficacy as well as potential sideeffects. Pharmacology Once a new drug target has been identified, a sequence ofstudies is initiated to characterize the dose-response rela-tionship prior to clinical trials. A variety of assays at themolecular, cellular, organ, and systemic levels are neededto define the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ofthe drug. Pharmacokinetics is the study of changes in drugconcentration with time due to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the drug. In contrast, pharmacodynamics is the study of the drug concentra-tion-dependent tissue or cell response. The target tissue isnormally represented by a dose-response curve. The EC 50of a drug is an index of its sensitivity or potency and refersto the concentration required to produce 50% of that drug'smaximal effect (e.g. tumor reduction or antiproliferative effect in response to an anticancer agent). The maximal effi- cacy of a drug represents the upper limit of the dose-response relation on the response axis. In cancer treatment, the same total drug dose can be delivered over different lengths of time (i.e. different dose intensities), which can impact the effect of the drug on otherorgan systems. The goal of chemotherapeutics is to achievea desired effect with minimal adverse side effects; therefore,when designing a microphysiological system for drug screening, it is important to recognize that many anticancer drugs are limited by their adverse effect on a number ofnon-cancerous tissues throughout the body. As furtherintroduced below, the proposed system recognizes that the response of cells and tissues to a pharmacologic chal- lenge is greatly influenced by the microenvironment.Table 1 categorizes a wide range of important microenvir-onmental factors that are present in the 3D architecture ofthe tissue that influence tissue response to a drug. Drug behavior in 2D versus 3D systems Differences in cell morphology, differentiation, prolifer- ation, viability, response to stimuli, metabolism, andgene/protein expression are observed when cells, previ-ously cultured in 2D, are moved to a 3D environment. 7 This is not surprising considering that human organs, with few exceptions, need 3D structure to develop their associated functions.8,9A well-known example of the neces- sity of 3D models for testing toxicity of novel therapeutics isthe culture of hepatocytes, which behave quite differently in 2D versus 3D cultures. 10 In cancer research, the idea of mimicking 3D tissue func- tionin vitro is not new. Tumor spheroids, for example, were presented nearly four decades ago.11However, given the fact that 2D systems are relatively easy to culture, provide simple assessment of cell function (e.g. protein expression), and are lower in cost, the adoption of 3D systems has beenrelatively slow. Nevertheless, recent studies have enhancedour understanding of the necessity for testing the efficacy of anticancer drugs in 3D systems. For example, among other differences, tumor cells in 3D adopt a different morphologythan in 2D, 12have different cell surface receptor expression and proliferation;13differentially regulate genes responsible for angiogenesis, cell migration, and invasion;14-16and have different extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis.17 Importantly, tumor cells in 3D also show differences in anticancer drug sensitivity. Studies have shown that cultur-ing cancer cells in 3D can shift their dose-response, some-times to the point where they become functionally resistant to the drug. For instance, culturing of cancer cells in a 3D system can lead to an increase of 20-fold or more in the EC 50 compared with 2D culture when cancer cells are exposed todoxorubicin. 18Moreover, recent studies suggest that 3D models, unlike 2D culture, more accurately predict acquired drug resistance.19Drugs that target molecular pathways have shown differences in activation or inhibitiondepending on the 3D architecture of the local2 Experimental Biology and Medicine................... ................... stage] Table 1 Drug testing of tumor cells cultured in 3D Tumor cell line Outcome of drug treatment Refs.

This higher resistance may be related to a decrease in the reduced folate carrier drug transporter when cells are cultured in 3D.Peters et al.109 (continued)4 Experimental Biology and addition, the ECM can significantly affect the antimigratory effect of some drugs.23,24These examples demonstrate that tumor cell biology in 3D culture is significantly different than 2D, leading to differences in drug efficacy. Although in vitro , the results in 3D culture may be more representative of the way cancer cells in vivo respond to chemotherapeutic treatment. Table 1 summarizes and highlights the role that the ECM, stromal cells (e.g. fibroblasts), vasculature, and other factors present in the tumor microenvironment can play in modulating drug response, sensitivity, and drug resistance. The drug response differences between 2D and 3D models suggest that pathways necessary for survival in a 3D environment may not be activated in 2D. As a result,drug screening performed on 2D monolayers can increase the false-positive and false-negative rates of investigational compounds. While false-positive results can increase failure of drugs in clinical trials, false-negatives discard potentially effective drugs. The use of 3D microphysiological systems is predicted to reduce the rate of false-positive and false- negative outcomes, thereby reducing the need for animal testing and improving the overall efficiency of drug discovery. Drug panel and strategy for validation Microphysiological systems need to exhibit drug responses that parallel those seen in vivo . Our strategy for validating tissue responses includes a panel of common drugs (Table 2). The panel distinguishes drugs considered to be traditional chemotherapy from those that can be classified as molecularly targeted therapy and considers known andpoorly understood cardiac muscle and bone marrow tox- icity. The panel also recognizes other important observedeffects in order to validate, predict, and better understand the response, toxicity, and effectiveness of the drug. Design of in vitro microphysiological systems To address the numerous potential side effects of anticancer drugs on multiple tissues and organ systems, robust in vitro microphysiological systems have been developed for pre-clinical high-throughput screening of candidate drugs. These systems need to mimic critical functions and anatom- ical features of in vivo tissues to generate an appropriate response to a pharmacologic challenge. It is important tonote that because of the complex nature of in vivo tissues, it may be impractical and unnecessary to mimic all the func- tions and architecture of in vivo tissues. In this view, an optimal level of anatomical complexity that has bearingon drug distribution and response of in vivo tissues needs to be reflected in the microphysiological systems. Each specific organ system presents unique challenges to correlate in vitro performance with in vivo physiology and pathology associated with anticancer drugs. The followingsections discuss the critical features of major organ systems and their anticancer drug-related behavior. Methods for mimicking these features in vitro within the proposed microphysiological platform are also presented.

Thus, to replicate the complex 3D arrangement of cells and ECM, human microphysiological systems must include a vasculature made of perfused vessels that possessa physiologic flow. The molecular transport across the vas-cular wall into normal tissues is largely driven by diffusion, but limited convection also takes place primarily in capil- laries. Vascular permeability varies considerably amongdifferent tissues and factorssuch as blood flow. 28Vascular permeability undergoes sig- nificant changes in pathological conditions such as wound healing, chronic inflammatory diseases, and cancer.25 Unlike arteries and veins, capillaries consist of little more than a layer of endothelial cells (ECs) and connective tissue,along with a sparse covering of pericytes. They lack thesmooth muscle cells that are present around the major ves-sels, arteries, and veins. The ECs are embedded in a 3D microenvironment that mainly consists of a collagen- based ECM and pericytes, and is influenced by biochemical(i.e. growth factors) and physical (i.e. shear stress) forces.Mimicking this complex microenvironment in vitro is a major challenge in vascular research. ECs are responsible for regulating a variety of functions including vascular tone,inflammation, coagulation, and sprouting of vasodila-tory, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, These functions are controlled mainly by secreted factors from the EC. 29In this context, since ECs are mostly quiescent under physiological conditions, thedevelopment of new anticancer treatments is also directedtoward targeting cell signaling pathways involved in patho- logical EC proliferation and migration. 5By targeting endo- thelium, the vascular supply to tumor tissue can bereduced, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Antiangiogenicdrugs are mostly targeted to the vascular endothelialgrowth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. These drugs often have VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) as a common target. However, VEGF does not only help new vessels to grow, butit also protects existing blood vessels. Thus, due to disrup-tion of VEGF signaling, many of these drugs are associated with a predictable risk of hypertension and coagulation that can lead to vascular dysfunction and thrombosis,respectively. 4,7,30 Tumor tissue Tumor cells have a remarkable ability to evolve in response to communication with the microenvironment. In this view,drug testing merely on isolated cancer cells is insufficient for a reliable estimation of drug efficacy in humans. The quest to develop improved models has progressed from2D cancer cell culture to 3D tumor spheroids made up ofcancer cells and 3D tumor spheroids composed of a mixtureof cancer and stromal cells. 31-33However, these models lack perfused vasculature and are limited in their ability to mimic the in vivo microenvironment critical for modeling drug delivery. Hence, we believe in vitro tumors with per- fused capillaries, embedded in naturally occurring ECM,will produce improved drug screening studies.It is widely accepted that tumors actively communicate with vasculature to fulfill their growing metabolicdemands, and in some cases to metastasize. Such commu-nication brings several changes in vasculature, includingangiogenesis that lymphatic vasculature of tumors is generally dysfunctional.34,36,37Together, these conditions are believed to increase the interstitial fluid pressure oftumors and consequently, increase the interstitial fluidflow from the tumor into surrounding tissue. 34,38,39As a result, in vivo tumors display uneven distribution of cyto- kines, nutrition, and drugs across the tissue, posing a majorchallenge for efficient drug delivery. 34,38-40Therefore, to simulate a variety flow and pressure conditions, drugscreening platforms need to have control over spatiotem-poral resolution of interstitial flow and pressure in tumor- on-chip devices. The inefficient vascular supply to tissues and increased growth rate create hypoxic conditions in certain regions oftumors. As a result, the microenvironment remains acidic,adversely affecting the action of many chemotherapeuticdrugs as reviewed elsewhere. 41,42Hypoxia also promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which is marked byincreased motility of cancer cells and results into invasion ofsurrounding tissue. 43Further, hypoxia is believed to pro- mote chemotherapeutic drug resistance in cancer cells bygene expression products such as P-glycoprotein. 44Hence, thein vitro tumors need to grow under hypoxic conditions closer to that experienced in vivo . We, and others, have pre- viously developed a protocol for creating normal tissuesthat are perfused with dynamic vasculature under hypoxicand non-hypoxic conditions. Interstitial flow and pressure, cellular behavior, drug dis- tribution, and, in turn, drug efficacy are influenced by ECM,which constitutes a major part of the tumor tissue. Tumorsare characterized by stiff ECM, which is typically composedof collagen, fibronectin, glycosaminoglycans, and proteo-glycans. 48,49The active role of tumor ECM in cell signaling, as well as creating chemical and mechanical cues for cell migration, is reviewed elsewhere.48,50Interestingly, it has been shown that it is possible to extract acellular ECMfrom in vivo tumors, 51,52and it is also possible to achieve collagen of varying stiffness by mixing it with other natur-ally occurring ECM such as fibrin. We believe such strate-gies could be implemented to create microphysiologicaltumor tissue. Apart from the constituents of the tumor microenviron- ment discussed earlier, other major components areimmune cells and tumor-associated fibroblasts. 50,53,54We and others have shown that fibroblasts secrete factors necessary for creating perfused vasculature,46,47,55and, recognizing this fact, our current model of perfused net-work includes fibroblasts. 45,47However, for the future advancement of the in vitro tumor model, appropriate tumor-associated fibroblasts may be needed. Among theimmune cells, tumor-associated macrophages are perhapsthe most significant cells as they affect a plethora of cancerprocesses, including angiogenesis, invasion, and metasta-sis, 50,53,56and, importantly, they also adversely affect Experimental Biology and Medicine................... ................... future advance- ment of microphysiological tumor tissue, it is important to integrate immune cells, particularly macrophages, on organ-on-chip platforms. Cardiac tissue Cardiotoxicity and altered cardiac function have been iden- tified as significant side effects of anticancer drugs.4,57-60At the cellular level, anticancer drugs can cause DNA damage,adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, apoptotic protein release, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, electro- lyte imbalance, lipid accumulation, and myocytedeath. 4,59-61At the tissue level, these effects manifest as vasospasm, changes in force and frequency of contraction, and modified electrophysiology.4,59As a result of these cell and tissue level effects, whole organ pathologies, such as left ventricular dysfunction, heart rea- lized. These cardiac dysfunctions are often not discovered until clinical trials primarily due to limitations in current drug screening models. Similar to the previous discussion,cardiac animal models provide whole heart response to drugs, but many drugs have human specific effects. The key features of a microphysiological cardiac tissue system are as follows: (1) Use of a cardiac-specific matrix creates a 3D environment with the appropriate tissue-specific architecture to induce the formation of tissue that better mimics in vivo physiology and pathology. 63(2) All cells are of human origin allowing assessment of humancell-specific drug responses. With further development of lineage-specific differentiation protocols, all cells implanted in the device may be derived from the same induced pluri-potent stem cell line allowing for genetic homogeneity, and thus patient-specific responses, throughout the tissue com- partments. (3) Tissues exhibit synchronous and rhythmicspontaneous contraction that allows detection of alterations in electrophysiological and contractile properties. Together, these properties represent the most critical parameters for ahigh-throughput cardiac tissue module for the screening of drug-induced cardiac side effects. Bone marrow Toxicity of pharmacological agents toward HSCs is a major problem for many therapeutic strategies, including cancer chemotherapy. 64,65Many antineoplastic drugs directly target the machinery of cell proliferation and thus alsotarget HSC, which can be either quiescent, undergoing self-renewal, or differentiating into erythroid, myeloid, or lymphoid progenitors, or they may target more committedprogenitors downstream of HSC. 66This results in immuno- suppression, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and many patients develop infections as a result. Blood transfusionscan reverse anemia, and neutropenia can be addressed by treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). However, in severe cases of myelosuppression,patients have to undergo bone marrow transplantation - either restoration of autologous HSC removed before the start of chemotherapy or by allogeneic transplantation.Identifying new anticancer drugs that do not target HSC and their descendants is thus a priority. HSC reside in the bone marrow in a specialized niche composed primarily of ECM, osteoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and vascular ECs. A hematopoietic microphysio-logical system will need to contain each of these cellularelements and the matrix will need to be extracted from bone marrow to ensure the presence of necessary extracel- lular cues. It is essential that the system will model the fol-lowing: (1) the maintenance of healthy HSCs that undergorenewal, (2) the generation of lymphoid lineage cells, (3) the generation of erythroid lineage cells, (4) the generation of myeloid lineage cells, and (5) the release of these cells into acirculatory system - the 'blood.' Incorporation of animmune compartment, specifically a hematopoietic com- partment, into any platform of integrated microphysiologi- cal systems will provide obvious advantages in anticancerdrug-screening strategies. Platform design considerations Individual modules of microphysiological systems mimick- ing critical organ functions can be developed separatelyand integrated to produce a platform for drug screening (Figure 1(a) and (b)). Such a platform should have the fol- lowing features: biocompatible, flexible, high-throughput,reproducible design, easy fabrication, affordable, and asmall footprint. Using soft lithography, it is possible to fabricate polydi- methylsiloxane (PDMS) devices with micron range features reproducibly and precisely. In short, the process of fabrica-tion involves the following: a master mold is created byphotolithography on silicon wafers that are spin coated with SU8 and PDMS is poured on the master mold. Features of the mold are impressed on polymerizedPDMS, which can be attached to another PDMS sheet orglass in a leakproof manner by using plasma treatment. 45,47 PDMS microdevices can be designed to create high-throughput platforms and the designs can be easily alteredto incorporate tissue-specific requirements, such as absorp-tive interface for gut tissue. Further, PDMS devices are bio- compatible, flexible, affordable, and our current designs can be adapted to create about 100 microtissues per 75 cm 2area. Moreover, by manipulating length and/or cross sectionalarea of microfluidic channels, it is also easy to maintain physiologic pressure drops across the tissue over time per- iods exceeding 2 weeks. 67Importantly, PDMS is optically clear, offering a non-invasive system of real-time tissue ima-ging with a high degree of spatial resolution. Our group has recently reported successful creation of perfused vascular networks in PDMS microdevices by allowing self-assembly endothelial colonyforming cell derived-endothelial cells and stromal fibro-blasts in a naturally occurring ECM. 45,68These tissues were formed in a PDMS device consisting of 0.1 mm2 tissue chamber, which was fed with microfluidic channels on either side of the tissue chamber, which mimicked arter-ial and venular supply to the tissue (Figure 1(a)). Significantly, the tissues were maintained in a medium without exogenous addition of VEGF or bFGF (primaryHeylman et al. A strategy for systems 9................. factors for ECs fibroblasts, respectively) and under physiologic oxygen concentration. These studieshave shown that using microtechnology, it is possible to achieve an intricate balance of biochemical and mechanical cues, and cell-cell communication to generate anatomicalfeatures of inter-connected capillary networks. Importantly,once the microvascular network is developed and anasto-mosed to the PDMS microfluidic channels, the tissue is fedonly with the microvascular flow. This feature of the system is particularly important because it allows control over mor- phogen delivery to tissues via the vasculature. Also, flowthrough the vasculature can be controlled by simply alter-ing the hydrostatic pressure gradient. 67-69Thus, this tech- nology has opened a plethora of opportunities fordeveloping organ systems mimicking in vivo tissues for drug screening platforms. This technology can be extended to create vascularized tumor, cardiac, reproductive, and other major organ sys-tems incorporating the cells of specific organs that mimiccritical functions of the organ. An example of a microphy-siological system module with appropriateinstrumentation, such as a fluid pressure sensor, pump, and oxygenation system, is shown in Figure 1(a) and (b).To grow microtissues in a microdevice, organ-specific cells, ECs, and other stromal cells are initially mixed with ECM gels and the mixture is seeded in the microdevice (Figure1(a)). The microtissue is initially nourished by interstitialflow controlled by a pressure gradient across the microflui-dic channels. Once the microtissue is vascularized, and thevasculature anastomoses with the high and low pressure microfluidic lines (Figure 1(a) and (b)), the tissue is com- pletely nourished by the vasculature. To integrate prevascularized organ systems on an inte- grated drug screening platform, the modules will beequipped with connector valves, which will allow modulesto be daisy-chained for system-wide integration (Figure 1(a)). These modules can be connected so as to broadly mimic the human circulation in which the tissuechambers are connected by the circulation in parallel(Figure 1(b)). Important considerations for integration arecompatible tissue culture media for all tissues on the plat-form and relative scale of the tissues. Since most primary Figure 1 A prototype drug screening platform. (a) The microphysiological systems are developed in a central tissue chamber of individual modules. These micr o- tissues are initially nourished by interstitial flow and later by a perfused capillary network. The medium is pumped around a microfluidic network an d is oxygenated through a bubble chamber. A pressure regulator controls 'arterial' pressure. Input and output channels on the arterial and venous side, respectivel y, allow mixing of fresh medium into the system. Individual tissue modules can be connected like jigsaw pieces, and connector valves allow 'anastomosis' of microfluid ic channels. (b) Microfluidic channels are lined by EC and these anastomose with the microvessels in the tissue chamber to form a continuous vascular network linking a ll of the organs. (c) An example of how the major organs with a tumor might be placed such that their perfusion is in parallel to each other. (A color version of this figure i s available in the online journal.)10 Experimental Biology and Medicine................... ................... systems need a specialized medium for cell sur- vival, differentiation, and growth, a universal medium sup-plemented with organ-specific growth factors needs to bedeveloped. Previously, it was shown that mixing two ormore specialized growth media can be used to facilitatefunction and growth of cells in co-cultures. 70-72 To simulate the integrated function of various organs on the organ-on-chip platform, it is necessary to appropriatelyscale these systems, the strategies for which are recentlyreviewed. 73,74The scaling is critical because the vascular blood supply (determined as percent cardiac output of theblood supply) per unit mass of organ varies considerablyamong various organs, significantly differing the amount ofdrug received by the organs. For drug screening platforms,the appropriate scaling parameters are the blood supply perunit mass and relative mass of an organ system with respectto other organ systems. These are required to maintain simi-larity with the in vivo organs. Notably, it may not be possible to maintain the relative mass of some of the organs, particu-larly skeletal muscle and adipose tissue whose masses aregreater than 500 times the mass of testis/ovaries. 75In such cases, the morphogen or concentrations on the arterial sideof the flow of particular organ systems may be modified toaccommodate the scaling parameter. The organ-on-chip platforms can be analyzed at molecu- lar, cellular, tissue, and systemic level functional endpoints.The greatest advantage of the platform material is that it isoptically clear and does not interfere with wavelengths oflight required for fluorescence or bright field imaging. Thisfeature allows non-invasive image-based measurement ofparameters relevant to drug-induced endpoints patho-genesis, such as fluorescent lifetime imaging of metabolicstate, 76assessment of calcium handling using calcium sen- sitive proteins77or calcium dyes,78electrophysiology moni- toring pacing,80perfusion, and vascular permeability. The organ-on-chip platform also allows easy collection ofcirculating media to analyze for soluble factors.Importantly, it is also possible to isolate each micro-organfor genomic or proteomic analysis as each microtissue ismaintained in a separate tissue chamber. Incorporation of other organ systems Our device has been designed specifically to address theeffects of anticancer drugs in vascular, tumor, cardiac, andbone marrow tissues. However, other organ systems havealso demonstrated significant response to anticancer drugsand are important to consider as modules in future iter-ations of the device. The general approach and method-ology of our proposed modular platform is easilyadaptable to other tissue systems. The gastrointestinaltract (GI), 81,82liver,83kidneys,84nervous system,85,86skel- have anticancer drug-related pathologies. Key features of developing a GI module include analogs of the small intestine (primary site of drug absorption) andthe liver (primary site of drug metabolism). Small intestinetissue is comprised of a simple epithelium with absorptivecells and three different secretory lineages. Mimicry of thisepithelium will require engineering of a similar epithelium to provide selective barrier function through which circu-lating media can pass. This will filter drug compoundsaccordingly and secrete the appropriate factors into thetissue microenvironment. Liver tissue is complex and con-sists of different zones with specific enzyme activity (phaseI and phase II enzymes). 91A major factor that regulates the enzyme activity in these zones is oxygen tension (i.e. vari-able distance from the closest blood vessel). 92To mimic liver function in a small microphysiological system compart-ment, an oxygen gradient will need to be establishedwithin the compartment to achieve the differential phase Iand phase II enzyme activity in hepatocytes. Directionalflow across the oxygen gradient will be necessary toexpose candidate drugs to the appropriate sequence ofenzymes to ensure that drugs are metabolized as they arein vivo . Kidney compartments will need to mimic the main kidney functions of waste removal and metabolite excretionin the urine. Renal tubule epithelial cells are especially sus-ceptible to toxic substances and are the critical cell thatcoordinates the secretion of waste products (includingmetabolized drug compounds) and the reabsorption ofnecessary nutrients. 93In vivo , both of these objectives are achieved by a counter-current mass exchanger. Thus, anengineered in vitro compartment could mimic this exchan- ger using microfluidics and a selectively permeable mem-brane, similar to that used in renal dialysis, 94coated with renal tubule epithelial cells. Nervous tissue modules will require blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier analogs tosimulate the specialized barrier properties that regulateaccess to microglia, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astro-cytes. Attempts at BBB reconstitution have been incompletethus far, but the proper shear stress resulting from bloodflow, as provided by our platform, is widely regarded as akey feature. 95 A skeletal muscle module will include contractile tissue and secretion of metabolically active factors into the vascu-lar circuit. Appropriate secretion of metabolically active fac-tors, such as interleukin-6, is necessary for hormonalcommunication and potential effects on drug metabolism. 96 In addition, the contractile tissue will require exogenouselectrical stimulation since certain anticancer drugs affectneuromuscular activity. 97 Gonad compartments will require both a testis and an ovary model. Drug effects on the testis and ovary can beprofound and can influence not only immediate reproduct-ive output, but can also have long-term effects on gametes.The main components necessary to mimic are: (1) the main-tenance of spermatogonial stem cells in the testis, (2) thedevelopment of ovarian follicles in the ovary, (3) recreationof the blood-testis barrier in males, and (4) secretion of thesex hormones testosterone and estrogen. Conclusion The need for improved methods of screening for anticancerdrugs prior to clinical trials is apparent. We have developeda strategy to create a platform that incorporates 3D tissueHeylman et al. A strategy for integrating essential three-dimensional microphysiological systems 11................. modules from multiple organ systems to assess the efficacy, as well as the potential side effects, of anticancer drugs.These tissues are comprised entirely of human cells, areperfused by a microvasculature, and mimic the in vivo fea- tures of vascular drug delivery and tissue response. The tissues are incorporated into a microfluidic device thatallows control of multiple parameters that affect tissuephysiology and drug response, as well as non-invasivemonitoring of tissue state. The device is currently com- prised of vascular, tumor, cardiac, and bone marrow tissues and is designed to allow for expansion of the system toinclude additional tissue modules. This in vitro approach represents a significant advance in the ability to identifypotential adverse effects of anticancer treatment wellbefore they reach clinical trials.
