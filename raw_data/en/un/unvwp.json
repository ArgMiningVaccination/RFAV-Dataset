As parents and students prepare for a return to campus, here are some frequently asked questions regarding Northeastern's vaccination requirement. On January 5, Northeastern was the first university in Massachusetts to begin vaccinating its community. However, due to limited federal supply, in late February the state of Massachusetts decided to prioritize vaccine distribution to its mass vaccination sites and is no longer providing vaccine to higher education institutions. If you are eligible for vaccination now under the state's three-phased approach, we recommend that you schedule your vaccination at one of the sites listed on mass.gov/vaccine. Beginning in the fall academic term, all students attending Northeastern University's campuses will be expected to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the first day of classes. You can find additional information in the university's announcement of the new policy. The health and wellbeing of our community is what drives our decisions. We believe that for students in a close-knit, residential environment vaccination is essential. All of the scientific evidence to date shows that the vaccines currently in use in the US, Canada, and the UK are safe and effective. We believe this decision will withstand any legal challenges. We are requiring the Covid vaccine for the same reason we require students to be vaccinated for Measles or Meningitis\u2014to protect our community. At this point, vaccination is proving to be the best way to control and ultimately defeat the Covid-19 pandemic. It is the best tool we have for advancing the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff. Students with legitimate religious or medical exemptions will be accommodated. The COVID-19 vaccine is mandatory only for students. All students are expected to arrive on campus in September fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical or religious exemption. The university is planning to return to a normal, in-person fall semester with in-person classes and regular campus activities. Details on how to submit your proof of vaccination will be announced. Students may request religious and medical exemptions to the policy. Details on how to request an exemption will be announced. Northeastern will continue to carefully monitor vaccine access and supply across our global network locations, especially as we approach the start of the fall term. We strongly encourage you to get the vaccine as soon as it becomes available to you. For international students who may have limited access to the vaccine, Northeastern will assist you in getting the vaccine soon after your arrival. Northeastern will continue to monitor and follow CDC guidelines when it comes to health and safety protocols like mask-wearing, hand-washing, and healthy distancing. All health and safety requirements, including testing, remain in place until further notice. Yes. If possible, you should plan to get tested the day before your vaccination appointment in the interest of keeping yourself and others safe. Yes, based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Until experts learn more about the protection the vaccine provides, the CDC recommends that people continue to use face masks, wash hands often, and stay at least six feet away from others. No. At this time, people who get the vaccine should continue with their required COVID-19 testing. Northeastern follows MDPH guidelines on this question: If a fully vaccinated person is exposed to someone with COVID-19 but has no symptoms, they are not required to quarantine. However, it is critical to monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 and to avoid being in close contact with others for 14 days following an exposure, even if they are fully vaccinated. If they experience symptoms, they should indicate the symptoms on the Daily Wellness Check, isolate themselves from others, speak to a member of the Northeastern Wellness Team, and be tested for COVID-19. You will need to get a vaccine approved in the country where you'll be taking classes. Please see the vaccine FAQs on the Northeastern Bay area website.
