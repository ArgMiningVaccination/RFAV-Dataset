Gradually, they began a silent minuet, turning, tumbling, twisting. Now, as if shaping a clump of clay, his hands pounded, then undulated across an invisible surface. On a table before him, the legs of a prone patient, his eyes closed, rose slowly, first one, then the other, as if in response to the the doctor's motions. For 15 minutes, like limbs of a string puppet, the patient's arms and legs rose and fell as the doctor pushed and pulled at the air between them. Dr. Yang Baotang is a master of ''qigong,'' a form of traditional Chinese medicine. ''Through qigong,'' Dr. Yang explained, ''a powerful force, my 'qi,' comes from my hand and the patient will feel it inside his body. The 'qi' moves from my body and has a physical effect on the patient.'' A Vital Force For millenia, ''qi'' has been discussed in Chinese philosophical texts. Although the word eludes precise translation, Western scholars have settled on the term ''vital force'' as a way of conveying the sense of a powerful spirit that vitalizes life. Shortly after dawn, in cities and towns throughout China, in groups and alone, people practice a form of exercise and calisthenics that is loosely called ''qigong.'' It is intended to invigorate the ''qi.'' The masters who practice curative and therapeutic qigong explain their skill as a concentrated harnessing of this vital force coupled with an ability to project that force into patients. They masters are reported to have had success in treating certain cardiac diseases, some forms of paralysis, motion sickness and some neurological disorders. ''Other doctors, of course, think this is very strange,'' said Dr. Yang, who also holds a medical degree in Western medicine. ''It is not easy to explain.'' With a nationwide resurgence of traditional medical practices like acupuncture and herbal medications, qigong is emerging from an intellectual and political oblivion that had forced its medical practitioners into reclusion by the end of the Cultural Revolution. Research to Explain It There are now 26 qigong clinics in China, and serious research is attempting to explain the phenomenon. Indeed, the Nuclear Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghaihas reported that ''qi'' resembles a low-frequency infrared electromagnetic wave. There are no data on the number of qigong masters, but Dr. Yang believes the number has dwindled to a mere handful. ''The people who really have attained a high level of qigong, I would think there are not more than 20 in the whole country,'' he said. Dr. Yang has both a clinical and research practice at the Chinese Academy of Traditional Medicine at the Xiyuan Hospital in Beijing, one of the country's most prestigious traditional medical facilities. Today, with the dramatic intellectual liberalization, Dr. Yang says he focuses his practice exclusively on treating patients through qigong while conducting research in an effort to understand its apparent success. Through Chinese history, the technique and practice of qigong has usually been transmitted from father to son, which was how Dr. Yang learned it. 'Always the Son Was Taught' ''In China, these sorts of skills were always taught secretly, always the son was taught, not the daughter,'' Dr. Yang said. ''When I was born, and turned out to be a son, my grandfather was extraordinarily happy. He was a master of qigong, but he had work as guard for wealthy people. My grandfather began giving me qigong after I stopped nursing. In this way, my grandfather projected his own ''qi'' into my body.'' ''It is not easy for one man to control the energy of qigong if there is not a good foundation,'' continued Dr. Yang. ''Even if you exercise for many years, if there is no foundation, it cannot easily be controlled.'' Two keys to this control, he said, were constant practice of qigong exercises, in the same way every time, and the influence of a teacher who imbues the student with his own qigong. The practice of qigong, Dr. Yang said, is rooted in a formidable philosophical and textual tradition dating at least to the fourth century B.C. Virtually every major Chinese thinker has grappled with the concept of qi, although more as an element in a broader philosophic scheme than as a therapeutic technique. According to Dr. Yang, the use of qi in medical practice relies on classical notions of Chinese health, that the body is suffused with two sorts of channels, called ''jing'' and ''luo,'' along which the vital force, or qi, flows and also along which acupuncture points are located. ''The ancient way of qigong is to move the qi through these channels,'' Dr. Yang explained. ''The doctor's qi moves through his own channels and is transmitted to the patient. The patient reacts. I react to the patient's movements and respond with my own qi. This is an actual thing.'' 'I Did Exercises in Secret' Dr. Yang attended medical school in Hebei Province and worked for nearly a decade in Inner Mongolia as a physician. In the early years of the Cultural Revolution, when anything associated with traditions was under attack, Dr. Yang said he told no one of his knowledge of qigong. ''I did exercises in secret,'' he said. ''Publicly I stopped. But only because I did these exercises secretly could I survive this disaster.'' In 1977, a year after the Cultural Revolution was officially declared over, Dr. Yang moved here, where he first worked at a small traditional medical hospital before moving to Xiyuan Hospital and the academy in 1978. That year, a department of qigong medicine was created at the hospital and for the first time Dr. Yang had an institutional blessing for his practice. Late one evening here, a visitor accompanied Dr. Yang to the home of a paralyzed woman. The patient, who asked that her name not be used, said she had been receiving qigong treatments from Dr. Yang for nearly a year in an effort to exercise her muscles and overcome her paralysis. 'I Feel Something in My Arms' Dr. Yang began his treatment by standing in front of her, rhythmically working his hands through the air, his palms pressed outward toward her. The woman sat quietly, her eyes closed. Gradually, her arms lifted and her body began to swivel from side to side. When Dr. Yang raised his hands, her arms rose above her head. When he pushed his palms to one side, her body shifted in that direction. Dr. Yang worked with the patient for nearly half an hour. Finally, he lowered his hands and she opened her eyes. ''I can get her to move,'' Dr. Yang said. ''Every couple days I come here to do this exercise with her.'' The patient said she experienced qigong as ''a kind of force that tries to lift my arms.'' ''Sometimes it's a bit warm,'' she said. ''I feel something in my arms. I can make my arms move. I can feel something in my body.'' ''Right now my fingers cannot move,'' she continued, ''but Dr. Yang said this is the first step.'' The patient's father, a scientist, who also asked that his name not be used, said he was convinced that Dr. Yang had contributed to an improvement in his daughter's condition. Yet, he said, he found himself unable to explain how qigong worked or how to explain it within the framework of scientific inquiry to which he was accustomed. ''I don't know what it is,'' the patient's father said. ''If I was forced to say what it might be, I suppose I would say maybe it is an electromagnetic phenomenon. But I really don't know.'' Caution About Its Use Dr. Yang, a compact man with a receding hairline and black-frame glasses, said qigong had been effective in treating a range of illnesses. He said qigong had been used to treat high blood pressure, a number of heart ailments, and certain gastrointestinal, respiratory and neurological problems. He hastened to point out however, that there were many illnesses that could not be treated with qigong and that not all patients treated with the technique respond favorably. ''The same is true in Western medicine,'' he said. Uncertainty over the nature of qigong as a legitimate traditional medical technique was reflected in the hesitant manner in which the president of Xiyuan Hospital, Prof.Fang Dingya, discussed the specialty and the reluctance he exhibited in allowing Dr. Yang to demonstrate qigong or engage in an extended discussion of his practice without another member of the hospital staff being present. Later, when he was alone, Dr. Yang acknowledged that he did not enjoy the full confidence of the hospital's president. ''He has doubts,'' Dr. Yang said simply. ''There have been some changes in the acceptance of qigong, but it has been very slow. There are some high-level people in government who are paying close attention to qigong.'' Even so, Dr. Yang said, among the thousands of students in traditional medical schools, some have chosen to concentrate on qigong. ''There are an increasing number of young and middle-aged scholars as well as medical students who pay attention to qigong,'' he said. ''This is one of the valuable things in China. It "}
