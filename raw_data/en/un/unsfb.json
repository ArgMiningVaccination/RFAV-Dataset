Ms. Chambers reviewed the Quarterly Schedule 68 of Revenue and Expenditure by Licensing Program- 4th Quarter FY 2017 and 1st Quarter FY 2018 69 and Indirect Cost Methodology FY 2017. Revenue going into 2018 is $480,310. Ms. Chambers 70 reminds the Board that the bulk of revenue comes at r enewal times. MAS will have much lower 71 revenue in off years so this amount needs to carry the program for the next two years to cover staff, 72 indirect expenditures, regulations, investigations, attorney expenses, and travel . 73 74 FY 2017 CBPL Cost Allocation : 75 76 MAS 2017 $228,015 Total Revenue -153,485 Direct Expense -45,225 Indirect Expense -25,590 Percentage of Direct Personal Services $224,300 TOTAL EXPENSES $3,715 2017 Annual Surplus 77 The website has all the Quarterly Reports for all the boards. 78 79 Division Update ended with a brief discussion of HB- 90 and the costs associated.

Ed Toal was present at the Anchorage to give 230 testimony at 1:15 p.m. Mr. Toal's statement was as follows: 231 232 \"I guess my first comment is that I'm sorry we never really get to have a discussion. The structure 233 of the regulatory body is: You guys talk; I listen. Then once in a while, I get to talk; you listen. We 234 never really get that human element where we share our feelings with each other and try to come to 235 an understanding. So, that's missing and I feel like that leads to adversity. I asked to be put on the 236 agenda so we might have a bit of discussion but that didn't happen. So, I guess here I am to pour 237 more gasoline on the fire of adversity! So, you'll hear my complaints. 238 I know you're all fine people. I don't question that but I feel like somehow we're going down the 239 wrong road on this question of whether Rolf Institute graduates should be able to be licensed. I just 240 took it for granted reading the Statute, and based on what every other state is doing, that just 241 wouldn't even be a question. I feel like the reason it's become a question is based on historical 242 animosity that's developed over previous conflicts that have come up over the Board's 243 misunderstanding of the Exceptions and our (Rolfers) opposit ion to HB 110. So, I feel like we've 244 brought baggage into the discussion of the determination of whether it seems self- evident that 245 Rolfers are well trained and certainly not a danger to the Public. So the argument that Ron came up 246 with earlier, he said that \"Rolfers may not be trained in draping, ect\". And may make them a threat 247 to the public if they are licensed as massage therapists, just doesn't seem like a very good argument 248 to me. Let me go down my list and maybe I'll have some more structure to my comments. 249 There's been a lot of talk of whether the Rolf Institute is a massage school or not. I feel like there's 250 a lot of sticking confusion on the word \"massage\" and I think that Jill Motz brought up the idea of 251 title protection. That there might be an erosion of the term massage and that part of the business of 252 a regulatory board would be to protect the identity of massage. To an extent, I agree with that, 253 however, there are definitions in Statute and those definitions are law and they should be tre ated 254 with respect that way. The definition of massage therapy, in Alaska, is so broad that practically 255 anybody that puts their hands on people could make a case that they are doing massage therapy. 256 The work that Rolfers do certainly falls under the broad definition of massage therapy that I can 257 read to you, if you want, but I probably don't need to because I'm sure you understand the Statute. 258 That being said, that's the reason why we had to have the Exemption in the first place, because the 259 casual observe r would look at what we do and say, \"Well, yes, this definition of massage therapy 260 applies to these people.\" So we made sure to get that Exemption in place, to create that distinction. 261 But it's an exception; not an exclusion. 262 I've made it my business to try to convince every new Rolf Institute graduate coming out, that's it's 263 to their advantage to become licensed as a massage therapist. I applied for my license the 1st of July 264 2015 because I value licensure, I want to be as credentialed as I can be. I'v e done a pretty good job 265 convincing all new people coming in; get your license. Now they're up against this barrier which I 266 feel is based on animosity toward that exception and our defense of the exception which led to the 267 struggle of getting what you really want out of HB110 which is establishment licensure, which I 268 totally agree with and it was unfortunate that we had to block that to protect out exception to 269 chapter. 270 That whole thing was just a mess and you guys came into what I thought was a good solution which 271 was to ask Sam Kito to drop the Exemption language out of it and clean up HB110, which we 272 would completely support and after that, not be in your way. So there's the confusion over if 273 someone has that exception are they trying to \"have their cak e and eat it too\". Well, they're not. 274 7 Page | 7 People that are applying for a license are not trying to claim exception, they're trying to waive their 275 exception and get licensed. And if you just read down the list of credentials, things that are 276 necessary for an applicant, Rolf Institute graduate meets every one of those unless you want to really 277 bend over backwards and try to say that Rolfers are not getting that kind of training that constitutes 278 massage. Well, go back to legal definition of what massage therap y is in Alaska, it's very clear. I'm 279 upset that people are trying to make that case. It's just confusing to me. 280 Keep in mind, these are people. I have three people right now that are not working in the 281 environment that they thought they would be. They were promised employment at clinics that bill 282 for services to...insurance payment and in order to do that, they need a massage therapy license. 283 And they've been in the wings since July. I didn't find out until October that this was all going on 284 which I'll talk about in a minute. These are real people that are not working right now to the extent 285 that they should be because of a misunderstanding. Nobodies trying to get away with anything. 286 Nobodies trying to \"have their cake and eat it too\". It's people that are legitimately seeking 287 employment, and have investing quite a bit of money in their schooling. This is not a light manner. 288 Ron brought up the issue on how massage and bodywork are different. You seem to not be giving 289 full weight to COMTA accreditation. Massage. Bodywork. It all falls under the legal definition of 290 massage in Alaska so that should be a non- issue. COMTA is very rigorous. Really the only 291 national accrediting agency or accrediting body in America. All massage schools try to get COMTA 292 accreditation. That is the gold standard. It took the Rolf Institute years of getting their ducks in a 293 row: having curricular review and interviews with faculty. It's not like they just mail in a 294 membership thing or something. COMTA is a real accrediting body and it should be taken 295 seriously . 296 Sara Chambers gave you a very clear explanation this morning. She gets it. She is a pro and 297 explained in exquisite detail what the situation is and, unfortunately, her clear explanation was 298 followed with, I would have to say, prejudice questions and comments. I do understand why there 299 is an axe to grind against the Rolfers because we've just, unfortunately, gotten into an adversarial 300 head-butting situation that I would love to clear up and have us all be colleagues someday. If I had 301 my way, all new Rolfers are going to be licensed massage therapists and the old guard that is 302 claiming the exception will retire in the next ten years. I would like for us to all be one big, happy 303 family. We'll see. 304 I found it interesting that particular Ron seems to be the main person saying that Rolfers are not 305 doing massage therapy. After two years of saying that, we are massage therapists. You talk about 306 your training at the Utah College of Massage Therapy and t hat you got some structural integration 307 training there and that you argued repeatedly that it's just a variation of massage therapy and now 308 you're changing your tune. Your letter in testimony of HB110 clearly stated it. David Edwards - 309 Smith brought up the Job Task Analysis from FSMTB during his testimony for HB110. His 310 testimony at the time was that Rolfers were doing practically identical work as massage therapy. So 311 there's that. I noticed in the Board Packet there was a lot of testimony pulled out from HB110, very 312 one sided with Rolfers saying they weren't massage therapists in an attempt to protect their 313 exception but nothing on your side where you guys argued that we are doing massage therapy. So, I 314 wanted to bring up that. 315 I wonder what Ron, in par ticular, what your agenda is? Why are you so adamant against or trying to 316 find a way? You brought up Georgia, the beacon of enlightened anything. Denying structural 317 integration continuing education as qualifying continuing education for massage therapy. Are we 318 really going to look to Georgia for guidance on these things? You said you disagreed with that, and 319 yet you said you would like to look at it and maybe find a way to deny licensure to Rolf Institute 320 graduates. I just don't get it. 321 8 Page | 8 You talked about looking at curriculum from various schools to see if they have it. The Board may 322 adopt a Regulation specifying what particulars on massage training would be necessary to get 323 licensed in Alaska and I think you all know that if you all start looking at e very individual training 324 \"You need this many hours of draping, you need this many hours of whatever\". Do you really want 325 that work? Do you really want to generate that? COMTA, again gold standard. Please trust 326 COMTA and just make it easier on yourselves and everyone else. They know what they're doing. 327 The State of Washington which I know board member, Traci Gilmour, highly regards. She is 328 licensed there, I believe and I've worked there in the past. They license Rolfers and they are one of 329 the more difficult states to be licensed in. They are highly regulated, very picky State when it comes 330 to this and all the Rolfers down there are licensed massage therapist and even one of them could 331 move to Alask a and submit their Washington state massage license as a way to get their License by 332 Credential. Lots of Rolfers out there are licensed as massage therapists and the fact that they have 333 exception to chapter in Alaska, I think Sara Chamber made it clear that is a separate issue. It doesn't 334 have bearing o n the credentials of an applicant. 335 I guess that's it. The Statute is clear that unless you have a background agenda you are trying to 336 overlay on it. If you would just read the Statute there would not be any question, I believe. 337 Not to make threats, I'm n ot threatening but the reality is that if this doesn't... if you block or reject 338 applications by Rolf Institute graduates it will be appealed, of course. Hopefully Department of Law 339 will nip it in the bud and will give a decision and say that these people s hould be issued licenses. If 340 not, it's going to go farther than that. It's going to turn into a lawsuit. It's going to be very 341 expensive and un-necessary and I would hate to see that happen. It's not going to stop with a 342 rejection of an application. If that's the pathway that this Board wants to travel down, just know 343 that we're all in and we're going to go all the way with this. Let's not wind up in court over this, 344 please. 345 I guess my last point is, I regret to say this because I really do respect Tr aci Gilmour. Believe it or 346 not Traci, I like you. Every interaction I've had with you...I respect you and I don't want to be 347 negative toward you but I feel like, in the interest of this Board there has to be some discipline or 348 censure or something. Something has to happen about how this went down with Traci Gilmour and 349 Dawn Hannasch because looking at the email exchange, Traci's first impression was, \"yes, Rolf 350 Institute graduates are fine\" and then I wrote to you, David, and you wrote back saying that the re 351 had been discussion and board meetings and had unanimous consent that Rolf Institute graduates 352 would qualify for licensure. 353 (One minute warning by OLE Dulebohn) 354 And then it all blew up, I guess trying to cover your bases and not have it get to be a runa way train, 355 you guys kinda backed up Tr aci. So she called Amanda (Uns er) and Amanda advanced an opinion. 356 She's not a Board member. Then it turned into blocking and telling people they can't get licensed. 357 It was like one person made a decision which masqueraded as Board policy that caused financial 358 harm to people. That is a black eye for the Board. You should at least say something in writing that 359 was a wrong thing to do and you're working on having clear policies and procedures for the futur e. 360 Please. End of rant. \" 361 362 Agenda Item 10 (continued) Applications 363 364 In a motion made by Jill Motz, seconded by Traci Gilmour , and passed unanimously with a 365 roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to APPROVE the application for an Alaska Massage 366 Therapist license for Aubrey Grause. 367 368 9 Page | 9 In a motion made by Traci Gilmour , seconded by Jill Motz , and passed unanimously with a 369 roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to TABLE the application for an Alaska Massage 370 Therapist license for Sarah Reichert pending review by Inves tigations . 371 , seconded by Jill Motz , and passed unanimously with a 373 roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to APPROVE the application for an Alaska Massage 374 Therapists license for Jie Wang pending application review of professional fitness questions 375 by the Division. 376 377 In a motion made by Traci Gilmour , seconded by Ron Gibbs, and passed unanimously with 378 a roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to APPROVE the reinstatement of Alaska Massage 379 Therapists license for Nicholette Eley. 380 381 In a motion made by Traci Gilmour , seconded by Ron Gibbs, and passed unanimously with 382 a roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to APPROVE the reinstatement of Alaska Massage 383 Therapists license for Ruiqing Xie. 384 385 In a motion made by Traci Gilmour , seconded by Jill Motz , and passed unanimously with a 386 roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to break until 2:00 p.m. 387 388 Agenda Item (Amended) Apprenticeship Program 389 390 Back on the record at 2:01 p.m. 391 392 Apprenticeship Program presentation by Board Member Jill Motz. 393 394 This task started out because the Board doesn't have regulatory authority over massage 395 apprenticeship programs and what the Board's responsibility is, to determine whether an 396 apprenticeship program meets criteria that produces a competent therapist. 397 398 Ms. Motz got into contact w ith the Department of Labor in Anchorage to see what a good 399 apprenticeship looks like and after several meetings came the idea to build the Apprenticeship 400 program for Alaska Massage Therapists with the help of a five person \" work group\" . The initial 401 idea was to build the program on the state level but when that didn't work out it became a federal 402 program. This is a more comprehensive program than you can get in the state of Alaska right now . 403 The Department of Labor has accepted this p rogram model. It's going through the commentary 404 process between the different levels and the Department of Labor is moving forward with this 405 program proposal. 406 407 Massage therapy education is uneven across the USA. This program model meets COMTA 408 (Commiss ion on Massage Therapy Accreditation) and ELAP (Entry Level Analysis Project) 409 qualifications. It is a COMTA accredited program. ELAP is a combined eff ort of seven different 410 organization's two year project to put together what a national entry level massage therapy program 411 would look like. When industry leaders got t ogether to create a standard, t he recommendation for 412 that standard is the ELAP. In the future, the hope is that all schools will be COMTA accredited and 413 that a nat ional standard would be the ELAP standard. . 414 10 Page | 10 It is designed so it can be applied in all 50 states. If for some reason, you don't finish with the initial 415 instructor, this is program is built to be able to take your accomplishments with you to another 416 instructor and continue where you left off in your education. 417 418 This program has not been reviewed by ACPE (Alaska Commission of Post- Secondary Education ) 419 420 How the apprenticeship program works is: 421 422 1)This a hybrid program that consists of book work and hands on learning. 423 Minimums hours are 1500 and maximum of 2500A COMTA accredited school 424 will provide 425 hours of book learning. 425 2)To be a Trainer: The proposal of the work group is that you must have 10 years 426 of experience and be a licensed massage therap ist in good standing with the State 427 of Alaska. If you have any deficits in knowledge, you will have the option to 428 outsource to another qualified trainer. Federal program offers modest stipends 429 to cover costs to pay for you to teach. The option of allowing Instructors to 430 have more than one apprentice at a time (but not more than two) is favored by 431 the founding workgroup. Once students have achieved certain competency 432 levels, they will be allowed to offer \"student\" massages for compensation. 433 3)Every trainer /trainee will complete a Competencies Checklist. The student will 434 shadow the instructor by observing and eventually co-treating. The instructor 435 and student both sign off on each individual component of a checklist as the 436 student completes training. It creates accountability from the teacher and the 437 student. 438 4)To Be an Apprentice: you must be screened and approved by the Department of 439 Labor . Since it is a federal apprenticeship program, it is free for trainees. 440 Furthermore, since the train ees must be an employee of the trainer's business, 441 they will be paid a living wage while they are learning . 442 5)A reporting agency for transcripts has yet to be determined. 443 6)This program model will allow people to stay in their home town and do their 444 trainin g with an approved instructor. 445 446 The Board needs to make a proposal to only accept apprenticeship programs that meet COMTA 447 and ELAP standards. This will create a high level of accountability in the profession. This program 448 is well vetted, researched, has gone through the Department of Labor, and the Board will know that 449 anyone coming out this program will be a competent massage therapist. 450 451 In a motion made by Jill Motz, seconded by Traci Gilmour , and passed unanimously with a 452 roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to send the following draft amendment to the Regulations 453 Specialist to \" only accept apprenticeship programs that meet COMTA and ELAP 454 standards .\" 455 456 In a Traci Gilmour , seconded by Jill Motz , and passed unanimously with a 457 roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to amend the agenda to move the discussion concerning 458 the Barrier Crimes Matrix/Disciplinary Fine Schedule on from December 1 to November 459 30, 2017. 460 461 462 11 Page | 11 Agenda Item (Amended) Barrier Crimes Matrix/Disciplinary Fine Schedule 463 464 In a motion made by Jill Motz , seconded by Ron Gibbs, and passed unanimously with a roll 465 call vote , it was RESOLVED to adopt the Barrier Crimes Matrix as written with a possible 466 regulations project if \"moral t urpitude \" needs to be further defined. 467 468 In a motion made by Jill Motz , seconded by Ron Gibbs, and passed unanimously with a roll 469 call vote , it was RESOLVED to a pprove the Disciplinary Fine Schedule , as amended by the 470 Board . 471 472 Agenda Item (Amended) Past Task List 473 474 The Board briefly touches on their research into NCBTMB, COMTA, RISI, and FSMTB and agree 475 to go into more depth during the Clarification on Accredited Massage Schools tomorrow under Old 476 Business. 477 478 Chair Edwards -Smith has recessed for the day and will reconvene the meeting at 9:00 a.m. 479 on December 1, 2017. 480 481 Off the record at 3:38 p.m. 482 483 F riday, December 1, 2017 484 485 Agenda Item Call to Order/Roll Call 9:02 a.m. 486 487 Board Members present, constituting a quorum: 488 489 D avid Edwards- Smith, Board Chair- Licensed Massage Therapist 490 T raci Gilmour, Licensed Massage Therapist 491 R on Gibbs, Licenses Massage Therapist 492 J ill Motz, Licensed Massage Therapist 493 494 Division Staff present : 495 496 Renee Hoffard, Records and Licensing Supervisor 497 Dawn Dulebohn, Occupational Licensing 498 499 Agenda Item Review A genda 500 501 Agenda was reviewed by the Board 502 503 Agenda Item 11 Old Business 504 505 HB110: 506 507 Traci Gilmour reports on her meeting with Representative Sam Kito's office (who has agreed to 508 carry the bill) concerning HB110 meeting as assigned on October 2, 2017 . HB110 has been 509 approved to be changed with removing the exemption licensing language. The rest of the bill will 510 12 Page | 12 remain the same in that Blood borne Pathogens requirements will be reduced to two hours, 511 education for Application by Examination will increase to 625 hours, there will still be a rural 512 exemption, the re will massage establishment licensing language, and the addition of fingerprint 513 language changes that have been requested to be done at renewal. Ms. Gilmour has a follow -up 514 meeting with Representative Kito's office next week and will send a report to OLE Dulebohn to 515 distribute to the Board. 516 In regards to the Sunset Audit, Ms. Gilmour clarified through Representative Kito's office that the 517 statute sunsets, not just the Board. If the legislature doesn't agree to continue the statute , it sunsets 518 in 2018 and then there is a wind down year for the Board to finish up business already in progress. 519 Chair Edwards- Smith wanted to clarify, for the rec ord, that the purpose of the sunset audit is to get 520 a sense of whether the Board is meeting statutory requirements and our r eport was very positive . 521 Fortunately, the Board has a recommendation to continue. 522 523 Clarification on Accredited Massage Schools: 524 525 The Board discusses all the correspondence that had been sent between Ed Toal, OLE Dulebohn, 526 and Sara Chambers in October 2017. The Board also reviewed the research done in regards to 527 COMTA, FSMTB, Rolf Institute of Structural Integration, and testimony f rom HB110 that was 528 tasked at the October 20, 2017 teleconference. The Board agrees that they want to make the best, 529 informed decision possible and not be rushed because they are here to protect the public. The 530 Board feels (in the past) they haven't asked enough questions before making some decisions and 531 they want to be sure they work for the good of the whole and not the few . 532 533 Some of the main points from the discussion are: 534 535 Board's Stance : The Board wants to resolve this conflict but have the job to make 536 decisions based on the finding of facts. On February 22, 2016, the Board was split but 537 ultimately approved a letter of support for the Rolfers of Alaska to pursue their own 538 licensure. The Board has previously issued licenses to Rolfers who are also massage 539 therapists and have completed massage training. The two main reasons for licensure is 540 public protection and the ability to directly bill insurance. Should the Board be looking to 541 define the content of what the 500 hour requirement entails as Washington and Oregon 542 have done? If the Board defines content in a regulations project, it will allow a pathway to 543 better understanding to applicants of the what is required and allow institutions to counsel 544 their students on how to make up for deficits 545 Rolfing: Rolfing is a trademarked, branded program that carefully avoids any language to 546 link themselves to the massage therapy profession and historically they have made an effort 547 to be excluded from massage therapy association. Since the brand goes to such great lengths 548 to avoid using the term \"massage\" it makes it more difficult to define how much they are 549 like massage therapists. Rolfers basically perform the same tasks as massage therapists . 550 Some of the Board members had believed structural integra tors should be under the same 551 umbrella as massage therapists until the Rolfers made it clear that they were not the same 552 profession. 553 Education: does RISI (Rolf Institute of Structural Integration) provide the necessary 554 training to be a massage therapist ? RISI transcripts have a lot of great courses but there is 555 no evidence in the curriculum that makes it a massage therapy school. Does the Rolf 556 Institute of Structural Integration meet the statutory requirement of a massage program 557 13 Page | 13 regardless of how they view or define themselves? The Board agrees that a more in depth 558 class descri ption from RISI is needed to determine if the courses meet the idea of what the 559 Board thinks should be taught at a massage school. . 560 Statutes : Sec. 08.61.030(3)(A) Qualifications for license. The board shall issue a license to practice 561 massage therapy to a person who furnishes evidence satisfactory to the board that the person has completed a 562 course of study of at least 500 hours of in -class supervised instruction and clinical work from an approved 563 massage school; 564 Sec. 08.61.100(1) (A) (B) \"approved ma ssage school\" means a massage therapy school or program that has 565 an authorization to operate from the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education or a similar entity in 566 another state; or is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency . Does RISI meet the 567 definition? Is the reason to accept RISI only because they have an insti tutional endorsement 568 from COMTA? 569 Sec 08.61.100(5) \"practice of massage therapy\" means the provision, for compensation, of a service involving 570 the systematic manipulation and treatment of the soft tissues...to enhance the functions of those tissues and 571 promote relaxation and well -being... If any program (reflexology, physical therapist) comes 572 before the Board and they have an accreditation but do not have a curriculum that 573 necessarily translate s over to massage but they meet the statutory criteria of the definition of 574 massager therapy, do they get licensed? The Board wants to think of the precedent they are 575 setting by possibly accepting a program that is not from a massage sc hool. 576 Sec. 08.61.080(10). Exceptions to application of chapter . This chapter does not apply to a person engaged 577 only in the practice of structural integration for restoring postural balance and functional ease by integrating 578 the body in gravity using a system of facial manipulation and awareness who has graduated from a pr ogram 579 or is a current member of an organization recognized by the International Association of Structural 580 Integrators, including the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration. 581 HB110 : An exemption does not equal an exclusion. Rolfers have earned an exemption 582 from chapter because these practitioners are so different that they don't belong with 583 massage. Would including Rolfers create a fracture in the law by accepting their education? 584 Would we accept the same education from someone who was a reflexologist or a physical 585 therapist and wanted to be a licensed massage therapist that had , included in their 586 curriculum, hands-on, soft tissue manipulation? If the Rolfers of Alaska would like to 587 change and not be exempt any longer, some Board members would support that decision. 588 The Board would like to note that the exemption language for Rolfers was put in place in 589 2014. The Board of Massage Therapists didn't begin meeting until 2015. The Board would 590 like to consult the sponsor of HB110. 591 Opposition : At every meeting about HB110, there were Rolfers telling people that they are 592 different and should not be included as massage therapists. 593 In 2015 RISI Board Chair, Kevin McCoy, says in a letter that \"structural integration is a 594 distinct profession, separate from Massage Therapy. Our long term plan is to be regulated 595 under the same heading.\" 596 In a letter from lobbyist Denali Daniels, \" Rolfers do not want to participate in Alaska's 597 regulatory framework for massage therapists. Rolfers to not want to exten d their scope of 598 practice. The Alaska Rolfers will actively oppose any legislation that revokes their 599 exemption.\" 600 In a 2016 s tatement from the President of i asi (International Association of Structural 601 Integrators) , \"Structural Integration possesses its own scope of practice, its own education 602 standard, and a psychometrically valid and legally defensible exam. Massage is a different 603 type of bodywork, but not all bodywork is massage . Failing to recognize structural 604 14 Page | 14 integration separately from basic massage does not protect the public. You're only creating 605 confusion for those seeking actual structural integration. Structural integration education is 606 not massage education. The MBLEx is not an appropriate exam for structural integrators. 607 Let us be regulated by our own professional skills and standards.\" 608 On February 12, 2017, Ed Toal states that \"i t is important to clarify that Ro lfing is a 609 distinctly different profession and is not massage therapy. Rolfing (SI) is sometimes 610 confused with massage but it is entirely different. The initial position of the Alaska Rolfers 611 is that they do not wish to participate in Alaska's regulatory framework for massage 612 therapists because they are not massage therapists. They are Rolfers and structural 613 integrators and this continues to be consistent with the nationally agreed upon exemption 614 for Rolfing. \" 615 All the opposition testimony demand the Board of Massage Therapists stay away from 616 Rolfers. 617 Aggressive Tactics by Rolfers : The Board feels the aggression from the loca l Rolfing 618 chapter by threatening to sue the Board over 50 people who are not massage therapists 619 was/is unnecessary and off-putting. Ms. Gilmour's answer of the question by OLE 620 Hannasch that has resulted in repeated requests that she be disciplined/sanctioned and 621 personally attacked is another example of the aggressive campaigned the Rolfers have made 622 to be included when they aggressively campaigned to be excluded. 623 FSMTB (Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards): On February 19, 2016 with 624 excerpts of the Model Practice Act, FSMTB makes a statement that \" soft tissue 625 manipulation is the category Rolfing would go under.\" All Rolfers are soft tissue 626 manipulators and should be included as massage therapists because of that distinction. 627 Sonia from FS MTB states that \"the MBLEx is a massage and bodywork exam. The Board's 628 best option is to see if everyone falls within the scope. Sonia also cautioned that the Board 629 really need to protect the title of 'massage therapist' from being watered d own and that it can 630 eventually lead to legal issues.\" Other states besides Georgia have exclusions for structural 631 integrators. Massachusetts has excluded structural integration from the definition of 632 massage. Nevada excludes structural integration from massage licensing and have passed a 633 law to license them separately. Colorado has very few curriculum requirement for massage 634 licensure. Kevin from FSMTB communicates that \"it is in the Board's best interest to 635 accept RISI as an accredited program. Regar dless of branding they are providing the same 636 basic tasks. Massage and bodywork are interchangeable and it would be in the Board's best 637 interest to 'build bridges instead of set fires'.\" 638 COMTA (Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation ): COMTA has three different 639 times of endorsements: a Program Endorsement, a Curriculum Endorsement, and an 640 Institutional Endorsement. Many massage schools on the website have programs or 641 curriculum endorsement but RISI and a few others have Institutional Endorsements and are 642 not listed as a massage therapy school . RISI's COMTA certification is as a bodywork 643 school, not a massage school. Angie Meyer from COMT A says they only accredit the 644 organization as an acceptable school. They do not evaluate conte nt. RISI is accredited by 645 COMTA as a school offering a Rolf certification program. It is not listed as a massage 646 therapy school. 647 NCBTMB (National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork) does not 648 accredit schools, they only accredit therapists who have met criteria as a master body worker. 649 NCBTMB states that their name stands for \"massage and bodywork\" and they do not 650 currently distinguish between massage and bodywork practitioners on their certificates. 651 15 Page | 15 652 653 Traci Gilmour left at 10:10 a.m. and was back at 10:12 a.m. 654 655 In a motion made by Traci Gilmour , seconded by Jill Motz , and passed unanimously with a 656 roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to break until 10:30 a.m. 657 658 Back on the record at 10:30 a.m. 659 660 Consult with Law : Deputy Director Sara Chambers and Harriet Milk from the 661 Department of Law join the meeting telephonically to answer questions from the Board 662 concerning how the Board determines what an approved massage therapy school or 663 program is and what the role of the Board is in defining said programs. 664 It was conveyed by Law that: 665 Groups that have a license and an exemption to chapter will still be investigated fully 666 allegations to see what capacity they were operating at the time of any incident that 667 might be reported to determine if a person was performing massage therapy. 668 Anyone practicing massage therapy are regulated by the Standard of Practice and 669 Code of Ethics. 670 The Board can regulate content o f what constitutes the 500 hours of required 671 education. If the Board wants to take steps to change a St atute or Regulation, they 672 can but until it is there is a change it is the Board's responsibility to interpret the 673 Statutes and Regulations that are curr ently in place. 674 When an applicant completes their application and it goes to the Board, if the Board 675 determines that more research is needed to do the ir due diligence , they may only 676 table an application as long as the next scheduled Board meeting or determined date 677 unless the Board decides to call a special meeting . 678 The Board cannot accept a school that doesn't meet the statutory obligation of being 679 an approved massage therapy school. In the absence of a national accreditation, it is 680 the Board's responsibility to determine what is a massage therapy school or program. 681 If the definition of what a massage therapy is being met, the name of the institution 682 is not as important as what the course curriculum is that is being taught as long as it 683 is natio nally accredited. 684 Having an exception to licensure and getting a license are not mutually exclusive. It 685 is an exception not an exclusion. 686 If the Board has deliberated and researched what it believes to be a massage therapy 687 education and the school does not meet the Board's requirements, then the person 688 who is presenting that school as their sole education d oes not qualify for licensure 689 The Board is not keeping people who do not have a license from working in their 690 field for other entities such as doctors and chiropractors. It is up to the entities to 691 decide their employee criteria. 692 Be as clear as you can why you are or why not granting the license. 693 694 Traci Gilmour left at 11:13 a.m. and was back at 11:15 a.m. 695 696 In a motion made by Traci Gilmour , seconded by Jill Motz , and passed unanimously with a 697 roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to break until 12:02 p.m. 698 16 Page | 16 Back on the record at 12:02 p.m. 699 700 The Board decides that it needs to define what is expected of an approved massage school 701 and the best way to do this is to form a sub -committee. The Board decides that Jill Motz 702 and Ron Gibbs would make up this sub- committee and will meet on January 1, 2018 at 3:00 703 p.m. The subcommittee will determine course content, list of COMTA and ELAP standards 704 and do research on Oregon, California, Washington, and Alaska state content curriculum 705 standards for massage therapy (if they're defined). They will then present their findings at 706 the next Board meeting and make a recommendation to the Board with what they believe 707 should be Alaska's standards for defining massage therapy program. 708 709 Agenda Item 12 New Business (Potential Regulations Projects) 710 711 In a motion made by Ron Gibbs, seconded by Jill Motz , and passed unanimously with a roll 712 call vote , it was RESOLVED to send the following draft amendment to the Regulations 713 Specialist to amend 12 AAC 79.100 to institute language that transcripts, exam scores, and 714 license verification be sent directly to the Division from the institution. 715 716 The Board discusses Blood Borne Pathogens time limits and it is decided that a person having taken 717 their BBP certification within the required time frame regardless of how long it takes them to 718 complete their application is all that is needed. 719 720 The Board discusses whether to make a regulations amendment how long an applicant has to 721 complete their file and whether it will go \"stale\" as in the Medical statutes and regulations have 722 written. OLE Dulebohn will do further research to present the regulations project to the Board 723 reflecting a 6 month cutoff date be fore an application goes \"stale\". 724 725 Agenda Item 13 Administrative Business 726 727 Sign Wall Certificates - Wall Certificates were signed by the Chair. 728 729 Sign Past Minutes- Past meeting minutes were signed by the Chair 730 731 Schedule Future Meetings- the Board confirmed the following meeting dates for the upcoming year. 732 Board Meetings: 733 March 5 -6, 2018 meeting in Juneau 734 (Ms. Gilmour made a motion to move the meeting to March 8- 9, 2017 but it was not 735 seconded) 736 June 11- 12 teleconference 737 September 10-11, 2018 teleconference 738 December 3 -4, 2018 in Anchorage 739 Conferences: 740 FSMTB conference in Salt Lake City on October 4-6, 2018 the Board decides that Jill Motz 741 and David Edwards -Smith 742 743 17 Page | 17 In a motion made by Traci Gilmour, seconded by Ron Gibbs, and passed unanimously with 744 a roll call vote, it was RESOLVED to send Jill Motz and David Edwards -Smith to the 745 FSMTB conference on October 4-6, 2018. 746 747 Correspondence: 748 749 National Headlines on A lleged Sexual Misconduct by a Massage Therapist - On Tuesday , November 750 27, 2017, Liz Thomas from KTV A called to OLE Dulebohn to get a comment on the national news 751 that Massage Envy, a national chain of massage spas (with two locations in Anchorage) , has had 180 752 allegations of sexual misconduct by a massage therapist (not in Alaska). OLE Dulebohn made no 753 comment but instead wrote down Ms. Thomas's contact information, notified her supervisor, and 754 filled out a Record of Contact (ROC) form in accordance with the division's policies. After 755 researching the story online and findi ng headlines in two national newspapers and a magazine, OLE 756 Dulebohn then sent out an e-mail to the Board notifying them of this breaking national news that 757 concerns massage therapists. 758 The Board discusses any action that needs to be done by them in terms of outreach. HB110 is 759 discussed in regards to the licensing of massage establishments. The Board makes the decision that 760 Chair David Edward -Smith will draft a statement in regards to this news story and the Division post 761 a Public Notice on the Massage Therapists website. 762 Supervisor Renee Hoffard informs the Board that on November 28, 2017, acting Chief Investigator 763 Greg Francois did contact Ms. Thomas and informed her that as of this time, at this time, there had 764 been no complaints against Massage Envy. Mr. Francois did inform her that Investigations only has 765 the authority to look into individually license individuals and businesses. 766 It was decided that David Edwards -Smith would draft a response letter from the Board addressing 767 this and would send it on to OLE Dulebohn to post on the website. 768 769 Received a phone call on November 21, 2017 from Lolita Tupua LMT asking if massage therapists 770 were required to keep their own client notes on patience when the LMT was working for another 771 entity such as a chiropract or. Ms. Tupua's employer discouraged the practice of keeping notes 772 outside the patient's file. OLE Dulebohn quoted the Standards of Practice #2 stating that massage 773 therapists \"maintain a record of daily clientele including name and date of service and adequate 774 progress notes when applicable.\" After consulting with her supervisor, OLE Dulebohn also 775 informed Ms. Tupua that another benefit of keeping her own notes is in case there are billing 776 discrepancies, financial audit, or in case notes were ever becam e a regulatory requirement and could 777 be audited. Ms. Tupua seemed satisfied and pleased with the information. On November 22, 2017, 778 OLE Dulebohn received a phone call from Ms. Tupua's employer, Dr. Rob v an Zweeden, disputing 779 the counsel given by OLE Dulebohn stating that it is a HIPA violation. I took his information and 780 passed it on to Supervisor Renee Hoffard. It was decided that this situation should go to the Board 781 for further insight. 782 The Board gave advisement that the SOP #2 was only to be followe d in the LMT's own private 783 practice and that when you work under the umbrella of another, those notes stay in the file in the 784 business because that business assumes the risk . I will contact both the chiropractor and LMT and 785 advise them of the Board's decision. Standards of Practice are currently a recommendation and do 786 not have a disciplinary matrix. They will be addresses on case by case basis. 787 788 At this time the Board concluded all scheduled Board business. 789 790 18 Page | 18 In a motion made by Traci Gilmour , seconded by Jill Motz , and passed unanimously with a 791 roll call vote , it was RESOLVED to adjourn. 792 793 794 Hearing nothing further, Chair David Edwards -Smith adjourned the meeting at and the record 795 ended at 12:43 p.m. 796 797 Respectfully Submitted, 798 799 800 801 ______________________________________________ ___________________ 802 805 806 _____________________________________________ ___________________ 807 David Edwards -Smith, Boards Chair Date 808 809 810 Educational Subcommittee Recommendations Hello Board members. H ere are the numbers I collected regarding state curriculum standards for massage therapy schools. Please review this data and come to our meeting prepared to make a recommendation. If you have any questions regarding any of the data please forward them to me through Dawn. T hirty -three states define curriculum areas and minimum hours for content areas Since states differ in the amount of required hours of education, I converted each state's required number of hours into a percentage of their total required hours. Then I averaged those percentages.

Appendix D.2 - Competency Chart Page 1 of 10 Competency Table: Completion Instructions The Competency Table is made up of four columns. The first two columns identify the Competencies and the individual elements. The third column, \"Teach, \" is where the knowledge and skills that are taught within t he curriculum are identified. The final column, \"Assess ment ,\" notes where in the program the Competency or element of the Competency is assessed. Prior to submitting the curriculum materials for the accreditation application or for the self -study report the school or program is required to complete the table and submit it as an exhibit to Standard 2 (Curriculum and Instruction) . The Teach column should identify where in the program the learning objectives relative to the specific Competency element are taught . Although areas may be reinforced throughout the curriculum, the information presented in the Teach column identifies where in the program the knowledge, skill or performance criteria are taught. This may occur in more than one course or more than one class within a course, and may be identified by course name and class number which could be verified through a review of a detailed syllabus. The specific learning objectives for the class or classes do not have to be restated in the Teach column. The Assessment column should identify where in the program the desired performance is assessed relative to the specific Competency element. Again, this may occur more than once during the program.

Page 1 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 Accreditation Standards Effective January 1, 2015 Revised July 2017 REQUIRED BACKGROUND INFORMATION Institutional Mission and Objectives 1. Institutional Mission STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: A mission statement outlines the purpose of an institution or program and provides cle ar direction for the ongoing development and operation of the institution or program. In developing and revising a mission statement, an institution or program should consider the needs of society, the profession, and the students for whom the program i s intended. The institution's or program's success will be evaluated in relation to its mission. Therefore, the institution must have a mission statement that is published, well communicated, and implemented throughout the organization 's programs and dail y operations. 2. Institutional Goals or Objectives STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: In addition to a general mission statement, the institution has goals or o bjectives to measure its effectiveness. These goals or objectives are derived from the general mission statem ent and are stated in specific, measurable terms. They are then used to guide the development and evaluation of all educational programs and institutional services. STANDARDS for BOTH PROGRAMMATIC and INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITATION I. Program Approvals STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Prior to accreditation, programs must receive state and/or any other applicable approvals to offer the certificate or degree. Standard I refers specifically to the approvals required for the massage/bodywork or esthetics programs. Any in stitutional approvals are considered in the Standard for Institutional Accreditation. Requirements vary based on the jurisdiction . In some states, programs must be approved by a state education agency and/or the specific professional licensing board. Ins titutions must demonstrate knowledge of and compliance with all applicable state regulations, as well as all applicable accreditation standards from COMTA or other institutional accrediting agencies. A. The programs under consideration for COMTA accreditation have current approval(s) as required by law and regulation in their jurisdictions, including state education agencies, state private postsecondary regulators, or massage or esthetics licensing boards. Page 2 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 B. Individual programs are in compliance with all standards and policies of their institutional accrediting agency. C. Changes to accredited programs must be reported to COMTA in accordance with applicable policies. II. Curriculum and Instruction A. Programmatic Educational Objectives STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Specific, measurable objectives for each certificate or degree program are derived fr om the institutional mission/goals. These programmatic educational objectives should be published and should guide the development of the curriculum, course content, course object ives, and evaluation methods. If there are multiple massage or esthetics certificates/degree programs, there should be separate educational objectives for each program that clearly delineate their different purposes. 1. Each program has clearly stated educational objectives that are published and consistent with the institution's mission. 2. Program objectives are stated in measurable terms so they may be used to evaluate program effectiveness and outcomes. 3. Program objectives are integrated consistently thro ughout the curriculum, instruction, and evaluation methods. B. Curriculum Design The curriculum is designed comprehensively, is organized systematically for effective learning, and prepares students for professional practice. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: The curr iculum is the plan for student learning and is where the institutional mission and programmatic objectives are realized . COMTA's curriculum standard includes three main components: organization, length, and content. The curriculum can be organized in a va riety of ways, depending on the school's mission and educational philosophy. I f an integrated curriculum model is used, schools should assure that course learning objectives are appropriately delineated and assessed between subjects. If a modular curricu lum delivery method is used, specific steps should be taken to ensure that the needs of both beginning and more advanced students are met . 1. Programs are organized for optimal student learning, including the following considerations: a. Programs are comprised of separate and discrete courses, which may be organized by content area, by term, or by a combination of content and term. b. Each course has clearly identified learning objectives. c. Programs are designed for systematic and sequential learning. (i) All course pre requisites are clearly identified and enforced to ensure concept mastery prior to a student advancing. 2. The program length complies with the following: a. The mission and objectives of the institution and program; Page 3 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 b. Professional licensing/credentialing requirem ents for the applicable jurisdictions and/or commonly accepted national standards in the field; c. A minimum of 600 hours of classroom and clinic/fieldwork that are directly supervised by qualified faculty members; and d. Standard academic measures of course len gth as defined by the applicable regulatory agency (i.e., clock hour definitions, clock hour to academic credit conversions, term length). (i) Schools seeking COMTA institutional accreditation use the COMTA Standard Academic Measurement Policy. (ii) For programmati c accreditation , in the absence of other regulatory policies, the COMTA policy applies. 3. The program's curriculum content is coherent and demonstrates that it has been designed with the following in mind: a. The mission and objectives of the institution and program, as well as the principles and values that are being emphasized by the program ; b. Professional licensing and/or credentialing requirements for the jurisdictions in which the school operates, jurisdictions for which the school prepares graduates, and/ or national professional standards; c. Historical foundations in the field; d. Recent developments in the field ; e. Sound educational models and current learning theories ; and f. COMTA Competencies (see next standard). 4. Curriculum Competencies STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Curriculum competencies set standards of professional knowledge and abilities. Evaluating a program in terms of student competency places the emphasis on student learning, as opposed to how much time is devoted to each topic . As a specialized accreditin g agency, COMTA has created a comprehensive list of content competencies that describe what graduates should know and be able to perform. Schools/programs must de monstrate how these competencies are being taught and assessed. The Commission's six general competency areas are as follows: 1. Plan and organize an effective massage and bodywork session or esthetic treatment. 2. Perform massage therapy and bodywork or esthetic treatments for therapeutic benefit. 3. Develop and implement a self -care strategy. 4. Develop suc cessful and ethical therapeutic relationships with clients. 5. Develop a strategy for a successful practice, business, or employment situation. 6. Identify strategies for professional development. Programs should refer to COMTA Competency Charts for a complete l ist of the specific elements within each competency area . a. Massage/Bodywork Curriculum Competencies Programs meet the minimum competencies found in COMTA's Competency Chart, as demonstrated through teaching and student assessment. b. Esthetic Curriculum Comp etencies Programs meet the minimum competencies found in COMTA's Competency Chart, as demonstrated through teaching and student assessment. Page 4 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 C. Syllabi Programs ensure documentation and consistent implementation of curriculum through the use of clear syl labi distributed to students at the beginning of each course. These syllabi comply with the COMTA Syllabi Checklist. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: The syllabus is the documentation and implementation tool for the course curriculum. It also serves as a written c ontract between school and student, serves as an archival record of student learning, and clarifies expectations to increase student success. Syllabi should be developed for each course and distributed at the beginning of each course, and followed consist ently throughout the course. This does not require that all instructors use identical syllabi, as long as consistency in learning outcomes is maintained. D. Methods of instruction and evaluation STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: The written curriculum is realized by i n-class instruction and evaluation. Quality instruction may be delivered in a variety of ways according to student need and instructor judgment. Instruction should encourage active participation by students and a direct focus on meeting diverse student needs. Sound adult learning theories should guide instructional choices and be evident in lesson plans and classroom observation. In addition, quality evaluation methods are essential for confidence in students' proficiency. Practical (hands -on) exams should be used routinely. These should be documented and employed consistently with predetermined rubrics or checklists. 1. Teaching methods are appropriate to course content, meet the needs of diverse learners, and are designed to encourage and enhance learn er participation and involvement. a. The teacher to student ratio reasonably ensures effective teaching and learning in both lecture and lab courses. Th is ratio is clearly published. 2. Evaluation methods (such as written and practical tests, papers, assignment s, classroom observation, etc.) are used appropriately to assess student knowledge and skills. a. Measurable performance standards are clearly outlined for students on syllabi . b. Students are assessed using both written and practical (hands -on) assessments bas ed on a predetermined set of skills ( i.e., checklists or rubrics for practical exams) that reflect the key educational objectives of the course. c. Faculty members use assessment methods and grading consistently in determining whether performance standards ar e met. d. Students receive timely and regular feed back on their performance during the course. E. Clinic/Fieldwork STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: The clinic/fieldwork experience is a vital component of student learning. Clinic/fieldwork should be considered an integ ral part of the instructional process, with appropriate learning objectives and evaluation tools . Clinics may be either permanent health centers in which students operate or temporary clinics in classrooms, as long as the program can substantiate that the experience models professional procedures and involves members of the general public. Off -site, supervised fieldwork may also be included, but hands -on practice in other classes may not be considered part of the clinic hours. Page 5 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 Programs include clinic/fie ldwork instruction as an integrated part of the curriculum according to the following requirements: 1. The clinic/fieldwork component is a distinct course with its own course learning objectives and evaluation methods (as evidenced by a written syllabus). 2. Students practice on members of the general public. 3. Clinics are designed to model professional procedures. 4. Students are supervised and evaluated by qualified faculty members. 5. Clinic/fieldwork hours are appropriate to the length of the progra m and adhere to the following: a. Hours do not exceed 25 percent of the required hours of the program. b. A minimum number of hours/client sessions on the general public must be performed and documented. (See COMTA Clinic Guidelines .) 6. Clinics are operated in compliance with all applicable laws. F. Externship (if applicable) If clock hours or academic credit are awarded for an externship experience, it must meet the following standards: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Externships involve experiential learning done awa y from the school. Schools may plan and coordinate these experiences to allow students to work with the general public while being supervised by a qualified professional who is not associated with the school. Externships are not a requirement for COMTA -accredited programs. However, if students are allowed to complete externsh ips (as either a requirement or an elective), the experience must meet the COMTA definition of externship (see Definition of Terms and the following standards. 1. The externship is a di stinct course with its own course learning objectives and evaluation methods (as evidenced by a written syllabus). 2. Externship hours are appropriate to the length of the program and adhere to the following: a. Hours are over and above the minimum 600 hours re quired for accreditation. b. Hours do not exceed 20 percent of total program hours. 3. There is a written agreement signed by the program faculty and externship site personnel that clearly defines the obligations of the onsite supervisors, the faculty coordina tor, and the student. 4. Student performance is supervised by an onsite supervisor who is legally qualified to do so. 5. Student performance is evaluated by a qualified faculty coordinator (employee of the school), and students are provided with planned opport unities to discuss the experience and their performance with the faculty coordinator. Page 6 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 G.Learning/Library Resources Students have reasonable access to library and learning resources, including electronic resources, which support the program objectives . S TATEMENT OF PURPOSE: It is essential that postsecondary institutions have a library and/or learning resource center. The library should be more than just a physical location and should contain learning resources that are incorporated into the curriculum, sup port the research competency, and serve as reference materials for practical work in the clinic. 1.L earning resources are accessible to all students during and beyond classroom hours and may be provided via hard copy and/or virtually. 2.L earning resources ar e integrated into the curriculum and instruction, and students a nd f aculty are trained on their use. 3.S tudents are guaranteed access to library and learning resources if the library is off site. III.P rogram Administration and Faculty STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: The individuals involved in a program's execution are key to its success. Therefore, the program should be properly managed by a qualified individual with time and resources dedicated for administration beyond teaching obligations. Further, faculty mem bers should have the educational background, field experience, and proper credentials to competently teach their assigned courses. In addition to expertise in professional technique, schools must ensure that instructors are qualified in teaching skills, and/or receive proper training and ongoing development in this area. A.P rogram Administration Programs are adequately managed by qualified individuals who maintain currency in the field. 1.T here is at least one full- time employee of the institution designated as program director (o r e quivalent title) with responsibility for the supervision, management , and administration of the program . a.

Program Effectiveness STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Accrediting agencies are required to assess institutions and programs based on success in achieving their stated obj ectives and continual efforts to improve educational quality. Program objectives then serve as a guide and a measure Page 12 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 for program effectiveness. Therefore, program administration should engage in ongoing self-assessment. P rograms should collect and analyz e feedback from a variety of sources, including students, graduates, employers and other interested parties. A Program Advisory Committee should be created to assist in formalizing this process. A Program Advisory Committee increases the perspective and b roadens the input for review, so it is essential that it include members who are not directly affiliated with the school. The collection of feedback from all parties should then be analyzed and used in reviewing and/or revising all aspects of the program . The curriculum itself should be regularly reviewed and revised as needed to ensure that it is current and effective in meeting its stated objectives. A. Evaluation of Programmatic Objectives The program has methods in place to measure its success in meeting its educational objectives. B.

Institutions have policies and procedures in place to ensure that ethical recruitment pra ctices are followed and information provided to prospective students is accurate . These policies must also comply with the COMTA Advertising and Recruiting Policy . 3. An institution's recruitment efforts focus on attracting only students who are qualified a nd likely to complete and/or benefit from the education provided. 4. Institutions may not promise prospective students that program completion will guarantee employment, licensure, or certification. 5. Personnel are trained and qualified to engage in recruiti ng activities and may only use a title that accurately represents the individual's primary duties. 6. An institution does not provide a commission, bonus, or other financial incentive or payment to employees involved in the recruitment or admission of studen ts, nor does it provide financial aid based directly or indirectly on the success in securing enrollment. C. Catalog 1. A catalog and/or student handbook accurately portrays the institution and program, facilities, resources, and all policies and procedures and is readily available to all prospective students prior to signing an enrollment agreement . 2. A catalog and/or program student handbook contains (at minimum) all items in the COMTA Catalog Checklist. 3. The catalog an d/or student handbook may be in either a printed or an electronic format , but all versions must be consistent and easily accessible to prospective and current students. D. Enrollment Agreements The institution ensures that the applicant is fully informed of the rights, responsibilities, and obliga tions of both the institution and the student under an enrollment agreement or other documentation before enrollment into the institution. Page 21 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 1. Enrollment agreements are completed with all students prior to enrollment and must include , at a minimum, all requir ed items listed on the Enrollment Agreement Checklist . 2. No enrollment agreement is binding until it has been signed by the applicant and accepted and signed by the appropriate school official. 3. A copy of the enrollment agreement is signed by all appropriat e parties and furnished to the student before any payment is made. E. Non-discrimination Admission requirements and procedures must comply with all local, state, and federal regulations. 1. Admissions policies may not discriminate on the basis of race, gender , religion, nationality, age, disability, sexual orientation, or other status protected by law. 2. Institutions or programs reasonably accommodate applicants with disabilities to the extent required by applicable law. F. Transfer Credit Institutions develop, publish, and consistently implement clear policies regarding transfer of credit into the institution. 1. The transfer credit policy specifies the educational criteria guiding the acceptance of transfer credits, specifies the maximum number of transfer credi ts that can be accepted toward completion of an accredited program , and outlines the procedure for determining whether transfer credit will be granted. 2. Records of transfer credit and any supporting documentation remain in the student's file. XIV. St udent Records and Student Services STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Institutions should monitor and maintain complete records of student progress throughout the program. This includes a clear definition of what constitutes satisfactory academic progress and provisi ons for ensuring student adherence to the institution's policy . There is a connection between student success and the support services provided. Therefore, institutions are expected to consider the students' academic and non- academic needs to encourage s tudent success. The institution should provide a variety of student services in accordance with its mission and any applicable laws and regulations , and such services should reflect the highest ethical standards. A. Student Record Management For all curre ntly enrolled students, institutions maintain educational records, which include all admissions, academic, and financial records. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Institutions have a responsibility to maintain student records in compliance with all laws, including f ederal and state regulation s (e.g., FERPA). Laws and standard practices for the content, confidentiality, security, and access of records should be followed consistently by all school personnel. Page 22 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 1. Educational records may be maintained electronically and/or in hard copy and both are accurate, organized, confidentially maintained, and secured from damage or loss ( e.g., fire, water, theft, or tampering). 2. Institutions have and follow policies and procedures that comply with all applicable laws, including rights to access and confidentiality. B. Satisfactory Academic Progress STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: The i nstitution should take measures to ensure students are making steady progress toward graduation through Satisfactory Academic Progress policies, including regular monitoring and assistance for students not succeeding. The school can determine its own requirements for the policy as long as the following criteria are met. NOTE: For schools participating in Title IV financial aid, there are more specifi cs that must be met within this policy. (See Title IV Compliance Standard.) 1. Institutions offering any COMTA -accredited program have a policy for determining what constitutes satisfactory academic progress throughout that program. 2. The school's S atisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy includes consideration of the following: a. Quality of a student's academic work (i.e., grade percentage or grade point average). b. Quantity or amount of time a student has been in the program (i.e., maximum time frame in which students must complete program requirements ). c. Clear increments of time when SAP will be assessed, not to exceed the program's midpoint or one year. d. The official actions to be taken as a result of failure to meet SAP ( e.g., warning letter, academi c assistance, probation, termination). e. An appeal process for those students who are terminated from the program and/or lose funding based on failure to meet SAP. 3. Student progress throughout the program is monitored and fairly applied to all students. 4. Those students failing to meet the policy should be duly informed and assisted prior to any adverse action. 5. Additional requirements apply for t hose institutions wishing to establish or maintain eligibility to administer federal student aid programs under Tit le IV of the Higher Education Act. (See Title IV Compliance Standard.) C. Student Services STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: The services that an institution provides its students have a direct impact on the students' academic success. Specifics of the services pr ovided may be at the discretion of the institution, based on its size and the demographics of its students. 1. The institution provides adequate student services and resources to support its students in maintaining satisfactory progress, achieving educational outcomes, and making informed decisions concerning training and employment. These services include but are not limited to: a. Academic advising b. Tutoring or other academic support Page 23 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 c. Placement services d. Non-academic support ( e.g., counseling and/or referra ls) e. Any other services as required by law 2. Student services are delivered and/or are accessible at the main campus and all branch campuses. 3. Institutions reasonably accommodate students with disabilities to the extent required by applicable law and regulat ion. a. The institution has a process in place for determining and providing reasonable accommodations for students in accordance with law and regulation. D. Student Code of Conduc t The institution has a published Student Code of Conduct/Academic Integrit y Policy that includes clear expectations and disciplinary action for violations of the policy . STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: T he Student Code of Conduct should be specific to student behavior while enrolled in the institution (e.g., no cheating), and thus in addition to encouraging a professional code of conduct in the field. XV. Title IV Compliance Institutions participating in United States Title IV Financial Student Aid (FSA) programs comply with all applicable laws and regulations. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Participating in Title IV is a responsibility beyond accreditation. Many accreditation standards are intended to help a school be proactive in maintaining compliance with Title IV requirements. A. Administration Institutions demonstrate the administrat ive capability to participate in these financial aid programs through satisfactory results of financial or compliance audits, program reviews, and other information provided. B. Loan repayment Institutions participating in federal loan programs have in place appropriate measures designed to encourage students to repay their loans, and the institutions maintain an official student loan default rate that is below the federal threshold. C. Required Disclosures 1. Institutions clearly publish all disclosu res required by federal regulation. 2. The catalog of the institution accurately describes the financial aid programs in which it participates and includes the requirements students must meet to maintain eligibility for continued participation in these programs. 3. The institution's cancellation and refund policy clearly stipulates procedures for the return of Title IV funds in compliance with federal regulations. D. Clock Hour to Credit Conversion Institutions participating in Title IV must comply with Title IV regulations regarding the calculation of aid. Institutions may use the COMTA clock hour -to-credit conversion for academic purposes. (See COMTA Standard Academic Measurement Policy if applicable.) Page 24 of 24 Revised July 2017 Effective January 1, 2015 E .S atisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Those institutions wishing to establish or maintain eligibility to administer United States Title IV financial aid programs are required to use more specific criteria for their SAP policy. These institution s use the COMTA SAP Guidelines and Title IV regulat ions to develop their SAP requirements.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. The Core: Entry -Level Massage Education Blueprint was co -authored by Pat Archer, Clint Chandler, Rick Garbowski, Tom Lochhaas, Jim O'Hara, Cynthia Ribeiro, and Anne Williams. Printed and published in the United States of America The Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations encourages wide readership of this report and its companion document The Core: Entry -Level Analysis Project Report, and hereby grants permission to use, copy, and distribute these materials for educational purposes only, provided a copyright notice is affixed in the form furnished above. December 18 , 2013 1 Statement of Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations \"We believe that the efforts of work group members have resulted in an extraordinary, ground-\u00adbreaking body of work. Their Blueprint, and the underlying process described in the report, gains strength from its intellectual integrity and independence.\" The \"Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations\" comprises seven organizations listed at the end of this statement. Our organizations play different roles, each contributing to the betterment of the massage therapy profession while also educating the public about benefits of professional massage therapy. We share a national focus: each of the seven organizations has members or constituents throughout the United States. Each of us seeks a thriving massage therapy profession that enhances the health and well-\u00adbeing of clients throughout the United States. We also share a desire to help our profession beyond serving each organization's self-\u00adinterest. Our Coalition initially convened in 2011 to identify and address opportunities to advance the massage therapy profession. Two senior leaders from each organization participated in that initial meeting and three subsequent meetings. Consistency and Portability In a healthy profession, effective improvement requires candor in acknowledging current imperfections. When our group of organizations initially assembled, we began by naming and prioritizing profession challenges that required attention. Emerging at the top of the list were two concerns: inconsistent quality, depth and focus of entry-\u00adlevel massage therapy education; and lack of licensure portability (professional mobility). Why these two? Numerous participants referenced observed knowledge and skill deficits among many recent school graduates and expressed concern that a resulting potential increase in inconsistent quality massage experiences could dull public enthusiasm for seeking massage therapy. Uncertainty about education quality and how to evaluate transcripts from unfamiliar schools, combined with inconsistent entry-\u00adlevel examinations utilized by different states, impairs state massage board confidence about approving licenses for practitioners moving to a new residence state. Identifying Entry-\u00adLevel Skills and Knowledge A preliminary proposal advanced at that meeting was refined by participating organizations over the following six months. The objective: identify and gain agreement on what should be core elements of entry-\u00adlevel massage therapy instructional programs - the 2 knowledge and skills an entrant to the profession should possess to be ready to work safely and competently with clients. The proposal recommended formation of a seven-\u00adperson work group composed of massage content experts and two individuals holding credentials in education and instructional design. Each Coalition member had an opportunity to recommend participants and to listen and offer comments during the March 2012 selection process. The aim was to bring together a group possessing objectivity and judgment alongside specific classroom instruction, curriculum development, instructional design, and assessment expertise. A clear instruction to the group was to approach their work with impartiality and integrity, to arrive at sound, research-\u00adinformed conclusions unconstrained by precedent or political acceptability. The project was initially estimated to require slightly over one year. As it evolved, participants quickly realized that more time would be required to do the job thoroughly. In the end, it proved to be a 21-\u00admonth endeavor. It is our belief that the resulting work product, combined with engagement and courage by leaders throughout the profession, can assist substantially over the next several years in alleviating both entry -\u00adlevel education qu ality and professional mobility concerns. The project was titled Entry -\u00adLevel Analysis Project (ELAP). If that title fails to sing, it does accurately identify the project focus. The ELAP process illuminated some predictable strengths in massage education, but also some wide-\u00adranging knowledge and skill gaps. We can't be certain how these skill gaps formed, but we can speculate that educational programs leave out certain subjects, address others in inadequate depth, fail to reinforce particular desirable beh aviors, or dilute essential learning with too much focus on other topics. With such gaps and inconsistencies, exacerbated by frequently vague state education requirements and equally vague education content descriptions on school transcripts, further compounded by diverse profession entry testing options, it is no wonder that some state licensing boards are cautious about licensure portability. Such education inconsistency frankly also causes some other health care professions to look at massage therapy with a skeptical eye, and to be hesitant about referring patients to massage therapists. Getting to a place where every newly trained massage therapist has completed education in agreed-\u00adupon core knowledge and skill development, thereby being positioned to be able to reliably deliver a quality basic massage, can potentially increase confidence among other health care providers. Our profession thrives when primary care 3 providers recognize the power of evidence-\u00adinformed massage therapy for the treatment of pain, stress, and other common problems. The ELAP Work Group The Core: Entry-\u00adLevel Massage Education Blueprint is the product of the seven work group members - Pat Archer, Clint Chandler, Rick Garbowski, Tom Lochhaas, Jim O'Hara, Cynthia Ribeiro, and Anne Williams. While other individuals potentially could also have been constructive work group contributors, we are confident the final group of seven chosen individuals has superbly represented the interests of the massage profession. The work group was asked to consider a multitude of previously completed massage and bodywork studies and reports, but to aim at constructing from the ground up what they believe should be the fundamental building blocks within every entry-\u00adlevel massage therapy instructional program. Existing studies did contain useful nuggets, however, what is known about learning and delivery means has changed in the interim and, equally important, the kinds of learners populating massage classrooms have changed. Work group members also reached out to all interested members of the profession for input. They commissioned fresh research to learn practitioner, instructor and employer perspectives. Then, about two-\u00adthirds of the way through the project, they provided an opportunity for public comment about which learning objectives and activities should be embraced within core education. That public commentary significantly informed the final product. Where the work group judgment differed from majority perspectives, the work group has clearly articulated those differences and provided a compelling rationale for their choices in the Project Report document. Integrating all this input into the group's work proved a massive undertaking. Coalition Support The group's work was funded by several of the Coalition organizations, but the work group worked independently and arrived at its conclusions independently, with no steering from Coalition organizations. The final report contains a highly comprehensive, detailed education blueprint that provides guidance on essential knowledge and skill components and the depth to which they should be taught. With so much detail, opportunities for divergent views certainly arise. Representatives from our seven organizations indeed may differ on several particulars. As such, neither the Coalition nor its constituent organizations, endorse every specific recommended sub-\u00adtopic, activity, or proposed weighting in the report. 4 Those differences aside, we all heartily support the message of The Core: Entry-\u00adLevel Massage Education Blueprint and its companion document The Core: Entry-\u00adLevel Analysis Project Report. We believe the work group processes have been thorough, inclusive, intellectually honest, and defensible. Their instructional design approaches are solidly grounded. Their development of a tailored, innovative learning taxonomy is potentially an important gift to vocational education. The work group agreed to clear parameters to guide their work. Following initial Coalition guidance, they put aside attachment to any particular philosophies or products to focus on outputs that reflected data findings, feedback from the profession, and the best interests of massage clients. The Coalition specifically supports important work group choices to include in basic instruction for all massage therapists not only assessment protocols, but also the development of skills necessary to \"choose appropriate massage and bodywork application methods to benefit [each] client's unique health picture.\" The Coalition also commends the work group for its inclusive bridging approach, in response to profession feedback on the initial draft, to long-\u00adstanding profession differences about techniques, approaches and language with reference to application methods. Rather than choose between Western and Eastern approaches and vocabulary, or among diverse styles and forms, the work group usefully has organized its recommended content around approaching \"application methods and techniques based on ways in which the hands and other anatomical tools ... manipulate ... soft tissue structures.\" We believe that the efforts of work group members have resulted in an extraordinary, ground-\u00adbreaking body of work. Their Blueprint, and the underlying process described in the report, gains strength from its intellectual integrity and independence. Core Outcomes and Instructional Hours Recommendations One key focus of the project is to recommend the minimum number of instructional hours schools and proficient educators need to prepare their students for entry into the profession. Instead of attaching a relatively arbitrary number of hours to subjects and topics, the work group approached this task by using data and feedback to define core content first - differentiating foundational learning from advanced theory and practice. It was only in the final month of its endeavors, when the blueprint was complete, that the work group tabulated hours for subjects, topics, and sub-\u00adtopics by translating learning objectives into recognizable classroom learning experiences as a means to determine timeframes. 5 That said, the work group's eventual recommendation that approximately 625 classroom hours of capable instruction would be required for students to acquire just core skills and abilities is invigorating. For context, a majority of states with massage regul ation (28 of the 45 states including D.C.) now require 500 total education hours; another 7 require between 570 and 600 hours, and 10 require more than 625 hours. Still, the typical distance to be bridged may not be so daunting: a 2012 survey of massage programs revealed that average program length was 697 hours. The hour estimate is what it is - an honest, objective best estimate by seven instructional design and curriculum experts who thoroughly examined the profession's body of past work in this realm. The elements making up The Core were built piece by piece. The 625 hour total represents simply the summing of the instructional hours associated with each of the pieces. We encourage interested parties to focus less upon the total hours and more on recommended subject matter and subtopics. Indeed, many massage therapy instructional programs already provide more than 625 total education hours. The Coalition recommends that, in addition to meeting the total education hours mandated by individual states, every massage school curriculum include Core report recommended subjects, topics and weighting. This report will require each of the constituent organizations to assess our perspectives on the subject of appropriate education hours. What we do clearly agre e upon is that the work group endeavors represent real progress in that its findings are based upon substantive assessment. That is far superior to arbitrary bases and biases that all too frequently have animated past decisions by licensing boards, cities, accrediting bodies, professional associations and others. Education Costs: Career Impacts One other constituency - prospective massage school students - will be impacted should The Core gain the breadth of influence we seek. As previously noted, most states now require a minimum of 500 hours of massage instruction to qualify for a license. Adoption of The Core would entail a 25% increase in minimum required instructional hours, which will likely translate into more tuition dollars for students. It is important to note that today 40% -\u00ad 50% of massage school graduates exit the field within 24 months after graduation. Many factors contribute to this result, including unrealistic expectations about the physical demands of massage work, compensation realities, and evolving life circumstances for 20-\u00adsomethings. Implementing The Core won't cause all attrition from the field to cease, but, by providing a sound knowledge and skill 6 foundation, a more functional curriculum should materially help to lessen the proportion of massage school graduates having to write off the cost of their massage education just a year or two out from graduation. We believe that use of The Core has the potential to lengthen and strengthen the careers of new massage school graduates; that is a cost benefit that will outweigh any increase in tuition from a 500-\u00adhour program. The Importance of Diversity It is vital to understand what The Core is not - it is not a complete massage school curriculum. The contents of this report are seen as the core - the foundational knowledge and skills every beginning massage therapist should possess - that should be part of every entry-\u00adlevel massage instructional program, but not the entirety. The massage and bodywork profession benefits from diversity in program points of emphasis and features. Diversity and innovation are profession strengths. While we believe that a student completing an instructional program containing just the recommended core elements would be ready to begin practice, we encourage individual schools to add program elements that reflect each school's expertise and philosophy, or to provide greater instructional depth in selected subject areas. Indeed, the recommended hours allocated to the practice of essential massage and bodywork application methods are independent of any specific modality. The work group listened to profession feedback that insisted that one form of hands-\u00adon work is not superior to others. Instead, the defining feature of massage and bodywork is therapeutic, structured touch, regardless of the system through which it is applied. This is a significant departure from previous thinking in our profession, one that builds on valuable diversity and exploration in education. What's Next? The Coalition believes use of The Core will elevate instruction, because it presents clear learning objectives and guidelines. Relatively inexperienced instructors will especially benefit from an improved road map. However, it is important to understand that the ELAP blueprint and the hours allocated to topics define minimum classroom hours. The blueprint places an emphasis on practical, real-\u00adworld learning appropriate for adult education. It assumes that teachers are competent, that learners have average learning ability, that only the defined content is taught, and that class time is well structured and used efficiently. Clearly, with these caveats, instructor training needs greater focus. Next steps in our profession should focus on helping massage content experts transition into classrooms with effective strategies to support adult learning. 7 Our desire is that The Core: Entry-\u00adLevel Massage Education Blueprint will have a positive, transforming impact on the massage therapy profession. Our organizations do not have the power to force the re-\u00admodeling of massage therapy instructional programs, but we believe that a movement toward adopting the ELAP standards would be beneficial for both massage therapists and massage therapy consumers. We aspire to have this report influence several profession audiences: the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards, which can use The Core as it builds guidelines for a model practice act; state licensing boards, which can use The Core in setting education requirements for licensees; the Alliance for Massage Therapy Education, which can refer to The Core in creating teacher-\u00adtraining standards and curricula; the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork, which can use The Core as it identifies beginning vs. advanced knowledge and skills for its Board Certification credential; professional membership organizations, which can use The Core in shaping membership criteria; the Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation, which can use the Core in evaluating massage and bodywork curricula for programmatic accreditation; other accrediting organizations, which can use The Core in shaping their accreditation criteria; school owners, administrators and faculty, who can use The Core to strengthen or validate curricula and to adopt consistent learning outcomes; and, potential massage therapy students, as they consider where to enroll. The Core may also influence publishers and writers in the development of new textbooks and teaching materials; continuing education providers who can develop offerings that build onto Core principles; employers, who will be able to rely on graduates of programs that use The Core to have dependable skills; health care providers, who want to make referrals to consistently well-\u00adeducated massage therapists, and finally the end-\u00adusers: massage therapy consumers, who will more reliably be able to get the therapeutic massage they are looking for. The single most powerful lever for change would be a decision by every state massage therapy licensing board to require license applicants to have completed an education program that includes The Core. Pragmatically, such a requirement could neither be retroactive nor immediate. Time would be required for schools to implement the new recommendations, for teaching materials to be developed and for creation of a method to identify which programs have implemented The Core. 8 The heavy lifting - identifying and prioritizing the key needed knowledge and skills - is done. However, The Core relies upon other stakeholders in the profession to take important next steps. Experience matters. Committed massage therapy professionals d evelop advanced skills from working with diverse clients, but this is only possible with a good start in the profession - and that requires a fundamentally sound core education. The Core provides a persuasive, comprehensive road map, available for all to use: a gift to the profession. Let u s individually and collectively seize this profession improvement opportunity.

Created by the ELAP Work Gr oup, the Blueprint also informs the Work Group's recommend ed total number of minimum hours of entry -level education. The Blueprint may prove a useful starting place for schools that wish to evaluate and evolve their curricula. The strong instructional de sign that underlies the Blueprint illuminates how people learn to support instructor best practices in the development of classroom activities, written materials, and educational experiences. The data -informed recommendations for key terms and concepts, hands -on skills, and effective and appropriate language and behaviors; the proper educa tional scaffolding illuminated by progressive learning objectives; the examples of educational experiences used to tabulate hours; and the organization of information based on increasing levels of knowledge and skill complexity support exceptional curriculum design, content development, and teaching. Nevertheless, the Blueprint is not meant to mandate specific classroom activities. Rather, it is a model of the essential foundations of massage and bodywork learning. Each school has a unique philosophy that allows it to differentiate itself for prospective learners in the marketplace. Schools are encouraged to teach additional hours and learning objectives in topics outlined by the Blueprint or in other topics based on their individual goals for their graduates. This introduction explains the terminology and instructional design that underlies the Blueprint's structure and the organization of subjects, topics, and sub -topics to support stakeholder use of the document. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 11 Terminology Affective (Feeling) Do main: Learning related to attitudes, values, and motivations established through self -awareness, self -exploration, opportunities to develop new ways to respond, effective role modeling, and classroom experiences. Cognitive (Knowledge) Domain : Learning rela ted to the acquisition of information, understanding, and mental skills from participation in educational experiences. Competent: A therapist who performs his or her job properly. Education theory: Ideas about how to structure learning experiences to faci litate learning. Entry -level education: Education that prepares a person to enter a profession and continue to develop knowledge and skill through experience.

Instructional design: The process of planning learning experiences to make the acquisition of knowledge and skill s more efficient, effective, and appealing. Interpersonal (Relating) Domain: Learning related to the development of skills necessary to initiate, maintain, and manage positive relationships with a range of people in a variety of contexts. Learner: A person who is learning; a student, pupil, apprentice, or trainee. Learning domain: A defined area or category of learning (cognitive, psychomotor, affective, and interpersonal). Learning experiences: Planned educational e vents or activities in whic h a learner experiences something that results in a change in his or her thinking, understanding, skills, values, or behaviors. Learning objective: A focused statement in specific and measurable terms that describes what a learner will know or be able to d o as a result of a learning experience.

Learning theory: Ideas about how people take in, process, store, recall, and apply information. Lesson plan: An instructor's detailed description of content and instructional strategies for one class. Psychomotor (Skills) Domain : Learning related to the development of well- coordinated physical activity, including the use of effective and professional language and behaviors as a result of training, hands -on learning experiences, and practice. Safe Therapist : In this document, a safe therapist is one who participates in behaviors that protect the health and well -being of clients and self . \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 12 Instructional Design Basics Instructional design (also called instructional systems design) is the process of planning learning experiences that make the acquisition of knowledge a nd skills more efficient, effective, and appealing. A number of models exist based on various learning and education theories, including Merrill's First Principles of Instruction, the ADDIE Model, the Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model, Kemp's Instructi onal Design Model, and many more. Usually models outline the steps in a design process based on the learning or education theory undergirding the model. For example, the commonly used ADDIE Model uses these phases: 1. Analyze : The instructional designer analyzes the environments in which learning occurs (e.g., brick and mortar classrooms deliver content differently from online environments, etc.), the characteristics of the learners (e.g., generation Y learners learn differently from baby boomer learners, et c.), and the desired outcomes of the learning process (e.g., if the learning is used to prepare a person for a particular career, what knowledge, skills, and attitudes does the learner need to be successful? ). 2. Design: In the design phase, point A and poi nt B of the class, unit, module, course, or program are described. For example, the ELAP group defined point A as a person with a desire to become a massage or bodywork therapist who enrolls in a massage or bodywork training program. Point B is a massage t herapist ready to enter the profession and work safely and competently. With point s A and B defined , the instructional design team outlines the subjects, topics, and sub - topics that comprise the learning areas and writes learning outcomes and objectives to show the step -by-step progression of the learner through the educational process. 3. Develop: In the development phase, the instructional design team plans learner assessments and outlines learning experiences such as lecture s, demonstrations, discussion s, projects, and homework assignments. Sometimes these take the form of lesson plans , and materials are developed (e.g., lecture notes) and provided to instructors. Sometimes, instructors are given a lesson plan but develop their own teaching materials. Classroom activities should lead to learner acquisition of the defined learning objectives and outcomes. 4. Implement : Using developed materials such as a lesson plan, instructors employ a variety of teaching methods to teach the learners the identified knowled ge and skills. 5. Evaluate : The progress of learners and their ability to demonstrate achievement of the defined outcomes is assessed to measure the effectiveness of the learning experience and the instructional design. The class, unit, model, course, or pr ogram is revised when weakness is detected. The ELAP Work Group selected best practices and methods from a number of instructional design models, learning theories, and current strategies for adult education. They conducted an extensive process to gather information from consumers, employers, educators, and professionals in order to \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 13 identify essential knowledge and skill components for safe and competent entry -level education (review the ELAP Final Report for details). They outlined the subjects, topics, and sub -topics that comprise core learning in massage therapy, and wrote learning outcomes and objectives at progressively complex levels to move learners effectively from point A to point B in a model educational blueprint . Finally, they translated learning objectives into learning experiences with defined timeframes. The most significant instructional design elements of the ELAP Blueprint are the ELAP Learning Taxonomy, the use of formal learning outcomes and objectives, and the descriptions of lear ning experiences and ti meframes in the ELAP Hours Rationale document (Appendix C in the Report) . The ELAP Learning Taxonomy A learning taxonomy is a model that classifies learning in progressively complex levels. The structure of the Blueprint is based on the ELAP Learning Taxonomy. Most educators are familiar with Bloom's Taxonomy, which outlines six levels of cognitive learning. A number of other education researchers have also developed learning taxonomies in one or more of the four learning domains: The Cognitive (Knowledge) Domain : The cognitive domain describes the levels of learning in the acquisition of information, understanding, and mental skills that come from participation in educational experiences. The Psychomotor (Skills) Domain : The psychomotor domain describes the levels of learning in the development of well -coordinated physical activity , including the use of effective and professional language and behaviors, as a result of training, hands -on learning experiences, and practice. The Affective (Feeling) Domain: The affective domain describes the levels of learning related to attitudes, values, and motivations established through self -awareness, self- exploration, opportunities to develop new ways to respond, effective role- modeling, an d classroom experiences. The Interpersonal (Relating) Domain: The interpersonal domain describes the levels of learning skills that are necessary to initiate, maintain, and manage positive social relationships with a range of people in a variety of contexts. Research conducted by the ELAP instructional designers to choose among the most widely accepted forms of each of these different learning taxonomies identified a significant problem. Each taxonomy outlines learning in slightly differing levels, and in n umbers of levels, making it impossible for the four taxonomies to be integrated and aligned in a unified, effective instructional design model appropriate for massage therapy . For example, Bloom's Taxonomy has six levels in the cognitive domain, while popu lar psychomotor, affective, and interpersonal taxonomies consist of three to seven levels depending on the author. Furthermore, most taxonomies separate learning into small, fragmented step s, including some that do not apply in all teaching situations or i n all disciplines. While of some theoretical value, s uch taxonomies make it more difficult to match teaching methods to learning \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 14 objectives. The ELAP instructional designers took a bold step and built on the work of established educational research to develop a new , unified learning taxonomy that reflects standardized key levels of learning and teaching align ed across the four domains (Figure 1). Because of its coherence, simplicity , and practicality, this new learning taxonomy has the potential to positive ly influence education beyond massage and bodywork . FIGURE 1: ELAP LEARNING TAXONOMY Domains Cognitive Psychomotor Affective Interpersonal Level 1 Receive and Respond Attain and Comprehend Observe and Imitate Receive and Respond Seek and Support Level 2 Apply Use and Connect Practice and Refine Value Communicate and Negotiate Level 3 Problem Solve Choose and Plan Naturalize and Adapt Integrate and Internalize Compromise and Resolve L earners learn and master new knowledge and skills in all domains through a process that gen erally occurs at three levels: 1.Level 1 - Receive and Respond: In the initial stage of learning, learners receive information by attending to the words and actions of the instructor, reading written materials and/or watchin g o r listening to material in other media formats, observing demonstrations of skills, noticing the ir o wn feelings and responses to new information, and listening to peer contributions, and then being able to respond in an initially simple way. a.Co gnitive Domain : In the cognitive domain, learners attain basic terms, facts, and key concepts. They demonstrate learning at this level by recalling information and showing the ir b asic comprehension. Sample learning objectives: i.Define the . .Psychomotor Domain: In the psychomotor domain, learners observe the movements, language, and behaviors of instructors. They demonstrate learning at this level by imitating the skills they observe in a simple, mostly rote manner. Sample learning objectives: i.Apply effleurage strokes at three speeds (slow, moderate, and fast). ii. Imitate the language an instructor uses to minimize the power differential with a client during a client interview. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 15 c. Affective Domain: In the affective domain, learners begin to recognize attitudes, feelings, and values appropriate for a massage or bodywork professional. They demonstrate learning at this level by attending classes in a receptive state, being open to new thoughts and feelings, and attending to their own feelings and responses. Sample learning objectives: i. Recognize components of dignity and respect. ii. Outline the elements of trust in a therapeutic relationship. d. Interpersonal Domain: In the interpersonal domain, learners seek improved relationships with others , are receptive to alternative viewpoints to enhance their understanding of people or situations , and begin to improve their relationship skills. They demonstrate learning at this level by actively listening to instructors and peers and by supporting the ideas and feeling of others. Sample learning objectives: i. Listen carefully to others in order to understand their feelings and points of view. ii. Express one's own ideas willingly, openly, and honestly. 2. Level 2 - Apply: Following the initial stage of learning, learners start to use and apply received information in new ways, to practice and refine their new skills, to refine their values and attitudes in a professional manner, and to build stronger interpersonal relationships with peers and instructors through more effe ctive communication and negotiation skills. a. Cognitive Domain: In the cognitive domain, learners now analyze and discuss information, compare and contrast concepts, place ideas into categories or broader contexts, and us e the information they have gained in new ways . They demonstrate learning at this level by applying what they know in new situations. Sample learning objectives: i. Compare and contrast the characteristics of therapeutic relationships, social relationships, and dual relationships. ii. Analyze cl ient-therapist scenarios to distinguish between therapist behaviors that demonstrate ethical professional touch and therapist behaviors that demonstrate unethical, unprofessional touch. b. Psychomotor Domain : In the psychomotor domain, learners practice and refine their skills based on feedback from instructors and peers. They demonstrate their learning at this level by showing improving skills in practice situations. Sample learning objectives: i. Practice making fluid transitions between different Swedish st rokes. ii. Refine one's language skills to determine if deep work is being applied at a comfortable depth for the client. c. Affective Domain: In the affective domain, learners personalize values and attitudes appropriate for the profession; their motivation is enhanced, and they are setting personal goals. They demonstrate their learning at this level by showing willingness to challenge their own assumptions and to personally adopt professional ethics and values . Sample learning objectives: i. Attend to and contr ol one's own emotional state in a challenging situation. ii. Demonstrate respect for all clients and their human dignity. d. Interpersonal Domain: In the interpersonal domain, learners communicate honestly and assertively and calmly defend their opinions whil e being open to new ideas. They \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 16 demonstrate learning at this level by negotiating outcomes with others through effective communication and discussion. Sample learning objectives: i. Seek feedback from peers and instructors to work through problems. ii. Disagree respectfully and openly when one's own views differ from those held by peers and instructors. 3. Level 3 - Problem Solve: At the highest level, learners are progressing with self- confidence to synthesize information and use it to solve problems, develop a personal style, adapt techniques in unique situations, integrate their feelings and understanding to grow on a personal level , and develop an ability to lead and teach others. a. Cognitive Domain: In the cognitive domain, learners evaluate choices, make decisions, plan strategies, defend their choices, self -evaluate, and respectfully comment on the choices of others. They demons trate learning at this level by identifying or creating solutions, evaluating best practices, and beginning to contribute to new knowledge. Sample learning objectives: i. Hypothesize about one way a client's attitudes, beliefs, and expectations might influen ce the results of a massage session. ii. Present the results of a 1 -hour full -body massage session including findings from the client's health intake process and interview, session planning to sequence body areas, palpation findings during the massage, and cl ient feedback from the session. b. Psychomotor Domain : In the psychomotor domain, physical skills now feel natural and learners are developing their own style for techniques. They adapt techniques based on each client's needs and responses. They may develo p unique massage strokes or sequencing ideas. They demonstrate their learning at this level by confidently showing professional skills in practice situations. Sample learning objectives: i. Modify massage methods to meet the needs of each client. ii. Coordinate one's body mechanics for effective and efficient application of massage methods . c. Affective Domain: In the affective domain, learners internalize their feelings and attitudes about learning and massage therapy such that an integrated positive value system guides their professional behavior. They demonstrate their learning at this level by speaking and behaving in a manner suggesting they have aligned their personality with professional values. Sample learning objectives: i. Respect all individuals and the inh erent worth of all clients. ii. Weigh cause -effect outcomes to determine how to act in any situation. d. Interpersonal Domain: In the interpersonal domain, learners are willing to compromise with others, resolve issues or conflicts, and facilitate positive int eractions with others. They demonstrate their learning at this level with an ability to effectively lead or teach others, including peers and clients. Sample learning objectives: i. Work through differences with another to arrive at an agreement. ii. Effectively lead a client to an understanding of how lifestyle habits may support the benefits of massage. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 17 One of the goals of all learning taxonomies is to guide the structuring of educational experiences in a manner appropriate for how people actually learn. The ELA P Learning Taxonomy helped the W ork Group develop learning objectives at progressively complex levels to suggest appropriate learning experiences taught in an effective sequence to improve learner comprehension and skill. Learning Objectives and Learning Outcomes Appropriate use of the Blueprint depends on understanding the purpose and educationa l use of learning objectives and outcomes. Learning objectives and outcomes are the primary way that educators state and communicate to others the knowledge and skills they expect their learners to acquire. Well - constructed learning objectives and outcomes leave little doubt about what a successful learner should know and be able to do at the conclusion of a classroom activity, class, course, or program. They help educators plan effective and meaningful teaching strategies and learning experiences, teach to pics to the appropriate depth, develop fair assessments, and organize classes, courses, and programs that provide effective continuity and sequencing for learners. Learning outcomes and objectives both have three parts: 1. Conditions: Condition statements describe the circumstances in which learning occurs. They can be general (e.g., Having completed 20 hours of instruction, or having read assigned materials , etc.) or very specific (e.g., Having analyzed three client scenarios depicting behaviors that cros s therapists' boundaries, etc.), depending on the particular objective. 2. Behaviors: The verb in the objective or outcome specifies what measurable action the learner must take to demonstrate the acquired knowledge, skill, or behavior. Verbs like know, understand, grasp, and appreciate are not used in objectives because they are difficult to measure. For example, how would an educator know if a learner \"appreciates\" a concept? What exactly does it mean for a learner to \"understand\" the lymphatic system? Instead, verbs like list compare , practice , refine , choose , plan and integrate help instructional designers clarify measurable learning. 3. Criteria: Criteria phrasing in an objective specifies how well the learner must perform the behavior. For example: Having participated in practice sessions, the learner will demonstrate proper draping methods that are neat, secure, and modest . In some cases, criteria are implied or it is assumed that the learner will perform a skill correctly or following a prescribed protocol. In the Blueprint , learning outcomes are defined for each topic. Outcomes describe broad aspects of knowledge, skills, and behaviors expected to be attained over several learning experience s or classes. Outcom es are usually formally assessed , such as through a written examination, practical evaluation, verbal examination, or graded activity . For example: Having completed 80 hours of instruction and practice in Swedish massage techniques, the learner will effectively perform a full- body Swedish massage \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 18 demonstrating proper draping, correct application of strokes, smooth transitions, professional client communication, and good body mechanics on a practical evaluation. Learning objectives are more highly fo cused statements of intent that describe specific units of knowledge or of a particular skill, rather than broader outcomes. Objectives can typically be accomplished in short time periods, and most can be informally assessed (e.g., instructor observation and feedback rather than a graded activity). For example: T he learner will apply petrissage strokes to the posterior leg. Many different specific learning objectives add up to the knowledge or skill integrated into a learning outcome. Well -written learning objectives clarify the extent or depth necessary for acceptable knowledge and skill acquisition. A poorly written learning objective might state, \"Know the nerve plexuses of the body.\" In a massage educational program, such a learning objective might lead an instructor to teach more depth than is reasonable and needed for assuring safe and competent massage practice. Instead, specific learning objectives would be written as \"Define the term nerve plexus \" and \"List the four spinal nerve plexuses from memory .\" Now the instructor better understands how much teaching is required. In class, the instructor will likely define the term, review each of the spinal nerve plexuses briefly, and provide one or two examples that are relevant for massage therapists. For in stance, learners might be directed to pay special attention to the brachial plexus because it can be damaged in areas of caution if strokes are applied too forcefully. Learning objectives in the Blueprint are written at progressively complex levels withi n the ELAP Learning Taxonomy, again to expedite the most efficient learning. For example, we'll show what progressively complex levels look like in the concept of professionalism. In level 1, learners might participate in a lecture/discussion where behavio rs related to professionalism are described one by one so that learners gain a full picture of professional standards. The instructor might check learners' knowledge by asking them to list four behaviors that demonstrate professionalism. Learners who can c omplete this task have attained the level 1 learning they need to continue progressing. In level 2, learners begin to personalize, explore, apply, use, and connect the terms and concepts from level 1. For example, learners might be asked to discuss how the y embody and practice professional behaviors in their own life, or they might be asked to analyze client -therapist scenarios to identify professional or unprofessional behaviors in a massage practice context. Finally, in level 3, learners might be asked to self- evaluate by comparing their own behaviors with established standards of professionalism and identifying their weaknesses in order to set goals for self- improvement. This \"scaffolding\" of learning objectives is essential for good instructional design and effective teaching. In contrast, if learners were asked to jump right in and evaluate their own behaviors by comparing themselves to standards they have not yet learned and explored, they might rightly feel confused and irritated and disengage from the learning experience. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 19 Learning Experiences Learning experiences are events or activities in which learners experience something that results in a change in their thinking, understanding, skills, values, or behaviors. Learning experiences are sometimes designed based on the education theory adopted by a school. For example, brain -based learning theory advocates three primary instructional tec hniques to facilitate learning: Relaxed alertness - the classroom and learning experiences should be nonthreatenin g because learner stress is believed to be counterproductive to learning. Orchestrated immersion - learners should actively participate in realistic, interactive, and multifaceted educational experiences that cover the same information from many vantage points. Active processing - learners should regularly share their feelings and ideas about learning by processing classroom activities in discussion groups. Learning experiences in a brain -based learning environment might include stress -reducing warm -up activities, the opportunity to work in peer groups to solve problems, and lots of discussion time. Compare those experiences to the types of learning experiences in a program based on the Lewinian Experiential Learning Model: Here- and- now experience - Immediate, concrete personal experience is the focal point for learning. Learners explore concepts and skills on their own before any formal teaching takes place, or instead of formal teaching. Observation and r eflection - Learners observe their experiences and reflect on their learning. They share data about their experiences with peers. Testing implications of concepts - Learners make conclusions based on their observations and test the implications of concepts in new situations. They plan modifications of their behavior to improve subsequent experiences or outcomes. Learning experiences in this model are more learner directed, flowing, and exploratory. For example, learners might be asked to explore how to keep a client covered for modesty while exposing the necessary areas for massage. Over time, they would learn draping skills through trial and error experiences. Th is would not likely involve the \"relaxed alertness\" of the first model (especially for the classmates acting as clients), but learning objectives could be met in this manner over time. No single theory fully explains the diversity of human learning or ad ult learning, so instructional designers draw on many models when planning learning experiences. The Blueprint design suggests learning experiences at each of the three levels of the ELAP Learning Taxonomy to ensure learners are exposed to the right level of challenge as they progress from lower- order to higher -order thinking and skills. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 20 Cognitive Learning Experiences As mentioned previously, at level 1 of the ELAP Learning Taxonomy, learners receive information and respond to it in a relatively simple way. Cognitive learning experiences focus on terms, facts, and concepts. Learners might participate in a lecture and ask questions, read assigned material, take notes, and/or complete a basic written activity such as matching terms to their written descripti ons, labeling a diagram of a bone, recalling a fact, giving an example, or making a list of items. A look at the list of terms at the beginning of each topic section in the Blueprint makes it clear that massage therapy students must memorize an enormous number of new words during their training program. Terminology therefore should probably be taught systematically and explicitly. The ability to define key terms or restate information in their own words supports learners as they move into level 2 learning . In level 2 of the cognitive domain, learning experiences are designed to help learners apply concepts, make connections, anticipate the consequences of particular actions, and approach problems effectively. Discussion is an important activity because it helps learners personalize content and think about its particular relevance and immediate real- life applications. When people discuss issues and concepts, they pay attention and absorb information, process it internally, connect it to previous experience, predict outcomes, and express their ideas to peers. Peer reaction to sharing provides important input that helps shape individual thinking and behaviors. Written activities and peer work support learners as they identify relevant information, utilize o utside data sources, break down complex concepts or models to examine their component parts, and/or brainstorm possible solutions to problems. Learners might analyze client -therapist scenarios to determine effective or ineffective therapist behaviors, or c ontrast alternative methods or procedures to predict therapeutic outcomes. These activities help prepare learners to move into level 3 learning where they use their knowledge to solve problems. Level 3 learning experiences support learners as they think critically to choose safe and appropriate massage and bodywork methods and plan sessions with clients. Activities might include simulations in which learners rule out contraindications or plan ses sion adaptions based on analysis of mock client health forms. They might write up session plans to think through the adaptations they might make based on a client's pathology. Sharing plans with peers and receiving feedback, and giving good feedback to peers, supports lateral thinking, self- evaluation, goal setting, and growth. Note that some material is taught only to level 1, some to level 2, and some up to level 3 depending on the level of learning necessary to ensure safe and competent practice at the entry -level. Level 3 involves moving into a level of mastery that sometimes goes beyond the entry -level as noted in the Blueprint by \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 21 the phrase; there are no relevant learning objectives for level 3 of this sub- topic. The learning taxonomy and structure o f the Blueprint reflects the whole learning process, but for learners who are just entering practice they don't need to attain mastery in every sub -topic in a foundation program. Level 3 learning in some cases, will happen as the new graduate gains profess ional experience or takes continuing education classes. Schools teaching longer training programs or advanced programs can add to the Blueprint by writing additional learning objectives at level 3 in some content areas. Interactive Lecture The ELAP Bluep rint often utilizes interactive lecture as a primary teaching strategy because it is a time - efficient method for level 1 and level 2 cognitive learning within an effective and meaningful learning experience. Interactive lecture is different from traditiona l lecture in that it follows a prescriptive formula to teach terms and concepts in a highly structured fashion. Lectures last no longer than 10 minutes and use strong visual aids to help learners create mental constructs of information. Short written activ ities and small group discussion opportunities are interspersed throughout and between short lectures to increase learner personalization, engagement, and recall. Psychomotor Learning Experiences In level 1 of the psychomotor domain of the ELAP Learning Taxonomy, learners observe instructor demonstrations and imitate client positioning methods, draping skills, massage and bodywork methods, body mechanics, and appropriate and effective professional language and behaviors. In level 2, learning experience s involve structured practice time in which learners can safely explore variations in strokes, the use of language, and the use of professional behavior, with feedback from an instructor or peers. Role- playing activities help ensure that learners can handle challenging client situations on the fly and put their knowledge of ethics, boundaries, and professional communication to practical use. At some points in the Blueprint, condition statements indicate that certain learning objectives, especially those r elated to ethics, be reinforced with \"on -the-spot\" practice. On -the-spot practice (described in the literature by various names such as \"in -context learning,\" \"orchestrated immersion,\" and \"emotional- context teaching method that knowingly p laces learners under some pressure. In many traditional massage programs, it is common practice to keep learners safe and comfortable. They learn about things like dealing with a hostile coworker, responding to a client complaint, or dealing with a sexual boundary -crossing in the calm , supportive environment of their classroom. When they are actually confronted in later practice by a hostile coworker, angry client, or sexual boundary crosser, however, they are often unable to implement an effective protocol in the moment because of the stress created by the situation. On -the-spot practice provides opportunities for learners to decrease the \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 22 emotional charge of stressful situations and repeatedly practice effective responses. Following is an example of on -the-spot pr actice in a massage classroom. Your learners have completed their training in ethics. They have created scenes demonstrating how to respond to challenging client situations, boundary -crossing behaviors, emotional release, sexual arousal responses, and other relevant scenarios, and all have passed a written examination on ethical terms and concepts. Now they are exploring massage and bodywork application methods in a hands -on practice class. You walk up to a pair of learners and say, \"Sarah, I'm going to ask you to pause your practice for a moment and imagine that your exchange partner has just asked you out on a date. I'd like you to demonstrate appropriate and effective language and behavior to decline the date and reestablish the boundaries of a therapeutic relationship \u2014go!\" Sarah is now under pressure and may or may not respond appropriately and effectively this first time. However, over time, if you continue to give learners on-the-spot practice situations, she will likely learn to cope with the e motional pressure of the moment and develop automatic and effective methods for dealing with such challenging situations. A s learners continue to practice their skills, strokes, professional language, and appropriate and effective behaviors, they start to feel natural. In level 3, learning experiences provide opportunities for learners to integrate numerous individual skills into fluid wholes. They can now manage a client throughout a session from the greeting, to the health intake process, through the session, to the session close and collection of the payment. Massage and bodywork is now fluid and delivered with a variety of methods that have been chosen or adapted to match the requests of the individual client. Learners are flexible and can modify a plan moment -by-moment during application to address unforeseen client needs. Learners are now ready to participate in the school's student clinic and work with members of the public. L earning Experiences and Hours The ELAP Work Group has outlined le arning experiences in Appendix C of the Entry -Level Anal ysis Report titled, \" Hours Rationale \". The primary goal was to tabulate the amount of time it takes an average adult learner to achieve the learning objectives and outcomes defined for that topic. Hour recommendations at the topic level, and summed at the subject level, inform the Work Group 's final recommendation of minimum education hours. Th e ELAP Blueprint suggests the use of interactive lectures, written activities, discussions, peer work, demonstrations, structured hands -on practice time, role -playing, written session planning, and simulations of massage and bodywork sessions as primary methods to move learners from point A to point B. However, other types of learning experiences could easily be substituted for those in the Blueprint in roughly the same time periods. It is important to point out that the ELAP Work Group chose \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 23 familiar learning experiences in order to tabulate time and that creative alternatives are encouraged as long as they are practical and appropriate for adult learners. Th e ELAP Work Group recognizes that educator s hold varying philosophies of education and encourage progressive teaching strategies and unique ways to approach information whenever it makes sense to do so. In the experiential learning example described earlier, an instructor chose to have learners explore safe and modest draping through trial and error rather than by providing a formal demonstration and structured practice. As long as learners have enough practice time to adapt their methods based on previous errors and feedback from peers, it is likely that this instructional strategy would eventually produce safe and competent draping skills. On the other hand, this method of instruction might prove more time consuming than teaching draping more conventionally, and it might feel like a waste of time to adults who tend to be pragmatic learners. Sometimes exploration is useful, and sometimes learners just want to know the best way to do something and then move on. W hile progressive and experimental approaches to learning are often valuable, especially as our understanding of adult education evolves, educators must remain practical. We are preparing graduates for a profession, and clients and employers have established expectations. This type of education, and therefore its instructional design, thus tends to be more pragmatic than many broad education models used in K -12 programs. A good rule of thumb is that any learning experience should feel meaningful and relevant to adult learners and meet defined learning objectives in a reasonable timeframe. H omework Homework is not i ndicated in the ELAP Blueprint, nor are instructional hours assigned to tasks that might happen outside of the classroom. The ELAP Work Group recommends that schools teach the defined learning objectives during classroom hours and follow the guidelines for homework outlined by Raymond J. Wlodkowski in Enhancing Adult Motivation to Learn. In summary, Wlodkowski points out that adult learners in vocational education programs are different from adult learners in university programs and should not be exposed to the same levels of academic rigor related to homework as their university counterparts. Adult learners in vocational programs often work full- or part -time jobs, have children at home, and/or have other family obligations. Research shows that requiring these learners to do more than 1 hour of homework per night leads to higher program attrition levels and lower academic scores. Instead of out -of-class assignments that teach learners new concepts, homework should be used to reinfo rce classroom learning through review of important terms and concepts and to pr epare for written examinations. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 24 Abilities in Massage Education Abilities is the term used in postsecondary education to refer to learners ' preparedness for learning. In the E LAP Blueprint, abilities are defined as natural or acquired information, understanding, and mental and physical skills that enable a person to participate effectively in a massage and bodywork training program, obtain the knowledge and skills presented in the program, and successfully meet the school 's requirements for graduation. It is expected that learners' abilities w ill develop and strengthen over the course of the education program through regular use.

Basic academic abilities : A person with the basic academic abilities necessary for success in a massage and bodywork training program is able to: a. Read English at a basic 12th grade level as defined by the Nation al Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Note that reading levels at each grade are described as basic, proficient, or advanced. Reading aptitude research conducted in 2009 on 12th grade students nationally by NAEP reports that only 38% of 12th grade students actually achieve reading proficiency for their grade. Descriptions of reading level abilities are described in reading resources available at the NAEP website (www.nces .ed.gov ). b. Write English to a basic 9th grade level as defined by the NAEP . Note that writing aptitude research conducted in 2009 by the NAEP nationally reports that only 21% of 12th grade students achieve writing proficiency for their grade.

While abilities are understood in the ELAP Blueprint as the skills learners have ideally acquired before enrolling in the massage and bodywork training program, schools regularly report that enrolled learners \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 28 often do not possess the requisite abilities to achieve the academic level necessary fo r graduation from their program . It is suggested therefore that schools recognizing incoming learning ability gaps in their student population provide a preparatory course of study to develop these abilities in learners before they begin their massage and bodywork training. Abilities can and should be systematically and regularly reinforced at predetermin ed points during the program. The Entry -Level Massage Education Blueprint Structure The Blueprint is divided into the subjects, topics, and sub -topics that data analysis suggests belong in entry -level massage education. For a detailed look at hours tabulations based on learning experiences developed from the Blueprint learning obje ctives, please review Appendix C in the Entry -Level Analysis Project Report, \" Hours Rationale .\" Subjects: Subject sections provide an ove rview of topics and sub -topics and a recommendation for the education hours allotted to the subject. At the subject level, instructional time is rounded to the nearest hour. Topics: Topic sections of the B lueprint state the time necessary to teach the learning objectives in all sub-topic s, as part of the condition statement for the topic's learning outcomes. This section also includes a list of key term s and concepts and clarifies the use here of any terms that are not used consistently within the profession. Sub-Topics: Sub-topic sections provide the conditions for learning and define specific learning objectives in the cognitive (knowledge) and psychomotor (skills) domains at each of the three levels of the ELAP Learning Taxonomy, as appropriate. (As noted previously, some information is covered only to level 1, such as when learners need only recognize a term, while some is covered through level 2 or level 3.) Note that sub -topics do not correspond to class periods or other specific time periods. Rather, they include all the key learning objectiv es for closely related knowledge or skills, which might be covered in just a portion of one class or in multiple classes. Massage and Bodywork Learning in the Affective Domain As detailed earlier, t he affective domain describes the levels of learning re lated to attitudes, values, and motivations established through self -awareness, self- exploration, opportunities to develop new ways to respond, effective role modeling, and classroom experiences. To date, we know of no published statement of attitudes and values that all massage and bodywork professionals hold and agree are essential for the profession. While we can point to shared values in some areas, such as professional ethics, the profession is diverse, as reflected by our varied belief systems and pre ferences. Educators are encouraged to review these learning objectives in the Blueprint and add their own based on the school \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 29 philosophy. Affective domain learning objectives are not assigned separate instructional hours but are reinforced throughout a tra ining program to develop and reinforce positive attitudes and values that enhance professional motivation, life-long learning , and career success in the massage and bodywork profession. Massage and Bodywork Learning in the Interpersonal Domain The inter personal domain involves skills that are necessary to initiate, maintain, and manage positive social relationships with a range of people in a range of contexts. Learners learn interpersonal skills by modeling the effective behaviors of peers and instructo rs, developing enhanced communication skills, practicing relating skills in various contexts (e.g., group projects), and receiving feedback via instructor coaching. The Work Group decided to separate general interpersonal domain learning objectives from the primary ELAP Blueprint to prevent redundancy, since many interpersonal skills coexist with other cognitive and psychomotor learning. Those i nterpersonal skills are taught in the Career Development subject of the ELAP Map. General learning objectives related to interpersonal skills are not assigned separate instructional hours but can be reinforced throughout the training program to support efforts to develop learner professionalism and communication for entry -level practice. Conclusions The primary purpose of the ELAP Blueprint is to precisely define what a person must know and be able to do to work safely and competently at the entry level and to provide a means to tabulate minimum classroom hours based on the time it takes an average st udent to learn the defined content through competent instruction. The ELAP Work Group hopes, however, that this document will prove more than a simple rationale for hours requirements. In all, we reviewed survey information related to entry -level education from 21,814 unique respondents self- identified as students, school administrators, instructors, professional therapists, employers of massage therapists, and other massage industry pro fessionals. We consulted over 10 0 books and articles written b y the profession's most notable authors and researchers, we analyzed important work already done by other work groups in past projects, and we used best practices in modern instructional design to produce this Blueprint. We have no illusion that successf ul completion of this project will by itself transform massage education and the quality of massage being provided to clients. Other important work, such as strengthening the teaching abilities of all instructional personnel, and using these evidence -infor med recommendations for minimum education standards in regulation commands parallel attention if the Entry -Level Analysis Project and this Blueprint are to have meaningful impact. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 30 With these caveats, and acknowledging both the need and opportunity for imp rovement throughout the massage profession, we believe this project comprises one important foundational step upon which additional curriculum, teacher preparation, and regulatory standards can build. We hope this document supports your efforts and goals, whether you are a school administrator, teacher, student, massage therapist, textbook author, employer, continuing education provider, regulator, organization, or other massage industry professional. The animating spirit of this project is not to criticize the past but to contribute to the construction of a more solid and consistent educational foundation that will help those entering the massage therapy and bodywork profession to thrive in their careers while ensuring their practice is safe and beneficial for all clients . \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 31 Summary of Learning Outcomes Point A: A person with a desire to become a massage or bodywork therapist who enrolls in a massage or bodywork training program.

Curriculum designers are encouraged to use the terminology specific with their school's philosophy or the definitions of similar terms used in their textbooks. For the purposes of this document, thes e terms are defined as: Bending force : A force that deforms the tissue by compressing the inner surface of the tissue and elongating the outer surface of the tissue. Compression or compressive force : A force that deforms the tissue by pushing the ends of a structure towards one another. Elongation methods : Massage or bodywork methods that exert a tensile force on soft - tissue structures causing deformation of the tissue by pulling the ends of the structure apart. Force: Something that internally or externally causes the movement of the body to change or soft -tissue structures to deform. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 261 Gliding methods: Massage or bodywork methods where strokes are applied in a smooth continuous motion that does not lose contact with the client's skin. Gravity: A force cau sed by the Earth's gravitational pull that compresses body structures downward. Oscillating methods: Massage or bodywork methods that deforms soft tissue through the momentum created by a back and forth swinging, rocking, or vibrating motion. Percussive methods : Massage or bodywork methods that use rapid, rhythmic blows to the body with the hands held in various formations to a ffect the nervous system while briefly deforming tissue with a bending force. Shear or shearing force: A force that deforms the tissue by pulling perpendicular sections of a structure in opposite directions, or by shifting different structures against each other. Shearing methods: Massage or bodywork methods that exert a shearing force on soft - tissue structures causing deformation of the tissue by pulling perpendicular sections of a structure in opposite directions, or by shifting different structures against one another. Soft-tissue deformation: The change in the shape of soft tissue as a result of applied forces. Static methods : Massage or bo dywork methods that deform soft tissue in various ways using hand positions that are held for usually fixed lengths of time. Tension or tensile force : A force that deforms the tissue by pulling the ends of the structure apart. Tissue load: T he amount of stress soft- tissue structures are under due to forces ; too much load and the tissue might fail and be injured. Torsion force or torque : A force that deforms the tissue by compressing and twisting one end of the structure in one direction whil e the other end is held motionless or is compressed and twisted in the opposite direction. Torsion methods : Massage or bodywork methods that exert a torsion force or torque on soft-tissue structures causing deformation of the tissue by twisting it.

List three factors that contribute to competent quality of touch (e.g., warm, soft, dry, open, and confident hands that sink into the tissue at just the right depth and maintain regular and continuous contact, etc.). Review the term therapist intention. List one characteristic of therapists who lack therapeutic intention (e.g., they may not hold a clear intent for the session to benefit the client and may chat about their personal lives instead of keeping the session focused on the client, they may not ha ve ready all the supplies necessary for the session and have to hunt around for the lubricant, they may \"check out\" and think about their bills or a personal event and not remain present with the client, etc.). List two considerations related to the use o f lubricant during a massage or bodywork session (e.g., lubricant should always be used in moderation ; for deeper, slower work, or for work where fascia is the focus, little or no lubricant is used; clients should have a choice in the type of lubricant use d; attention must be paid to skin sensitivities, etc.). Explain in one's own words the concept of pacing and leading (e.g., the idea that the therapist matches the client's personal pace while entering the session and then leads the client towards a more relaxing pace as the session progresses). List two considerations related to engaging the tissue during a massage or bodywork session (e.g., the idea that clear communication regarding the agreed upon session goals, the approaches that work best, and the agreed upon depth of pressure leads to a massage/bodywork session that is therapeutic and satisfying for the client ). There are no relevant learning objectives for this sub -topic in level 3 of the psychomotor domain. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 263 Define the term therapeutic edge (e.g., the particular pace and depth of work for the specific client that allows for the greatest therap eutic change in the tissue, etc.). Explain in one's own words what the therapeutic edge feels like to a client (e.g., the place where the client feels the \"good hurt\" or therapeutic discomfort ; a technique feels \"close to the limit\" but the client also feels that the tissue is changing in a positive way and the stroke feels appropriate and \"good ,\" etc.). List two considerations related to rhythm in massage and bodywork application (e.g., the idea that strokes should be applied in regular patterns at a reg ular pace or tempo to elicit the parasympathetic nervous system response ; when strokes are delivered in uneven patterns or at an irregular pace, it is jarring for the nervous system and the client has more difficulty relaxing, etc.). List two consideratio ns related to flow and continuity in a massage or bodywork session (e.g., the idea that methods flow from one technique to another and from one body area to another through smooth transitions ; strokes should flow in one uninterrupted action so that the cli ent experiences the constant and steady pressure of hands, etc.). List two considerations related to variety in massage and bodywork sessions (e.g., the idea that therapists want to use a variety of methods to work in layers and to engage the interest of t he client, and that muscles in particular areas respond better to certain methods and techniques ; variety of methods also reduces stress on the therapist 's body that might be produced through overly repetitive motions, etc.). List two considerations related to stroke length in massage and bodywork sessions (e.g., in general wellness or relaxation sessions, long strokes are used that connect body areas together and completely cover appropriate areas ; strokes should travel the length of muscles or muscle groups when possible as cutting a stroke short can leave a client feeling frustrated, etc.). \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 264 List two considerations related to general verses specific work (e.g., the idea that broad and general application methods lead to more specific or focused methods and the n b ack to broad, general methods as the session closes, and that there is a differencebetween what a client experiences withgeneral work verses specific, focused work in just one area, etc.). List two considerations r elated to working i n l ayers (e.g., therapists often work superficial, to deep, and back to superficial, avoid ing changing the depth of work sporadically a nd j umping between layers of tissue, etc.). Explain in one's own words what it means towork at obliq ue angles (e.g., in so me s ituations therapists drop straight down into the tissue, but most often work at obliqueangles no greater than 45 degrees ; this ensures that blood vessels, lymph vessels , and nerves won't be pinched, etc.). List two consideration s to ensure tha t r esistant tissue is not forced during a stroke (e.g., slow down and wait for the tissue to release, make sure that tissue is warmed upsufficiently, find the therapeutic edge a nd wo rk in layers, etc.). Explain in one's own words how the use o f br eath during sessions benefits the client (e.g., it helps the client relax throughpotentially uncomfortable methods, it ca n s upport the release of tension, it can reduc e s ensations of pain, it can positively influence lymphatic movement, it can lea d to greater relaxation, etc.) . E xplain in one's own words what a client might mean when request ing \"deep tissue \" massage.

Describe one way a therapist's hands might apply a tensile force to a muscle (e.g., the therapist might place crossed hands with the fingers pointing away from each other on a body area, engage the tissue by dropping slightly downward, and then move the hands apart, stretching the tissue between the hands, or by using minimal or no lubricant and working away from either an origin or insertion point and \"dragging the tissue\" away from the fixed point, etc.). List two ways the application of methods that deform soft tissue with tensile force benefits the body (e.g., elongate shortened tissue, break the hydrogen bonds that hold adhered tissue together to improve range of motion, etc.).

Define the term bending force (e.g., a forc e t hat deforms the tissue by compressing th e i nner surface of the tissue and elongating the outer surface of the tissue, etc.). Describe one way a therapist' s hands might apply a bending force to a muscle (e.g., thetherapist might place both hands across the fibers on a muscle's belly and lift the muscl e s lightly to press the thumbs horizontally into the lateral aspect of the muscle's belly whil e t he origin a nd insertion points are pulle d s ideways and downward, etc.). List two ways the application of methods thatdeform soft tissue with bending force benefits the body (e.g., adhesive bonds between tissue fibers are broken making th e t issue more pliable, short ened tissue is elongated, etc.). \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 270 Explain the difference between a forc e a pplied externally that benefits soft tissue and a force applied externally that causes injury to soft tissue (e.g., a force applied with the right amount of intensity deforms the tissue in a positive way as with a massage method that elongates a shortened muscl e e ncouraging it to return to a normal restin g l ength ; a force applied with too little intensity might not produce enough tissue deformation to cause a positive change butstill feels enjoyable; a force applied with too much intensity might produce so much tissue deformation that injury results such as whe n a muscle is overstretched and muscle fibers are torn, etc.).

Curriculum designers are encouraged to use the terminology specific with their school's philosophy or the definitions of similar terms used in their textbooks. For the purposes of this document, these terms are defined as: Continuity: The continuous contact the therapist makes with the client's body and in which the overall pacing and rhythm of the massage remain consistent. Direct pressure techniques: Often used interchangeably with static compression and ischemic compression. Fascial stretching: Any stroke variation that applies tensile force to myofascial tissues. Fascial torqueing : Any stroke variation that applies bending or rotary forces to myofascial tissues. Flow: The smooth application of strokes where one stroke flows into another stroke via a smooth transition. Myofascial approaches : Term used to recognize a number of myofascial forms and system s including connective tissue massage, myofascial myofascial release, myofascial myofascial unwinding , which address the myofascia of the body to promote therapeutic change . Neuromuscular Approaches : Term used to recognize a num ber of forms and systems that address trigger points including trigger point therapy , neuromuscular therapy, trigger point pressure release . For the purposes of this document, neuromuscular approaches are defined as the treatment of myofascial pain and dysfunction utilizing any combination of techniques spe cifically directed at deactivating trigger points and/or tender points , restoring optim al muscle resting length, and reducing or normalizing muscular tension . Sequencing: Refers both to the sequence of strokes (the order in which strokes are applied to a particular body area) and to the overall sequence of the massage (the order in which body areas are massaged). Transition: Smooth and enjoyable movement from one type of technique to another type of technique, or the efficient progression of skills such as the change from undraping a body area to the introduction of the therapist's hands ont o the client's body.

List three anatomical \"tools\" massage therapists use to palpa te tissue (e.g., fingertips, palms, knuckles, forearms, elbows, etc.). List three general goals of palpation (e.g., detect irregularity in tissue textures, detect irregularity in tissue tone, sense differences in tissue temperature, notice variations in tissue hydration, spot structural asymmetry, identify restrictions that are causing a reduction in range of motion, recognize areas that are painful, locate a specific structure, identify fiber direction of a muscle to apply a specific technique correctly, distinguish between changes in tissue from the beginning of a session to the end of a session, etc.). Match these general palpation skills to their written descriptions: cognitive skills (e.g., the knowledge that informs touch such as the ability to name body landmarks in a particular region), kinesthetic discrimination skills (e.g., the ability to sense, feel and inter pret normal and altered qualities of the body's tissues such as temperature, texture, fiber direction, densit y, depth, hydration, and tone , etc.), communication skills (e.g., the ability to use correct terminology and name sensations so that perceptions of tissue can be categorized and analyzed more easily, etc.). Conditions: With ongoing guidance from an instructor during one or more palpation activities, the learner will be able to: Imitate the methods an instructor uses and notice physical characteristics during a palpation exploration: Sense possible temperature differences when palpating regions of the body (e.g., some regions may feel noticeably warmer while others feel noticeabl y cooler). Sense tissue quality and notice tissue variations during palpation of the skin's surface (e.g., notice dryness, moistness, bumps, roughness, decreased elasticity, skin color, skin temperature, etc.). Sense tissue quality and notice tissue variations during palpation of the superficial fascia (e.g., notice if lymph nodes can be felt, amount of \"lift,\" if fascia is \"glued down,\" can it glide easily over underlying muscle, etc.). Sense tissue quality and notice tissue variations during palpation of bony landmarks (e.g., notice that bones feel hard, have irregular shapes with knobs, grooves, holes, spines, depressions, and angles, etc.). Sense tissue quality and notice tissue variations during palpation of skeletal muscles (e.g., notice that muscl es are layered and that deeper muscles are palpated by dropping through superficial layers, notice if muscles glide easily past or over one another, notice the differences between muscle bellies and where the muscle transitions into tendon at attachment si tes, notice if the edges of muscles can be felt, notice if muscle feels \"plump,\" \"springy,\" \"full,\" \"pliable,\" \"dense,\" \"hard,\" \"ropey,\" etc.). \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 338 Match these specific palpation skills to examples of each skill in action: Locate a specific structure through touch (e.g., find the gastrocnemius). Differentiate between two structures in the same region (e.g., \"I know that I am on the teres minor and not on the infraspinatus because...\", etc.). Differentiate layers of tissue thro ugh touch (e.g., \"I know I have sunk through the gluteus maximus to palpate the piriformis because...\", etc.). Assess the quality or condition of soft - tissue structures through touch (e.g., the ability to recognize if a muscle is hypertonic, hypotonic, or healthy). Make comparisons between tissues bilaterally, before and after sessions, or from one session to another through touch (e.g. \"the right scalene feels like X while the left scalene feels like Y\" ). Verbally describe palpable findings using the corr ect pronunciation of structure names and technical language (e.g., \"There is a palpable hypertonicity in the muscle just inferior to the proximal attachment site\"). Verbally describe palpable findings using a rich vocabulary of personal descriptive words (e.g., \"This tendon feels bound, ropy, and grainy\"). Sense tissue quality and notice tissue variations during palpation of tendons and ligaments (e.g., notice that tendon feels smoother and denser than muscle, notice that ligaments tend to feel taut regardless of the position of the joint, etc.). Verbally describe three palpable findings for each palpation step during a palpation exploration (e.g., describe the mus as \"full,\" \"pliable,\" \"dense,\" \"hard,\" \"ropey,\" etc.). \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 339 Outline a specific step -by-step approach to the palpation of a region (e.g., the school or instructor should determine the approach students are expected to take when palpating structures in a region; in a general example one approach might be to (a) review the anatomical structures present in a specific region and make a list of structures to palpate, (b) look at the surface area of the region to palpate and visualize the structures using a textbook, (c) use a full palmar surface to palpate, (d) work from superficial layers to deeper layers, (e) palpate \"normal\" first, (f) palpate muscle tissue in at least two different directions, (g) utilize isometric muscle contractions to make the target muscle easier to identify, (h) ask the client to give feedback on the sensations noticed while the tissue is palpated). Level 2 Knowledge: Use and Connect Skills: Practice and Refine Apply Conditions: Having participated in a class discussion and completed an activity, the learner will be able to: Discus three or more reasons massage therapists should develop good palpation skills (e.g., to better understand the health of the client's tissue, to locate specific structures, to compare tissue from one session to the next, to support the therapist in choosing effective techniques during a massage, to inform session goal setting, etc.). Discuss the general goals of palpation (see the example list of genera l goals of palpation in level 1).

Attitudes are manifest in an individual's manner, disposition, po sition, and orientation towards something (positive, negative, or neutral). Values are the importance, significance, or worth individuals or groups place on something. Attitudes and values are closely related; we tend to demonstrate a positive attitude towards those things we value. Sometimes attitudes and values are the primary focus of education , such as with diversity awareness training and ethics education, but most often , they are learned implicitly. Although they may not always be aware of it, most educators are involved in some form of attitude and value teaching in all of their classes. In every word and action, including nonverbal communication, massage therapy educators are role modeling their own attitudes and values toward the profession, clien ts, and other dimensions of massage. Learners' own attitudes and values evolve in part as a result of learning implicit in the observation of instructors and other learners , as well as through explicit teaching. To date, there is no one accepted statement of the attitudes and values held by the massage and bodywork profession as a whole, although there would appear to be some consensus in many areas such as ethical behavior, the importance of focusing on the client, and other aspects of professionalism. This blueprint for the affective domain focus es on objectives in areas that we generally view as true of the profession and noncontroversial: the importance of learning, values related to working with clients and with other professionals, and valuing the pro fession itself as well as one's own role within it. When integrated with the other ELAP blueprints, this affective domain blueprint remind s us to pay attention to ways in which learners become true massage professionals, rather than merely possessing knowledge and skills. \u00a9 2013 Coalition of National Massage Therapy Organizations Page 508 Topic : Value Learning Conditions: Throughout the massage and bodywork training program , by examining, demonstrating, and internalizing the following attitudes and values, the learner will be able to: Level 1 Receive and Respond Receive Respond Show enthusiasm for becoming a massage professional and obtaining massage credentials.

They will need a minimum of 570 hours of training and education. The 570 hours must include at least 50 hours of physiology, anatomy, and structural kinesiology (http://cca.hawaii.gov/pvl/files/2013/08/har_84 -c2.pdf ). There must be 100 hours of theory and demonstration.

The Board notes that there is not a list of approved apprenticeships; the prospective massage therapist may seek out a sponsoring massage therapist on his or her own (http://files.hawaii.gov/dcca/pvl/faqs/FAQ_Massage_Therapy.pdf ). The Board has, however, provided instructions and paperwork to en sure that the apprenticeship meets state regulation. A Hawaii apprentice will receive 70 hours of training in clinical operations; the clinical operations training will include 30 hours each of sanitation and office procedures and 10 hours of record keepin g. The apprentice will have 40 hours of advanced techniques, comprised of 20 hours of observation and 20 hours of consultation. The remaining 320 hours of the apprenticeship will be supervised practice of massage, along with record keeping duties. Out-of-state trainees must receive their education through massage therapy schools; the Board will not accept out -of-state apprenticeship programs. Schools must hold appropriate approval or licensing. This may be granted by an educational agency, the American Mass age Therapy Association (AMTA), or the Rolf Institute. Board -approved workshops may also be credited toward the instruction/ theory requirements. The massage therapist will need training in infant and adult CPR. Training should be pursued through the Ameri can Red Cross or the American Heart Association. Courses by other providers may be accepted, but the applicant will need to submit a waiver request. Online study is not permitted. Idaho Educational Requirements Prospective licensees must complete massage therapy programs comprised of at least 500 hours of education and training.

New York programs are registered with the State Education Department. The Office of the Professions maintains a list of programs that are license- qualifying in the state (http://www.op.nysed.gov/prof/mt/mtprogs.htm ). State-registered programs include 200 hours of anatomy, physiology, and neurolo gy (with at least 50 hours in neurology). They include 150 hours of instruction in myology and/ or kinesiology. They include fully 100 hours of pathology; this study includes muscle, soft tissue, and skin disorders. Programs include at least 150 hours of g eneral massage therapy theory and technique, with at least 50 hours devoted to the fundamentals of each of the major traditions: Eastern and Western. The Board has identified a number of other areas of study that are at least peripherally related to massag e therapy practice, including hygiene and infection control, first aid, recognition of abuse and neglect in patients, and use and effects of oils and powders in treatment. Together, related subjects comprise an additional 75 hours. Board -identified subject must be addressed; other subjects may receive coverage as well. CPR training is credited toward this content area. CPR training must be recent; if three years have passed since the student completed the massage therapy program, the student will need to do CPR again. The remaining 325 hours further the student's mastery of massage therapy technique; at least 150 must involving performing massage therapy. Programs that are not registered with the State Education Department are to be \"the substantial equivale nt\". Options for Individuals Who Completed Shorter Programs Although 1,000 hours of education and training will ultimately be required, massage therapy graduates may submit their license applications when they have completed as few as 500 hours. The Board will determine deficiencies. The individual will be able to correct the deficiencies by taking coursework through an acceptable program. The licensing agency will carry out another review later. A massage therapy graduate also has the option of applying to a license -qualifying New York program and matriculating as an advanced student. This option, unlike the previous one, will result in the student earning a new diploma or certificate. An individual who chooses this option will have to complete more hours o f education, however, as New York massage therapy schools will only accept 250 hours of transfer credit. A student who took massage therapy coursework but did not complete a program will need to complete one to become license -eligible in New York. Again, u p to 250 hours of credit may be awarded for prior study. Individuals with questions about verifying education from non -approved programs may contact the Bureau of Comparative Education by telephone at 518 -474-3817, ext. 300 or by email at 'comped at nysed. gov'.

Administrative rules state that all programs must either be licensed by the jurisdic tion's educational licensing authority or be statutorily exempt. If the curriculum of an out -of-state program meets most requirements, but not all, the Board may issue a license with conditions (http://www.bmbt.org/downloads/GUIDELINES%2004%2011.pdf ). The licensee would then need to meet some additional requirements post -licensure.

I identified myself and asked her to supply me with her school's accreditation information. She asked me to call her back in 2 hours which I did. When I called her back she told me her school was accredited by BPPE (California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education). I asked if they were accredited by COMTA or FSTMB and she said no, just the BPPE. I looked up Hamilton School on the BPPE website and found that they are listed but the only as a Bureau approved institution (see attached application and website pages).

I know that as a board we can come up with a better attestation but I believe that this will help solve some of the issue we are having with local Rolfers. If we are forced to accept their training, we need to be sure that we protect our license title and not allow it to be watered down by people getting the license and then simply titling themselves professionally as whatever they please. I'm not sure if this needs David's approval first before we seek an opinion but I know that going through you is the right way to start. :) Thank you!

The CEs were completed outside of timeframe but can be used with a consent agreement. The CEs should be approved by the board to use as remedial CEs for use with a consent agreement. I told Shelly I would not have a consent agreement for her until after the board meeting in March so these can be addressed at the board meeting. Like we've talked about, I can't prepare any consent agreements until the board has determined discipline for the failed audits.

Meeting Deliverables Information gained: Action recommended: GOVERNOR BILL WALKER 1. 2. 3.From: Scott and Traci To: Dulebohn, Dawn L (CED) Subject: Board followup with my meeting with Rep. Kito, etc. Date: Monday, December 11, 2017 2:26:38 PM Hi there, Please forward to the board and Sara if you deem appropriate. I met with Rep. Kito and another staffer on Thursday. We talked about the Sunset Law and he is willing to carry the bill. The way this works is that our law and board sunsets if the Legislature does not choose to vote to extend for another 3 or 4 years. When a Sunset approaches, a sponsor is needed and a bill is introduced to extend the law. If so decided, many other things can be attached to that bill. Rep. Kito and I agreed to introduce a clean bill. If HB110 and 145 die in the legislature this session, we will need to work to reintroduce them next session. I feel that is not in the best interest of our therapists, the board nor the state at this time to add anything to the bill. I hope you are supportive of a clean bill. What we need to do to prepare: Rep. Kito plans to introduce our bill early. I would suggest when we get more information that Chair Edwards-Smith plan to come to Juneau to lend his support and testimony and make the rounds with legislators explaining our good work and our future projects. We will need to garner support from legislators, committees and, I feel, our community of clients, patients and fellow therapists. This work needs to begin now. Please begin to reach out to our peers and legislators. Please write letters and encourage your clients/patients/colleagues to do the same. I would start by reaching out to House Labor and Commerce committee members, but others in each house as well. Thankfully we have received a good report, but more work needs to be done. Especially for the fact that there is a lot of misinformation out there in regards to what this board should and shouldn't be doing. On that note, Dawn -- when do you think the DRAFT minutes will be posted? When can we expect emails to be sent regarding the \"newsletter\" information we talked about in our meeting? I would like to see a draft of the informational email before you send if we can. Next, I would like to know if the Board can or should request the Division to send an answer to Mr. Toal regarding his request for an apology from the Board and myself. I would like to speak further to this matter. Thanks so much, I look forward to hearing from you.

Attached is a publication by the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council that addresses some of the issues involved, including some \"best practices\" for fingerprint technicians to follow when verifying the demographic information they put on the fingerprint card belongs to the applicant whose prints they are rolling. There is no legal apparatus for enforcement of chain of custody at the state level in Alaska, and due to our unique geographic and infrastructure problems, I doubt that will change in the immediate future. Under Alaska law, anyone may roll fingerprints (except in the solitary case of concealed handgun permit applications, in which case the fingerprint technician must be either pre-approved or work for law enforcement), and therefor there is no formal regulation of fingerprint vendors. One practice currently being implemented by one of our other clients is to issue a document to the applicant, which must be returned to the agency with the prints, on which the fingerprinter signs a statement attesting that photo ID was verified at time of fingerprinting. I have only secondhand knowledge of this practice, but it's been implemented by DHSS.

I'm leaving for my flight now. If you do get those items, could you please send them to my personal e-mail of dawn.dulebohn@gmail.com Thanks! Best Regards, Dawn Dulebohn Licensing Examiner Alaska State Massage Board Corporations, Business, and Professional Licensing P.O. Box 110806 Juneau, AK 99811-0806 An applicant with a disqualifying out-of-state arrest applied for a teacher certificate and persuaded a student to provide the applicant her finger - prints. The fingerprints were submitted and the applicant was able to obtain a teaching certificate. The student subsequently was arrested and the fingerprints hit on her own fingerprints that were in the state rap back system. When the Department of Education received the rap back notification, they discovered that the mug shot did not match the teacher enrolled in rap back. An investigation revealed identity fraud and the case was turned over for criminal prosecution of both the teacher applicant and the student. In this instance rap back prevented a disqualified individual from having continued access to a vulnerable population. 2. The following scenario illustrates how an applicant attempted to cir - cumvent the fingerprinting process in order to obtain a position of trust, but due to the vigilance of the fingerprinting vendor, the hiring agency was able to successfully prevent the individual from obtaining the position. An individual applied for a health care worker position. Due to the fact that she had a criminal history record, she requested her room - mate be fingerprinted on her behalf. Unbeknownst to her, the room - mate also had a record. However, the fingerprinting agency verified the applicant's identification and determined that the photo/biographic identification did not match the applicant's identity. The fingerprint vendor notified the Department of Health (DPH) that the applicant did not match the identification submitted. Subsequently, both the ap - plicant and the individual that agreed to submit the false fingerprints were arrested and charged. Due to verification of the identification, the DPH was able to detect fingerprint fraud and prevent a convicted felon from obtaining a position of trust as a health care worker. Federal Legislation and Other Documents Pertinent to this Guide: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14616 Public Law 109-13, also referred to as the REAL ID Act (The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on T error, and Tsunami Relief Act, May 11, 2005) HSPD-12 (Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12) Revised 2014 by the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council 71The National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact Council (Com - pact Council) is a15-member body of local, state, and federal govern - mental officials which prescribes system rules and procedures for the effective and proper operation of the Interstate Identification Index (III) for noncriminal justice purposes. In recent years, the demand for fingerprint-based background checks for noncriminal justice purposes has increased. Fingerprinting agencies and contractors alike have expressed concern that applicants with a criminal history record may have someone pose as the applicant for fingerprinting purposes. In response to these concerns, the Compact Council prepared this guide for voluntary use in the development of policy, procedures, and practices for applicant identity verification. Factors to consider (For the purpose of this guide, \"agency\" will refer to any agency or contractor responsible for the capture and/or submission of fingerprints for noncriminal justice purposes.) In the course of establishing an identity verification program, agencies may choose to consider the following factors: Clearly define and document policy, procedure, and practices. Document what is to be accomplished and how it is to be performed. Review current business policy, procedure, and practices regarding verification, training, legal obligations, and privacy implications that may be incorporated into a program. Develop an understanding of the use of various biometric-based systems. Preliminary considerations Coordination with the State Repository Since the state repository manages the processing of fingerprint submissions to the FBI, it is suggested that appropriate coordination and liaison be estab - lished at that level as a preliminary step toward an identity verification program. 6 E. Implement the use of form(s), which may include the: 1. Date of fingerprinting 2. Reason for fingerprinting 3. Printed name, signature, and/or identification number of the employee taking the fingerprints 4. Name of employee's supervisor 5. Supervisor's signature 6. Address of agency to receive fingerprints 7. Name of agency and physical address where fingerprinting was performed 8. Type of fingerprint capture (rolled ink, flat ink, live scan, etc.) 9. Applicant's consent for fingerprinting 10. Type of ID verified (Driver's License #/State/Expiration Date) For further information, please visit the Compact Council website at: www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/compact-council FingerPrint Fraud scenarios 1. The following scenarios illustrate how an applicant attempted and suc - cessfully circumvented the fingerprinting process in order to obtain a position of trust and the importance of verifying the individual's identity, as well as maintaining the chain-of-custody: An individual applied for, and successfully obtained, a position of trust as a teacher within a school district, after having another in - dividual go to the sheriff's office and provide his fingerprints. The prospective teacher also utilized his father's name, which was the same as his. The fingerprints were subsequently submitted to the State Identifica - tion Bureau for a background check. T wo years later, the falsified finger - prints were discovered when the teacher was arrested for criminal tres - pass and window peeping. It was also discovered the teacher had a prior arrest and conviction for simple assault and a sexual battery arrest which resulted in a misdemeanor assault conviction. As a result, the individual's employment was terminated. Subsequently, the individual who had sub - mitted the falsified fingerprints was also arrested for fraudulent activity. 2Fingerprinter Certification Another preliminary consideration for states may be the enacting of a state statute establishing a certification process that qualifies the employ - ees capturing the applicant's fingerprints. Additionally, if the statute were compliant with Public Law 92-544, a state and federal fingerprint-based background check could be performed on the individuals certified to take fingerprints. Policy, Procedures , and Practices In developing an identity verification program, the Compact Council sug - gests establishing written policy, procedures, and practices. The following guide may be helpful in the process. Determine Policy, Procedures, and Practices Create an Identification Validation Guide Create Chain of Custody Procedures Determine Policy, Procedures and Practices Policy, Procedures, and Practices may include: A. Training in the capture of fingerprints (rolled or flats, and hard copy or livescan). B. Certification of employees performing duties under the scope of the identity verification program, which may include recog - nizing and validating authorized identification forms, identification documents, and source documents for identity confirmation. C. Security considerations: 1. Train employees to recognize and properly utilize the se - curity features of the various forms of identification pre - sented. These features include biometric like photographs and machine-readable technology such as magnetic strips and 2D/3D barcodes. 2. Assign a unique identification number to each employee to be included with each fingerprint submission. 5 Check the applicant's signature in person with that on the identification form. Ensure that the identification form has not been altered in any manner. If available, verify that the machine readable data matches the data on the card when it is scanned. When an agency has a reason to believe an applicant has presented fraudulent information, agency personnel should contact local law enforcement. No attempt should be made to detain or pursue the person. create chain oF custody Procedures An agency may employ a process to protect the integrity of the applicant's fingerprints when they are forwarded to the state identification bureau and/or the FBI. The following information provides a guide to developing a chain of custody process: A. Establish provisions for the agency to manage both manually and electronically captured fingerprints. B. Establish an agency tracking system (applicant log) using the employee's name or some other method of identifying the in - dividual capturing the fingerprints and verifying the applicant's identity. C. Establish procedures that document the type(s) of identifica - tion used by the applicant. D. When possible, electronic fingerprint submissions should be used, thus eliminating the return of the fingerprint card to the applicant. However, in those instances when the fingerprints must be returned to the applicant, the agency should establish procedures that use specially sealed envelopes, agency specific stamps, etc. when forwarding the applicant's manually captured fingerprints.3 Create an Id entification Validation Guide Primary and Secondary Identification Currently most agencies request some type of photo identification card as one method for verifying an individual's identity. The Compact Council suggests agencies accept only current, valid, and unexpired photo identi - fication documents. As a primary form of photo identification, the following documents may be presented by an applicant when being fingerprinted: State-issued driver's license* U.S. Passport or U.S. Passport Card Federal Government Personal Identity Verification Card (PIV) Uniformed Services Identification Card Department of Defense Common Access Card Foreign Passport with Appropriate Immigration Document(s) USCIS - Permanent Resident Card (I-551) USCIS - Employment Authorization Card (I-766) Federal, state, or local government agency ID card with photograph U.S. Coast Guard Merchant Mariner Card Canadian driver's license * For those applicants without a driver's license, a state identification card may be pre - sented if the state's identification card standards are the same as for the driver's license. However, in the absence of a primary identification, applicants may provide at least 2 secondary identification documents including: State Government Issued Certificate of Birth U.S. Tribal or Bureau of Indian Affairs Identification Card Native American tribal document Social Security Card Court Order for Name Change/Gender Change/ Adoption/Divorce 4 Marriage Certificate (Government Certificate Issued) U.S. Government Issued Consular Report of Birth Abroad Draft record School ID with photograph Certificate of Citizenship (N-560) Replacement Certificate of Citizenship (N-561) Certificate of Naturalization (N-550) Replacement Certificate of Naturalization (N-570) Secondary Identification Data Support Documents When validating the authenticity of secondary identification documents and forms, the data and information may be supported by at least two of the following current documents: Utility Bill (Address) Jurisdictional Voter Registration Card Vehicle Registration Card/Title Paycheck Stub with Name/Address* Jurisdictional Public Assistance Card Spouse/Parent Affidavit * Financial information may be redacted by the individual. Additional Identification Data Support Methods T o further support the validation of the original identification documents, the agency may choose any or all of the following methods to validate the authenticity of the documents: Physically examine the applicant's photo on the identification form/card. Visually compare the photo with the applicant in person. Compare the physical descriptors of the applicant to the docu - mentation provided by the applicant (i.e. height, weight, hair and eye color, age, etc.). Request the applicant to verbally provide date of birth, address, etc., and check this against the identification forms used.From: Gaffney, Eric L (DPS) To: Dulebohn, Dawn L (CED) M (DPS) Fingerprinting Date: Saturday, February 17, 2018 10:49:14 AM Dawn: The best person to speak to the relevant issues is our Bureau Chief, Kathryn Monfreda, and she would be happy to answer any questions you have. But she's going to be out of the office and not available on March 8 & 9. To my knowledge, this department has never offered advice on how often our clients should submit fingerprints. The results of a criminal history search are, in a strict sense, out-of-date almost immediately after you've received them, the issue being that new occurrences of criminal misconduct may go unnoticed if they happen after the initial background check. Most of our clients who do require applicants to submit new fingerprints periodically have arrived at that determination on their own, and the timeline for doing so varies according to client and their governing statute. Probably any timeline is somewhat arbitrary, and the resulting cycles are a compromise between the client's due diligence and the impracticality of submitting new prints at a high frequency. In the case of the FBI, there has historically been no means of performing a name-based background check, so new information has been dependent on the submission of additional fingerprints. Within the past several years, the FBI has introduced a program (referred to as \"rap back\") which allows them to retain civil fingerprints on file, and to update the submitting requestor on new developments in the subject's criminal history without soliciting additional prints. This requires an authorizing statute by a participating state, and Alaska currently does not have one. There has been some interest by some of our clients in pursuing this, and I believe there has also been some opposition such legislation. The precise nature of the opposition and whether it bears any relationship to what you're describing is not known to me. At any rate, without a change in state law, this option is not currently available to Alaska employers and licensing agencies. A further issue relevant for at least some of our clients is that they have applicants who work in Alaska on a seasonal basis. Employers and licensing agencies have an easier time learning about local events than out-of-state ones, and if someone is living and working in Alaska full-time, it's presumably more difficult to them to get into serious trouble in a distant jurisdiction without the relevant employer/licensing agency being aware of it. But someone who only works in Alaska intermittently, but maintains a current license even when away, could conceivably be arrested or charged with serious offenses out-of-state without anyone here being the wiser. Eric Gaffney Records & Licensing Supervisor Division of Statewide Services Alaska Department of Public Safety (907) 269-5634 From: Dulebohn, Dawn L (CED) Sent: Friday, February 2:37 PM To: Gaffney, Eric (DPS) Cc: Hoffard, Renee (CED) Subject: RE: FBI Fingerprinting Hi Eric, So, let me start by saying I've been out of the office since Friday, Feb. 9th. This is where the information came from: There was a hearing on 2/13/2018 where there was an opposition to fingerprinting after the initial application by Rep. Seaton. There has been a recommendation from the Board to Statutorily change fingerprinting from every renewal cycle to every 3. The committee has tacked that language not just to the sunset bill 275 but also to HB110 (which has quite a few changes). Because of the legislative opposition to renewal fingerprints, the Board feels that without support for FBI Fingerprinting procedures, the addition of this language will tank both bills. I apologize for the miscommunication. So, that brings me back to my original question of if you know of anyone I can contact who will not only answer some Board questions at their next meeting but will be able to testify to the importance of renewal fingerprinting on the Federal level for this program? Thanks for your time and patience.

The Board of Massage Therapists is very concerned about this since FBI fingerprinting has proven a useful and needed tool to screen out applicants that may have a negative impact on public safety. As such, the Board would like to speak to someone from the FBI fingerprinting program who could not only answer questions but could also testify as to why this valuable resource is needed for programs such as these. Could you point me in the right direction to find such a person? I am on a bit of a time crunch as the next Board meeting is March 8-9, 2018. Thank you in advance for your time.

We want to make sure that our certifications are easily acceptable for your group of massage therapists and that the CE content hours are in clear view for you, which is why we (per your request) have updated our certificates to show the number of CE's they've completed (bottom of the second column of skills). I hope this helps you with your end of reporting hours and encourages you to continue working with our company! In a message I left today, I also mentioned that we are telling MT's to take our ProFirstAid Advanced (healthcare provider CPR/FA) course as well to obtain the CE hours they need. This is something we set up a few years ago with the previous person in that department. Is this still the recommended two courses that we should continue to direct MT's to? If you need more info on that let me know. Also, so that we can keep things as simple as possible, I created a direct link https://www.procpr.org/signup/abtm for your department to utilize as a starting link for professionals to use for training. It will direct them to the training they need, which includes the Bloodborne Pathogens training and the ProFirstAid Advanced (healthcare provider level CPR/FA) course. (We can add or remove required (or suggested) training to this link as well.)Feel free to share this link with your licensee's and those new therapists that are needing an update in their training. Sharing this link will ensure they are taking the course the board accepts and shouldn't let them get confused. Many states put these links directly on their website so it is easy to access. They also share it with those in the office that are approving and reviewing provider information so you have a direct link (you can bookmark and share as needed) to the appropriate training that the state board of massage therapy accepts.We added your department's logo on that page to remind the provider that they are in the right place! Hit the link below and take a look. If anything is missing or needs to be changed, please let me know. https://www.procpr.org/signup/abtm Each provider that uses this link will receive a 10% discount on their training every time they use this link! None of this costs you a thing. It's our way of assisting your professionals to stay compliant with their state's regulations regarding BBP, CPR and First Aid certifications. In addition, when your providers finish their course and make their payment, you'll automatically receive an email that looks kind of like this \"Jane Doe has finished their training\" . Right now that email is set up to go to dawn.dulebohn@alaska.gov but we could set that up to go wherever you like, or remove it, just let me know. . We hope that our assistance with compliance in this area of training helps you immensely and if you ever need additional health & safety training for your providers in the future, we'd hope ProTrainings could be your training company of choice!

That massage therapists were considered professional providers? Ive been a professional massage therapist for over thirty years. I am now working with an Anesthesiologist in his pain management clinic. www.neuroversion.com . On top of it... It took me a lot of paperwork and four months of waiting to become a provider with Blue Cross. Yet they are saying they wont reimburse for my services to patients that are referred to me by the Medical doctor I work with? Or any other medical doctor for that matter? This is a real medical clinic with real doctors and real patients that need me. Unless there is something specific in his policy that does not allow for massage therapy period. They need to honor my professional license. Please help clear this up. Otherwise. I don't have a real professional license. I can pay for my own background check.. I don't need to pay all this money for a license that's no better then the city license we had before. Sorry Im a little upset about this. I don't think Im wrong in feeling upset? Thank you for your help. Gordon J. Wallis LMT. From: Kristen Washburn Sent: Wednesday, To: Gordon Wallis Subject: Massage- only covered by PT or chiropractor Hi, Just an FYI- I just got off the phone with Vanessa at Blue Cross- Anthem plan She stated that massage therapy was not covered for patient C. Rouse unless it was rendered by a Licensed Physical Therapist or a Chiropractor. I know that you had mentioned before that Blue Cross stated they would cover for a LMT; however, this would be one example where they don't.

The LMT is working for an anesthesiologist at Neuroversion in Anchorage. I would like to clarify this issue before I present it to the Alaska Board of Massage Therapists for discussion. My questions are: What (if any) are the policies of Premera Blue Cross in regards to billing by Licensed Massage Therapists in Alaska? Does it matter who they are working for (ie self employed, chiropractor, or medical doctor) when it comes to billing? Does Premera Blue Cross accept insurance claims from any LMT's and what criteria must be met? I understand that specific plans may hinder payments for payment to a LMT, I just want to know if it's a blanket \"we don't accept billing from LMT\" or if there are specifics. I would appreciate a response by e-mail at your earliest convenience.

These company policies just don't seem right. Im supposed to have a professional license. Yet it only works in certain buildings under certain conditions, that are not required by other types of health care professionals. If nothing else, the board should be aware that our license is limited. And perhaps the fees should come down.

Best Regards, Dawn Dulebohn Licensing Examiner Alaska State Massage Board Corporations, Business, and Professional Licensing P.O. Box 110806 Juneau, AK 99811-0806From: Nickel, Dulebohn, Dawn L (CED) Subject: RE: Insurance Billing by License Massage Therapists Date: Thursday, December 28, 2017 11:37:31 AM Good Morning Dawn, A response was received on 12/19, I had been out of the office since then. See Premera's response to each question noted in blue below. \u00b7 What are Premera's policies related to billing by LMT in Alaska? Are there limitations depending on their employer (self-employed, chiropractor, medical doctor)? There are no limitations depending upon their employment structure. However, when a massage therapist is licensed, our expectation is they would start billing under their own tax ID, and not under the supervision of a chiropractor, physical therapist, etc. (as was the case prior to the state licensing message therapists). If the massage therapist works for a contracted provider, the massage therapist will need to bill under the provider's tax ID. If the massage therapist works for themselves, then they would bill under their own tax ID. \u00b7 Does Premera accept insurance claims directly from LMT? Yes. We began contracting with message therapists once they became licensed in the State of Alaska. \u00b7 What criteria must be met in order for LMT to submit insurance claims? They will need to be licensed with the State of Alaska, and submit a proper authorization form. \u00b7 Are the billing policies for LMT uniform, or is there variation based on market type (individual, small group, large group, ASO)? The policies vary, depending upon the member's specific benefits. \u00b7 Who at Premera should LMT contact if they have a question regarding billing? Providers can contact either Customer Service 1-877-342-5258, option 2, or Provider Relations @ 1 -877- 342-5258, option 4.
