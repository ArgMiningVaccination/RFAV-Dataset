General characteristics The Moderna is an RNA vaccine composed of nucleoside-modified mRNA (modRNA). The synthetic mRNA is a encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) virus stabilized in S-2P of the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein with a transmembrane anchor and an intact S1-S2 cleavage site. S-2P is stabilized in its prefusion conformation by two consecutive proline substitutions at amino acid positions 986 and 987, at the top of the central helix in the S2 subunit [ [Wrapp D, 2020](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6483/1260) ]. The S glycoprotein mediates host cell attachment and is required for viral entry [ [Corbett KS, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2622-0) ]. It is important for the immune system to respond to the virus at the prefusion stage because it would probably be too late for the immune system to intervene at the postfusion stage when the virus is entering into the cell [ [Xia X, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v13010109) ]. Proline substitution is one of the main techniques reported to stabilize the SARS-CoV-2 spike at prefusion conformation. Spike protein variants can exhibit different levels of expression in comparison to the parental construct, and improved ability to withstand heat stress, storage temperature and resistance to freeze-thaw cycles [ [Hsieh CL, 2020](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6510/1501) ] The mRNA sequence encoding the protein was synthesized using an optimized T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription reaction with complete replacement of uridine by N1-methyl-pseudouridine [ [Corbett KS, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2622-0) ]. The reaction included a DNA template containing the immunogen open reading frame flanked by 5untranslated region (UTR) and 3UTR sequences and was terminated by an encoded polyA tail [ [Corbett KS, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2622-0) ]. Assembling mRNA using pseudouridine, a nucleoside variant naturally occurring in the body, reduces the response of dendritic cells, interferon-associated genes and other components of the immune system to trigger an inflammatory response. [ [Karik\u00f3 K, 2008](https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(16)32681-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1525001616326818%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) ]. One way a vaccine mRNA molecule can be modified is by placing it between two RNA untranslated regions which stabilize the mRNA and optimize it for translation. The ends of the mRNA, known as 5' and 3' ends, can be modified by the addition of a cap and a poly(A) tail. The cap serves as a recognition signal for the cellular ribosome to bind and translate the mRNA and the poly(A) tail stabilizes the protein and further enhances translation of the protein [ [Schlake T, 2012](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/rna.22269) ]. The mRNA is encapsulated in lipid modified ethanol-drop nanoprecipitation process [ [Hassett KJ, 2019](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2162253119300174) ]. The modification of the lipid nanoparticles improves the immune response and improves tolerability [ [Hassett KJ, 2019](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2162253119300174) ]. After injection, body cells take up the lipid nanoparticle, delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into viral protein and then initiating the immune response against COVID-19 [ [Hassett KJ, 2019](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2162253119300174) ]. The membrane-bound spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is expressed and then recognized by immune cells as a foreign antigen. This elicits both T-cell and B-cell responses to generate neutralizing antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. Ingredients The vaccine contains the following ingredients: Active ingredient One dose (0.5 mL) contains 100 micrograms of nucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) stabilized for injections Spikevax bivalent (original + omicron BA.1) Active ingredient One dose (0.5 mL) contains 25 micrograms of elasomeran and 25 micrograms of imelasomeran, a for injections. Spikevax bivalent (original + omicron BA.4-5) Active ingredient One dose (0.5 mL) contains 25 micrograms of elasomeran and acetate trihydrate Sucrose Water for injections. Risk considerations Risk of insertional mutagenesis Unlike DNA vaccines, which might carry a small risk of insertional mutagenesis and integration, mRNA does not have the potential to integrate into the host genome and is degraded naturally during the process of antigen expression [ [Stenler S, 2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/hv.28077) ]. Risk of infection Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is a non-replicating platform. This means the delivered mRNA does not carry an intrinsic risk for infection [ [GAVI,2020](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/will-mrna-vaccine-alter-my-dna) ]. Additionally, contaminating microorganisms in mRNA vaccines are unlikely because the manufacturer does not need bacterial cell culture [ [Pardi N, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243) ]. Inflammatory reactions mRNA vaccines have a more pronounced proinflammatory nature. This feature might provide a self-adjuvant property but also can result in local and systemic reactions [ [Liu MA, 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/7/2/37) ]. However, a proposed mechanism for possible autoimmune responses is via the induction of type I interferon, which has been observed in preclinical studies [ [Pepini T, 2017](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/198/10/4012) ]. Allergic reactions Most immediate allergic reactions associated with vaccines are related with excipients [ [Stone CA, 2019](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bcp.14112) ]. Polyethylene glycols (PEG) are frequently used as excipients in many liquid and solid formulations of medications and are also used to stabilize the lipid nanoparticle containing the mRNA of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, PEG constitutes the main candidate for explaining the cause of allergic reactions to this vaccine [ [Stone CA, 2019](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213219818308237) ]. PEG itself has not previously used in other vaccines but polysorbate, a closely related compound, has been implicated in allergic reactions to other vaccines [ [Stone CA, 2019](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213219818308237) ]. Dosing and schedule Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (original strain) The recommended schedule for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is: [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)] For children aged 6 months to 5 years: a series of two doses (25 g, 0.25 ml each) 4 weeks apart. For children aged 6 to 11 years: a series of two doses (50 g each) 4 weeks apart. For persons 12 years of age and older: a series of two doses (100 g, 0.5 ml each) 4 weeks apart. WHO recommends an interval between the first and second dose of 4 to 8 weeks, preferably extending it up to 8 weeks. The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. This vaccine is presented as:* Suspension for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (each 0.5 mL dose containing 100 g) indicated for persons aged 12 and older [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-mrna-vaccine-nucleoside-modified)]. Suspension for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial with the label \"BOOSTER DOSE ONLY\" (each 0.5 mL dose containing 50 g) [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/spikevax-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccine)] Pediatric formulation: suspension for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (doses of 25 g in 0.25 mL per vial) indicated for persons aged 6 months to 5 years (dark blue cap vial with magenta border label) [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/spikevax-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccine)]. Pediatric formulation: suspension for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (doses of 50 g in 0.5 mL per vial) indicated for persons aged 6 to 11 years (dark blue cap vial with teal border label) [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/spikevax-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccine)]. *labeling depends on the availability of supply for each country [ [WHO, 2021](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-mrna-vaccine-nucleoside-modified)], [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/spikevax-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccine)]. Booster dose [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)] A booster dose (50 \u00b5g for adults) is recommended for the highest priority-use groups (i.e. older adults, health workers, persons with comorbidities) 4-6 months after the completion of the primary series. If more than 6 months have elapsed since the completion of the primary series, the booster dose should be given at the earliest opportunity. Once high booster dose coverage has been achieved in the highest priority-use group, countries may also consider a booster for other lower priority-use groups. WHO has not yet determined the need for and timing of booster doses for persons below 12 years of age, except for immunocompromised children. Second booster dose: WHO recommends considering a second booster dose 4-6 months after the first booster dose for all older persons (age-specific cutoff defined by countries), all persons with moderate and severe immunocompromising conditions -regardless of age-, adults with comorbidities that put them at higher risk of severe disease, pregnant women, and health workers [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. FDA recommends a second booster dose for persons 50 years of age and older and immunocompromised individuals from 18 years of age, provided at least after 4 months of the first booster dose [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/spikevax-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccine)]. EMA recommends second booster dose for persons 60 years of age and older and medically vulnerable individuals provided at least after 4 months of the first booster dose [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ecdc-ema-update-recommendations-additional-booster-doses-mrna-covid-19-vaccines)]. Heterologous schedule [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)] WHO supports a flexible approach to use different COVID-19 vaccine platforms for different doses (heterologous schedule) and considers two doses of any EUL COVID-19 vaccine to constitute a complete primary series. For persons aged 12 and older, a 50 g dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine may be used as a booster dose following a completed primary series from any other EUL COVID-19 vaccine platform. Heterologous vaccination should only be implemented with careful consideration of current vaccine supply, vaccine supply projections, and other access considerations, along with the potential benefits and risks of the specific products being used. Vaccination schedule for immunocompromised persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)] WHO recommends an extended primary series including an additional (third) full 100 \u00b5g dose for immunocompromised persons. An additional (third) dose should be given 1-3 months after the second dose in the standard primary series in order to increase protection as quickly as possible in immunocompromised persons. A first and second booster dose (fourth and fifth doses) given 4-6 months after the previous dose is recommended for all immunocompromised persons. Adapted Moderna COVID-19 vaccines Spikevax (original + omicron BA.1) is administered as a single booster dose (0.25 mL for persons aged 6-11 years, and 0.5 mL for persons aged 12 years) after three months of the primary series or monovalent booster [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)]. The pharmaceutical form is a dispersion for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (each 0.5 mL dose containing 25 g of elasomeran and 25 g of imelasomeran) The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Spikevax bivalent (original + omicron BA.4/BA.5) EMA recommends to administer Spikevax bivalent (original + omicron BA.4/BA.5) as a single booster dose (0.5 mL) for persons aged 12 years and older after three months of the primary series or monovalent booster [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)]. FDA recommends to administer Spikevax bivalent (original + omicron BA.4/BA.5) as a single booster dose (0.2 mL for persons 6 months to 5 years of age, 0.25 mL for persons aged 6-11 years, and 0.5 mL for persons aged 12 years) after two months of the primary series or monovalent booster [ [FDA, 2022](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/spikevax-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccine)]. The pharmaceutical form is a dispersion for intramuscular injection provided in a multidose vial (each 0.5 mL dose containing 50 g) The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Indications and contraindications Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (original strain) Indications Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is indicated for individuals 6 months of age and older [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. For prioritization by age and other considerations, refer to the WHO Prioritization Roadmap [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Vaccines-SAGE-Prioritization-2022.1)] WHO recommends the use of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant individuals. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)].

Precautions Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (original strain) Allergic reactions [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. A history of anaphylaxis to any other vaccine or injectable therapy (i.e. intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous vaccines or therapies) is not a contraindication to vaccination. For such persons, a risk assessment should be conducted by a health professional. The vaccine should be administered only in settings where anaphylaxis can be treated. Such persons should be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. Individuals with an immediate non-anaphylactic allergic reaction to the first dose (such as urticaria, angioedema or respiratory symptoms, that occur within 4 hours of administration) should not receive additional doses, unless recommended after review by a health professional. Subject to individual risk-benefit assessment, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine could be provided under close medical supervision if it is the only available option for people at high risk of severe COVID-19. The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex, and there is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for persons with a latex allergy. In addition, as Moderna COVID-19 vaccine does not contain eggs or gelatine, there is no contraindication or precaution to vaccination for persons with allergies to any food substances. Myocarditis [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. Myocarditis is a rare adverse event that has been reported after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The observed risk is highest in males aged 18-39 years (with the highest risk in males aged 18-24 years), and highest within a few days after the second dose. Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis, such as new onset and persisting chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. It is important to rule out other potential causes of myocarditis and pericarditis, including COVID-19 infection and other viral aetiologies. Individuals who develop myocarditis or pericarditis after a dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should generally not receive additional doses of any COVID-19 vaccine, unless recommended after review by a health professional with specialist expertise [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. Pregnancy [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)] WHO recommends the use of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant individuals. WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination. Breastfeeding [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. Vaccine effectiveness is expected to be similar in breastfeeding women as in other adults. As Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is not a live virus vaccine and the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell and is degraded quickly, it is biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the nursing infant. Several small studies show that mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies are found in breast milk, which might help protect breastfeeding infants. On the basis of these considerations, WHO recommends the use of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in breastfeeding women. WHO does not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding because of vaccination. Children and adolescents [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. The priority remains to prevent deaths by achieving high vaccine coverage (primary series and boosters) in the highest and high priority-use groups. It is of utmost importance for children to continue to receive the recommended childhood vaccines for other infectious diseases. Older persons [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. Vaccination is recommended for older persons without an upper age limit Persons living with HIV [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. Persons living with HIV who are stable on antiretroviral therapy should be vaccinated. It is not necessary to test for HIV infection before administration of the vaccine. Persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. Vaccination may be offered regardless of a person's history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The optimal time interval between a natural infection and vaccination is not yet known, but an interval of 3 months could be considered. Persons with current acute COVID-19 [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. Persons with acute PCR-confirmed COVID-19, including between doses, should not be vaccinated until after they have recovered from acute illness and the criteria for discontinuation of isolation have been met. Persons who previously received passive antibody therapy for COVID-19[ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)] Although some reduction in vaccine-induced antibody titers has been observed in this group, the balance of benefits versus risks favors vaccination. Other precautions Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with an acute febrile illness (body temperature over 38.5 \u00b0C) or acute infection [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. A few cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups have been reported within the first days after the vaccination with Spikevax (original). In individuals with a history of CLS, vaccination should be assessed by appropriate medical experts [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)]. Co-administration with other vaccines For adults, based on several co-administration studies, COVID-19 vaccines may be administered concomitantly or at any time before or after other adult vaccines, including: live attenuated vaccines, inactivated, adjuvanted, or non-adjuvanted vaccines. When administered concomitantly, the vaccines should be injected at separate sites, preferably different extremities [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. Inactivated influenza vaccine [ [WHO, 2022](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-vaccines-SAGE-recommendation-mRNA-1273-2021.3)]. WHO recommends that countries consider co-administration of COVID-19 vaccines with seasonal influenza vaccines, whenever feasible, dependent on seasonality. Adapted Moderna COVID-19 vaccines Spikevax bivalent (original + Allergic reactions [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)]. Events of anaphylactic reactions have been reported after receiving Spikevax (original). Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should be available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of Spikevax bivalent (original + omicron BA.1). Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination Myocarditis and pericarditis [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)]. There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Spikevax (original), observed more often after the second dose, and in younger males. Pregnancy [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)] There are no available data regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent (original + omicron BA.1) during pregnancy. However, a large amount of observational data from vaccination with Spikevax during the second and third trimesters have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Breastfeeding [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)]. There are no available data regarding the use of Spikevax bivalent (original + omicron BA.1) during breastfeeding. However, observational data from vaccination with Spikevax from breastfeeding women have not shown an increase in adverse effects in breastfed infants. Immunocompromised persons [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)]. The efficacy and safety of this vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised persons. The efficacy of Spikevax bivalent (original + omicron BA.1) may be lower in these individuals. Other precautions Vaccination should be postponed in individuals with an acute febrile illness or acute infection [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)]. A few cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups have been reported within the first days after the vaccination with Spikevax (original). In individuals with a history of CLS, vaccination should be assessed by appropriate medical experts [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)]. As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals with bleeding disorders or other conditions that increase the risk of bleeding, such as anticoagulant therapy, thrombocytopenia and hemophilia (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with the vaccination process itself [ [EMA, 2022](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spikevax)].

Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness Efficacy of preclinical studies on the vaccine The immunogenicity of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was tested in non-human primates that received 10 or 100 \u00b5g of mRNA-1273 or no vaccine. The mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate induced robust antibody responses with ID50 GMTs higher in the 100 g dose group (3481) compared to the 10 g dose group (501). Peak subgenomic RNA levels during days 2 through 7 were significantly lower in both the 100 g dose group and the 10 g dose group than the control group, in both bronchoalveolar fluid specimens (BAL) and nasal swab samples. Furthermore, total RNA levels were significantly lower in BAL fluid in both dose groups than in the control group [ [Corbett KS, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2024671) ]. Efficacy of the vaccine in clinical trials Main immunogenicity outcomes mRNA-1273-P201 (NCT04405076) was a phase 2 trial sponsored by ModernaTX, Inc. and conducted in the United States. The trial included healthy participants 18 years of age. The sample size was 600 (2 cohorts of 300). Participants were randomized 1: 1 to receive Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in doses of 50 \u00b5g, 100 \u00b5g or placebo. The results showed that in both vaccination schemes of mRNA-1273 vaccine, the geometric mean titers increased 28 days after the first dose. Furthermore, 14 days after the second dose (day 43), the geometric mean titers improved significantly, 1733 (1611-1865) \u00b5g/ml in the 50 \u00b5g group and 1909 (1849-1971) \u00b5g/ml in 100 \u00b5g group in young adults, while in older adults, mean titers were 1827 (1722 -1938) \u00b5g/ml in the 100 \u00b5g group of mRNA-1273 vaccine [ [Chu L, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.02.007) ]. In the preliminary report of the phase 1 study [ [Jackson LA, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483) ], it was reported that the vaccine induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. In this dose-escalation trial, in 45 adults 18 to 55 years of age antibody responses were higher with higher doses after a first vaccination, and serum neutralizing activity was detected after second vaccination. Main efficacy outcomes of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine Key messages Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduces the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 Contracting COVID-19 (measured at least 14 days after the second injection, with a median follow-up of 5.3 months after 2nd dose) The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.07 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.1). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 93%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting COVID-19. Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 751 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 14164 presented this outcome (49 per 1000) versus 55 out of 14287 in the group that did receive it (4 per 1000). In other words, 45 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 4.5%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 by 4.5 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 22. Which means that 22 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contract COVID-19. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Contracting severe COVID-19 (measured at least 14 days after the second injection, with a median follow-up of 5.3 months after 2nd dose) The relative risk of contracting severe COVID-19 in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.02 (95% CI 0 to 0.08). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 by 98%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting severe COVID-19. Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 106 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 14164 presented this outcome (7 per 1000) versus 2 out of 14287 in the group that did receive it (0 per 1000). In other words, 7 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 0.7%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting severe COVID-19 by 0.7 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 143. Which means that 143 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contract severe COVID-19. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Mortality The existing evidence does not allow to assess the impact of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on the risk of death attributable to COVID-19. The information provided by randomized trials was not adequately powered to estimate a difference in this outcome. Deaths can occur in the intervention and control group for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or the vaccine. Establishing that there is a reduction (or increase) in the risk of death attributable to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine would require trials with a higher statistical power. Efficacy of the vaccine in subgroups Contracting COVID-19 (6-11y) (measured at least 14 days after the first injection) The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 (6-11y) in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.12 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.28). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 (6-11y) by 88%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: contracting COVID-19 (6-11y). Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 7 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 2887 presented this outcome (20 per 1000) versus 18 out of 880 in the group that did receive it (2 per 1000). In other words, 18 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 1.8%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 (6-11y) by 1.8 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNT is 56. Which means that 250 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to not contract COVID-19.

In other words, 3 less people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk reduction of 0.3%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of Contracting COVID-19 after second dose (12-17y) by 0.3 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome.

Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as moderate. The certainty of the evidence is based in the following judgments: Risk of bias: no concerns; Inconsistency: no concerns; Indirectness: concerns; information provides from a small sample; Publication bias: no concerns. Contracting COVID-19 (>65y) (measured at least 14 days after the second injection) The relative risk of Contracting COVID-19 (>65y) in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.11 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.21). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of Contracting COVID-19 (>65y) by 89%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis.

Summary of findings (iSoF) Table Efficacy and effectiveness of the vaccine in subgroups Sex Randomized trials The proportion of females in the COVE trial was 43% (14372 out of 30346 participants) [ [El Sahly HM, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2113017) ]. The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 in men in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.08 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.12). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 in men by 92%, compared with placebo vaccine. The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 in women in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.07 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.1). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of contracting COVID-19 in women by 93%, compared with placebo vaccine. The magnitude of the effect was similar between the subgroups, and there was no statistical evidence of a subgroup effect by sex Age Randomized trials The proportion of patients 65 years of age in the COVE trial was 25% (7512 out of 30351 participants) [ [El Sahly HM, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2113017) ]. The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 (>65y) in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.11 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.21). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of Contracting COVID-19 (>65y) by 89%, compared with placebo vaccine. The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 (>75y) in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.03 (95% CI 0 to 0.46). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of Contracting COVID-19 (>75y) by 97%, compared with placebo vaccine. The phase 2, open-label study QHD00028 is currently evaluating the efficacy/safety of the vaccine in fully vaccinated adults with mRNA-1273 65 years of age and older [ [Sanofi Pasteur, a Sanofi Company, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04969276) ]. The phase 4, randomized controlled trial mRNA-1273-D3-2021 is currently evaluating the efficacy/safety of the vaccine in vaccinated residents 65 years that received [ [Mark Loeb, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04978038) ]. Other comparative studies The phase 1 study 20-0003 [ [Anderson EJ, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2028436) ], NCT04283461 number, was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or 71 years). This study showed that binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients. A follow-up of this study at 119 days after the first vaccination [ [Widge AT, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2032195) ] showed that despite a slight expected decline in titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies, the vaccine provided durable humoral immunity and elicited primarily CD4 type 1 helper T responses. There is no evidence that indicates a lower efficacy in older adults. It is important to notice that very few patients >80 years old were included. Rane MS et al was a case control study conducted in the United States that included data from 931,972 patients with vaccine records: 39,185 with a positive test and 892,787 with a negative test. The study estimated Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic infection in a population of patients seeking care at CityMD, a large ambulatory care center in New York and neighboring areas. VE against symptomatic infection for BioNTech BNT162b and mRNA-1273 vaccines combined was 96% (95% 79% (95% CI, 77% to 81%) in the Delta period. Adjusted VE against any infection was higher in all subgroups in the pre-Delta period compared with the Delta period. VE for participants aged 12 to 15 years old was 85% (95% CI, 81% to 88%) during the Delta period. VE was lower for adults aged 64 years or more compared with <64 years, even in the pre-Delta period.

Results of the study showed an efficacy of the vaccine of 95% after the second dose [ [Ali K, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2109522) ]. The KidCOVE trial or study P204 (NCT04796896) is an ongoing phase 2/3 randomized trial sponsored by Moderna evaluating vaccine efficacy in children from 6 to 11 years of age. Preliminary results showed an efficacy of 88% after the second dose [ [Creech CB, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2203315) ]. Other comparative studies Levy M et al is a comparative study conducted in France. The study included pediatric patients diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome admitted to 1 of the 41 French pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) between September 1, 2021, and October 31, 2021. The Hazard ratio for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.04-0.211) after the first vaccine dose compared with unvaccinated adolescents.

COVERALL was a phase 3 randomized trial conducted in Switzerland. The study enrolled 430 patients (412 included in the intention to treat analysis): 341 patients living with HIV and 71 solid organ transplant recipients. Patients were randomized to Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech. The primary endpoint was antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain 8 weeks after the second vaccination. The percentage of patients showing an immune response to Moderna was 92.1% (95% CI 2 test, 89.1% (95% CI 84.8 to 93.4) had immune and 89.5% (95% CI 85.4 to 93.7) to BNT162b2.

Results showed that at month 4 post-vaccination, an anti-RBD antibody level of at least 100 U per milliliter was present in 33 of 60 patients (55%) in the mRNA-1273 group and in 10 of 57 patients (18%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.1; ]. Heinzel et al was a secondary analysis of the phase 2 randomized trial BOOST-TX conducted in Austria. The study enrolled 201 kidney transplant recipients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies following two doses of an mRNA vaccine. Participants were randomized to a third dose of the same mRNA vaccine (the mRNA group) or a dose of the vector vaccine (Janssen, Ad26COVS1). A total of 169 patients were available for the 3-month follow-up. Overall, seroconversion at 3 months was similar between both groups (45% vs. 50% for mRNA and the vector group, respectively; p = 0.539). However, when applying higher cut-off levels, a significantly larger number of individuals in the vector group reached antibody levels > 141 and > 264 BAU/ml at the 3-month follow-up (141 BAU/ml: vs. 10%, p = 0.018 for mRNA vs. the vector vaccine group, respectively).

In addition, 103 KTRs receiving 100 g mRNA-1273, were randomly assigned 1:1 (mycophenolate mofetil-) mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid treatment for 2 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants with a spike protein (S1)-specific IgG concentration of at least 10 binding antibody units per mL at 28 days after vaccination. The seroreponse rates were 68% (95% CI, 56% (95% CI, 57% to 79%) for single Bonelli et al was a randomized controlled trial in Austria that assigned 60 patients under rituximab treatment who did not seroconvert after their primary mRNA vaccination with either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273, to receive a third dose, either using the same mRNA (28/30) or the vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (27/30). Seroconversion rates at week 4 were (6/27 patients, 22%) and mRNA (9/28, 32%) vaccines (p=0.6). Overall, 27% of patients seroconverted; specific T cell responses were observed in 20/20 (100%) vector versus 13/16 (81%) mRNA vaccinated patients. Newly induced humoral and/or cellular responses occurred in 9/11 (82%) patients. 3/37 (8%) of patients without and 12/18 (67%) of the patients with detectable peripheral B cells seroconverted.

Poh X et al. is an ongoing phase 4 randomized clinical trial conducted in Singapore, assessing the humoral response elicited by homologous and heterologous booster vaccination regimens based on a primary regimen with Pfizer-BioNTech. Interim results of two groups have been published. The study recruited 100 participants who either received a Pfizer-BioNTech (n=51) booster or a Moderna booster (n=49). Results show a booster dose increases antibody titers in all participants by 35- to 49- fold on day 7, with only a modest increase by day 17. Antibody titers were higher in the Moderna group, particularly in the 60 years age subgroup. On day 28 antibody titer reached 29.751 (IC 95%: 25.281-35.011) UI/mL for the Moderna group and 22 382 (IC del 95 %: 18 210-27 517) UI/mL for the Pfizer-BioNTech group.

Chuang et al. was a randomized controlled study made in Taiwan. It included data from samples of 340 health care workers (HCW) with prior Oxford-AstraZeneca homologous vaccination and that received one of the four vaccines as booster doses: Pfizer-BioNTech, half-dose Moderna, full dose Moderna or MVC-COV1901. The primary outcomes were humoral and cellular immunogenicity and the secondary outcomes safety and reactogenicity 28 days post-booster. The study found that, compared with pre-boost, all study vaccines elicited significantly higher anti-spike IgG at 28 days post-boost (P < 0.0001). The mRNA vaccines had more reactogenicity than the protein vaccine [ [Chih-Hsien Chuang, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.14.22276236) ]. COV-BOOST was a phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom. This study enrolled 166 participants who had received Pfizer-BioNTech as their third dose and randomly assigned them to receive a fourth dose of either Pfizer-BioNTech (30 \u00b5g in 0.30 mL; full dose) or Moderna (50 \u00b5g in 0.25 mL; half dose). It was compared immunogenicity at 28 days after the third dose versus 14 days after the fourth dose and at day 0 versus day 14 relative to the fourth dose. The results showed a significant increase in geometric mean anti-spike protein IgG concentration from 28 days after the third dose (25,317 ELU/mL, 95% CI 20,996-30,528) to 14 days after a fourth dose of Moderna (54 936 ELU/mL, 46,826-64,452), with a geometric mean fold change of 2,19 (1,90-2,52). The fold changes in anti-spike protein IgG titres from before (day 0) to after (day 14) the fourth dose were 12,19 (95% CI 10,37-14,32) and 15,90 (12,92-19,58) in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna groups, respectively. T-cell responses were also boosted after the fourth dose (the fold changes for the wild-type variant from before to after the fourth dose were 7,32 [95% CI 3,24-16,54] in the Pfizer-BioNTech group and the Moderna group).

[ [Cerqueira-Silva T, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004156) ] Kamal SM et al was a comparative cohort study conducted in Saudi Arabia that included data from 1,500 vaccinated participants: 503 AstraZeneca, 521 Pfizer, and 476 Moderna, and 1,500 in the control group. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna vaccines, and two Pfizer boosters. Relative risk of infection after the first booster was 0.015 (95% CI, 0.0049-0.047). [ [Kamal et al was a case-control study conducted in the United States that included data from 78,170 emergency department encounters: 8,986 cases and 69,184 controls. This study assessed the effectiveness of a bivalent booster dose among immunocompetent adults during September 13th to November 18th 2022 (Omicron BA.5 sublineage predominance). Vaccine effectiveness of bivalent booster dose against emergency department or urgency care encounters was 56% (95% CI, 50% a 61%). [ [Tenforde MW, 2023](https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7153a1) ] Safety of the vaccine Safety of the vaccine in preclinical studies The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was tested in non-human primates. There were no vaccine-related adverse events noted. No cases of death or pathological changes in the lung were noted [ [Corbett KS, 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2024671) ]. Reproductive toxicity A study performed in rats assessing postnatal reproductive toxicity of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was submitted to FDA on December 4, 2020. FDA review concluded that a dose of 100 g given prior gestation periods did not have any adverse effects on female reproduction, fetal/embryonal development, or postnatal developmental [ [FDA, 2020](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download) ] Developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART) studies in rats concluded that the vaccine at a dose of 100 g, given prior to mating and during gestation periods, did not have any adverse effects (including on female reproduction, fetal/embryonic development, or postnatal developmental). Safety of the vaccine in clinical trials Main safety outcomes of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine Key messages Moderna COVID-19 vaccine increase the risk of any adverse events. Moderna COVID-19 vaccine did not increase the risk of serious adverse events. Any adverse event after the 2nd dose (within 7 days after injection) The relative risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.94 (95% CI 1.58 to 2.38). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose by 94%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse event after the 2nd dose. Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 6255 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 14578 presented this outcome (439 per 1000) versus 13556 out of 14691 in the group that did receive it (851 per 1000). In other words, 412 more people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 41.2%, or that the intervention increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose by 41.2 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTH is 2. Which means that 2 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to experienced any adverse event after the 2nd dose. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Local adverse events after the 2nd dose (within 7 days after injection) The relative risk of local adverse events after the 2nd dose in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 3.67 (95% CI 2.26 to 5.95). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of local adverse events after the 2nd dose by 267%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: local adverse events after the 2nd dose. Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 2757 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 14578 presented this outcome (200 per 1000) versus 13029 out of 14691 in the group that did receive it (734 per 1000). In other words, 534 more people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 53.4%, or that the intervention increased the risk of local adverse events after the 2nd dose by 53.4 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTH is 2. Which means that 2 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to experienced local adverse events after the 2nd dose. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Systemic adverse events after the 2nd dose (within 7 days after injection) The relative risk of systemic adverse events after the 2nd dose in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 2.98 (95% CI 1.56 to 5.67). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of systemic adverse events after the 2nd dose by 198%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: systemic adverse events after the 2nd dose. Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 5343 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 14578 presented this outcome (342 per 1000) versus 11678 out of 14691 in the group that did receive it (1018 per 1000). In other words, 676 more people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 67.6%, or that the intervention increased the risk of systemic adverse events after the 2nd dose by 67.6 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTH is 1. Which means that 1 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to experienced systemic adverse events after the 2nd dose. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Non-serious adverse events The total number of non-serious adverse events was not reported as a group, so it was not possible to estimate the effect for this outcome. The most common non-serious adverse reactions associated with Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were pain at the injection site (91.6%), followed by fatigue (68.5%), headache (63.0%), muscle pain (59.6%), joint pain (44.8%), and chills (43.4%); local adverse reactions occurred more frequently after second dose, and were generally less frequent in younger participants (65 years of age). Serious adverse events (within 28 days after any injection) The relative risk of serious adverse events in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 0.95 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.25). No statistically significant differences between groups were found for serious adverse events. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse event after the 2nd dose. Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 104 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 104 presented this outcome (65 per 10000) versus 98 out of 15184 in the group that did receive it (62 per 10000). In other words, 3 less people per 10000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk of 0.03%, or that the intervention reduced the risk of serious adverse events by 0.03 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome. In this case, the NNTB is 3333. Which means that 3333 people need to receive the vaccine for one of them to experienced serious adverse events. Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as moderate. The certainty of the evidence is based in the following judgments: Risk of bias: no concerns; Inconsistency: no concerns; Indirectness: concerns; information provides from a small sample; Publication bias: no concerns. Safety of the vaccine in subgroups Any adverse event after the 2nd dose (Females subgroup) (within 7 days after 2nd injection) The relative risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the females subgroup in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.96 (95% CI 1.91 to 2.01). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the females subgroup by 96%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the females subgroup. Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 3292 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 6847 presented this outcome (428 per 1000) versus 6635 out of 7045 in the group that did receive it (838 per 1000). In other words, 410 more people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 41%, or that the intervention increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the females subgroup by 41 percentage points.

Any adverse event after the 2nd dose (Males subgroup) (within 7 days after 2nd injection) The relative risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the males subgroup in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 2.36 (95% CI 2.29 to 2.43). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the males subgroup by 136%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the males subgroup.

In other words, 583 more people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 58.3%, or that the intervention increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the males subgroup by 58.3 percentage points.

Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Any adverse event after the 2nd dose (65 years) (within 7 days after 2nd injection) The relative risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the 65 year old participants in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 2.45 (95% CI 2.34 to 2.56). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the 65 year old participants by 145%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the 65 year old participants . Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 1334 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 3649 presented this outcome (428 per 1000) versus 3304 out of 3691 in the group that did receive it (1048 per 1000). In other words, 620 more people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 62%, or that the intervention increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in the 65 year old participants by 62 percentage points.

Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Any adverse event after the 2nd dose (12-17 years) (within 7 days after 2nd injection) The relative risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in children between 12 to 17 years of age in the group that received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus the group that received placebo vaccine was 1.74 (95% CI 1.66 to 1.83). This means Moderna COVID-19 vaccine increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in children between 12 to 17 years of age by 74%, compared with placebo vaccine. Figure - Forest plot of risk ratio meta-analysis. Outcome: any adverse event after the 2nd dose in children between 12 to 17 years of age. Comparison: Moderna COVID-19 vaccine versus placebo vaccine In the trial identified in this review, 680 people not receiving Moderna COVID-19 vaccine out of 1220 presented this outcome (428 per 1000) versus 2405 out of 2478 in the group that did receive it (745 per 1000). In other words, 317 more people per 1000 did not develop the outcome because of the vaccine. This is the same as saying that the intervention led to an absolute risk increase of 31.7%, or that the intervention increased the risk of any adverse event after the 2nd dose in children between 12 to 17 years of age by 31.7 percentage points. Another way of presenting the same information about the absolute effects is the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/H), the number of participants who need to receive the intervention for one of them to experience the outcome.

Applying the GRADE approach [ [The GRADE Working Group, 2013](https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) ], we assessed the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as high. Summary of findings (iSoF) Safety of the vaccine in subgroups Sex Randomized trials The proportion of females in the COVE trial was 47.3% (14366 out of 30351 participants) [ [Baden LR, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389) ]. Safety profile of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was similar across sex groups. Other comparative studies Li LL et al. included 3,118,802 participants who had received one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and 2,979,326 who had received two doses (1,389,401 Pfizer and 1,589,925 Moderna). Data were collected during the period from December 12, 2020, to August 21, 2021. The study results showed that, Overall, two-dose mRNA vaccine regimens are safe in a population with many comorbidities. Weakness, muscle aches, fever, mental status changes, falls, dehydration and acute kidney injury were transiently increased after vaccination, especially after the second dose. Among patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was an increased risk of hospitalization (absolute risk 1:1000) [ [Li LL, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.01.026) ]. Age Randomized trials 25% (7512/30351) of the participants in the COVE trial were aged 65 years or over (mean age: 70.6 years; range: 40-95 years) [ [Baden LR, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389) ]. Severe adverse reactions were generally less frequent in participants 65 years of age as compared to younger participants [ [FDA, 2020](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download) ]. Lymphadenopathy (axillary swelling and tenderness of the vaccination arm) was observed in 12.4% of vaccine recipients 65 years of age, as compared with 5.8% of placebo recipients [ [FDA, 2020](https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download) ]. The phase 2, open-label study QHD00028 is currently evaluating the efficacy/safety of the vaccine in fully vaccinated adults with mRNA-1273 65 years of age and older [ [Sanofi Pasteur, a Sanofi Company, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04969276) ]. The phase 4, randomized controlled trial mRNA-1273-D3-2021 is currently evaluating the efficacy/safety of the vaccine in vaccinated residents 65 years that received [ [Mark Loeb, 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04978038) ]. Children and adolescents Randomized trials The TeenCove or study P203 (NCT04649151) was a phase 2/3 trial sponsored by Moderna evaluating vaccine efficacy in adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age. Results of the study showed that in the mRNA-1273 group, the most common solicited adverse reactions after the first or second injections were injection-site pain (in 93.1% and 92.4%, respectively), headache (in 44.6% and 70.2%, respectively), and fatigue (in 47.9% and 67.8%, respectively); in the placebo group, the most common solicited adverse reactions after the first or second injections were injection-site pain (in 34.8% or 30.3%, respectively), headache (in 38.5% and 30.2%, respectively), and fatigue (in 36.6% and 28.9%, respectively). No serious adverse events related to mRNA-1273 or placebo were noted [ [Ali K, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2109522) ]. P204 study (mRNA-1273-P204) is an ongoing phase 2/3, randomized trial sponsored by ModernaTX, Inc. It was first registered in March 15, 2021 and plans to enroll 6750 participants with children between 6 months of age and less than 12 years of age, finalizing in June 10, 2023. Participants will be randomized to receive intramuscular injections of the vaccine at different doses (defined in the different states of the study), 28 days apart, on Day 1 and Day 29. [ [ModernaTX, Inc., 2021](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04796896) ]. Other comparative studies Cheng DR et al was a population based study conducted in Australia. The study included 454,974 12 to17 years old participants who had received 871,689 mRNA doses (782,964 Pfizer and 88,725 Moderna). The aim was to describe myocarditis adverse events following immunisation reported following any COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in the adolescent population. Confirmed myocarditis reporting rates were8.3 per 100 000 doses in this age group (aggregated data for both mRNA vaccines). [ [Cheng DR, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2022-001472) ] Cristina Morciano et al was a self-controlled case series study that included 15,986,009 participants who received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine: 10,833,284 with Pfizer vaccine, 1,706,979 with Moderna vaccine, 2,863,950 with AstraZeneca vaccine and 581,796 with Janssen vaccine. This study investigated the risk of Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome after vaccination with anti-COVID-19 vaccines. Relative incidence of Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome for the second dose of Moderna was 6,83 (95% CI, 2,14-21,85).

These pregnant women were age-matched with 166 female controls. Safety was assessed as any vaccine-related complaint as defined in the original safety data. Results showed a frequency of complaint following vaccine administration of 18.1% in the pregnant group and 16.9% in the non-pregnant group. The most frequent local and systemic reactions in Pregnant females were: fever 4.8%, Cough/Shortness of Breath 4.8 %, Vomiting/Diarrhea 4.8%. Complaint frequency was higher after the second dose (12.3 %) than after the first dose (6%) [ [Nakahara A, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1745-1168) ]. Aharon D et al. included 222 vaccinated (Pfizer =119 or Moderna =103) patients and 983 unvaccinated patients who underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles between February and September 2021. Data collected included oocyte, fertilization, and embryo development parameters, as well as results of preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy among cycles in which testing was performed. The study showed that the administration of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was not associated with an adverse effect on stimulation or early pregnancy outcomes after in vitro fertilization. The fertilization rate for the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cohort was 80.7% (95% CI 78.4 to 83.0) in the vaccinated group and 78.7% in unvaccinated groups (95% CI 77.5 to 80.0). No differences were observed between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients on univariate analysis in the secondary outcomes of eggs retrieved, mature oocytes retrieved, mature oocytes ratio, or blastulation rate. In cycles in which preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy was performed, vaccinated patients had a proportion of euploid embryos of 48.8% (95% CI 44.1 to 53.6) compared with 42.5% (95% CI 40.2 to 44.9) in unvaccinated patients [ [Aharon D, 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000004713) ]. Kachikis et al . analyzed a convenience sample of adults enrolled in the online prospective study who were pregnant, lactating, or neither pregnant nor lactating at the time of their booster or third dose was eligible for this follow-up survey; 17,014 (97.2%) completed the follow-up survey. 16, 989 individuals who reported their vaccine type for their booster or third dose, most received the BNT162b2 (10,319 [60.7%]) or mRNA-1273 (6651 [39.2%]) vaccines. After a COVID-19 booster or third dose, 82.8% reported a local reaction, and 67.9% reported at least 1 systemic symptom. Compared with individuals who were neither pregnant nor lactating, pregnant participants were more likely to report any local reaction to a COVID-19 booster or third dose (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4; P = 0.01) but less likely to report any systemic reaction (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.8; P<0.001). Most lactating of 10,277 [96.0%]) individuals reported no or concerns after vaccination.

This study aimed to determine the frequency and nature of significant health events among pregnant females after COVID-19 vaccination, compared with unvaccinated pregnant controls and vaccinated non-pregnant individuals. Data were collected primarily by self-reported survey after both vaccine doses. Most pregnant participants had received BNT162b2 (3414 received dose one and 1892 received dose two) or mRNA-1273 (2183 received dose one and 1216 received dose two) COVID-19 vaccines. Pregnant vaccinated females had decreased odds of a significant health event compared with non-pregnant vaccinated females after both dose one (aOR 0.63 95% CI 0.55 to 0.72]) and 0.62 [0.54 to 0.71]) of any mRNA vaccination. Pregnant vaccinated females had an increased odds of a significant health event within 7 days of the vaccine after dose two of mRNA-1273 (adjusted odds ratio 4.4 95% CI 2.4 to 8.3]) compared with pregnant unvaccinated controls and 1.3 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.42) after second dose of Pfizer vaccine.

The study compared the frequency of adverse outcomes in between pregnant patients who received mRNA vaccines and unvaccinated patients. Vaccination was associated with a lower incidence of perinatal death (aOR 0.20 [95% CI, 0.05-0.88]), (aOR 0.63 [95% CI, 0.48-0.82]), neonates with very birth weight (aOR 0.35 [95% CI, 0.15-0.84]), and neonatal (aOR 0.66 [95% CI, 0.52-0.85]) aOR = [Morgan JA, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000005072) ] Breast-feeding Randomized trials No clinical trial evaluating vaccines to prevent COVID-19 has included breast-feeding females. Other comparative studies Kachikis et al . analyzed a convenience sample of adults enrolled in the online prospective study who were pregnant, lactating, or neither pregnant nor lactating at the time of their booster or third dose was eligible for this follow-up survey; 17,014 (97.2%) completed the follow-up survey. 16, 989 individuals who reported their vaccine type for their booster or third dose, most received the BNT162b2 (10,319 [60.7%]) or mRNA-1273 (6651 [39.2%]) vaccines. After a COVID-19 booster or third dose, 82.8% reported a local reaction, and 67.9% reported at least 1 systemic symptom. Compared with individuals who were neither pregnant nor lactating, pregnant participants were more likely to report any local reaction to a COVID-19 booster or third dose (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4; P = 0.01) but less likely to report any systemic reaction (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.8; P<0.001). Most lactating of 10,277 [96.0%]) individuals reported no or concerns after vaccination.
