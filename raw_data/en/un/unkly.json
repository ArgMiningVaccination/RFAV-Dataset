It is what helped you get pregnant, birth your child, and what is commonly disrupted during the postpartum period. It can cause the mind and body to get dysregulated and create chaos, anxiety, worry, fear, and unneeded stress. Ayurvedic care focuses completely on grounding Vata in its postpartum recovery with many pathways of support. This time is unique and sacred. It is important to give yourself space for healing, resting, and for integration. I have designed a program called the \"Rituals of Care\" to suit the needs of the early postpartum period, specifically the first 42 days after birth (though it can be used during other times of the postpartum period with great success too). Each ritual and treatment is specially put together with the tenets and practices of Ayurveda as the guide-working to attune the whole self: mind, body & spirit. I have taken great time and care to create a program that is both comprehensive and could be used and continued well beyond the tender and dear passage that follows the enormity of birth. Please enjoy this [article](https://www.livingartsayurveda.com/blog/2021/12/7/ayurveda-amp-postpartum-care) from my journal which talks a bit more about the perspective of the postpartum time through the wise practices of Ayurveda. I have listed a few other resources as well. Here's What to Expect: Initial In-Home Consultation It is recommended that we meet prior to birthing so I can get to know you and you can get to know me and I can get to know your home with an in-home consultation (this is a 90 min in-home consultation). In this initial visit, we will talk about your health history, your needs, likes, dislikes, and concerns as well as what's on your mind. This helps me prepare for your postpartum recovery, healing, and integration. This visit is $225, please email or call me to schedule this initial consultation: [danielle@livingartsayurveda.com](mailto:danielle@livingartsayurveda.com) or 503-504-2726 After birth let me know how you are and from there we can get started. The \"Rituals of Care\" bundle can be done 1 x a week or multiple times. It may vary slightly depending on your needs and healing but the roots are the same: deep nourishment of mind, body & spirit and a slow and sustainable way to integrate this amazing portal into your life through ritualized care. Allow for 4-4 1/2 hours for each visit so that there is plenty of time, all supplies included- $425 per visit or commit to 6 visits for $2399 which saves $151. If you live outside of the Portland metro area, do let me know. A traveling fee may be added per visit. Thank you! The Rituals of Care Abhyanga a foundation of health and healing, abhyanga is similar to massage but a whole different practice. It is the ritual of rubbing warmed, herbal oil over the body with loving care and presence. It is not for structural alignment or \"working out\" muscle tension, rather a deep and caring treatment that uses and infuses oil, hands, and heart to help support the mind and body. [Here](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/blog-the-banyan-insight/details/why-ayurveda-prefers-oil-over-lotion/) is a great article on the practice of abhyanga done for daily health which can be of great benefit for postpartum. In addition to your abhyanga I will also do gentle [marma therapy](https://chopra.com/articles/learn-all-about-marma-point-therapy), focusing around the head to help relax, soften and integrate this massive life experience as well as tuning forks studded with gem tips to synthesize and decrease the role of Vata. This tending to the subtle channels of the mind-body is so important during the early days after birthing and a wise integration for those who are further along in the postpartum journey. Pelvic Steaming This wise and ancient practice has been used for thousands of years across the globe. While the uses vary from culture to culture, one time period used by most is during postpartum recovery. Depending on your delivery, pelvic steaming will be introduced and practiced. Click [here](https://www.steamychick.com/4thtristudy/) to read about the extraordinary gifts of postpartum steaming through a recent study done by the Peristeam Hydrotherapy Institute. Each session we will do a steam ritual together and a plan can be set for possible increased healing and support. Flower & Herbal Bath Depending on your delivery and your recovery, after abhyanga and before steaming, allow me to draw you a bath to let the healing qualities of the herbal and floral allies support you. Soaking with herbs and flowers is tremendous and depending on your needs spending time with these tender healing beings can be so nourishing. Additional Support Compassionate and supportive listening and observation as a grounded and experienced mom, healer, and caregiver. I cannot say enough about the importance of connections to mind, body, and spirit for strong mental health especially during this time where so many worries, concerns, questions, and processing needs to have a place to land. I'll come bearing resources, referrals, and references as well from a wide berth of people, books, classes, and/or experiences. Snack and healing teas-I'll come with a prepared nourishing and supportive snack and an herbal tea for grounding, regeneration, hydration, and care Dietary & lifestyle guidance and support that is individualized to your unique constitution but also this unique and sacred window. Included might be recipes, recommended books and references to guide you through this time. Baby & Life integration-you might find yourself with a lot of the most practical or impractical of thoughts and questions- giving time & space for this is important. Simple questions about lactation, Infant massage, navigating sleep (or lack thereof), bumps & burps are all fair game here. Space for you to rest so light housework, chores, and the likes can find their way into this time as well. I recommend resting after these sessions and will make sure to tuck you in with lots of blankets and create warmth to stimulate circulation and release toxins. These are generally the many parts that make up \"The Rituals of Care\" and each of my visits with you. My hope is to support you, the birthing parent during this tremendous time of change with love, honor and reverence using these amazing and ancient practices handed through time. ***Please note that not all treatments are best done right after birthing. C-sections, perineal lacerations, and other birth circumstances may require alternative care and rest as well as greater amounts of time for healing before doing some of these specific practices. There is important healing work to be supported, I will assess each birthing parent prior to getting started with hands-on care. Thank you for your understanding and our shared practice of supporting your best and most sacred healing during this time*** I have spent many years dedicated to my studies and practices to support you most uniquely during this time. As an Ayurvedic Practitioner with a master's degree in Ayurveda, as well as credentials in the practices of yoga and meditation, pelvic/vaginal steaming for postpartum care, cooking for the postpartum period, ayurvedic postpartum caregiving during the postpartum period, DONA postpartum doula certification, energy work and Reiki and most importantly my own experiences of having and navigating two (just about adult!) kiddos, my scope of practice and care is variegated and unique. I would love to be there to support you during this highly transformative time with skills and techniques that are tried and true bathed and held from my heart to yours. .
