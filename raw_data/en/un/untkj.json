Naturopathic medicine is more than just switching pharmaceutical meds for herbs or supplements wherever possible. It's a philosophy, a whole new world of perceiving, thinking, and living. The results patients can enjoy with this mindset make it increasingly popular around the world, including in Minnetonka, MN, and the Minneapolis and St Paul areas that Yggdrasil Naturopathic Medicine serves. Our naturopathic medical doctors prioritize the most natural treatment options possible to promote overall wellness and prevent disease without medication or invasive surgeries. They may include dietary advice, nutritional supplements, herbal remedies, lifestyle changes, and other holistic therapies. We believe in the natural power of your body to heal itself and aim to help our patients achieve their desired results. Personalized Care for Your Family At Yggdrasil Naturopathic Medicine, our holistic doctors take the time to care for you and your individual needs, hopes, and dreams. We follow the same intake, examination, and diagnostic testing procedures as conventional doctors, but the first thing you may notice is the longer consultations and emphasis on your body as a whole system. For example, you may be asked about food intolerances and other aspects of your digestive health if you visit us for spring allergy treatment. Functional medicine testing is another common aspect of examination in order to get a clear picture of your health. In naturopathic and integrative medicine, you will be treated as a unique individual, too. When visiting a functional medicine doctor in our Minnetonka, MN clinic, you are cared for as a whole person.

Your treatment plan is tailored for your own symptom picture, and what is feasible for you. You can trust that our holistic physicians have your best interests at heart.
