We are energies of light. You are not only mass and volume, you have a deeper level of consciousness that you need to connect with and this is about re-connecting with your Higher Self and your Soul Level. The heart directly connects with the Soul Level. The root of all disease affects the Shaoyin level; involving the heart and kidneys, according to Mikio Sankey, L.Ac, PhD, author of 'Climbing Jacobs Latter' and many other books on Esoteric Acupuncture. We tend to go about our lives making sure we look good on the outside and try to balance it on the inside with proper nutrition, but we are still missing something. We are all made of energy. Energy needs to keep moving and when you obtain blockages in your auric levels or your soul level, disease creates an imbalance in your physical body (i.e. cancer, diabetes and heart disease). Emotions and traumatic events can create negative thought patterns and these thought patterns are not only emitted within your body, but into the universal flow of consciousness, and as much as you would like to change your conscious thinking and awareness, your subconscious mind, your higher self and your soul are often left without acknowledgement. This is where those deep issues need to be worked on and released. Karmic energy from your past lives, as well as your parents', is a part of this picture of health. There are techniques to help interact with your soul level and higher self, as well as releasing past karmic influences brought on from birth and from your ancestors, using EDxTM and Esoteric Acupuncture techniques which help to properly grid up your body to successfully allow this release. EDxTM is Energy Diagnostic and Treatment Method, involving balancing right and left brain hemispheres, tapping on points and reciting affirmations to clear negative thought patterns. According to Mikio Sankey, L.Ac, Ph.D., we are living like we are in the Piscean Era, which is a water-based theory, and we need to be more aware that we are actually living in the Age of Aquarius. The Age of Aquarius focusses more on using your Right Brain and developing your skills with intuition and tapping into your Heart Centre and Soul Level to help heal disease and focus on Wellness. Augment the old ways of thinking, involving mostly a Left Brain focus on a linear world, and refocus on the world that is changing and moving and evolving on a day-to-day basis. Be aware and allow yourself to move with the dynamic equilibrium of the universe and follow the frequency shift that is occurring at all times. You are not only one piece of the pie, you are the whole pie and flow like the web of life. COVID-19 Coronavirus can be more lethal than the annual flu because it causes an inflammatory chaotic storm in the Lungs which can lead to respiratory distress, effecting other organs from functioning properly and even causing death. Learning how to enhance your immune system with improving your diet, vitamins, herbs, neutriceuticals, adaptogens, anti-virals and healthy lifestyle practises could prevent you or your loved ones from experiencing the detrimental effects caused by "}
