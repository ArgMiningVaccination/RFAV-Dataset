The 5 articles address various aspects of indigenous healing practices in different cultures. In distilling a number of pertinent themes, theauthor presents the view that indigenous healing practices can no longer be ignored by conven-tional medicine. These practices are potentially an invaluable resource available in addressing theongoing global health crisis. However, in order to ethically address the role of indigenous healingpractices within a westernised worldview, certain policy, methodological, and conceptual changeswill be necessary. Keywords: Global health crisis; Holistic medicine; Indigenous healing; Policy changes Introduction In reviewing the five articles that appear in this Special Issue, \"Indigenous and Complementary and Alternative Healing Practices\", it is clear that there are similartrends that define and connect indigenous healing practices across differentcultural contexts, be they African American, Native American, Mexican Curander- ismo, Pakistani healers, or South African traditional healers. All share similar epis- temological foundations. All are based on the interconnectedness betweenspirituality, humanness, culture, and community. All were, and are still, subjectedto historical and political influences and restrictions. All have been, at best, under-estimated in their efficacy or, at worst, dismissed by the western-based scientificbiomedical model. Yet despite, or perhaps because of, these factors, the researchers *P.O. Box 491, Milnerton, Western Cape, 7435, South Africa. Email: moya@visualnet.co.za472 L. Marks note that large percentages of people avail themselves of indigenous healing reme- dies. Harley (this issue) cites the National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2004) in this regard. She notes the crisis facing health care systems world-wide as well as the lack of credence given to Indigenous practices by institutionalisedmedicine. The observation is made that the popularity of Indigenous Healing practices among African Americans is largely due to the intuitive recognition that these heal-ers base their authority on a collective understanding of a culturally bound idea ofhealth or a worldview based on consubstantiation. In contrast, the biomedicalmodel is perceived as poorly equipped to administer to the Indigenous ideology ofillness and health. It is clear from Harley's article that Indigenous practices are animportant part of non-formalised health care and that an authentic, ethical, andappropriate collaboration between the healer and institutionalised medicine isunavoidable. Portman and Garrett similarly highlight the worldview of the Native American healer as based on the inextricable interconnectedness between spirit, the environ-ment, and the self, resulting in a complex holistic treatment practice. The impor-tance of the individual's belief system is pivotal to the acceptance of the healer'sknowledge and the healing process. This multidimensionality is highlighted byZacharias with her call for an ethnopsychotherapy and a method of research that issensitive to a culturally based healing paradigm. While the hegemonic system ofwestern medicine has recognised the cultural importance of the work of the Mexicancuranderos , medical validity is withheld, despite evidence of a clinically significant service offered by these healers. In noting the difficulties that the Traditional Healing practices have experienced with respect to the modern medical world, Farooqi notes that the strong cultural andspiritual fabric that characterises Indigenous medicine has been dismissed, due tothe dehumanisation of medical treatment particular to the western model. Nonethe-less, traditional and alternative practices are alive and well in Pakistan. Mzimkuluand Simbayi stress the efficacy of African Traditional Healing practices in the treat-ment of psychosis in South Africa, and reiterate the call for collaboration betweenwestern and traditional treatment systems. A theme highlighted by the five articles focuses on the often underestimated efficacy of the realm of the Indigenous or Traditional Healer. These IndigenousHealing practices are understood to include a wide range of interventions fromherbal remedies to rituals, faith healing, therapeutic touch, and spiritual practices.All are based on historically accumulated knowledge within a specific culture. As aresult, Indigenous Healing practices have remained outside the accepted boundarythat defines the biomedical model. Battiste and Youngblood Henderson (2000,p. 41) reflect that \"Indigenous knowledge is a complete knowledge system with itsown epistemology, philosophy and scientific and logical validity ... which can onlybe understood by means of pedagogy traditionally employed by the people them-selves\".Holistic Medicine 473 A Call for the Recognition and Legitimisation of Indigenous Healing Practices A cursory perusal of the shelves of any well-stocked bookstore or Internet search engine reveals a plethora of writings addressing the complex and multifaceted realm of Indig-enous or Traditional Healing practices. In addition, there is a growing awareness thatwe are facing a global health crisis. A point noted in the articles, and one that is wellknown, is that, despite the advancement of medical systems, they fail to reach themajority of those most at risk, due to rising costs, and complex and expensive tech-nologies that limit accessibility and availability of health care. The crisis in health carewill need to be addressed with great rapidity and by resources that lie outside theboundary defined by conventional modern medicine. The World Health Organization(2004) in Johannesburg, South Africa, quoted statistics the attest that 80% of Africansdepend on Traditional Healers. Farooqi notes that two-thirds of the world's popula-tions rely on herbal medication. Faced with these statistics, one is forced to questionwhether or not it is at all possible for the biomedical world to continue to maintain apaternalistic tolerance or patronising dismissal of these Indigenous practices. Giventhe global health crisis facing established health systems, the biomedical model willneed to access and assess as many alternative resources as is possible. The researchers recognise the difficulties faced by the Indigenous Healing frater- nity on its path to recognition and acceptance. These include politico-historicaldiscrimination, colonialisation and the reluctance of the Indigenous Healers to shareesoteric knowledge for fear of contamination and exploitation. An added difficultythat the biomedical model faces is the attempt to transpose methodologies andresearch techniques that grew up in a reductionistic paradigm onto the Indigenousapproaches in which spirituality is interwoven with health care. There is a Need to Engage in Inter-epistemological Dialogue The World Health Organization (2001; as noted in Harley, this issue) stated that Indigenous medicine has a central role to play in the twenty-first century. I believethat established medicine will eventually honour this sentiment. In doing so, thebiomedical world would need to make paradigmatic shifts that are not comfortableand that are mostly without precedent. Indigenous Healing practices (as also notedby Portman and Garrett, this issue), have a long history that extends beyond today'sconventional medicine. Conventional medicine owes its roots to the so-called \"folkremedies\" of old. It seems that yesterday's folk remedies become today's medicalscience only once they survive the rigours of currently accepted scientific investiga-tion. It seems rather short-sighted to dismiss something just because we do not as yethave the instruments to validate its existence. Herein lies the challenge faced by thebiomedical model. Part of this challenge will be the acknowledgement that theIndigenous Healer as an individual is not limited to specialist categories so prized bythe biomedical world, but functions as a multifaceted practitioner. Indigenous Healing has been defined as comprising the interrelatedness between physical and spiritual components. I would like to focus on an aspect of the Indigenous474 L. Marks Healing cosmology that is alluded to in most of the five articles; that of the spiritual role of the healer and the symbolic essence of the \"illness\" or symptom. This aspectis perhaps a more controversial and difficult one for the biomedical model to accept.The scientific medical approach conceptualises and treats symptoms as deviations froma pre-determined norm. This model aims to eliminate physical symptoms, often atthe expense of a more holistic understanding of the role of the symptoms in the person'slife. Ignoring the role that a symptom may represent for the individual may also contrib-ute to a poor prognosis. An example from my practice illustrates this point. A 36-year-old female patient was diagnosed with debilitating migraines and chronic pain duringan unwanted divorce. Her ex-husband agreed to support her financially as long as sheremained ill. Her symptoms continued despite medical treatment. Her illness hadbecome more than a physical symptom, acquiring an emotional and psychologicalfunction, and thereby ensuring the ongoing relationship with her ex-husband. The cosmology of the Indigenous Healer understands and accepts this phenome- non as natural since the healer is the \"one who lives in an undivided world in whichancestor, dream, plant, animal, body, [mind and spirit] all belong together\"(Kruger, 1974, p. 30; brackets added). As mentioned, this aspect of IndigenousHealing practices has long confounded the conventional medical model whoseresponse has been to relegate such practices to the position of frivolity or, worst still,the amusing \"mumbo jumbo\" of mystics. It is in the face of this dismissal that the Indigenous Healer has stood. The paradigm shift required of the biomedical model is no easy task as it seems to compromise thevery foundation upon which it is built\u2014that illness is not always isolated and treatedas a separate entity, but is considered an integral part of the human condition. Indigenous Healing Operates from a Multi-layered Perspective The Indigenous Healer, certainly in South Africa, functions as herbalist, counsellor, and spiritual guide\u2014the repository of cultural and historical spiritual knowledge. TheIndigenous Healing process rarely limits itself to the prescription of herbal remedies,but invariably includes a ritualised ceremony in order to address the spiritual andcommunal imbalances in the person. Achterberg (1985) observed that illness for thehealer is the result of an external intrusion into the body, not unlike conventional medi-cine. This intrusion may be a virus or a spirit. However, unlike conventional treatment,the indigenous healer's primary concern is not only the removal of the intrusion, butthe identification of the \"loss of personal power\" that has led to the intrusion in the firstplace. It is possible to compare this with the biomedical view of a compromised immunesystem; the body's \"power\" to resist illness. In the Indigenous Healing epistemology,a person becomes \"ill\" when their personal protective immunity is weakened. The aetiology of disease, for the Indigenous Healer, is thus the result of spiritual imbalances. Illness is not merely a physiological symptom, but indicative of a deeper,more serious, social, spiritual, and emotional imbalance. The reinstatement of well-being involves the commitment to a more conscious approach to living and anawareness, in day-to-day life, of that which is beyond the physical. The healer'sHolistic Medicine 475 world is one in which the organic and the spiritual are inseparable. This presents a challenge to the comfortable Descartian westernised view of reality as that which isperceived by the five physical senses. This results in a view of the human as fixable,as well as the concomitant loss of soul. Shulman (1997) suggests that western heal-ing systems are \"ill\" because they suffer from a \"one-sided gerontomorphy\" thatneeds to be corrected. A shift away from this way of thinking calls for policy, concep-tual, and methodological changes. Jung (1969) commented that \"the fact that we aretotally unable to imagine a form of existence without space and time, by no meansproves that such an existence is in itself impossible\". This further presents a chal-lenge to the World Health Organization's definition of health to include factorsbeyond the physical, mental, and social well-being of the individual. The belief system of the individual is fundamental to the success of the healing process, be it Indigenous or Allopathic. The placebo effect is well known. Achter-berg (1985) noted the interactional effect between imagination and physiology.Bodily changes are observable in response to certain images. The autonomicsystem's response to stress is also well documented and often results in physiologicalchanges in the body's auto-immune system. The recognition of the interactionbetween belief systems, cognitive processes, and successful treatment forms thefoundation of all Indigenous Healing practices. Neuro-physiological and bio-chemi-cal changes have been noted in response to various Indigenous processes that involveritualised ceremonies as part of the treatment plan (Buhrmann, 1984; Hammond-Tooke, 1989; Moore, 1990; Smith, 1997). The Indigenous Healing world seems tooffer the modern western medical world a rich understanding of healing, rituals, andspirituality and their interaction and effect on health and well being. There are Many Pathways to Competent Health Practice The twenty-first century has presented humanity with a crisis of existence. Climatic change, globalisation, economic and political stresses, AIDS, overpopulation, andsubstance abuse have resulted in heightened levels of anxiety, a lack of adequateresources, and a deep sense of the loss of security resulting from a breakdown ofsocial and cultural structures. To begin to address this crisis, the idea of what consti-tutes health and who constitutes health practitioners requires revision beyond merelythe absence of disease and the acquisition of approved academic qualifications. The biomedical world dismisses the knowledge of the Healer as this knowledge was not acquired in a recognised academic institution. However, Indigenous Healersspend a number of years apprenticed to an experienced and qualified healer beforethey themselves are deemed fit to work independently. This apprenticeship is a rigor-ous and exacting process that requires a deep level of commitment and \"scholarship\".The scientific tradition inherent in western medical interventions, as noted in the arti-cles, further devalues Indigenous Healing practices because they do not lend them-selves to empirical investigation and thus provide no scientific basis for therapeuticeffectiveness. The herbal remedies used by some healers may be subjected to abiomedical type of analysis, but interventions such as spiritual healings and rituals do476 L. Marks not. This would require a methodological paradigmatic shift away from the \"test- tube\" syndrome: if you cannot see it, test it, and manipulate it, it does not exist. In addition, this will require a revision of the research methodologies employed by western researchers in order to understand the Indigenous epistemology. Researchmethods that were established within the biomedical paradigm are insufficient inpromoting an unbiased analysis of the Indigenous Healing practices that are embed-ded in alternative epistemologies and worldviews. Portman and Garrett suggest thatthe indigenous healer must be included in the research process as researcher and notjust as subject/participant. Indigenous Healing practices are sensitive to the intrusive nature of biomedical research methods. The very idea of researching, documenting, analysing, and reduc-ing phenomena to quantitative statistics or even qualitative descriptions is foreign tothe Indigenous Healer's worldview. This was expressed by a Zulu TraditionalHealer, who asked me during my own initiation process \"Why do you do this, ask somany questions? Just sit still and you will see\". It was during this process that I wasfaced with the quandary discussed in this paper. As an individual trained within thewestern paradigm, I had to deal with the so-called conflict of existing between thesetwo seemingly very different worlds. To become a Traditional Healer in the AfricanTradition is not something that one can elect to do, but rather something one is\"called\" to do. For the Traditional Healer, to resist such a call results in illness. Theprocess is one that must be lived. One is faced with seemingly bizarre, magicaloccurrences of precognition located in the collapse of linear time and space thatunfolds during dreams and altered states of consciousness that defy rationalisation.However, the gulf may not be too wide to bridge. There is growing awareness that ina globalised world, dominated by hegemonic ideologies, there is an increasing needfor Traditional Healing systems to participate in a transcultural discourse and toassist in creating an appropriate research methodologies and understanding. This process may be aided by developments in scientific fields such as quantum physics, which offers opportunities for such connectedness. Quantum theory hasstimulated a shift in the worldview of the physicist. The observations that subatomicparticles exist within probability patterns as part of an interconnected cosmic web(Capra, 1982), begins to approximate the views of the healers who have long beenaware of the circularity and interconnectedness of life and who have escaped thelimitations of a linear conception of time and space. The Indigenous Healer is profi-cient with altered states of consciousness where the interrelatedness of all is apparentand where past, present, and future exist in a dynamic multidimensionality. Jung (1959; brackets added) too, understood this need: Sooner or later, modern [...] physics and the psychology of the unconscious will draw closer together as both of them, independently of one another and from opposite direc-tions, push forward into transcendental territory, the one with the concept of the atomand the other with that of the archetype ... Psyche and matter exist in the same worldand each partakes of the other, otherwise any reciprocal action would be impossible. Ifresearch could only advance far enough, therefore, we should arrive at an ultimateagreement between physical and psychological [and spiritual] concepts. (p. 261)Holistic Medicine 477 The World Health Organization (2004) reflected that there is one traditional healer for every 500 head of population in sub-Saharan Africa compared with the40,000:1 ratio of patients to every western-trained medical practitioner. The effec-tive functioning of western health systems worldwide demands a more inclusiveawareness of culturally and spiritually based belief systems that will have implica-tions for the conceptualisation, diagnosis, and treatment of illness. While it may notbe possible to entirely recreate a spiritualised and ritualised way of being that isendemic to non-urbanised cultures, there can be little doubt that a collaborationbetween the Indigenous Healing community and the western-based biomedicalmodel is a prerequisite in order to address the challenges facing global healthsystems. The National Health Plan of South Africa encourages the recognition of all healers, in that: Traditional Healers will become integral and recognized part of health care in South Africa. Consumers will be allowed to choose whom to consult for their health andlegislation will be changed to facilitate controlled use of Traditional practitioners. (African National Congress, 1994, p. 38; italics added) Recent South African legislation (2004) proposed a bill recognising the legitimacy of the Traditional Healer and promoted registration of all healers in South Africa. Whilethis change begins to address the historical and political suppression and discriminationof healers in South Africa, the course of registration and legitimisation is problematicas it requires that healers become subsumed under the control of existing biomedicallegislation. These changes have not as yet filtered into the day-to-day lives of the Tradi-tional Healers, who still function in relative obscurity and with little or no recognitionof their work. Such changes in policy must be introduced with sensitivity and under-standing in order to preserve Indigenous practices and protect against contamination,commercialisation, and the possibility that Traditional Healers begin to mirror themethods and practices of the biomedical system. A collaboration must include theIndigenous Healers as colleagues and as experts in their own particular field. The attempt to bridge the divide between Indigenous Healing practices and the biomedical model requires a mutual acknowledgement and recognition in the devel-opment of a re-humanised and spiritualised holistic approach to healing. In addition,the following points are relevant to a South African context and, as noted by Hill(2003), perhaps to Indigenous Healing worldwide: 1. There is a need, as has been expressed to me directly by a number of healers, to clarify the terminology used in referring to Indigenous Healing practices. Thisincludes the clarification of the term herbalist versus spiritual healer and theoften inappropriate, erroneous, and damaging use of the term \"witchdoctor\". 2. The term \"medicine\" when used within an Indigenous paradigm refers to anything from herbal remedies to rituals or spiritual interventions. This requiresdistinction from the use of this term in the biomedical sense. 3. There is a need for the protection of the intellectual property of the Indigenous Healer. A recent case brought by the Southern African San community against478 L. Marks the pharmaceutical industry illustrates the urgency of this need. This case involved the Hoodia Gordonii plant used for thousands of years by the indigenous San tribes of Southern Africa as an appetite suppressant. The pharmaceuticalgiant, Pfizer, \"discovered\" and farmed the plant, reaping enormous financialrewards. They were forced to recognise the San people as owners of the Tradi-tional knowledge about this plant and to ensure that the San people receive apercentage of all profits from the sale of Hoodia (Koro, 2005). 4. Governmental policy and regulation of Indigenous practices requires modera- tion to insure that all policies and guidelines are appropriate. 5. There is a need for an egalitarian forum for the meeting of Indigenous Healers and biomedical practitioners in order to promote further understanding andcooperation. In closing, I am reminded of the Xhosa proverb in this regard: Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu (\"a person is a person through/because of other persons\").
