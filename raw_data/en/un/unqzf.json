Let's first break down the words: Hol=whole, istic=works with. Holistic is working with the whole body. Chiro=hands, practor=to practice or always improve. So, we work with our hands to improve you. In conclusion, a Holistic Chiropractor is one whom works with his hands to improve your whole body and make it work better rather than just treating a simple symptom or one area of the body. Allopathic is a system of medical practice that aims to combat disease by use of remedies (such as drugs or surgery) producing effects different from or incompatible with those produced by the disease being treated. (Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary) So in other words, Allopathic medicine tries to break the body down to smaller and smaller parts, then they try to address a specific part with surgery or a chemical reaction with a drug. In my opinion, the body is so complicated and different for every single individual, that this approach requires constant change and innovation with little to no improvement on the outcome in a person's overall health. Many people confuse the approach of Allopathic medicine with Holistic Chiropractic. These two concepts are in no way similar and should not be confused. Chiropractic has been confused as a treatment for back pain, headaches or other musculoskeletal symptoms. I am here to tell you that concept is not true. In fact, chiropractic does not treat any symptom or condition. You might be thinking: what?? I'll repeat: chiropractic does not treat any symptom or condition. However, it does treat dis-ease (or, lack-of-ease.) My job is to look at your whole body structurally and functionally, to determine how we can get it all to work better. Once we determine what to do, we apply an adjustment (a change for the better) to the structure of your body to allow your whole body to improve function. This adjustment is performed most of the time to the spinal column because the central nervous system controls the function of every single cell, tissue and organ in the body. However, there are times to adjust other areas such as diet, mental attitude, reduction of stress, exercise regimes, etc. Holistic chiropractors are highly in tune with these other aspects as well. Don't just settle for a treatment of a pain or a symptom. Take charge of your own health because you are the one who must live in your body. Use the tools that your holistic chiropractor can help you with. In this approach, I can guarantee you will be much happier and healthier with less dependence on medications and surgeries. - Dr. Eric Evans "}
