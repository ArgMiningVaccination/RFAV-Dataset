McNamee and Prof. Dr. J.B. RijsmaniiiABSTRACTThe majority of studies pertaining to substance misuse and eating disorders aredominated by concurrent disorders research. Within that framework, traditionalmedical, psychological, biochemical models, and the disease model of addictionprevail. Studies that consult young women about their ideas and knowledge for howto best address these problems in therapy are relatively rare within these fields. Usinga narrative approach to therapy, I explore the interplay between these problems, andthe ways in which disordered eating practices and substance misuse problems can\"feed off of each other,\" thereby keeping young women ensnared in their grips.Twelve young women (insiders) who attended a residential substance misuse programwere interviewed about their personal experience with substance misuse anddisordered eating practices in an attempt to explore and identify ways in whichhelpers and young women can use these similarities to their advantage. Using caseexamples from 12 semi-structured interview conversations, I demonstrate the meritsof co-research practices, and detail the practical and therapeutic applications of anarrative therapeutic approach when working with young women struggling withthese problems. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, sorted and assigned tothematic categories. The results suggest the importance of highlighting the interplaybetween these problems and illuminate the young women's insider knowledgeregarding these problems. Based on these results, suggestions for ways to best addressthese problems are offered. In order to contextualize the problems and locate themivwithin their political and social cultural context, the above ideas are framed withinhistorical accounts of alcohol and drugs, disordered eating, mental illness, socialconstruction, and narrative therapy ideas. This study may benefit counsellors, health-care professionals, parents, and teachers who know or are working with youngwomen who struggle with substance misuse and disordered eating practices in that thestudy offers practical ways to assist persons in reclaiming their lives from theseproblems.vDEDICATIONThis is dedicated to all the young women whose voices are included in thisdissertation.

However, it is less commonly known how to workwith these problems as a therapist when they occur simultaneously in a young woman'slife. So grew my interest in developing ways to work with young women who strugglewith problems that threaten both themselves and challenge their helpers due to theircomplexity. My purpose in this dissertation is to explore and illuminate the interplayand relational features of disordered eating practices and substance misuse. I willexplore what I have learned as a therapist to develop an approach to working with thecomplex relationship between these two problems. Using case examples from 12 semi-structured interview conversations I conducted with young women who have personalexperience with substance misuse and disordered eating practices, I will illustrate thepractical and therapeutic applications of this approach for therapeutic work with youngwomen struggling with these problems1.There is a wide breadth of understanding in regards to the paradigms used todescribe substance misuse and disordered eating practices. Before I move on it isimportant to clarify the paradigms that my understandings of these two problems are 1 I am aware that young men also experience a form of body policing and also struggle with disorderedeating practices. Yet I chose to only include young women's experience with both problems for a varietyof reasons; 1) Rates for disordered eating practices are consistently higher for women than men (Hudson,Hiripi, Pope & Kessler 2007), 2) In my work as a therapist more young women tend to be reporting thestruggle with substance misuse and disordered eating practices more than young men and 3) Discussingboth young men and women's experience with these problems is beyond the scope of this writing.15located in. When using the term substance misuse I use it to discern from the morecommonly used terms substance abuse/dependence. Abuse/dependence are rooted inthe dominant addiction terminology, and the disease model of addiction. Rather thanuse the term eating disorders, which I find conjures up and limits us to traditional andindividualistic understandings of anorexia, bulimia, and compulsive eating I chose theterm disordered eating practices. I use the term disordered eating practices toencompass \"anorexia, bulimia and weight preoccupation\" (Brown, 1993, p. 53). AsBrown describes \"the weight preoccupation continuum often includes fear of fatness,denial of appetite, exaggeration of body size, depression, emotional eating and rigiddieting\" (p. 53-54). Brown acknowledges, \"only a matter of degree separates thosewomen who diet, work out, and obsess about their body shape and calorie intake fromthe more extreme behaviours of anorexia and bulimia\" (p. 54). My use of the termdisordered eating practices is an attempt to conceptualize the societal drive for thinnessnot as individual pathology, but as problems that are very much connected to their largersocial contexts (Brown).Traditional discourses of eating disorders and addiction can also result in thetotalizing labels of 'anorexic/bulimic/alcoholic/addict' being placed on or taken up bypersons (Sanders, 2007; Madigan, 1999). While some people describe finding these'labels' helpful as they give them a way to understand their experience and place tostand, others find that these labels soon begin to define and explain their understandingof who they are and how others know and relate to them (Tomm, 1990)This dissertation is divided into seven chapters. Chapter one introduces the readerto my own initial interests in this work and the practice, based on theoretical16assumptions that inform my work. Additionally, I briefly introduce the reader to thetraditional ways of understanding substance misuse and disordered eating. Thesetraditional treatment models are problematized and an alternative way of addressingthem is proposed. The voices that inform my research will also be discussed. Chaptertwo describes the relational features that disordered eating practices and substancemisuse have in common, and ways in which helpers can use these features to theiradvantage when working with clients. I give an overview of the narrative re-authoringperspective, and present a hypothetical conversation between disordered eating andsubstance misuse. Chapter three contextualizes disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse in history and explores the ensuing ways of understanding and treatingthese problems. I also explore some of the similarities and differences in the ways theseproblems have been constructed and the ways that this has impacted our currentunderstandings and treatment practices. The second half of chapter three gives thehistory of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)(APA, 2000) and speaks to theimpact this perspective has on persons seeking therapy for substance misuse anddisordered eating practices. In chapter four, I explore and give an overview of socialconstruction, which is the orienting discourse of this dissertation. Chapter five explainsmy research methodology, and chapter six presents the results of my interviews with theyoung women. Throughout chapter six, therapeutic questions are included in order togive the reader a sense of how these ideas work in praxis. Finally, in chapter seven, Idiscuss the implications of my research and suggestions for incorporating these practicesinto the work that we do as counsellors when working with young women strugglingwith what can be life-threatening problems. This final chapter also describes the17limitations of my dissertation while suggesting possible directions that this work cantake in the future.How I Came to this WorkA significant portion of my therapy career has been spent working alongsideyoung men and women trying to reclaim their lives from drugs and alcohol. For the pasteight years I practiced first as a youth counsellor and later as a family therapist at PeakHouse, a co-ed residential substance misuse program located in Vancouver, BritishColumbia, where young people live for a period of 10 weeks, participating in individual,group, and family therapy. I was first introduced to Peak House in 2000, while taking acourse in Substance Abuse Counselling, a required course for my Master's degree. Thecourse was taught by Colin Sanders, who at that time was the clinical director of thePeak House program. In my Master's program and this course in particular, I studiedpostmodern and collaborative therapies (Andersen, 1987; Anderson White 1990; 1985). When I began mypracticum at Peak House2, I witnessed postmodern, narrative and collaborativeapproaches to therapy come to life (Reynolds, 2002; Radke, Kitchen & Reynolds, 2000;Madigan, 1992; Sanders, 1998, 2007; Bird, 2000, 2004). These practices expanded mypreviously held notions of what was possible when working from a collaborativeapproach with people seeking relief from problems. 2 I would like to acknowledge the therapists, young persons, program directors and youth counsellorswhom I worked with at Peak House in helping me to develop the ideas written about in this dissertation.18The theoretical framework of this dissertation is postmodern3 and socialconstructionist thought (Burr, 2003; Foucault, 1980; Sarup, 1993; McNamee & Gergen,1992). Social construction is interested in the \"relational and generative nature ofknowledge and language\" (Anderson, 2003, p. 126). In this approach ourunderstandings of the world are seen as emerging through our relationships with others.They are constructed communally. These paradigms question the commonly acceptedmodernist notion that there are 'Truths' to be known, which are located withinindividual minds. Rather than viewing language as an expression of the mind, socialconstructionists propose that it is in our interactions and performances with others (inlanguage) that we create, understand, and interpret our experiences.The narrative metaphor has been extremely influential in my work as a therapist.From this perspective, our lives are understood as being storied (Bruner, 1986; White,2007), and it is through the telling of stories that we come to know and understandourselves and the world around us. In the narrative approach, the therapist views theclient as being in relationship to the problem, which creates linguistic space betweenperson and problem, as the problem is not understood as located within the psyche orbiochemistry of the individual. Labelling, deficit based understandings, andpathologizing discourses are resisted and explored in therapeutic conversations. Ratherthan leaving social, political, cultural, and gendered discourses outside of the therapyroom, therapists have a responsibility to address these discourses and the effects thatthey have on peoples' Tuhaka, & Campbell, 2003; Hare-Mustin, 1994). Clients' strengths, courage, and understandings of their experiences are 3 Used here to refer to \"a family of concepts that critically challenge the certainty of objectivetruths, the relevance of universal or meta-narratives, and language as representative of the truth\"(Anderson, 2003, p.126).19privileged, and taken for granted assumptions are deconstructed. This stance createsroom for people's preferred stories to come to the forefront, and for previouslyunimagined possibilities to emerge. In writing this dissertation and interviewing theyoung women, this stance came to life.The narrative metaphor is complementary to and located in social constructionistideas, as the telling of stories always occurs in relationships (White & Epston, 1990;White, 1995; Gergen, 1991; McNamee, 2004c). Stories themselves are socialconstructions, as opposed to truth or fact, one possible story out of a myriad of othersthat may be told. Both narrative therapy and social construction approaches focus theirattention on the relational aspects of human interchange, what people are doing together(McNamee, 2006). This differs from modernist approaches to therapy that concernthemselves with the individual, focusing their attention on what occurs inside peoples'minds.The Problems OverlapSome of the young people who walked through the Peak House doors not onlystruggled with the harrowing problem of substance misuse, but they also struggled withweight preoccupation, body image concerns, restricted food intake, binge eating,throwing up after meals, or over-exercising. Some of these youth had previouslyattended eating disorder programs or treatment centres, while other youth had kept theseconcerns hidden. The other therapists and youth counsellors working at Peak Houseworked hard to figure out a way to allow those young women who we knew werestruggling with purging, over-exercising, or food restriction to remain in our program. Itseemed unjust to prohibit someone from participating in a substance misuse treatment20program simply because she was also struggling with disordered eating practices.4 Todeny treatment in this way would, we worried, only throw these young women back intothe arms of drugs or alcohol, and drug dealers (and sending them back into isolationwith disordered eating practices). Our continual question was, \"Aren't they better offwith us?\"Isolating Two ProblemsOur program had the same policy as many other substance misuse programs: Ifyou are self-harming or engaging in practices of disordered eating, you need to leaveand come back when you can focus on the problem of substance misuse. I can see thegood intentions behind this policy, as it can be useful for some youth as it takes a solidposition against disordered eating practices, sending the message that it is not welcomehere.5 For them, the fear of having to leave the program should they be caught purging,serves as a motivator for seeking assistance with disordered eating practices. For others,this stance may push disordered eating practices even further underground, hidden fromthe therapists and youth counsellors' views. For example, youth might comply with theprogram's eating requirements, but may purge their meal or over-exercise in their roomsafterwards. Alternatively, they may find ways to skip meals by claiming that 'they arestill full from lunch,' or 'they feel sick if they eat breakfast.' Instead of asking us forsupport, they may keep their struggle with food a secret, and in the silence disordered 4 All prospective youth were required to have a medical evaluation done prior to entering the program andif a person was deemed too unwell and required more intensive medical care than we could offer to them,they were referred to the appropriate organization at that time.5 This process of externalizing was developed by Michael White and David Epston (1990) of DulwichCentre. It is a way of working whereby problems are externalized. \"The problem is the problem, theperson is not the problem\" is a catch phrase used to describe this way of working. Externalizing andNarrative Therapy will be described in greater detail in Chapter 2.21eating practices grows. In response to this issue, our team of youth counsellors and therapists beganto construct ways to make it possible for young women to be \"eating-enough,\" trying tocut down on \"purging-enough,\" and engaging in \"healthy-enough\" exercise so theycould stay in the program (Bird, 2000). I remember many shifts where young womenwould let us know that they were struggling with their body shape/size after gainingsome weight since entering the program. I also remember watching tears pour down ayoung woman's cheeks as she chewed a piece of lettuce from her salad. She had justbeen told, on her first day of the program, that eating three meals a day was arequirement to stay in the program.We saw the shame the young women experienced when their 'secret' wasdiscovered. They begged us not to kick them out or tell their families or their alcoholand drug counsellors. Many of them said that they were trying to cut down on purging,as they binged on plates overflowing with syrup-drenched French toast. We watched asthey drank glass after glass of water and then disappeared into the washroom, turning onthe faucet to tune out the sound of their heaves. We watched as they walked out of thewashroom, face red, eyes glistening and darting anxiously around the room to seewhether they had been noticed.We recognized the need for young women struggling with both substance misuseand disordered eating practices to have a space to address these concerns. They wereentitled to have capable, respectful, ethical and well-informed counsellors to assist themin their quest to find freedom from these problems, yet the structures that we had inplace then were restricting and limiting. We realized that we needed to work with both22problems if we wished to better serve the clients and their families6 who approached usfor our help. So grew my interest in developing ways to work with people who strugglewith problems that threaten both themselves and challenge their helpers due to theircomplexity.Disrupting the IsolationWhen a young woman struggles with substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices, it can be daunting to navigate a path to freedom. If you are continuallystruggling with one problem or the other, you can never really focus on your self, sinceone of the two is lurking in the background influencing your thinking. Even moredifficult is when young women struggling with both problems describe both problemsoperating at once in their lives, especially when they seek professional help or whenthey are trying to step away from one problem or the other. Addressing the twoproblems simultaneously disrupts the traditional approach in which each problem isisolated and dealt with individually, the idea being that only one problem\u2014eatingdisorders or substance abuse\u2014can be treated at a time. Traditionally these problemshave been seen as separate from each other, and counsellors often specialize in oneproblem or the other. What does this mean for our youth?Typically, someone struggling with substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices would have to address these issues separately, as \"historically, those whosuffered concurrently with disordered eating and substance misuse found the doors ofeither type of helping facility shut until they could manage one or the other problem\" 6 When I use the word 'families' I am using it in the broadest possible way. Family includes whomever itis who loves and cares for the young woman and is supporting her in this work, be it moms and dads, twomoms, two dads, adopted parents, legal guardians, grandparents, friends, or partners.23(Dennstedt & Grieves, 2004, p. 64). In most eating disorder treatment programs, aperson who has had a (self-admitted) history of substance misuse must be abstinent fromall substances for three months prior to entering the program. The same is true in mostsubstance misuse programs; people are required to eat three meals a day and expected toabstain from purging, binging, restricting, over exercising, and other disordered eatingpractices. This means that people often face multiple barriers to treatment access suchas treatment refusal, lack of resources/treatment that addresses both disorders, and longwait lists (Dunn, Geller, & Brown, 2008). People seeking support for both problems areoften straddling two very different treatment philosophies. In the field of addictions, thedisease metaphor underlies most treatment approaches. Treatment is often de-medicalized and governed by 12-Step programs (Alcoholics Anonymous /NarcoticsAnonymous), addiction counsellors, detoxification centres, recovery homes, andabstinence based treatment programs. Eating disorders treatments are mainly overseenby hospitals, psychiatrists, psychologists, and inpatient and outpatient programs that arealso run within these frameworks. Therapies tend to be cognitive behavioural andinterpersonal in nature with psychopharmacological medication prescribed more oftenthan not (Brady, Back & Greenfeld, 2009). Unfortunately this compartmentalization isincongruous with the ways in which people live their lives, and can lead one problem orthe other to go underground, defying detection.Traditional Ways of Understanding Disordered Eating Practices and Substance MisuseIn the mental health field, when eating disorders and substance abuse occur at thesame time, they are commonly referred to as a dual diagnosis, co-occurring disorders or24problems of co-morbidity. The term concurrent disorders7 is defined by Health Canada(2002) as:The concurrent disorders population refers to those people who are experiencinga combination of mental/emotional/psychiatric problems with the abuse ofalcohol and/or another psychoactive drug. Technically, it refers to anycombination of mental health and substance use disorders, as defined forexample, with the classification scheme of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders [DSM-IV-R] (p. 7).In the last ten to 20 years there has been an increased focus on concurrentdisorders in the mental health field (Cooper & Calderwood, 2004). Many studies havedocumented the associations between substance misuse and disordered eating (Dunn,Neighbors, Fossos, & Larimer, 2009; Franko, D., & Vincent, 2003). These studies have suggested theneed to assess patients with eating disorders for drug and alcohol use, and patients withsubstance misuse problems for eating disorders (Dunn, Et. Al, 2009; Gorden, Johnson,Greenfield, Cohen, Killeen & Roman, 2000; Piran & Gadalla; Courbasson, Smith &Boland, 2004). They also suggest a need for conducting research into effectiveprevention programs, and integrated treatment programs for patients with co-occurringeating and drug and alcohol disorders (Dunn, et al., 2009; Piran & Gadalla). In theseparadigms (12 step approaches (AA/NA), psychiatry, psychology, and the evolving 7 The words co-morbidity, dual diagnosis and concurrent disorders are often used interchangeably. InCanada the term concurrent disorders is most often used, whereas in the US the term dual diagnosis isused. In Canada dual diagnosis refers to an individual that has a physical disability as well as a mentalhealth disorder (Cooper & Calderwood, 2004).25concurrent disorders field), eating disorders and substance abuse are most often viewedas individualized and static problems. Furthermore, the cause of these disorders is oftenseen as residing inside people inviting us to look inwards for the cause of the problem,for example, at an individual's biochemistry, genes, or personality traits.A quick search on the PsycInfo computer database (from 1983 to 2009) using thekey words \"eating disorders\" and \"substance use\" finds 305 results, which illustrates thecurrent interest in this subject matter as an area of research (Retrieved, August 28,2009). A common thread between the studies is that they try to determine co-morbidityrates for eating disorders and substance use and substance use and eating disorders. Forexample, studies have examined the co-morbidity rates of disordered eating behaviour inwomen who seek treatment for substance use/abuse/dependence (Herzog et al., 2006).More commonly, the association between eating disorders and substance consumption isstudied in a person's seeking treatment for eating disorders, by exploring his or her pastand present patterns of psychoactive consumption (Weiderman & Pryor, 1996; Corcos etal., 2001). These studies often explore the association between the two problems inquestion. For example, regarding the prevalence of eating disorders among men andwomen who were hospitalized for substance abuse, it was surmised that the increasedstimulant use was because stimulant drugs suppress the appetite thereby increasingweight loss (Hudson et al. 1992).Other studies attempt to locate common underlying psychopathological factors.For example, Baker, Mazzeo, and Kendler (2007) conducted a study in which theyexplored the associations between bulimia nervosa and drug use disorders focusing onthe common genetic and environmental influences between the two. Many studies focus26their inquiry on the links and common factors between specific substance use andspecific eating disorder diagnoses, for example, anorexia nervosa and its associated sub-types, restricting type, binge-eating/purging type and bulimia nervosa and theirassociated sub-types, and purging or non purging type (Dunn et al., 2009; Dunn, Geller,& Brown, 2008; Herzog et al., 2006; APA, 2000).Concurrent disorders are studied in various ways with clinically based orcommunity based populations typically examined separately. In some cases, thelifetime prevalence rates of eating disorders and substance abuse are studied and thenthe likelihood that an individual with an eating disorder would also have a substance usedisorder or eating disorder is determined (Piran & Gadalla, 2007). In other cases,information is gathered from individuals who are currently in treatment programs (oftenreferred to as clinical samples) for eating disorders or substance use, having themcomplete questionnaires regarding their past and present substance use or disorderedeating behaviours (Krug et al., 2008; Hudson et al., 1992). While the studies described above are of interest and show a need for increasedresearch regarding the co-occurrence of these problems (and most certainly generatefunding for continued research in this area), most do not lead us in the direction oftherapeutic treatment approaches for persons struggling with the problem of substancemisuse and disordered eating. When treatment approaches are suggested, they aretypically cognitive behavioural therapies8, interpersonal therapies, orpsychopharmacological treatments (for example, antidepressant therapies) (Sysko &Hildebrant, 2009; Brady, Back, & Greenfield, 2009). Brady et al. point out that there is 8 Cognitive behavioral therapy has been chosen as the treatment of choice for eating disorders by theAmerican Psychiatric Association (Brady, Back & Greenfield, 2009)27currently \"no treatment\" (p. 235). This demonstrates the need for furtherinvestigations into and the development of therapeutic approaches when working withperson's struggling with disordered eating and substance misuse.This dissertation does not focus on the reasons why a young woman may developa problem with substance misuse and disordered eating. Nor am I interested in whatcame first, the chicken or the egg. Rather, I am interested in exploring the interplaybetween these problems, and the ways in which disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse problems can 'feed off of each other' thereby keeping young womenensnared in their grips. I explore the relational features that these problems share, andways in which helpers can use these features to their advantage when working withclients. My purpose in this dissertation is to explore the interplay of disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse in the lives of young women and the implications of thisinterplay for therapeutic practice. This research involves formally asking youth the kindof questions that have emerged in my therapy sessions with young women at PeakHouse.In my therapeutic conversations with young women, I have found that addressingthe problem simultaneously creates a common space where the problems come alive inan entirely new way, thereby interrupting the tendency to dichotomize these issues,creating new possibilities for change. Addressing substance misuse and disorderedeating problems collectively is important, otherwise these problems remaincompartmentalized and separate: defined as this (i.e. disordered eating practices) andthat problem (i.e. substance misuse). The problems' interplay between them remains28outside of any categorizations, its location hidden and silenced.To my knowledge, this is the first qualitative study documenting young women'spersonal experiences regarding the interplay between substance misuse and disorderedeating practices. This is also the first study to detail a therapeutic approach and providetreatment ideas and therapeutic questions for practitioner's working simultaneously withthe problems of disordered eating practices and substance misuse.Youth's VoicesIn closing this chapter, I wish to describe the voices that inform this writing, aswithout them this dissertation would not have been possible. This dissertation is theresult of 12 semi-structured interview conversations with young women who havepersonal experience with substance misuse and disordered eating practices. Of course,all identifying information and names have been changed in order to protect theiranonymity. I have paid specific attention to ensure that their voices are highlighted byincluding quotes and snippets of our conversations throughout the dissertation. Chapter6, the results sections, is comprised mainly of the young women's voices. Their voicesinfluenced the creation of the chapters and held me accountable to highlighting theirlocal knowledge (Geertz, 1983) and wisdom throughout the chapters. This is importantto me as so often youth's voices are not included in professional literature. Instead, thevoices of professionals are allowed to 'speak for' the people who are under'investigation.' This is especially the case where the 'subjects' being studied havediagnoses that pathologize them and separate them from so-called 'normal,' or 'healthy'individuals. Foucault refers to these as \"dividing practices\" (Rabinow, 1984, p. 8).Often the focus of traditional psychological research is to understand what causes the29deviation from normal behaviour. In these instances, it is assumed that there is anessence to be known and that this essence unlocks the key to understanding theindividual's behaviours, actions, and thoughts. When people are categorized as'well/unwell,' 'normal/abnormal,' health-care professionals are positioned as expertswho treat or heal those who require help in specific, culturally agreed upon ways. Thisstance disqualifies the expertise and knowledge of the person consulting with the healthcare professional, and places the professional in a position of power over the individual(Foucault, 1980).I often co-present with youth9 from Peak House at workshops and at the localcollege where I teach. In these contexts, the comments of workshop attendees/studentsare strikingly similar, \"Did you pay them to say that?\" \"They were so articulate!\" \"I'venever heard young people speak so well.\" What do these comments reflect about theways in which we view these young people? What does it say about those voices towhom we give credence? How is it that so often professionals are surprised that theindividuals who receive 'professional' help/therapy/counselling/treatment, have ideasabout what will work best for them at this time in their lives?North American society lends little credence to the voice of young people. Oftentheir voices are marginalized and not given much room to speak, or if they do have thechance to speak, they may not always be heard. Instead youth are positioned as peoplewho need to be taught, shaped, and moulded. These ideas can contribute to us talkingdown to youth, or stereotyping them into categories of violent, aggressive, naive, and 9 This practice was passed down by Colin Sanders (2007) as a way to not speak forthose that can speak for themselves, as young persons are so often under represented attherapy conferences, and teaching institutions.30self-centred, rather than positioning youth as having something meaningful to say, andas teachers.This dissertation is an attempt to privilege youth's voices in a way that willinvite them to let us\u2014the professionals\u2014know how we can be more of use to them.Their ideas for future therapeutic conversations with other youth who are also strugglingto navigate this rugged and confusing territory are highlighted. I was interested inhearing about the young women's lived experiences with both substance misuse andeating disorders. I was curious about how these problems gained a hold on them, howthey made sense of them, and how they have begun to find freedom from theseproblems. I strongly believe that young persons are intelligent and have much insightinto their own lives. They have hopes and preferences about the direction in which theywant their lives to go. I also believe that the problems of substance misuse anddisordered eating are often initially attempts to cope, after which they take on a life oftheir own, and that no one imagines or wants their life to be engulfed by these problems.I believe if you position yourself as curious and interested in what someone has tosay, and if you really listen to the other as she is speaking, that you will hear that she hasher own ideas and solutions for her problems. I also believe that by positioning yourselfas a listener you will be amazed at what it is that you will hear and it is my hope thatyou, my reader, will be amazed by the many voices of the youth that inform and speakthrough this dissertation.31CHAPTER 2 THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN DISORDEREDEATING PRACTICES AND SUBSTANCE MISUSEIn order to demonstrate the interplay between substance misuse and disorderedeating practices, it will first be useful to look at the many relational features that theyshare. The relational features are the similarities between the problems and the ways inwhich these similarities interact to create a new problem. Highlighting these featureswill illuminate the ways in which the problems may appear together, how they can be ameans to a similar end, and how difficult it can be to break free from them. It will alsoilluminate how these problems, in relationship with each other, can be unrelenting in ayoung woman's life. Knowing these relationships, and the ways that they work togetherin a young woman's life, may help us assist young women in finding freedom from theproblem.I do not intend to write an exhaustive list of all the relational features that theproblems share. Rather, I wish to describe some of the main ones that I have noticed inmy work with young women struggling with disordered eating practices and substancemisuse. I will examine the relational context between the two problems and how theycan\u2014at times\u2014collude to become a means to the same end, such as to lose weight, dealwith emotions, to feel normal, to look/act/be viewed by others in a certain light, or to fitin/belong.The diagram below illustrates the traditional modernist way of understanding thesimilarities between disordered eating practices and substance misuse. The problemssimply overlap.32Figure 1 Traditional modernist way of understanding the similarities between disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse The diagram below illustrates the interplay between the two problems. I willdescribe the lower circle that represents the relational context that the two problemsshare. The social context of the young women's lives is always present when discussingthe relational context.Figure 2 The interplay between disordered eating practices and substance misuse 33Both problems are skilled at offering empty promises as a way to recruit youngwomen. I describe their promises as empty, as the costs of the promises in the lives ofthe young women are much greater than they let on. Both substance misuse anddisordered eating practices can work as an 'analgesic,' a way to cope with problems orto 'self-medicate.' Both problems can make empty-promises of increased belonging andconnection with people. For example, drugs and alcohol might convince people that theyare more social, more outgoing, and less boring when they are under the influence.Disordered eating exploits people by leading them to believe that if they are thin thatthey will be more likely to be socially accepted by others and have more friends. Yeteventually, both problems can lead to isolation and disconnection from family andfriends in a way that allows the problems to gain increasing control over the youngwomen's lives.Another commonality is that, with time, substance misuse or disordered eatingpractices become the most easily accessible 'solution' in a person's life. If someone isgoing through a difficult a break-up, it might seem easier to go out and use, or to bingeand purge as a way to cope with the barrage of emotions that one would experiencewhen a relationship ends. The other viable solutions\u2014calling a friend to talk, crying, ormourning the loss of the relationship\u2014might not be as available to a person as the abovepractices and/or the results might lack the immediacy for which the person is looking.This is not to say that people intentionally select problematic ways to deal withdifficulties in their lives, but that alcohol and drugs or disordered eating practices maydisguise themselves as non-problematic solutions or ways to cope. It is often only with34time, when problems have taken on a life of their own, that the devastating effects ofwhat first might have seemed like a benign act (smoking a joint after a hard day atschool or cutting out desserts) becomes apparent.In our consumer-driven culture both problems receive cultural support; alcoholuse and some drug use are socially approved and accepted. Social gatherings,celebrations, and birthdays, often revolve around the consumption of alcohol. Drinkingalcohol is often considered a right of passage for teenagers on their way into adulthood,young men's drinking often being strongly tied to discourses of masculinity (Smith &Winslade, 1997; Nylund, 2007). In western countries, drinking among young women ison the rise, mirroring that of young men. In addition, young women are increasinglytargeted by alcohol companies in advertisements (Lyons & Willott, 2008). Problems arealso supported by ideas or promises of increased belonging and a sense of community.For example, people may begin to drink socially or attempt to lose weight as a way to fitin.The \"relentless pursuit of thinness\" (Bruch, 1973, p. 555) and the generalizedfear of (being) fat that exists in society, encourages and supports women (and men) toalter their bodies by exercise, limiting their food intake, and dieting. In addition,advances in cosmetic surgery and declining costs in procedures have considerablyincreased the availability of surgical alteration of the body. For example, liposuctionand breast augmentation have become common ways to meet societal body standards(Blum, 2003). The patriarchal male gaze and normative discourses that come throughthe male gaze, with its emphasis on thinness, fat phobia, and heterosexism, support this(Orbach, 1978). Berger (1972), writes, \"Men look at women. Women watch themselves35being looked at. This determines not only most relations between men and women, butalso the relation of women to themselves\" (p. 47). This can translate into the practicesof self-surveillance, perfectionism, self-sacrifice, comparison with other women, and acritical policing of their own bodies (Foucault, 1979).Disordered eating and substance misuse also support the notion of 'special-ness'amongst its recruits. Young women often describe feeling like they were part of a secretclub, or that other people were jealous of them. For example, young women mightclaim that if they did not have drugs, they would be 'nothing.' In reviewingconversations and transcripts from interviews of young women, disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse have been frequently personified and described as a'friend,' (Maisel, Epston & Borden, 2004) just as dealers and pimps are often calledlovers and boyfriends. Substance misuse or disordered eating is described as 'havinghelped' the individual to get through certain periods in her life, 'stood by' her in timeswhen others might not have. Both problems have a way of convincing people that they(substances and disordered eating) can truly be counted on. Once people are free fromthe problems, they are able to see that the problems are anything but friends and howthis fa\u00e7ade isolated them from people who cared about them.At times substance misuse and disordered eating is minimized as a problem.Young women often describe how they could 'stop using at anytime,' or 'its not really aproblem.' For example, 'When I loose X10 pounds then I'll be satisfied' or 'Just one lasttime, then I'll quit,' 'I'll just have one drink,' 'It is the other people in my life that havethe problem, not me, if people would just get off of my back then I would be fine.' In 10 As an anti-anorexic practice I am putting an X rather than a number as a way to not inadvertently feedanorexia or potentially invite ideas of comparison.36some circles this minimizing would be referred to as denial (Marlatt, 2002).The term denial has been critiqued in many disciplines, especially the substancemisuse field, as it negates peoples' abilities to know themselves and the problems withwhich they are struggling. It also casts the therapist/helper in an expert role, suggestingthat the person is unable to see that she has a problem. Solution focused therapists Bergand Miller (1992) write, \"In traditional [treatment] models clients are expected to learnand adapt to the frame of reference of the treatment model or be considered difficult,resistant, or 'in denial'\"(p. 7). By asserting that a client is in denial, the therapist ispositioned as the expert and is therefore absconded of any professional accountability orresponsibility to determine if the help that they are providing 'fits' with the needs of theclient (Berg & Miller). The client is simply in denial if they are not responding to thehelp offered or making the changes deemed necessary by the therapist. Yet resistancecan very well be a sign that the therapist is trying to encourage the client to makechanges that this client is not yet prepared to make (Miller & Rollnick, 1991; Berg &Miller).Both problems are associated with increased health risks and mortality rates.Mortality rates for persons with anorexia are higher than any other mental andpsychiatric disorder (Keel, Dorer, Eddy, Kamryn, Charatan, Herzog, Franko, 2003;Herpertz-Dahlmann, 2009). Young women aged 15-24 with anorexia have annual deathrates that are 12 times higher than other young women of similar age (Sullivan, 1995).Overdose associated with illicit drug injection is one of the leading causes of death forinjection drug users (Kerr, Tyndall, Lai, Montaner & Wood, 2006). Hser, Hoffman,Grella, and Anglin (2001) followed persons dependent on heroin for 33 years and found37that 284 of the 581 participants had died with the majority of deaths being caused byoverdose.Some fields of study consider anorexia/bulimia to be an addiction, and 12-stepgroups such as Anorexics and Bulimics Anonymous: The Fellowship Details ItsProgram of Recovery For Anorexia and Bulimia (Farthing, 2002) have been created.These groups are based on concepts that are the foundation of traditional 12-stepprograms for Alcoholics Anonymous; for example, ideas of hitting bottom andadmitting that you are powerless (Bill, 1955). David Krueger (1982) points out that,Perhaps the most common theme of all the eating disorders is that they areaddictions: anorexia nervosa is an addiction to food avoidance, to the pursuit ofthinness, and to feeling a sense of control and of mastery over one's body;bulimia, an addiction to food binges and perhaps purging or laxative use, often dueto the intense affect of depression, emptiness, or isolation and the attempt at affectregulation; and compulsive, addictive overeating, a relentless pursuit of andobsession about food, with the person often automatically turning to food forvarious types of tension reduction (p. 371).There are of course important differences between the two problems. One is thatit is possible to abstain permanently from drugs and alcohol, whereas we cannot abstainfrom eating, which has implications for therapy. Thereby a different type of relationshipneeds to be negotiated with people's relationship to food, and people need to develophealthy-enough eating practices to ensure that they maintain their physical health.Another important issue is that prior to attending a residential therapy program, peopleneed to be medically well enough to participate in therapy. This would mean38detoxification in some cases for those under the influence of drugs and alcohol, andweight gain (which can take the form of re-feeding on hospital wards in extreme casesof malnourishment) for those who are malnourished from lack of eating. Anotherdifference is that people usually start using substances due to curiosity, seeking pleasureand or transcendental and or mood altering experience, whereas people often begin'dieting' as a way to lose weight.Below is a chart that highlights the relational features that exist between the twoproblems, and to also show by way of illustration the times when someone is vulnerableto one of the problems can make it very difficult for a person to break free from theother, as both problems can serve very similar purposes. In this way, the problem keepsthe person trapped in a web of difficulty. I have decided to break this chart into two.One chart describes overall relational features between the problems, and the other chartdescribes the promises that the problems offer to the young women. The categories andcharts that I have created are not mutually exclusive. Rather, there is an ebb and flow tothem. You may notice some overlap between the two.Table 1 Relational features between the two the popularmediaNormative expectations ofthinness for women and ageneralized fear of fat thatexists in societyGlorification of thinnessand beauty in the popular 11 I would like to thank Ali Borden for helping me come up with the idea to create this chart.

These features can make someonesusceptible to the other problem as both can act as a similar means to the same end. As42further demonstrated in the results section of this dissertation, both problems are cleverat morphing their tactics to serve their own survival. The relationship between the two isnever static; it is ever changing and as such, our questions and conversations need toreflect the movement between the problems in accordance with how an individual'srelationship to the problem may also be changing. The stories behind the problems alsoneed to be heard in order to unpack each young woman's understanding of theproblems, the connections between the two, along with their similarities and differences.In doing so, young women might start to get a clearer glimpse of what they need to do inorder to separate themselves from the problems.Some examples of the problems' interplay are as follows:A woman who defines her main problem as alcohol and drug use might noticethat when she is attempting to quit or enters treatment to address her substance misuseproblem, she begins to gain weight. Disordered eating thoughts or practices may alsoshow up as a way to lose the weight she is gaining in treatment. Or she might begin toimagine using substances for a week after she leaves the program in order to lose theweight she gained.As a young woman tries to stop purging, she notices that her substance usebegins to increase as a way to deal with uncomfortable feelings that are showing up as aresult of no longer purging. Not having access to other easily accessible means to copewith these feelings, substance misuse becomes a way of coping with uncomfortablefeelings. The opposite may also be true; another young woman might be in a substancemisuse program and is no longer using substances. For that young woman, disorderedeating practices, such as restricting or purging, might show up as a way to deal with43uncomfortable feelings that were previously numbed by substance misuse.A young woman uses amphetamines as it increases her short-term immediateproductivity and consequently begins to notice a loss of significant weight. When theamphetamine use begins to cause problems in her life and she stops using, she mightnotice weight gain, which might be upsetting, in which case she might resort toamphetamine use as a way to try to lose the weight.In conversations with young women, I have noticed that the ways the twoproblems might show up in a person's life can vary from person to person, and oneproblem might be described as being more problematic or more manageable than theother. Where this interplay begins and ends for each person is quite complex and thishighlights the importance of looking at the meaning of the problematic behaviour for theperson, its purpose, her understanding of it, and what she needs to do for the definedproblem to leave her life. In order to understand the interplay, we need to hear people'sstories\u2014unpack their understanding of the problem, their connections, similarities, anddifferences. In doing so we go beyond the behaviour and into the meaning or purpose ofthese problems in young women's lives. We are also taking into consideration the socialand cultural contexts of people's lives and how different situations can make space forcertain problems' appearances. As we pay attention to the relationship between the two,we create a linguistic space for something else to be seen, created, and known.The above discussion illustrates the need to create space to inquire about the twoproblems. Without such inquiry, one problem may remain underground, silently feedingthe other. Within traditional therapeutic frameworks, therapists are trained to addressone problem at a time, and therapists often specialize in one field, for example as44substance misuse counsellors, or as eating disorder counsellors. Yet traditionalassumptions about how to work with individuals struggling with both problems do notalways reflect the ways in which they live their lives, and the way that the problemworks in their lives. Accordingly, practitioners need to develop ways that reflect andrespect the complexities of their lives. In the following section, I will describe anarrative relational approach to working with disordered eating practices and substancemisuse that I have found to be helpful.The Narrative Re-authoring PerspectiveThis section describes the therapeutic approach I have used for the past ten yearsin my work as a therapist. I will describe the narrative approach, discuss externalizingpractices, and provide examples of externalizing conversations and questions. I willdiscuss the benefits as well as common critiques of the narrative approach.Narrative therapy originated through the work and ideas of David Epston andMichael White (White, 1989, 2007; White & Epston, 1990; Epston, 1988). The narrativeapproach is probably best known for the practice of externalizing internalized andoppressive problem discourses, a practice which is summarized as 'the person is not theproblem, the problem is the problem' (White & Epston, 1990). The narrative approachis also called a re-authoring approach (Myerhoff, 1986) to therapy (White & Epston,1990). Narrative ideas have a rich history and are rooted in \"feminist ideas; the ideas ofthe philosophers, and cultural historians, influences\" (Smith, 1997, p. 1).45Storying our worldAs the word narrative implies, a central tenant of the narrative approach is thatwe come to know ourselves and the surrounding world through the co-construction ofstories. This occurs through the stories we tell about ourselves and through the storiesothers tell about us. White and Epston (1990) have found the use of the text analogyhelpful to describe their approach. The text analogy (also referred to as the interpretivemethod) explores how people interpret events that have occurred in time and later go onto construe and ascribe meaning to these events (White & Epston, 1990; Bruner, 1996).It is through our \"lived experience\" (White & Epston, 1990, p. 9) that we come tounderstand and story our lives. Jerome Bruner (1996), who heavily influenced Whiteand Epston, writes \"human beings make sense of the world by telling stories about itby using the narrative mode for constructing reality\" (p. 130). The storying of ourlived experience is constructed across time in such as way that a reliable story linebegins to emerge allowing persons to have a sense of what might occur next in theirlives\u2014this soon becomes the dominant story of a person's life. Events that fit withinour dominant way of understanding ourselves are noticed, and events that fall outside ofour understanding, are often missed or ignored, as we may have no way to make senseof those events (Bruner, 1996).At times, these stories or dominant discourses can be problematic and oppressiveand constrain people from living their lives in preferred ways. Dominant problemdiscourses can be very restrictive in people's lives and can become totalizing andconstitutive of a person's identity, affecting the way that they see themselves. Peoplebegin to internalize stories that others tell about them and the stories that they, as a46result, begin to tell about themselves. When people internalize the problems that plaguethem they can begin to see themselves as the problem. Within the text analogy,problems are constructed as the \"performance of oppressive, dominant story [ies] orknowledge\" (White & Epston, 1990, p.6) and these problem stories become constitutiveof people's lives. Problems are discussed in such a way that a diagnosis of anorexia orsubstance abuse does not become superimposed on their identities. For example, 'she isstruggling with the problem of anorexia,' anorexic' disruptspotentially totalizing language practices.The interpretive method described above differs from the more commonlyaccepted modernist way of viewing persons. Gremillion (2003) writes, \"narrativetherapy is centered on the premise that persons' identities are always 'in the making'\"(p. 195) which differs greatly from the idea that we have static personalities whichremain consistent through time (Gergen, 1991). Cushman (1995) describes the \"currentconfiguration of the self [as] the masterful, bounded self of the twentieth century\" (p.28). People are viewed as self-contained individuals (Cushman) with their individualthoughts presumed to reside within their individual minds. From a modernistperspective, it is considered possible to have objective knowledge of others andourselves and possess \"essentialist knowledge of the world\" (Madigan & Goldner, 1998,p. 296). From this objective and essentialist space, therapists and professionals arebelieved to possess expert knowledge about the lives of their patients. This results inpeople being objectified and described as things (White, 1989). White writes:Within the context of these practices, persons are constructed as objects andencouraged to relate to themselves, to their bodies, and to other persons, as47objects. This is fixing and forming of persons. In Western societies, thesepractices of objectification are very pervasive (p. 22).These practices are so prevalent and far reaching that they are no longerquestioned by many\u2014they have acquired a truth status, (Foucault, 1989) privileged andelevated over other possible ways of knowing.Externalizing practicesOne way to counter these objectifying practices is through the use ofexternalization practices. Externalizing allows people to consider the impact that theproblem(s) has been having on their lives and relationships in a way that does not viewthe person as the problem. Externalizing practices are particularly useful when itappears that the person's identity has been defined by or co-opted by the problem(White, 2007). It is important to note that not all cases call for externalizing practicesas there are times when a person's sense of self has not been totalized by the problem.White maintains that \"externalizing conversations have opened many possibilities forpeople to redefine their identities, to experience their lives anew, and to pursue what isprecious to them\" (p. 59). By locating the problem outside of persons' bodies throughexternalizing practices we position people as being in relationship to these problems,rather than the problems being located internally (White & Epston, 1990). Externalizingpractices can be liberating for the clients we work with, as they enable clients to holdonto the knowing that they are more than a 'sick' person. Clients are viewed as being inrelationship with the problem, rather than totalized or labelled as the problem (Bird,2000, 2004).Externalizing conversations create linguistic space (Bird, 2000) between person48and problem, allowing us \"to objectify and at times personify the problems that theyexperience as oppressive\" (White & Epston, 1990, p. 38). This shift is as Tom Andersen(1991) proposes, just different enough to do something different in the conversation.One of the first steps in externalizing is turning the problem into a noun, which locatesthe problem outside of the individual thereby externalizing previously internalizedproblem discourses. Once the problem has been 'named' and 'externalized,' it ispossible to become curious about the person's relationship with the problem, the historyof the relationship with the problem, and the effects that the problem has had on anindividual's life. Through the personification and externalization of problems, therapistscan explore the tactics, strategies, and promises the problem uses in an attempt to takeover and devastate a person's life.The following is an excerpt from a conversation in the book Biting the hand thatstarves you: inspiring resistance to anorexia/bulimia (Maisel, Epston, David Epston externalizes anorexia with 15-year-old young woman namedRiannon. Epson demonstrates how through the personification and externalizing ofanorexia, he learns how anorexia operates in Riannon's life. David: Can I just ask you why you think it is that anorexia tricks people intogoing to their death thinking they're feeling fine? Why do you think that is?What purpose would it have in getting you to go to your death smiling? Mostpeople go to their death upset or opposing it, especially when they are beingmurdered, don't they?Riannon: Yeah...David: I've wondered about this..., and you're probably wondering about it too.49Probably it is confusing all of us right now. How can anyone be on death row andnot know it? How is anorexia telling you that you're feeling fine when, in fact, itcould kill you at any moment?Riannon: Well, I've got energy.David: How is anorexia fooling you into that? You're on death row and everyoneknows that except you, although you know it sometimes when you take our wordfor it (p. 102).Maisel, Epston and Borden (2004) describe this way of talking as anti-anorexictalk as it takes a firm position against anorexia and for the life of the person. Throughexternalizing conversations we are able to get to know the intentions that problems havefor people's lives, and the lived effects that these problems have in their lives.Colin Sanders (1998) provides a series of questions that therapists can use toexplore the influences and effects of substances on a person's life. I am including thesequestions to further demonstrate the types of questions that can be used to externalizeproblems in therapeutic conversations. Sander's writes:Does it sometimes appear to you that drugs are ripping you off?Could you describe some of the ways in which drugs are doing this too you?Are there specific situations or contexts in your life that drugs are more likely totake advantage of?Would you agree that valuable time has been stolen from you bycocaine/pot/heroin, etc? (p. 157).In externalizing anorexia and substance misuse, both Epston (as cited in Biting theHand that Starves You: Inspiring Resistance to Anorexia/Bulimia by Maisel, Epston &50Borden, 2004) and Sanders (1998) create space for the effects that these problems havebeen causing in people's lives to become visible. When the real effects of theseproblems are visible, people can form an opinion about the impact that these problemshave been having on their lives. Through this process people often notice that they areno longer living in line with their values and preferences of how they wish to be in theworld.It is important to note that just because people recognize that they are not living inline with their preferences for how they wish to be acting or living, this does not implythat change will occur immediately. This process takes time. Often people understandexactly where the problems are leading them, yet they 'don't care' or they have losthope that change is possible. It can sometimes take a long time for the problem to getout of the way long enough for care to show up. We may need to stay here for a while(maybe a long while), really mapping out and getting to know the ways in whichproblems work in a person's lives, all the while listening for exceptions to the problemstory (White & Epston, 1990). It is my experience that if we skip ahead too fast,perhaps trying to move the client to a place they are not yet able to get to, that thecontradictions in the problem's story that are always present will be written off as flukesor one-offs, rather than reflecting alternative possibilities.Alternate StoriesWhen the problem's effects on the life and relationship of the person have beenfully mapped out, space is opened for the \"authoring of alternate stories\" (White &Epston, 1990, p. 6). It now becomes possible to talk about the person's influence on thelife of the problem. An alternate or preferred story can be co-created by the therapist51and the person; a story in which the person's strengths are remembered, as well as theway in which the person would prefer to act in the world. The story tells about timeswhen the person acted against the problem, the times when the problem may not bearound, and about the person's hopes and dreams for their future. White and Epston,borrowing from Goffman (1961) refer to these developments as unique outcomes, whichbegins to create an alternate story. Questions that trace the history of these uniqueoutcomes can be explored, further enriching this story, and prompting newdevelopments in the person's life. In this way, people's lives are re-authored.Narrative therapy has developed creative ways to thicken (Geertz, 1973) uniqueoutcomes which strengthens the meaning persons attach to these unique outcomes andfacilitates the re-storying of people's lives by such & theVancouver Anti-Anorexia/Anti-bulimia League (Grieves, 1997); counter documentsand certificates (White & Epston). A Socio-Political ApproachNarrative therapy is a socio-political approach that is concerned with ideas ofsocial justice and injustice. It does not assume a neutral position. It is political in that thenarrative approach brings to light the power practices that create and sustain people'sproblems and subsequent oppression. The Just Therapy Team (Waldegrave, Tamasese,Tuhaka & Campbell, 2003) stress that therapists have a responsibility to address issuessuch as poverty, racism, homophobia, and the contributions they make to the problemsclients face. When these issues are overlooked, therapists are positioned to inadvertentlyhelp their clients be happy or content to live in unjust conditions (Waldegrave,52Tamasese, Tuhaka & Campbell).In my experience, it is helpful to view disordered eating practices and substancemisuse within their larger dominant socio-political and cultural contexts and discourses,rather than as fixed entities that reside within a person. As Bruner (1990), quotingGeertz, writes, \"there is no such thing as human nature independent from culture\"(p.12). Traditional therapy practices individualize and locate the problem withinpersons, which serves to decontextualize both the person and problem (Madigan &Goldner, 1998). For example, locating anorexia inside of a young woman suggests thatthere is something defective within her or her personality that requires fixing.The narrative approach is quick to point out that people do not create the ideas thatare oppressing them, and works to locate 'problems' in institutions of power rather thanas pathology located within people. This approach takes into account that people'sstories are affected and influenced by their larger social context and \"politics of localrelationship, as well as the larger social politics of gender, class, professional andinstitutional dominance\" (Wylie, 1994, p. 44). For example, when considering theproblem of anorexia, the narrative approach allows us to consider the powerful culturaltraining and pressures young women receive regarding ideas of thinness, beauty,perfection, gender, and being a person for others, in a cultural context where thinness isrevered. To overlook the effects of gender, culture, sexuality, class, and racism is seenas being an injustice to the work and to people's lives. In becoming curious about thecontribution that the larger dominant cultural discourse has on anorexia, a therapist may,for example, ask their client, \"Why do you think it is that more young women strugglewith anorexia than young men?\"53Narrative therapy and powerThe narrative approach pays careful attention to the power relationship intherapeutic relationships. In traditional approaches, the therapist is positioned as anexpert on the client's life. However, in the narrative and collaborative approaches, thetherapist is viewed as an expert in facilitating therapeutic conversations (White &Epston, 1990; Anderson & Goolishian, 1992). Rather then working to erase power,power is rendered visible by asking permission to ask certain questions, letting clientsknow they can choose not to answer questions, asking clients permission to take notes,and letting clients read these notes and the notes contained in the clients' files, lettingclients know they can choose to end therapy at anytime, letting the clients decide thedirection of therapy, and respecting that the client knows what is best for his or her life(Madsen, 1999).In terms of specific treatment practices, Gremillion (2003), has writtenextensively about the need for therapists to pay careful attention to the possibility ofreplicating power and gender practices within disordered eating treatment services. Sheargues that, \"mainstream therapies participate unwittingly in historically specific,dominant cultural discourses of gender, individualism, physical fitness and family lifethat help constitute anorexia's conditions of possibility\" (p. xv). She maintains thattraditional therapies for eating disorders, with their focus on body weight, surveillancepractices of weighing and measuring (food portions and young women's bodies) and thereplication of traditional gender practices between doctors, nurses, psychiatrists andtherapists, inadvertently reproduce and replicate some of the very practices that anorexiauses in the lives of young women. For example, anorexia thrives on body surveillance,54control, and a preoccupation with food/exercise, measuring/weighing practices, andcomparison with others. Treatment programs often reproduce these elements in thename of helping clients get better, thus reinforcing anorexic practices (Maisel, Epston,& Borden, 2004). Comparison and competition can also be inadvertently encouragedsimply by the diagnosis that young women receive. The diagnosis of anorexia is oftengiven a higher status than bulimia by disordered eating sufferers (Grieves, 1997)Michael White (1986) has discussed how young women with anorexiainadvertently surrender \"the responsibility for the supervision of their lives to others\"(p.72). He continues, \"If freedom has to do with choice, these women experienceincreasing oppression as they become more 'taken over' by those around them and bythe symptoms of anorexia nervosa\" (p. 72). While White is referring to the increasedresponsibility that families begin to assume in the lives of a young woman whenanorexia is refusing to let their daughter eat, the same oppression occurs when therapistsand treatment centres act as if they know best for the young woman's life. Ali Borden(2007), building on White's work, writes:...treatment programs specifically can be critiqued as constituting another call toperpetual effort of self improvement and named as another powerful opportunityfor clients to scrutinize themselves for inadequacies and deficiencies and engagein the consistent and 'necessary' work to improve one's body, mind and selfalong these pre-determined lines of health (p. 39).I suggest that the same argument can be made for persons entering substancemisuse treatment centres to learn how to properly engage in life, that is, without the useof substances. In most substance misuse programs it is assumed that one must abstain55from substances entirely in order to improve. Abstinence is promoted and encouragedover practices of drinking in moderation or harm reduction (Peele, 1995).Responses to Common Critiques of the Narrative ApproachThere have been some critiques of the narrative approach which I feel should beaddressed as they help alleviate the same criticism of my work. One common critique isthat the externalization of problems places people in passive positions where they havelittle or no control over their own actions. It is also suggested that, through theexternalization process, therapists overlook the fact that people are often resistingsomething through their use of the problem. It is overlooked that through the problem,young women are gaining a sense of control over themselves and their lives. Thiscritique is especially common where narrative practices of externalization have beenused when working with persons experiencing the problem of eating disorders(Vitousek, 2005; Brown, 2007). As Brown says:What is so evidently missed here is that anorexia is protest: It is not justcompliance. So committed is this approach [narrative therapy] to rescuingwomen from their compliance, their victimhood, it negates the complex,multiple, and contradictory stories of anorexic body talk (p. 285).These writers suggest that people are placed in dichotomous positions of goodand bad, people good and the problems bad.It is my understanding that externalization practices can and do co-exist withagency. By engaging in externalizing practices I am not suggesting that people have nocontrol or are victims in their lives. I recognize that people choose to engage indisordered eating and substance misuse practices. These are choices that people make,56often to feel better, or to cope, and they may offer them something that they cannototherwise find. I believe that we can externalize problems while at same time enquiringabout the ways that these problems did or continue to 'help them out.'Yet people are in different positions in regards to choice (Elliott, 1998). Forexample, when a young woman begins to experiment with alcohol she may do that outof curiosity, for fun, or because this is what her friends are doing. Should that sameyoung woman continue to choose to drink on a regular basis, she may, in the long term,develop a problem with alcohol. The longer she chooses to drink, the more problemsthis may begin to cause in her life. For example, the drinking that once occurred onlyon weekend nights, may begin to spill over into weeknights, which begins to affect herability to go to school and her grades may drop. The drinking may begin to get her intotrouble with her parents, and teachers, and as a result, she may have more 'reasons' todrink. Drinking may no longer be a way to connect with friends and to have fun, itmight begin to serve the purpose of making her feel better. The methods she previouslyused to cope with difficulties may no longer seem available to her. For example, if sheused to confide in her mother as a way to work through problems, this may no longerseem like an option if her mom is 'mad at her' because of her drinking, skipping school,and lying. Drinking may become a way to 'forget' about her problems, yetparadoxically the more she drinks, the more problems are created. She may begin tocrave alcohol, and she may begin to feel better if she has a drink. Thus the choice tochoose to not drink is no longer as easy as it once was when she first began toexperiment with alcohol.57I believe that it is in this way that people's choices to engage with 'the problem'becomes limiting. The problem of alcohol, in this example, begins to exert its owncontrol over the young women and begins to control and limit the choices that areavailable. Quitting drinking is no longer as easy when you are kicked out of school, donot have a routine, all your friends drink, and your body has developed a tolerance toalcohol. Therapists can enquire about how drinking makes sense for these youngwomen and 'helps them out' while also enquiring about how it begins to play such alarge role in their lives. Externalizing problems while at same time enquiring about theways that these problems did or continue to help them out will give us better insight inthe issues at hand and will enable us to honour the complexity of the problems and ofthe young women's lives.Michael White (2007) addresses these critiques and writes:It has at times been assumed that externalizing conversations are complicit witha trend toward constructing people as autonomous units of thought and action. Itis my hope that I have given sufficient illustration of the practices ofexternalizing conversations to dispel this assumption. These practices make itpossible for people not only to redefine their relationship with the problems oftheir lives, but also to redefine their relationships with each other in ways thatacknowledge each other's voices in the development of their sense of identity.(p. 59).White (1989) describes how people are able to take more responsibility for theirlives through the externalizing process. Through externalizing practices, the effects thatthe problem has been having on a person's life becomes clearer, and people are able to58counteract these practices in a way that they were unable to before the problems tacticsand effects were unveiled (White). In this way, the young woman's responsibility forher actions is increased rather than decreased.Another critique is the idea that metaphors of warring or fighting are commonlyused to describe the process needed for young women to achieve some space from theproblems (Brown, 2007). Brown states that, within the narrative approach, therapists\"are determined to situate women's struggles with anorexia and bulimia within agendered social context. All wish to encourage women to claim power back over theirlives by fighting back against or resisting the power of anorexia or bulimia\" (p. 283). Insome cases a strong position against these problems is warranted, as there are timeswhen people describe, fighting for their lives in regards to substance misuse anddisordered eating (White, 2007).Maisel, Epston and Borden (2004), clarify their position:...when we talk about 'fighting' a/b, we do not mean fighting in the sense ofdefeating or conquering. A/b cannot be conquered, but it can be foiled. Whenwe speak of fighting a/b, we mean resisting it and eventually finding ways ofescaping or disengaging from it (p. 144).Given the power that anorexia has over and in young women's lives,externalizing practice help counter the powerful pathologizing impact of internalizedproblem discourses (Gremillion, 2003). White has also spoken to this concern thatwarring or fighting metaphors are commonly used in his work, for example encouragingpeople to 'stand up to problems.' White reviewed his work and found that in only a few59case examples has he used these metaphors, and that in most cases the client hadintroduced the metaphor themselves (2007).In ClosingIn closing this chapter I discussed the relational features of disorderedeating practices and substance misuse, as well as the narrative approach and the conceptof externalizing. Narrative therapy has been referred to as an alternative to themainstream approaches of therapy, aligning itself with postmodern and socialconstruction understandings of the world rather then modernist or scientific paradigms.Given that the narrative practices of personification and externalization are foundthroughout the dissertation it was important to discuss these concepts. Without thisbackground the reader may have found the dissertation difficult to read, as for thoseunfamiliar with the narrative approach, people often describe finding it an odd way oftalking about people and problems. This speaks to the insidiousness of the modernistway of thinking\u2014how locating problems as inside of individuals and as pathology hasbecome second nature. As a way to bring to life the complexity of the interplay betweensubstance misuse and disordered eating practices, I thought that it would be helpful toillustrate this by way of eavesdropping on an imaginary conversation between substancemisuse and disordered eating. In this conversation you will hear how the problems ofsubstance misuse and disordered eating befriend each other and begin to be in cohootswith one another. Scheming together they try to drive a young woman into the ground.In hearing the inner workings of the problems and the ways that they can converse witheach other you will have a richer understanding of the relational features the problemsshare, which will add depth to your reading of this dissertation. This fictional60conversation is a compilation of young women's experiences with both problems that Ihave been told over the years as a therapist. If it bears resemblance to your ownexperience or that of someone you know it is purely coincidental while also speaking tothe similarities in the ways the problems operate in people's lives.Substance misuse: Well I'm sure you've heard, Georgia's parents are forcingher to go to a treatment program to deal with what everyone is calling her drugproblem. But she doesn't even have a problem. She knows it and I know it.Disordered eating: Of course I've heard. I know everything that's going on inher life.Substance misuse: I'm trying to talk her out of it of course. I've told her thatI'm the only one that really cares for her, and the proof is that her parents areplanning to ship her off to treatment. I think they just want to get rid of her. I'vebeen telling her to look around at the friends she hangs out with, some of thosepeople are way worse off than she is. She's only having fun! Apparently theschool is saying that if she is caught one more time being high at school she'll bekicked out. Her parents are livid, and they are threatening her that she'll have tomove out if she doesn't stop using me and go to treatment. Can you believe it?Luckily her parent's actions are working in my favour. I keep telling her \"Seeno body understands you like I do,\" \"even your parents are trying to get rid ofyou.\" But she's been talking back to me lately, telling me she hates me, that Iruined her life. I just keep telling her about all the good times we've had, thefun, the parties, the friends, the highs....61Disordered eating: I don't know what's gotten into her either. Lately she hasbeen eating like a pig. I think its since she's been trying to cut back on thedrugs. Whatever it is she is looking fat these days. I keep telling her that she isnot gonna have any friends if she keeps gaining weight. She is gonna lookdisgusting.Substance misuse: There is no way that she will be able to quit me. She is notstrong enough to do that. But I feel like I am starting to loose my grip on her.We can't let her go to the treatment program. The bunch of losers there willwant her to kick us both out of her life.Disordered eating: Well I don't have to worry about myself. She never tellsanyone about me, I'm like her dirty little secret. She'd be too ashamed forpeople to know that the only reason she can fit into her jeans is because of me. Ifit wasn't for me she'd have been laughed out of school for being the fat kid. I'mthe only reason she has any friends. She won't say anything about me.Substance misuse: What? You're trying to take the credit for her weight? That'sme, that's all me. I work way better at keeping weight off than you, everyoneknows that. People forget about food when I'm around, it makes them sick.You are too much work, people think about eating all the time, planning whatthey would eat if you'd let them, planning how to avoid eating. In fact youshould thank me. Some people who might never have thought about you start towhen they see what I can do for them.Disordered eating: No. You have it all wrong. You should thank me. Youngwomen start out losing weight because of me, and then they find out about you62and I'll admit it you can make the weight come off pretty quick. But anywaysafter they are done with drugs they tend to stick with me. Most women in theworld are on a diet.Substance misuse: This could go on forever and we don't have that kinda time.Right now we might have to work together to ensure that we don't loose her.Disordered eating: What? Now you wanna be friends with me? I'll rememberthis when you are trying to take the credit for killing her.Substance misuse: Here's the plan, when she goes into treatment I'll try toconvince her to sneak some drugs in with her- just in case she decides she can'thandle it without me. Plus maybe they'll catch her with them and she'll bethrown out. Wouldn't that be the best? Getting kicked out of treatment! She'dneed to use a ton of me then to ease that shame. Once she is in there we'll just dolike we've always done. The counsellors at the treatment program are going toforce her to eat three meals a day there, and she is obviously going to be hungrygiven that she has been consuming more drugs than food lately. She'll startgaining weight pretty soon into the program.Disordered eating: And that's where I come in. Soon she will notice that herclothes are not fitting like they used to. Then she won't be able to fit into herpants. I can have her agonizing over her body in the mirror, staring at the rollsof fat pouring over the tops of her jeans. But luckily I can solve all that. She'lljust have to gain some control over her huge appetite and begin to restrict hermeals. Or she could always start purging- no one there would catch on to that.63Substance misuse: And if her weight doesn't get her back to you, my guess isthat she'll need some way to deal with all the memories of all the shit she hasdone over the past couple years.Disordered eating: Yeah I've got many ways to help her out with that, purgingbeing one of them. I can keep her so focused on her unhappiness with her bodythat she won't have any time to think of any thing else but me.Substance misuse: Perfect! If she is preoccupied thinking about her weight ortrying to not eat, she'll miss most of what they are trying to teach her intreatment. She'll be way too distracted to get anything out of it, which will makeit much easier for me to sneak back into her life once she's done treatment(that's if she can even finish the program). That's where we can really startworking together. I'll start telling her that all she has to do when she leavestreatment is to use me for like a week and then she'll be happy with her body.Disordered eating: Perfect, then I'll tell her that once all that weight's off she canjust start going to the gym, and be healthy. They always fall for that.Disordered eating and substance misuse: Excellent! She won't have seen thiscoming and she won't even know what hit her!64CHAPTER 3 THE HISTORICAL CONTEXTThis chapter traces the history of substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices. In tracing their rich and varied histories we begin to see the manytransformations that our understanding of these problems have gone through. Itbecomes clear that our present day concepts of anorexia/bulimia and substance abusebear little resemblance to that of our ancestors' experience of the same phenomena. Thischapter demonstrates the changes in our understanding of concepts of self, illness, andsocially acceptable behaviours over time. This chapter is broken into three sections. Inthe first section, I trace the history and emergence of the phenomena we now know aseating disorders. In the second sections I sketch the history of substance misuse. Thethird and final section examines these problems together looking at the historicalsimilarities and differences that exist between the two.Eating DisordersBrumberg (2000) writes, \"The story of anorexia nervosa lays bare the extent towhich disease is a cultural artifact, defined and refined over time, and thereforeillustrative of fundamental historical transformations\" (p. 6). This section will describesome of these historical and cultural shifts in an attempt to demonstrate the extent towhich anorexia is, in fact, a cultural artifact, and also to illustrate how our response to itor treatment of it varies depending on the way in which it is constructed.65Medieval EuropeAlthough anorexia nervosa attracted medical attention and was formally namedin the 1870s, women's food refusal can be traced back to Medieval European times(Brumberg, 2000; Bell, 1985; Bynum, 1987). As early as 1200 AD, women's foodrefusal and fasting is documented. For example, Catherine of Siena (1347-1380) wassaid to eat \"only a few handfuls of herbs each day,\" (Brumberg, p. 43) and she wouldoften eat twigs to make herself throw up if she was forced to eat. In the Roman CatholicChurch, fasting was a practice women used as an expression of their piety. \"Themedieval women's capacity for survival without eating meant that she found other formsof food: prayer provided sustenance, as did the Christian Eucharist\u2014the body and bloodof Christ\u2014ingested as wafer and wine\" (Brumberg, p. 44). Fasting was commonlyunderstood as a devotional practice and was as such supported in the Medieval Era(Brumberg). During fasts, Medieval women often experienced visions, and during thesevisions women frequently reported being fed by \"eucharistic food\" (Bynum, p. 131).The intent of this self induced starvation was not to become thin, in fact a plump bodywas considered the ideal as it showed one's elevated social standing. Instead this self-induced starvation signified one's dedication to God, and demonstrated the importanceof the spirit of the body, and over the flesh.The Protestant Reformation and 17th and 18th CenturiesIn the 16th Century, during the Protestant Reformation, some of the practicescentral to the Roman Catholic religion were called into question, such as praying toSaints and fasting. These were considered practices of the devil. Yet cases of femaleself-starvation continued, as can be seen in the story of Saint Veronica in the 17th66century. She was said to fast for three days at a time, and then \"on Fridays permittedherself to chew on five orange seeds, in memory of the five wounds of Jesus\"(Brumberg, 2000, p. 43). During the 17th and 18th centuries, physicians began to refer \"toperiods of prolonged fasting or 'self starvation' as, anorexia mirabilis (miraculouslyinspired loss of appetite)\" (Brumberg, p. 44). As stories of women surviving on little tono food persisted, there was an increased need from the medical profession toauthenticate these cases.Questions were being raised as to how these women were able to survive withouteating for prolonged periods of time, or by abstaining from eating altogether (Brumberg,2000). Entrusting the how to faith or miracles no longer satisfied the newly emergingmedical professions. Physicians and the clergy were deemed the appropriate agents todetermine the authenticity of a person's fast. Typically these authentications consisted ofwatching the fasting patient 24 hours a day for weeks on end to determine if they wereindeed surviving without food. These authentications often ended with the discoverythat the patient was being kept alive by consuming very small amounts of food or drinksbrought to them by their family members (Brumberg). In some cases young womendied of starvation during these watches, and a number of fraudulent cases resulted in theyoung women being condemned to die (Brumberg).The 19th Century: Anorexia is namedThe late 19th century was a time of medical discovery. Diseases were beginningto be named and classified and it was during this time that anorexia nervosa was itselfnamed as a new disease. As a way to increase understanding amongst physicians,anorexia nervosa was distinguished from other diseases that also had lack or loss of67appetite as a symptom. Anorexia was seen as separate from 'lunacy' and physicians'treatments tended to occur at the young women's homes or private hospitals, as opposedto asylums where the poor tended to be housed and treated. Private physicians enjoyedspecial status treating young women from middle to upper classes, where cases ofanorexia were most common.In the late 19th century, cases of fasting girls continued, and improvements in theprinting press made it possible for cases to be widely and rapidly published for bothphysicians and the general public. Cases such as Sarah Jacob and Mollie Fancher werewell known and attracted much attention, often in the form of pilgrimages to the youngwomen's houses (Brumberg, 2000). These fasting girls continued to generate a conflictbetween science and religion, as their ability to sustain life without food seemed to defylogic.In 19th century Victorian England, anorexia was typically seen as a formof hysteria, a nervous disorder13. The etiology of the word hysteria is derivedfrom the Greek word, 'hustera' which means womb (Soanes, 2001, p. 445-6).According to Greek physicians hysteria was thought to be \"a rising of thewomb\" (Burstow, 1992, p. 26). One of the believed causes of hysteria was a lackof sex, which resulted in the uterus drying up and then floating upwards, whichcaused fits, convulsions, weakness, muteness, and melancholy. Puberty wasthought to be an especially risky period for the development of hysteria, as wasany demanding intellectual pursuit, since women presenting with hysterias wereregularly noted to be of strong intellect (Bordo, 2003). The treatment for hysteria 13 \"Hysteria..., neurasthenia, and anorexia...were three recognized Victorian ills of the middle and upperclasses\" (Cushman, 1995, p. 103).68was often what caused it in the first place: isolation, rest, and a limit on mentalstimulation, work, or study. Hysteria was a gendered and class basedphenomenon; it was not seen among the poor, males, or working class females.Femininity became linked with hysteria, illustrating patriarchy's power to definewomen by their biology (Mitchell, 1974; Foucault, 1978). This illustrates howour understanding of problems such as anorexia and hysteria are shaped andconstructed by historical and cultural contexts, and the extent to which thesedisorders are mere cultural constructions (Malson, 1998; Bordo).In the nineteenth century, women's dress in high Victorian society was asrestrictive as the rules surrounding women's behaviour. Waists were tightly corsetedseverely limiting movement. Occupational choices for upper and middle class womenwere very restricted, making them economically dependent on men (Cushman, 1995).For the most part, women were considered possessions and their value was increasinglyintertwined with their appearance and home making skills (Hesse-Biber, 2007). Inaccordance with what was considered desirable at the time, a frail, subservient, andattractive woman stood a good chance of finding a husband. Hesse-Biber, citinghistorian Helen E. Roberts, writes, \"In an age when alternatives to marriage for womenwere grim and good husbands scarce, the pressures to conform to the submissive idealthat men demanded were enormous\" (p. 39). As men and women's lives divided intobreadwinner and homemaker, and women were forced into the domestic sphere,advertisers began directing their ads towards women who were quickly becoming the\"primary consumers\" (Hesse-Biber, p. 40). Women could purchase items for their homeand the latest beauty products, promising self-improvement and increased femininity69(Hesse-Biber; Cushman). Consumption soon became linked with salvation (Cushman),and manufacturing businesses quickly recognized that \"as long as a woman viewed herbody as an object, she was controllable and profitable\" (Hesse-Biber, p. 40).In 1873 the French physician Lasegue (1873) used the term hysterical anorexiato describe anorexia is his paper, \"Del'anorexie hysterique.\" He details the pressuresthat upper and middle class girls faced and the way in which these pressures maycontribute to the development of hysterical anorexia. He illustrated the power that foodrefusal had within the context of Victorian England homes, where family life oftencentred on meal times. A young girl who refused to eat would have caused majordistress at meals. In Victorian England, young women of the upper and middles classeswere discouraged from eating large amounts, and a delicate appetite was encouraged, asa women's appetite, thinness, and frailty was equated with her class standing, morals,and ability to marry into a respectable family of high standing (Brumberg, 2000).Appetite was also tied to sexuality, eating meat was discouraged among females as itwas thought to generate heat within the body, and a voracious appetite was reflective ofone's sexual attitude. With this understanding of food in Victorian society, as well asthe lack of possible outlets for women's distress and unhappiness, food refusal becamean especially powerful form of protest14 during this time period (Bynum, 1987).Cushman (1995) writes:Physical symptoms were one of the few avenues of expression availableto women within the Victorian terrain: where else could women expressthe restrictions and frustrations of their roles but in the body, that realm 14 The idea of food refusal as protest will be expanded upon later in this chapter.70wholly identified with, and expressive of, their \"untamed\" nature? (p.104).Malson describes how \"'the hysterical woman' or anorexic woman'parodies the deeply embedded gender ideologies that devalue women, insisting that weinhabit a dependent and restricted social role\" (p. 21).In 1873, shortly after the publication of Lasegue's paper, anorexia nervosa wasclassified as a diagnosis by British physician, Sir William Withey Gull (Brumberg,2000).15 The classification was based on Gull's work with upper and middle class youngwomen. According to Brumberg, Gullconceived of anorexia nervosa as a coherent disease entity distinct fromstarvation among the insane, and unrelated to organic diseases such astuberculosis, diabetes, or cancer...this disease had a specific clientele: youngwomen between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three (p. 110).Both Lasegue's and Gull's descriptions of anorexia had at the centre a youngwomen who would not eat and who exhibited \"low body temperature, amenorrhea andhyperactivity\" (Brumberg, 2000, p. 160).Treatment for anorexia consisted of bed rest and feeding at regular intervals. Itwas preferred that the girl's family not be responsible for the feeding, and, if possible, itwas considered best for the youth to be separated from her family, her care entrusted toa nurse until her health was regained. Young women were considered cured when theyhad regained weight. Young women were often fed by force with a stomach pump ifthey refused to eat. Being force-fed is an inherently violating act. In the case of using a 15 Even though anorexia was named in the 1870s, \"until the 1920s and 1930s ...American doctors usedthe two terms almost interchangeably: 'hysterical anorexia' (a reference to a neurological conception) andanorexia nervosa\" (Brumberg, 2000, p. 109).71stomach pump, the use of the benign word feeding minimizes the force involved in theact of being fed in this manner16 (Coates & Wade, 2007). These methods show howyoung women were not seen as autonomous individuals, instead decisions for their careand treatment were left up to others. Underlying the anorexia nervosa (as with hysteria)was believed to be an irrational longing for attention and sympathy. This interpretationbasically negates all potential claims at distress that a young woman was making, andlocated the distress as originating within the women themselves.The 20th CenturyPhysicians continued to search for possible biological explanations for women'sfood refusal and in 1914, the discovery of Simmond's disease was used to explain awoman's lack of appetite (Brumberg, 2000). A deterioration of the anterior lobe of thepituitary gland was thought to be the cause of Simmond's disease (Brumberg).Treatments consisted of giving patients hormones with the hope of stimulating theirappetites. Though this was later disproved and Simmond's disease was found to berelatively rare, the search for biological causes and hormonal treatments for anorexianervosa continued into the 1920s and 1930s.The Flapper EraIn the Flapper Era of the 1920s there was a societal emphasis on thinness as theboyish look of the flapper took center stage. Transgressing traditional gender roles, 16 Today woman are force-fed using nasal gastric tubes. This is a procedure that can be live saving, and inextreme cases of malnourishment necessary to keep someone alive. Maisel, Epston & Borden (2004)describe how \"when the will of the treatment team is imposed upon the person, violations of spirit arebound to occur. At times these impositions may be necessary to save a life (p.279). In their book \"Bitingthe Hand that Starves You\" they offer suggestions for how to proceed in the most respectful way possibleshould it be deemed necessary that a person be hospitalized or tube-fed (Maisel, et. al.).72women's breasts were bound, hemlines raised and hairstyles became shorter and freer.These acts of resistance were part of women's on-going attempts to challenge the longlists of behaviors that were deemed unacceptable for women such as drinking and casualsex. They were also a response to the hegemonic policing of women's bodies and desires(Gramsci, 1971). Standardized ready-to-wear clothing was also introduced during thisperiod, which meant that women's bodies were now required to fit the clothing,compared to having clothing tailor-made to fit an individual woman's body. Womenwith larger bodies were at a disadvantage and often unable to fit into the newly arrivingcollections of fashionable clothes (Brumberg, 2000).Though psychoanalysis was developed in the late 1800s it did not actually takehold until the 1930s when the medical field's interest in exploring endocrinologicallyand biologically based reasons for anorexia waned (Brumberg, 2000). In the late 1800s,Sigmund Freud and Pierre Janet began talking to their patients in hope of uncovering theemotional reasons for the development of anorexia. \"Freud posed the importantconceptual question that had not been asked before: What does the anorectic's lack ofappetite mean?\" (Brumberg, p. 212). Of course, given the time period and socialcontext in which they lived, Janet and Freud based their theories of anorexia in ideas ofsexuality. It is important to note that Freud is one of the first theorists to consider theimportance of the symbolism involved in food refusal and thinness. He discussed howmany of his patients described being fearful of the fat that accumulated on theirstomach, hips, and breasts\u2014areas that are typically seen as defining characteristics of awoman's body (Bordo, 2003). In this way, women were resisting their own bodies bydieting and food refusal (Bordo).73In the 1930s and 1940s, Freud's theories of anorexia as a psychosexualdysfunction were brought to the forefront. Psychiatrists linked anorexia to theunconscious and sexuality, claiming among other things, that anorexia was an attempt tohold onto a small, childlike body, and a fear of oral impregnation (Brumberg, 2000;Gremillion, 2003). Psychiatrists agreed that, for a patient to recover, she needed to gainweight as well as undergo psychotherapy to discover the reasons behind her refusal toeat (Brumberg). During this period, psychiatrists began to talk about an 'anorexicpersonality,'\u2014women who had anorexia were found to be intelligent, willful, driven,introspective (Brumberg). Here we see the beginning of the diagnosis of anorexiabecoming fixed to the young woman's identities. Freud's theories continued to beinfluential up until the 1950s when people began to move away from the heavy focus onpsychosexual stages and instinctual drives, and toward the behavioral approaches thatbecame popular are still in use today (Gremillion, 2003).The SixtiesIn the 1960s, anorexia was characterized by an intense focus on thinness, and anaversion or fear of becoming fat (Malson, 1998). Twiggy, a 97-pound British fashionmodel, emulated the fashion style of the sixties, and became a fashion icon to many ofher generation (Hesse-Biber, 2007). Interestingly the pressure to conform to a slenderbody occurred as women were beginning to take up more space in the public sphere,attending university and working out of the home (Hesse-Biber). Anorexia was still notwell known by the general population, yet around this time there began to be an increasein the number of patients diagnosed with anorexia. Hilde Bruch (1973) revolutionizedthe ways in which eating disorders were treated when she detailed the meaning behind74food behavior and its relationship to the development of women diagnosed withanorexia. As a result of her conversations with hundreds of women and professionals,she described anorexia as a longing to be thin coupled with the feeling of being fat. Psychiatry began to recognize that anorexic patients were not suffering from alack of appetite; in fact they were denying their appetite in spite of their hunger. Bytalking with their patients, they realized the extent that patients were going to in ordernot to eat and avoid food. Bruch also linked under-consumption and excessive foodconsumption together, describing them both as diseases in need of treatment (Brumberg,2000). The increased number of patients diagnosed with anorexia during this time hasbeen linked with the abundance of food and food choices, coupled with 'norms' for howthe female body should look. In the 1970s, in addition to body size standards forwoman, there was also an emphasis on health and fitness. Women were not only to bethin but also fit and toned, which placed more pressure and responsibility for theshaping of their bodies. Women's bodies began to become sites of prescription wherehegemony was scripted onto the bodies of women (Foucault, 1979; Diamond &Quimby, 1988). Treatment during this time centered on weight gain, and was based inbehaviorist approaches using both positive and negative behavioral reinforcements toattain the desired treatment outcome (Gremillion, 2003). Once an individual's weightwas stabilized, cognitive/behavioral, family therapy or psychotherapy could commence.Capitalism and patriarchy joined forces further commodifying women's bodiesas a product and, by the 1980s, dieting had become a common practice to the extent thatover five billion dollars was spent on dieting, exercise, and weight loss regimes(Brumberg, 2000). Cushman (1995), citing Lears, writes how \"the influence of75advertising... has had a negative effect on the feminist movement, preoccupying womenwith the perfectionist pursuit of cleanliness in the middle class home and the ambitiouspursuit of a life a glamour in the celebrity spotlight\" (p. 69). Singer Karen Carpenter'sdeath in 1983 from anorexia spurred a new awareness of the disease and for the firsttime, anorexia became known outside the medical profession.Present day understandingsCurrent \"lifetime prevalence estimates of DSM-IVR anorexia nervosa, and binge eating disorder are .9%, 1.5%, and 3.5% among women, and .3%.5%, and 2.0% among men\" (Hudson, et. al., 2007). The main criteria for eatingdisorders, specified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IVR (APA, 2000), definesdifferent features for anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and eating disorders not otherwisespecified.The following features define Anorexia Nervosa:Table 3 Features of Anorexia NervosaA. Refusal to maintain body weight at or above 85% of normal weight for ageand height.B. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight, shape or size isexperienced.D. In postmenarcheal females, amenorrhea, i.e., the absence of at least threeconsecutive menstrual cycles (p. 263)Bulimia Nervosa is defined as:76Table 4 Features of BulimiaA. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized byboth the following:1) Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g.. within any 2-hour period), andamount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat duringa similar period of time and under similar circumstances2) A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feelingthat one can not stop eating or control what or how much one is eating)B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour in order to prevent weight gain,such as self induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or othermedications; fasting; or excessive exercise.C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviours both occur, onaverage, at least twice a week for 3 months.D. Self-evaluation is unduly influence by body shape and weight.E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of Anorexia Nervosa.(p. 264-5).Eating Disorder Not Other Wise Specified:Table 5 Features of eating disorders not otherwise specifiedThe Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified category is for disorders of eating thatdo not meet the criteria for any specific Eating Disorder (p. 265).Treatment for anorexia and bulimia tends to be based on inpatient or outpatientprograms, which are often located in hospitals or specialized treatment centres.77Treatment, while still focusing on weight gain, is often in the form of behaviourmodification therapies, and includes individual, family, group and psycho-educationaltherapies (Gremillion, 2003). But, as Gremillion explains,...even with this multipronged treatment approach, anorexia\u2014widely understoodsince the 1960s to be a syndrome of complex ('multifactorial') or unknownetiology\u2014remains extremely difficult to treat. It has the highest mortality rate ofany psychiatric illness (approximately 10%), and according to a number of studies,most patients continue to struggle with significant anorexic symptoms many yearsafter treatment (p. 3). I will now trace the historical perspectives of drugs and alcohol, and our presentday understandings of substance abuse and dependence.Historical Perspectives on Drugs and AlcoholAlcoholIn order to conceptualize how our current understandings of substance misusehave developed, it is helpful to have an historical understanding of the context out ofwhich the treatments and attitudes towards drugs and alcohol have grown. This meanstracing the etiology of alcohol and drugs as well as contextualizing their use and thesocial meaning of their use at that time.As I live in Canada, it is particularly relevant that I include a discussion aboutthe impact that alcohol use has had on the First Nation People in Canada. First Nationspeople were the original settlers of Canada, with prolonged European contact notoccurring until the 17th and 18th centuries (Brody, 1988). As the European settlersencroached upon First Nations' land the First Nations people began to experience a78cultural dislocation. The Hudson Bay Company began to trade alcohol for furs, whichled to the breakdown of communal, kinship-based, cultures (Ray, 1998). Prior to contactwith Europeans, alcohol was not a part of First Nations people's diet. Brody writes:Traders soon recognized that they had an almost ideal trade commodity inalcohol: it is soon consumed and tends to be addictive. They exchangeddrink\u2014traditionally rum\u2014for furs, or sold it for the money they had paid forfurs, or simply gave it away. The Indians promptly drank it all. The traderswere left with the furs and the Indians were left with as great a need as ever\u2014ifnot an increasing need\u2014for trade goods. Trading, thus helped by alcohol, led tomore trading (p. 251).The devastating and destructive effects of alcohol and colonization continuetoday in Canada in the lives of First Nations people.People have been trying to alter their states of consciousness for most of ourdocumented history. Beer jugs have been found dating back as early as 3700 BC, andwine is believed to have been around since 1700 BC (Levinthal, 2005). Prior to the 18thcentury, alcohol was one of the few beverages able to be consumed since water was notalways safe to drink. Fermented alcohol served an important dietary role; it was a stapleof early diets and provided important nutrients (Levine, 1978). Alcohol was also used asa medicinal substance, prescribed by physicians to relieve aches/pains, sootheindigestion, and to fight fatigue. Levine states, \"liquor was food, medicine and sociallubricant, and even such a Puritan divine as Cotton Mather called it the 'good creature ofGod'\" (p. 494).79In the 17th and 18th centuries, drinking was part of daily life. Levine (1978)writes, \"Americans drank wine, beer, cider, and distilled spirits, especially rum. Theydrank at home, at work and while travelling, noon and night. And they got drunk\" (p.495). Heavy drinking was built into the culture of social celebrations, and the tavernkeeper was an esteemed member of town (Heron, 2003). The tavern acted as acommunity centre for gatherings and get-togethers (Heron). People who chose to drinkto excess did so for their love of the drink, they were not judged to be doing so becauseof the addictive power of alcohol, or from a lack of will power or a need to drink. Theygot drunk because they enjoyed it and because they wanted to (Levine).Dating back to at least the 17th century, the occasional complaints about theamount of drinking in the colonies came, more often than not, from wealthy colonials orpreachers (Roth, 2004; Levine, 1978). Habitual drunkenness did not go unnoticed.Towns often had lists of 'drunkards' as they were referred to during that time and tavernkeepers could be fined or shut down if they provided them with alcohol. But for themost part, drunkenness was an accepted part of life in colonial America. It is importantto note that most histories of drinking are specific to males; taverns were for the mostpart dominated by males, and most stories of 'drunkenness' (especially in public spaces)pertain to males. The existing stories of public displays of female drunkenness aretypically about prostitutes. Women who drank to excess most likely did so within theconfines of their homes due to the harsh judgment of female behaviour and the verydifferent standards as to what was acceptable for men and women (Heron, 2003).With the change from an agrarian society to an industrialized one in the 18th and19th centuries, attitudes towards alcohol hardened, and concern regarding \"habitual80drunkenness\" (Levine, 1978, p. 496) increased. Industrialization meant the break up ofsmall and connected communities as individuals moved to larger cities looking forwork, and immigrated to Canada and the US. In agrarian communities, employersprovided alcohol and employees drank on their breaks at work as a way to ease the hardwork's toil on the body (Heron, 2003). The use of heavy machinery meant that it wasno longer safe for workers to drink on the job and more important, productivity andfinancial gains could be threatened. As industrialization progressed and capitalismstrengthened, stronger divides emerged between the upper and lower class. Capitalismwas beginning to play a central role in defining a person's position and worth in newpost-colonial America (Severns, 2004), and increasingly the values of the upper classand the emerging middle classes were forced upon those below. Industrialization alsomarked the end of family and community regulation of alcohol consumption. Thepoorhouses, prisons, asylums, and sanitaria increasingly handled these problems.In the mid 18th century we begin to see concerns arising regarding the amount ofalcohol that people were consuming, the number of taverns that existed, and the amountof time people were spending in them (Levine, 1978). Temperance groups that promotedmoderate drinking emerged and their reasons for encouraging drinking in moderationwere tied to religious discourses of good and evil, which were increasingly moralisticand pejorative. Interestingly, the amount of alcohol that was being consumed did notchange between the 16th and 19th century. What did change, however, were the attitudesthat people held towards alcohol (Roth, 2004). In Canada and the US in the 1820s and1830s, temperance movements emerged from the previously formed temperance groups,and we increasingly see drunkenness portrayed as if it were a disease (Heron, 2003;81Levine). This movement emphasized morality, self-control, moderation, and theavoidance of spirits (Heron; Roth). Advocates of the movement believed that if spiritswere avoided, then most of the social problems faced by colonial America woulddisappear (Levine). Members of the temperance movement rallied to encourage peopleto stop drinking alcohol as a beverage and to pledge that they would abstain fromdrinking entirely (Heron).Benjamin Rush, a physician and a signatory on the Declaration of Independence,17was adopted as a 'spokesperson' for the temperance movement after writing a pamphletin 1785 that detailed the impact that alcohol had on both the mind and body (Levinthal,2005). Citing Sander's (1994) description of Benjamin Rush's ideas on the effects ofalcohol, \"alcohol, in the lives of some persons, was a misused substance that eroded'willpower' and led to a troubled existence and impoverished life\" (p. 26). Levinedescribes how:Rush's contribution to a new model of habitual drunkenness was fourfold: First,he identified the causal agent-spirituous liquors; second, he clearly described thedrunkard's condition as a loss of control over drinking behavior- as compulsiveactivity; third, he declared the condition to be a disease; and forth, he prescribedtotal abstinence as the only way to cure the drunkard (p. 500).Women became more involved in the prohibition movement, and according toHeron (2003), \"by mid-century women had a prominent role in many temperanceorganizations, even as speakers and organizers, and sometimes had their own branchessuch as the Daughters of Temperance\" (p. 56). Women were included in many of the 17 Rush is also considered the Father of American Psychiatry (Brodsky, 2004).82temperance activities \"to set a higher moral tone and to keep male excesses undercontrol\" (Heron, p. 56). Within this context, people who fell prey to 'drunkenness' wereviewed with compassion, and sober houses were set up where people could stay untilthey lost their desire for the drunkenness\u2014women often providing assistance to familieswhose member had fallen prey to the drink (Heron; Levine, 1978).Nearing the end of the 19th century and entering into the 20th century, temperancewas fuelled by the middle classes who insisted that those who drank were weak willedand of lower moral standing than those who refrained or drank in moderation. Roth(2004) describes how, \"the now more aware middle class cast the proletariat-as-drunk asits Other\" (p. 23). For example, the Irish working class were generally Catholic, whilethe middle class were mostly Protestant. The derogatory slang phrase, 'paddy wagon' isthought to be derived from inebriated 'Patty's,' referring to Irish persons (C.J. Sanders,personal communication, March 1, 2009).The middle and upper classes began to avoid the taverns and saloons that theyhad previously frequented, choosing instead, if they did drink, to drink in the privacy oftheir own home with friends of the same class standing (Roth, 2004). Saloons began tobe demonized as breeding grounds for corruption, and sites for immoral behaviour.Public drinking among the working class became more visible and apt to be judged asthe divide between those who could choose to drink and remain unseen behind closeddoors widened.As the temperance movement gained momentum, alcohol was portrayed as adangerous drug that no one could use safely or in moderation; therefore no one shouldhave access to it. \"Demon Rum\" (Levinthal, 2005, p. 235) was viewed as an entity that83could destroy the lives of even the most well to do, and much concern existed formembers of their own classes; anyone could become alcohol's victim (Levine). Clearly,the language used to describe alcohol and its effects was not neutral. Terms such as'demon rum' imply that alcohol was evil and consumption of it would result inpossession by the devil.Prohibition parties began pressuring the government to ban the manufacture,sale, transportation, and importation of alcohol, and on January 29, 1920, the EighteenthAmendment of the Constitution in the United Stated implemented prohibition(Hartmann & Millea, 1996). In Canada, retail outlets closed and shipments of alcoholwere restricted but brewers, distillers, and wine-makers were allowed to continuemaking and selling their products for export which set the stage for bootlegging alcoholto the US18 (Heron, 2003). Legally, alcohol could still be purchased, but only from\"properly licensed wholesalers or... official government-run dispensaries and only for'medicinal, mechanical, scientific, and sacramental purposes'\"(Heron, p. 181).[Distilled] Hard alcohol replaced beer or wine because it could be transportedmore easily and illegal clubs\u2014'speakeasies'\u2014appeared in cities all over the US. Inthese 'speakeasies' only spirits were served and intoxication was the norm. It quicklybecame apparent that prohibition was not working\u2014organized crime surroundingalcohol consumption increased, the government lost out on revenue from the taxation ofalcohol. It is estimated that \"by 1927 well over 50, 000 people had died from drinkingpoorly made alcohol\" (Severns, 2004, p. 159; Hartmann & Millea, 1996). For theaforementioned reasons as well as the financial devastation that the economy was in due 18 And the ascendancy of the Bronfman \"Seagram\" dynasty. (Heron, 2003)84to the depression, in 1933, the Volstead Act, which had made prohibition possiblebeginning in 1919, was repealed by the 21st Amendment, and alcohol was againlegalized (Levinthal, 2005; Hartmann & Millea).Only two years after Prohibition was repealed, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)came into being as a way to support individuals who wanted to stop drinking. AA wasstarted by Bill Wilson (often simply referred to as Bill W.), with ideas based in thetraditions of the Oxford Group, a religious group that centred on \"performing selfinventory, admitting wrongs, making amends, using prayer, and meditation and carryingthe message to others\" (Alcohol Anonymous Worldwide Services Ltd., 2008, \u00b61). AAis a fellowship-based group with a spiritual component that relies on sober AA membersto support and sponsor other alcoholics who want to quit drinking. Thus began a realself-help model regarding the treatment of addiction.Within the AA framework, the word \"'illness,' 'allergy,' 'sickness,' and'malady'\" were used (Severns, 2004, p. 161) to help explain the problem of addiction.The word disease was intentionally not used so as to not offend the medical profession,as they were generally not in favour of treating alcoholics and they wished to \"re-involve the medical profession in treatment\" (Severns, p. 161). Another reason the wordallergy was chosen was:AA members were anxious not to give the impression of genetic anomalybecause, until the rise of Nazi Germany, the United States led the world ineugenics. AA members did not wish to be the target of forced sterilization ormore noxious strategies by which they would be denied the possibility ofprocreation (Severns, p. 161).85The dominant view of alcohol at this time was that problems were caused by thenature of alcohol itself, as opposed to the problem residing with the person drinkingalcohol. In 1940, AA members formed The Committee for Education on Alcoholism,which later became the National Counsel on Alcoholism (NCA) (Hatmann & Millea,1996). These groups arose partially in response to the type of inhumane treatments thatwere available to alcoholics and addicts\u2014institutionalization, criminalization, andexperimental surgeries such as frontal lobotomies\u2014and also due to a lack of fundingand research initiatives directed towards alcoholism and addiction (Severn, 2004).Severns writes, \"isolated and without help, alcoholics were viewed as hopeless, theirtreatment reduced to sterilization and end-stage warehousing, with frontal lobotomiesbecoming a popular option in the 1940s\" (p. 158).Now that alcohol was again legal, the liquor industry needed to find ways toundo the fear towards alcohol that over 100 years of temperance had created. One waywas to build on the 'allergy' idea being promoted by AA, which meant that alcohol wasonly addicting to a small group of people and that others were safe to drink it. Jellineckbegan researching the disease idea in the 1940s, and throughout his career he was alifelong advocate for the medical treatment of alcoholism (Severns, 2004). It is ofinterest to note that Jellineck's research studies were \"financed by the liquor industry,which reported that about 10% of U.S. citizens were predisposed to alcohol addiction\"(Severns, p. 159).19 19 This sort of association continues today with the medical profession being courted and recruited bypharmaceutical companies to distribute new drugs. For more information regarding this phenomena seeDavid Healy (2002) The Creation of Psychopharmacology. Harvard University Press: USA; RobertWhitaker, (2001) Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of theMentally Ill. Basic Books: USA.86In 1960, Jellineck expanded on the allergy idea and wrote a book categorizingalcoholism into five distinct types, titled, The Disease Concept of Alcoholism (Hartman& Millea, 1996, p. 40). With this, the 'disease' concept of addiction blossomed(Severns, 2004). The American Medical Association affirmed the disease concept ofalcoholism in 1968, but it was still considered \"an indicator of 'mental illness'\"(Hartmann & Millea, p. 41). In 1970, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse andAlcoholism (NIAAA) was formed and the disease concept of alcoholism was advanced.The NIAAA expanded treatment programs and research funding for alcoholism, andalso ensured that most addiction treatment programs were based in AA philosophy andthe disease model of alcoholism (Hartmann & Millea; Peele, 1999).The ascendance of drug useDrug use can be seen as entering the western scene during a time when alcoholuse was being scrutinized and intolerance towards alcohol was growing. Up until the1800s, drugs were used in their natural, unaltered form, and when used in this mannerthere was less likelihood of addiction occurring (Musto, 1991). In South America, theuse of the coca leaf can be traced back to Inca civilizations in the 13th century. Cocaleaves (from which cocaine is derived) were known to have stimulant properties andwere used for years by locals, in the way of chewing coca leaves, which contain about2% cocaine.Opium, which comes from the head of the Opium Poppy, was used for centuriesalmost exclusively on a medicinal basis without addiction; in China, it was used as earlyas 973 AD by Chinese herbalists, and by the indigenous populations of South America, 87particularly, in Peru. The active agent, morphine, is diluted when opium is taken orally.It wasn't until people began smoking opium in the 18th century, that problems withopium addiction began (Levinthal, 2005). In terms of the effects of colonization, it isimportant to note that it was Britain that fuelled the demand for opium among theChinese, by demanding that China trade Chinese silk and teas for opium, effectivelyforcing the Chinese people into addiction. This culminated in the Opium Wars of 1839-1842 and 1856-1860 between China and Britain, which China lost (Chang, 1970).When Chinese labourers were brought to North America to build the WesternRailroads, they brought with them the tradition of smoking opium (Willutzki &Wiesner, 1996). The Chinese received harsh treatment for their opium smokingpractices, which was fuelled by fear and racism. Opium used in this form was seen as avice and associated with the lowest class of people, whereas opium taken in the form ofa drink called Laudanum was both acceptable and common practice by both English andAmericans. 'Mrs. Winslow' Soothing Syrup is one such mixture of Laudanum, and wasused for pain relief, sleep, and for common coughs or colds. Western practices ofconsuming narcotics were considered legitimate and licit, yet the Chinese immigrants'practice of consuming the same narcotic substance by smoking it was viewed as dirtyand illicit (Musto, 1991).With advances in science in the 1800s, drugs were chemically isolated from theirraw state and became available in purer form (cocaine, morphine, codeine, and laterheroin in 1898). Physicians and lay people, not knowing the addictive potential of thesesubstances, used them unabashedly for their medicinal, euphoric and, relaxationinducing properties\u2014they were widely available and their advertising was unrestrained.88In 1812, many Civil War soldiers became addicted to opium after being givenopium preparations when they were wounded, ill, or 'shell shocked' (the origins of whatbecame post-traumatic stress disorder) (Kutchins & Kirk, 1997). With the discovery ofmorphine, it was assumed that this would be a cure for opium addiction due to less of itbeing needed. In 1870, the hypodermic syringe was perfected and had become afamiliar instrument to both doctors and patients. Doctors falsely assumed that because aperson was injecting less morphine they were less likely to become addicted to it. Asdoctors continued to isolate new chemical forms of drugs they would unwillinglyreplace one drug addiction for another. For example, when in 1884 Sigmund Freudpromoted cocaine to mainstream medicine, he described it as a 'magical drug' and asafe, non-habit forming, treatment for morphine addiction (Levinthal, 2005). By 1885the Parke Davis Company had made cocaine available in 15 different forms, cocainecigarettes, cocaine for injection, and cocaine for sniffing. In 1863, cocaine was alsoused in a beverage mixed with wine called Vin Mariani (Musto, 1991). Later thealcohol was removed and Coca Cola was born, advertising the benefits of cocainewithout the 'harmful' effects of alcohol (Musto).After about 100 years of unrestrained use and unrestrained advertising of drugs,public fear of opiates and their addictive properties increased. The increase in fears wasa response to capitalism, increased criminalization of drugs (Severns, 2004), and themarginalization of the Chinese people who had been brought to America to build therailways (who had brought with them the practice of opium smoking), (Willutzki &Wiesner, 1996). Due to these fears, we begin to see a decline in the general public'sconsumption of drugs. Some states responded to these fears by allowing morphine to be89available only by prescription. With fears increasing about morphine addiction,physicians were looking for other substances to replace morphine, and in 1898 the BayerAspirin Company believed they had found the answer through heroin (Willutzki &Wiesner, 1996. p. 52). Heroin was believed to be less addictive than morphine, withfewer side effects. It was even included as an ingredient in cough syrup as it was usefulin suppressing the cough reflex (Musto, 1991). The addictive potential of heroin wassoon discovered and quickly associated with criminal use, as it was not a drug regularlyused by the medical profession (Willutzki & Wiesner).As a result of the growing temperance movement in the 1800s and increasingunease towards alcohol, a burgeoning patent medicine mail order trade had developed,of which doctors were trying to gain control, mainly because of the profits to be made(Severns, 2004). In part, the use of mail order patent medications was one way to avoidthe shaming that was occurring when people consumed alcohol (Severns, 2004). In 1847the American Medical Association (AMA) was formed, which allowed them, in 1914, togain control of patent medications and drugs (except nicotine and alcohol) under theHarrison Act (Severns, 2004). In 1914, the Harrison Drug Act was enacted which gavethe American Medical Association (AMA) control of patent medications and drugs(nicotine and alcohol were excluded) and categorized all substances as narcotics(Severns, 2004). The Harrison Act oversaw any opium coming into the United Sates aswell as the dispensing of it. The sale and production of opiates were now prohibitedexcept through prescription, which made it possible for physicians to maintain apatient's addiction. No longer could any patent remedies contain any trace of narcotics.The Harrison Act was also an attempt to stop illicit drug use and the importation of90narcotics by immigrants into the United States. This act drew a clear line between whiteAmerican's licit drug use (laudanum) and illicit drug use by the Chinese (opiumsmoking). In 1919 the Supreme Court ruled that \"indefinite maintenance for 'mereaddiction' was outside of legitimate medical practice hence, physicians were no longerable to maintain a patient's 'addiction'\"(Musto, 1991, p. 44). Now patients who weredependent on narcotics had to obtain them by other means, which created a large blackmarket for drugs and increased crime rates. Similarly, prohibition put alcohol's controlin the hands of organized crime and created an illegal market for alcohol. Increasinglyindividuals who used drugs and alcohol were criminalized, leaving 'addiction' treatmentin the hands of law enforcement (Severns, 2004). As described by Willutzki andWeisner (1996):In the next decades early attempts by the medical profession to work in the area ofdrug use were very much restricted by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics....thousandsof physicians and drug users were criminalized and put in jail; eventually themedical profession mostly dropped out of the field (p. 52).So disappeared years of treatment practices, addiction knowledge, and medicalremedies treating addiction (Levine, 1978; Severns, 2004).In the 1950s, doctors again began treating 'addiction' (Willutzki & Wiesner, 1996)based mainly in AA ideas, and in the disease model of addiction. Addiction was seen asa progressive disease that would end in death if drinking or substance use was notstopped, therefore abstinence was always prescribed. Even today, the judgment towardsindividuals misusing alcohol and drugs tends to be quite strong and paternalistic. The91general belief is that people not willing to seek help are in denial, that they chooseaddiction, and that they can stop if they so desired.Present day understandingsAs insurance companies are increasingly outcome orientated and institutionscompete with academia and research for funding, there has been an increasing demandfor the treatment providers to have an education that extends beyond personalexperience in the field (Hartmann and Millea, 1996). As more money goes intoresearch, the disease concept of addiction is increasingly called into question althoughthe search continues for the ever-elusive human gene responsible for causing addiction.Colin Sanders (2007) writes, \"The tendency to locate the etiology of the addictionexperience within a person's biochemistry is the latest, albeit most sophisticated, variantof the history of the disease metaphor\" (p. 60).The American Psychiatric Association (APA) DSM-IVR (2000) outlines the criteriafor substance dependence and substance abuse as follows:Table 6 Criteria for substance dependence:A maladaptive pattern of substance, use, leading to a clinically significant impairment ordistress, as manifested by three or more of the following, occurring at any time in thesame 12-month period:20 20 The APA has been criticized for the use of the word dependence, claiming that it is too general of aterm (Peele, 2009). As Peele (2009) writes, \"people can become dependent on medications for goodmedical reasons, but that this doesn't comprise a disorder.... Why is there no addiction in the DSM-IV?Addiction experts used to consider narcotic withdrawal the penultimate characteristic of addiction. Thatwas called \"physical\" dependence. But that left out cocaine (and nicotine).... So physical dependence andwhat used to be called \"physic\" dependence were folded into one big dependence ball of wax\"www.peel.net/blog/090425.html921) Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:a) A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieveintoxication or desired effectb) Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of thesubstance2) Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:a) The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substanceb) The same (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoidwithdrawal symptoms3) The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than wasintended4) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substanceuse5) A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance (e.g.,visiting multiple doctors or driving long distances), use the substance (e.g., chain-smoking), or recover from its effects6) Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reducedbecause of substance use.7) The substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent orrecurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused orexacerbated by the substance (e.g., current cocaine use despite recognition ofcocaine-induced depression, or continued drinking despite recognition that anulcer was made worse by alcohol consumption) (p. 110-111).93Table 7 The criteria for substance abuse as defined by the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000)A. A maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairmentor distress, as manifested by one (or more) of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:1) Recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfil major role obligations atwork, school, or home (e.g., repeated absences or poor work performancerelated to substance use; substance-related absences, suspensions, or expulsionsfrom school; neglect of children or household)2) Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g.,Driving an automobile or operating a machine when impaired by substance use)3) Recurrent substance-related legal problems (e.g. arrests for substance- relateddisorderly conduct)4) Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social orinterpersonal problems cause or exacerbated by the effects of the substance(e.g., arguments with spouse about consequences of intoxication, physicalfights)B. The symptoms have never met the criteria for Substance Dependence for this classof substance (p. 114-115).Harm ReductionIn Europe, Australia and Canada since the 1980s, there has been a growing harmreduction movement, which has begun to shift the focus away from the hegemony of the94disease model of addiction that continues to prevail in the United States (Marlatt, 2002).It is important to note as Marlatt points out that, \"the origins of this approach to drugproblems can be traced back to the 19th century\" (Marlatt, p. 30) Harm reductionpractices meet the individual where they are at, with services geared towards reducingharm at the individual and societal level. Harm reduction practices do not expect theindividual to just say 'No' to drugs and alcohol, and instead provide services forindividuals who do not wish to stop using. Examples of harm reduction practices are;needle exchange programs, methadone maintenance programs, and supervised injectionsites, among others. These practices focus on the health and dignity of the person usingsubstances, and on creating safer options and alternatives for persons who wish tocontinue using drugs and alcohol.Crafting Alternative Understandings of Eating Disorders and Substance MisuseIt is important to consider the historical context from which both alcohol/drugsand eating disorders came for a few reasons. First, it allows us to see how the conceptsof substance misuse and disordered eating have evolved through time\u2014they are clearlynot static categories. Instead they have subtly transformed into new categories that arequite different from their original understandings. In each different historical context,substance misuse and food refusal have been given new meanings based on the beliefsand values that existed at that given time. Looking back, we are able to see how peoplecoordinated their actions based on their beliefs, values, and expectations (McNamee,1992) regarding drugs, alcohol, and food. These beliefs, values, and expectationsemerged within communities as generalized notions of the correct or appropriate way tobehave during given time periods (McNamee). Knowing that the theories we use to95make sense of ourselves and of our surroundings are not universal truths better positionsus to deconstruct our current understandings of substance misuse and disordered eating.Second, a historical looking back sheds light on how people who drink, usedrugs, or refuse food are viewed in the context of particular time frames. For example,according to Willutzki and Weisner (1996), \"The historical perspective of drug use inthe U.S. during the last 200 years seems particularly instructive because it covers the fullrange from autonomy to disease to criminality concepts and back\" (p. 53). Thediscourse surrounding drug use and misuse, particularly marijuana, cocaine and heroin,has been influenced by race and racism, not just class. The Chinese were feared forsmoking opium, Mexicans for marijuana use, and African Americans for cocaine andheroin use. The 'other' is usually constructed regarding a race, class, and ethnicity byprivileged whites (C. J. Sanders, personal communication, March 1, 2009), and, as hasbeen demonstrated, this 'othering' has strong implications for an individual's social andmedical treatment (Sampson, 1993).Third, the historical context demonstrates how meaning and subsequent languagepractices influence our understandings of phenomena. This understanding is very muchtied to a society's specific cultural values, ethnicities, and moralities (Epstein, 1996). Inmy opinion, nothing illustrates the importance of this better than the concept of gluttony.Gluttony was originally tied to excessive food consumption, and a refined appetite thatshowed restraint was highly regarded. As Roth (2004), explains, \"The most obviousearly taxonomy for bad behaviour was the Seven Deadly Sins, in which gluttony markedthe place of sins of consumption, but it was uniformly associated with food, not drink\"(p. 20). As has been demonstrated, excessive drinking soon surpassed excessive food96consumption as a sinful and immoral behaviour. The cultural meaning given to thebehaviour of gluttony changed, and people adapted their beliefs accordingly. Thebehaviour remained the same yet the values attached to it had changed. This illustratesthe power a discourse has in disseminating what is acceptable or not at a given period inhistory.Changes in the Way the Problem is UnderstoodWhen tracing the history of substance misuse and food refusal, what becomesapparent is the change that occurred in the ways that they were understood. Initially notmuch thought was given to 'why' people drank or drank in excess. It was just not seenas a problem. With time, this changed and people began looking for explanations as towhy people drank. What they found was that people drank simply because they loved todrink, and they loved liquor itself. The same can be said of food refusal. Originally itwas understood within the context of religion. Religious women, whose faith wasstrong, were believed to be able to survive on the Eucharist alone due to the strength oftheir faith (Bell, 1985).However, within a few hundred years, food refusal and drinking or drugging toexcess was understood in very different ways. Drinking to excess was now the result of'an allergy' and eventually was believed to be 'a disease' that some people had andsome people did not have (Severns, 2004). It was even given a name, alcoholism.Bateson writes (1972) \"They [AA (alcoholics anonymous)] try to have the alcoholicplace alcoholism within the self\" (p. 322), for example, 'I am an alcoholic.' A similarphenomenon happened with food refusal. In the later part of the 1800s, physiciansbegan searching for the biological location of the problem, and offered treatments such97as bed rest, stimulation of internal organs, and re-feeding. When no plausible biologicalexplanations could be found, the search moved from the body to the psyche, andpsychotherapists began to 'talk' to their patients, who could now be diagnosed withanorexia nervosa, which would eventually lead to them being described as 'anorexic'(Brumberg, 2000).Before problems could be attached to a person's identity or personality, peoplefirst needed to be conceptualized as individuals. But what changes had to occur insociety to allow for such a huge shift in perspective? Phillip Cushman (1995) writes,We can see the beginnings of individualism in a myriad of small changes,such as portraits that began to reflect personal idiosyncrasies as well asone's place in the social hierarchy; the concept of personal friendshiprather than corporate feudal bonds; the philosophical growth ofmysticism that emphasized personal communion, rather than a solelyinstitutional, mediated relationship with God; the shift in art from a fixedto a moveable perspective; and literary forms such as the biography andautobiography. (p. 364)As Cushman (1995) clearly illustrates, it was not just one change that occurred;instead many small shifts in perspective needed to occur in order for people to becomeindividuals. Industrialization and capitalism were two very influential factors in thedemise of communal identity and communal ties by which people had previouslydefined themselves (Sampson, 1989). As people moved to larger cities looking forwork, small and tightly knit communities dissolved. Individuals became moreautonomous and there was less family and community regulation of social disruptions,98crime, and physical ailments. As others have suggested, and I concur, the socialdislocation (Engels, 1987; Alexander, 2008) caused by industrialization set the stage forthe development of social problems like drinking to excess and food refusal in the formsthat we begin to see in the nineteenth century. Severns (2004) describes how:Jellinek's belief was that communal systems had previously providedcontext and ritual whereby life was given meaning and reason, whichsafeguarded members for the personal disintegration that Jellinek saw tobe prevalent in his day. He saw the value of alcohol as having shiftedfrom symbolic to ritualistic use, to the level of folk custom, as a culturalattempt to reduce the tension produced by individualism (p. 162).Additionally, people began to be conceptualized as possessing stable'personalities' that were assumed to reside inside a person's mind (Geertz, 1973). Whenthe words we speak are seen as the portal to the mind, words become constitutive ofindividuals. Gergen (1991) writes, \"the idea of single minds behind words is acornerstone of Western individualism\" (p. 106). Disciplinary power further positionspeople as subjects or things to be acted upon\u2014\"docile bodies\" becoming a thing todiscipline and control (Foucault, 1979, p. 135).As societies became increasingly saturated with work and responsibilities, andincreasingly disconnected from their communal bonds, the way was paved forprofessionals, doctors, and\u2014eventually in the twentieth and twenty-firstcenturies\u2014therapists, and counsellors, to step into our lives to perform roles that hadpreviously been assigned to our families, friends, and loved ones (Gergen, 1991). The99medicalization of illness slowly replaced the religious views that had been dominant upuntil the 1600s.Medicine has played an increasingly important role in the current understandingsof disordered eating practices and substance misuse. We see a reliance on the diagnosesof professionals to explain what was going on inside of people's bodies/minds and astepping away from more traditional ways of knowing and healing practices. This gaveincreasing authority to the medical professions to create new and more elaboratecategories of deficit by which to define people (Peele, 1989). Phillip Cushman (1995)describes how keeping individuals focused on their personal deficit qualities and failuresensured that they would not look outwards to their surrounding community for thesource of their unhappiness. To Cushman, if deficit or personal failure...is thought to be caused by the biochemical structure of our genes\u2014our humannature\u2014not the particular political arrangements of twentieth century capitalismThus it is foolish and ultimately ineffective to blame, and then advocateresisting, current social structures (p. 342).For the above to take place, mechanisms of surveillance by an unjust societyneeded to be put into place as methods of individual social control (Foucault, 1979).Initially these mechanisms of control were externally located. The genealogy of eatingproblems best illustrates these mechanisms. It shows a history of women being watchedover by patriarchy and being prescribed certain appropriate avenues in which todemonstrate that they were women. In Victorian England, corsets and full skirtslimiting a woman's mobility were considered fashionable and a thin waist was theultimate in femininity. In the 20th century, the appropriate size of women's bodies100began to be dictated by standardized clothing sizes, insurance companies, and the dietindustry. By the 1960s, medicine and a burgeoning diet and beauty industry haddeveloped and women had internalized what a women's body ought to look like. Whenindividuals began to watch over their own body, the mechanisms of controlunknowingly became internally located. For example, 'the gaze' as described byFoucault, has us acting and controlling our actions as if there is always someonewatching. Foucault (1979) states:The efficiency of power, its constraining force has, in a sense, passedover to the other side- to the side of its surface of application. He who issubjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumesresponsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them playspontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation inwhich he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of hisown subjection (p. 202-203).This is not to say that women are personally responsible for theirsubjugations. Instead, they are responding to power structures and hegemonicprocesses that direct and coerce their choices. Our bodies become docile bodies(Foucault, 1979) objects upon which things can be done, and we as individualsare then solely responsible for their form and their shape. Women are indirectlyand directly socially encouraged to try to reach the ever-unattainable goals ofthinness, which ensures an ever-present awareness of the ways that their body isnot meeting society's norms for beauty. This often occurs at the expense ofeducational pursuits and other life enriching options. In this way, our bodies101also become commodities from which others may profit in terms of clothing, dietand beauty industries.Substance Misuse and Eating Disorders as a Form of Protest21/ResistanceTo some extent both substance misuse and food refusal can be viewed as a formof protest of the conditions within which individuals are living. According to Bynum,(1987) food refusal in the medieval ages even though a spiritual meaning was attachedto it, was very significant beyond the meaning of food itself. Bynum writes:Far from substituting control of self for control of circumstance ordestroying ego and body while attempting to direct the attention of otherstowards them, women's food practices frequently enabled them todetermine the shape of their lives\u2014to reject unwanted marriages, tosubstitute religious activities for more menial duties within the family, toredirect the use of fathers' or husbands' resources, to change or convertfamily members, to criticize powerful secular or religious authorities, andto claim for themselves teaching, counseling, and reforming roles forwhich the religious tradition provided, at best, ambivalent support (p.220).Entering into the doctrine of religion allowed women access to other roles thatwere not possible if one were married, raising children and responsible for the care ofothers. Something similar can be seen amongst the middle and upper class youngwomen in Victorian England, as they too were very much confined to a life of 21 For more information on resistance or protest to oppression please see Allan Wade's article, Small Actsof Living (1997), which is based on the premise that where there is oppression there is resistance.102domesticity. Young women's lives were highly controlled by their parents, who wishedto raise daughters suitable to be married into even higher social standings. Educationand work was believed to be detrimental to a woman's reproductive organs and toostressful for her overall constitution (Hesse-Biber, 2007).In these conditions, food refusal served as a statement of protest to the stiflinglyand potentially un-stimulating activities to which young women were allowed access, aswell perhaps to the conforming standards of beauty exemplified by thinness andpaleness common at the time. Brumberg (2000) describes how the frailness and foodrefusal associated with middle and upper class women was not seen in lower or workingclass women, as it was not an influential form of protest. Many writers have noted thatwomen's control of the body as a form of protest or resistance to the prescribed genderroles and patriarchy actually restricts and limits women's possibilities (Bordo, 2003; Malson, 1998; Orbach, 1978). To quote Bordo:The experience of power is, of course, deeply and dangerouslyillusory. To reshape one's body into a male body is not to put on malepower and privilege. To feel autonomous and free while harnessing bodyand soul to an obsessive body-practice is to serve, and not transform, asocial order that limits female possibilities (p. 179).Substance misuse can also be viewed as a form of protest and in some cases aform of resistance. When the Chinese immigrated to North America to build theWestern Railroads, they brought with them the tradition of smoking opium. Asmentioned earlier, Chinese labourers used opium while doing extremely dangerous workthat was seen as unfit for their North American counterparts. Chinese immigrants were103surrounded by racial violence, attempts to destroy their dignity, and attempts to stoptheir immigration into America. Holding onto their familiar practices may have been arefusal to assimilate in a country that was treating them with hate and disdain as well asan escape from the stress of their circumstances. During the civil war, fighters weresome of the first casualties of morphine addiction, morphine perhaps dulling the pain ofthe memories of the atrocities that they both participated in and witnessed while in thebattlefield. Similarly, the housewife at the turn of the 20th century, addicted toLaudanum, which was widely prescribed for minor problems such as sleep disturbances,developed an addiction problem as well. Later, in a similar vein, Valium was lovinglyreferred to as \"mother's little helper\" (The Rolling Stones, 1967), indicating its use as away to survive the monotony of a housewife's days [this role, too, being a capitalistconstruct that would later evolve, post-feminism, post-60's, into the heterosexual'family' where both mother and father required being in the work force] (C. J., Sanders,personal communication, March 1, 2009).As a gendered response, substance misuse can be seen as women's refusal toconform to the 'acceptable' standards of drinking and drug use by which she issurrounded. Drinking and drug use in this way can be a form of rebellion, as it is notconsidered typical of a 'proper' woman's behaviour. Women have been responsible forchild rearing, managing the household, keeping the family intact, and if a woman isusing illicit drugs or drinking to excess, the chances of this occurring can be lessened.Women's drug using behaviour can then be seen as a threat to traditional gender rolesand 'life' as it has always been. In the book Using Women, Campbell (2000) traces\"how women's drug use has been constructed as a gendered, racialized, and sexualized104threat to modernity, capitalist production, social reproduction and democraticcitizenship\" (p. 14). This is illustrative of how women's substance taking behaviour hasfar reaching implications on so many levels other then the substance use itself.How People Were Seen and Subsequently TreatedInitially, excessive drinking was not seen as a problem, but with time peoplewho were considered habitual 'drunkards' were looked down upon, condemned, andjudged. Habitual drunkenness became associated with the lowest form of citizen, andwas an attack on their morality (Sanders, 1994). In the mid to late 20th century, bothsubstance misuse problems and food refusal came to be defined by the AmericanPsychiatric Association (APA) as problems that resided inside an individual and wereconsidered a deviation from what was considered 'normal' (Kutchins & Kirk, 1997).Now, someone who drank to excess was viewed as doing so because s/he was analcoholic. Someone who refused to eat did so because s/he was an anorexic. Thereason for the existence of the problem was assumed to be a deficit or pathology thatresided within the individual. This explanation made it possible for a problem to define aperson's identity, without the person's consent.A certain \"meaning and value\" (McNamee & Gergen, 1999, p. 4) is attributed topeople's actions, and the actions of consuming too much of a particular substance, oreating to excess or too little, are likely to have a typical response of distain, pity, orjudgment passed for their actions. Persons struggling with substance misuse arecommonly faced with a contradictory judgement. It is assumed they have no controlover themselves, yet it is expected that they could choose to stop using at anytime theywant. People with anorexia are often called spoiled, selfish, and narcissistic. When105people are constructed as individuals, divorced from their context, they become solelyresponsible for their actions and pathologized accordingly (Bruner, 1990).Cultural influence\"In Maurice Merleau-Ponty's famous phrase, culture, through everyday socialpractices, is \"sedimented\" in the body. This is what is meant by the social\"construction\" of the individual\" (Cushman, 1995, p. 18).In the social world, our actions are co-ordinated (McNamee & Gergen, 1999)with those around us, as are the resulting ways we come to understand and give meaningto people's actions. This includes people's decisions (and our understandings ofpeople's decisions) to use or abstain from alcohol and drugs, and/or restrict/purge/over-consume food. Yet the cultural influence is often overlooked resulting in anorexia,bulimia and substance misuse being pathologized. For example, the 2000 edition of theDSM-IV included culture bound syndromes in its Appendix I, acknowledging theimportance of cultural difference in the understandings of disorders. Yet anorexianervosa, bulimia, eating disorders not otherwise specified, substance abuse andsubstance dependence were not included as culture bound syndromes (APA, 2000). Thedescription reads:The term culture-bound syndrome denotes recurrent, locality-specific patterns ofaberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to aparticular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenouslyconsidered to be 'illnesses,' or at least afflictions, and most have local names . . .culture-bound syndromes are generally limited to specific societies or cultureareas and are localized, folk, diagnostic categories that frame coherent meanings106for certain repetitive, patterned, and troubling sets of experiences andobservations (p. 844).Some writers have made strong cases for disordered eating and substancemisuse to be considered as culture bound phenomena (Malson, 1998; Peele,1995; Cushman, 1995). For example Helen Malson describes how:Anorexia nervosa, like some other illnesses can be viewed as a metaphorfor, and a manifestation of, a multiplicity of socio-cultural concerns of thelate twentieth century; concerns about femininity and feminism, about thebody, and about individual control and consumption within consumersociety (p. 5-6).Stanton Peele (1995) has written extensively of the differences in thehistorical treatment and understanding of drinking compared with our currentunderstandings of the same behaviour. The behaviour has not changed yet ourunderstandings of the behaviour have. He states:What people believe about their drinking actually affects how they reactto alcohol... In other words, the readier people are to decide that theirbehavior is a symptom of an irreversible addictive disease, the morereadily they fall into a disease state. For example, we will have morebulimia now that bulimia has been discovered, labelled, and promulgatedas a disease (p. 170).Culture is powerfully generative of our identities, communities, and our beliefs.Our identities are communally constructed within the cultural frame we are surroundedby, with popular culture playing an important role in this. For example, when television107arrived in Fiji in 1995, anorexia was relatively unknown and young Fijian womenreported feeling good about the size and shape of their bodies (Becker, Burwell, Gilman,Herzog & Hamburg, 2002). Only three years later there was a statistically significantincrease in the numbers of young women no longer content with their bodies and/ordieting as a way to alter the shape of their bodies (Becker et. al.). In North Americasome people will go to any means necessary to attain beauty\u2014invasive plastic surgery,liposuction and gastroplasty (stapling of the stomach) being fairly common procedures.The reality television show Nip Tuck demonstrates just how far men and women will goto surgically alter their bodies\u2014all in the name of beauty.Alcohol use is also built into western cultural social celebrations andheterosexual male identities are strongly associated with drinking. David Nylund (2007)in his book Beer, balls, and babes: masculinity and sports talk radio, describes howdrinking culture has become an integral part of our understanding of what it means to bea heterosexual male in the 21st century. When we consider the context of people's lives adifferent understanding of their lives is possible. Today the general consensus amongstmainstream professionals is that both problems are individually and medically based,which excludes any cultural, historical and social based reasons for the development andprogression of these problems. Yet when people's actions are seen solely within theconfines of biological causes this leaves little room for the impact of trauma, poverty,racism, homophobia, and gender training on a person's behaviour.In the following section I briefly describe the history of the Diagnostic andStatisticians Manual (DSM) and the impact that the DSM has had on our societalunderstandings of mental illness and treatment practices.108A brief history of the DSMThere are many perspectives from which to view eating disorders and substancemisuse. The stance that we adopt impacts our interaction with the persons consulting usfor therapy, as well as the solutions that are possible within the chosen approach. In thissection, I will briefly trace the history of the Diagnostic Statisticians Manual (DSM) andthen discuss the implications that the DSM can have on the clients who consult us fortherapy. Of particular concern to this writing is the pathologizing discourse that stemsfrom the DSM. Especially as the classifications that define 'normal' grow smaller andthe possibilities to be diagnosed as having a DSM diagnosis grows larger given the ever-growing list of disorders housed within the text. This is very relevant to this dissertationas young women seeking treatment for anorexia and bulimia are often required to meetthe 'criteria' listed in the DSM-IV in order to access treatment for disordered eating. Iwill argue that the criteria that have been created to support young women caninadvertently strengthen disordered eating practices (Gremillion, 2003).22Madness as a concept has existed long before the profession of psychology orpsychiatry emerged (psychiatry as a profession did not exist before the end of the 18thcentury (Shorter, 1997). Individuals considered 'mad,' or 'insane,' were commonlyseen as a threat to society in Roman and Greek societies, who preferred to remove thiselement from society. The Spartans routinely tossed defective offspring of the cliffs,while Plato suggested to take the 'offspring of the inferior' to an unknown place (ascited in Blatt, 1966). During the middle ages, the initial spread of Christianity fostered amore charitable view of the insane: as in need of help and protection from the devil. The 22 In British Columbia, Canada most youth treatment programs for alcohol and drug misuse are nothospital based therefore young persons are not required to have a DSM diagnosis of substance abuse ordependence in order to be admitted.109bishop of Myra for example (also know as Saint Nicholas) offered shelter for thementally ill in the fourth century (Wever-Rabehl, 2001). Treatment or education was nota consideration however (Wever-Rabehl). Mental illness and developmental delays wereseen as incurable and hopeless. This did not change until the late 1700s, with work ofJean-Marc Gaspard Itard and his 'wild boy of Aveyron' (Wever-Rabehl).Throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries, the medical profession searched forthe cause of madness, which was believed to be located inside the body (Cushman,1995). By the latter half of the 19th century North America had gone through massivesocial change and disruption as the result industrialization, which lead to socialproblems such as unemployment, homelessness, slums, and crime. 'Defective genes'were identified as the cause of these problems (Wever-Rabehl, 2001). Much researchtook place, in the US as well as in Europe, on the interplay between mental status andcrime. The eugenics movement provided an answer in that they offered a scientificmethod for the improvement of the human race through selective breeding andsterilization (Wever-Rabehl). Till well into the 1900s, federal and state governmentsissued various social control measures directed against the 'mentally retarded' and the'insane:' sterilization, restriction on marriage and sexual relationships, and eveneuthanasia (Wever-Rabehl). Sterilization continued on a broad scale until the 1960s, andeventuated in the forced sterilization of 31,038 Americans (Knoblock, 1987, as cited inWever-Rabehl). In Germany, eugenics was taken to an extreme. Some 275,000 mentallyretarded and mentally ill were killed in 'mercy deaths' (Werthman, 1978, as cited inWever-Rabehl).110Science and medicine became more and more influential in the care of people'sphysical and mental health in the early twentieth century (Cushman, 1995), and insanitywas increasingly associated with the pathological (Wever-Rabehl, 2001). In order tostandardize and humanize treatment for the mentally ill within asylums, the American-Medico Psychological Association was founded in 1892 by G. Stanley Hall (Reisman,1991). In 1921 it was changed to its current name, the American PsychiatricAssociation (APA). In 1952 the APA published the first edition of the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM-I (American Psychiatric Association,1952). Karl Tomm (1990) describes how the DSM was \"originally intended to stabilizepsychiatric nomenclature in American Psychiatry and to clarify the description ofdiagnostic terms\" (p. 1). It also offered a common language for psychiatrists to usewhen consulting with one another about their patients. Tomm (1990) describes howwhen the second edition of the DSM (DSM-II) was released in 1968, the name referringto the mental 'disorders' had been changed. For example, what had previously beencalled mental 'reactions' in the first edition, were now called mental 'illnesses' (Tomm,1990). As a result the field of psychiatry was now closer aligned the field of medicine(Tomm, 1990).To get a sense of the changing nature of the contents of the DSM, DSM-III wasreleased in 1980, and DSM-III-R was released just seven years later (Kutchins & Kirk,1997). DSM-IV was released in 1997 and DSM-IV-TR was release in 2000. With eachrevision, categories have been deleted or added, and terminology changed, all in thename of 'diagnostic reliability' (Kutchins & Kirk, 1997, p. 27). Regarding the DSM-IVthe APA itself claims: \"one of the most important features of the DSM-IV is its111provision of diagnostic criteria to improve the reliability of diagnostic judgments \"(APA, 2000, p. ix). The next version DSM-V is expected to be released in 2012 (APA,2009, \u00b6 9).The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders is commonly referred to within mental health fields as 'the bible,' as itdefines and outlines the current diagnostic criteria for the mental disorders containedwithin it (Tomm, 1990). The DSM-IV-TR (2000) includes the criteria for AnorexiaNervosa (307.1), Bulimia Nervosa (307.51), and Eating Disorders Not OtherwiseSpecified (307.50). Also included are the criteria for Substance Abuse or SubstanceDependence Disorder. (Please refer back in this chapter for the full diagnostic criteria ofthe aforementioned disorders). As our society changes, what is collectively deemedacceptable waxes or wanes, and so do the criteria in the DSM. This helps explain whywhat started out as a book of 66 disorders now includes almost 400 (Kutchins & Kirk,1997).The DSM has been critiqued for its \"pathologizing of everyday behaviour\"(Kutchins & Kirk, 1997) as it identifies what could be seen as normal healthy responsesto problems or ways of living as forms of mental illness. For example, homosexualitywas included in the second edition of the DSM under the category of sexual deviations(Kutchins & Kirk). Implicit in the initial creation of homosexuality as a disorder is avalue judgment of 'normal' being assigned to heterosexual behaviour and deviant or'abnormal' being attached to homosexual behaviour. Homosexuality was subsequentlyeliminated from the third edition. Kutchins and Kirk link the removal of the diagnosis toa combination of four factors, one of which was the \"historical changes in the category112of homosexuality\" (p. 58). Because of societal changes, increasing acceptance ofhomosexuality, and a developing gay liberation movement, homosexuality could nolonger be classified as a mental illness. This underscores that categories of mentalillness are invented constructions, created by individuals with the power to label others(Kutchins & Kirk; Foucault, 1982).Anti-psychiatrist, Szasz (1972) describes mental illness as a myth. The mentalillnesses contained within the DSM are social constructions, yet nowhere does the DSMmention that mental illness is, in itself, a construct. Nor is there mention of how thevarious categories of disorder listed in the DSM are by-products of socially negotiatedpractices. The problem with the diagnoses listed within the DSM as Caplan (1996)describes is how \"these subjective determinants of diagnoses masquerade as solidscience and truth\" (Caplan, 1996. p. xvi). These truths can have serious consequences onpeople's lives. For example there is a common belief that alcohol abuse 'runs infamilies,' and if you come from an 'alcoholic home' you will either become an'alcoholic,' or become 'co-dependent.' While there likely is a genetic predisposition,this remains to be proven as no gene has yet been found. Meanwhile, some people livetheir lives as if genetics were fully to blame, which runs the risk of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy (Peele, 1995).In a similar vein, Kutchins and Kirk (1997) note that:The DSM can be an instrument that pathologizes those in our society who areundesirable and powerless; this occurs not because of any malicious intent butbecause of unspoken cultural biases about what should be considered normal andwhat should be considered disease (p. 19).113Foucault has argued along similar lines that the institution of psychiatry has thepower to shape the lives of individuals based on the norms of acceptable behavior, andtruth claims of certain discourses (Rabinow, 1984). In this way psychiatry becomes a\"dividing practice,\" separating the normal from the deviants, the sane from the insane(Foucault, 1986, p. 208).The impact of this perspectiveThe DSM locates mental illness 'in an individual.' This suggests that there issomething wrong with that individual's makeup. Tomm (1990) writes:The authors seemed oblivious to the theoretical significance of theirindividualistic presuppositions. There was no mention of the possibility ofanother point of view. They simply ignored the body of knowledge based on analternative assumption, namely that the human behavior, the mind, and itsdisorders, may be more fundamentally grounded in social phenomena thanindividual phenomena (p. 2).The diagnosis of mental illness has far-reaching consequences on a person'ssense of self and identity. The language of the DSM has the power to both construct andcolonizes a person's identity (Kutchins & Kirk, 1997). Coates and Wade (2007) inviteus to consider the inherent violations that occur in this 'benign languaging' of identitythat have serious implications for how people see themselves and the way that othersrelate to them. Sanders (1994), citing Karl Tomm writes:The diagnostic label imparts a defective personal identity to the patient, it willhenceforth identify him to others and will govern their conduct towards him, andhis towards them. The psychiatric nosologist, thus, not only describes his114patient's so called illness, but the ramifications of this description have beenhorrifying for many persons, who have experienced the debilitating andtotalizing effects of diagnostic labels in terms of self-blame, self loathing, andintense self monitoring (Sanders, 1994, p. 27).If the language we use constructs the reality we live in, then it is possible that theterminology of pathology trickles into the culture at large. Today it is commonplace forpeople to describe themselves and others by these DSM-IV based terms. For example,'I'm so depressed,' 'he's a sociopath,' 'I am bulimic' (Gergen, 1991). This way ofdescribing each other and ourselves has become so common that even children can notescape this rampant labelling. For example, the diagnosis of children with AttentionDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) reached epidemic proportions during the 1990s(Nylund, 2000). Gergen (1991) refers to the labels that are housed within the DSM as\"terms of mental deficit. They discredit the individual, drawing attention to problems,shortcomings, or incapacities\" (Gergen, 1991, p.13). As this occurs and the language ofthe medical profession becomes the language of the everyday\u2014even more specializeddiscourse needs to be created, and the public ever more relies on the medical professionin order to be 'cured' from their ailments (Gergen, 1991; McNamee, 2002).The use of the DSM in North America has become so commonplace that moreoften than not medical insurance companies often require individuals to have a DSMdiagnosis in order for them to receive help, and for practitioners to be compensated fortheir work (Cushman, 1995). The problem then expands; in order for people to receivehelp, they need to be 'diagnosed' which results in their being pathologized. On one handthey benefit from getting help, yet on the other they receive a label and its associated115stigma. As a notable conflict of interest, the APA is closely linked to thepharmaceutical industry, which contributes massive funding and monies to research andhospitals (Healy, 2004).What this means for this dissertationOf importance to this writing is how social construction and the narrative approachto therapy positions us to question the truth status that has been assigned to thediagnostic labels listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (APA, 2000) by muchof the larger health-care profession and society at large. When positioned as onepossible idea among many, we can question the impact that labels have on the clientswho consult us, as well as how it impacts our interactions and relationships with thoseclients. The writing of this dissertation has allowed me to question the utility of thoseideas and to privilege the young women's ideas about how to find freedom from theproblems with which they struggle.The intent of the DSM is not to locate problems in their socio-political context.Yet it is easy to see the relevancy of the socio-political context. The diagnosis of aneating disorder exists mainly in industrialized societies, and upwards of 90% ofdiagnoses pertains to young women. Many have experienced sexualized violence and/orabuse (Bordo, 2003). As well, activities that are focused on body size, appearance anddisplay women's bodies such as modelling, gymnastics, and ballet are often associatedwith increased rates of disordered eating (Maisel & Epston, 2004). Correspondingly,rates of substance misuse are found to be higher for people who live in poverty, have amental health diagnosis, are impacted by racism, homophobia, or disabilities, and haveexperienced sexualized violence or physical or emotional violence/abuse (Gitberg &116Van Wyk, 2004). To overlook the contributions of the socio-political context ofdiagnosis is a grave error, as we then pathologize individuals for their actions rather thanplacing them back in the socio-political context in which they belong (Waldegrave,Tamasese, Tuhaka, & Campbell, 2003). If we continue to look at problems asindividually based problems of 'the self' there is little space to include culture and theimportance of human relationships and connection on individuals actions. Thediagnostic criteria of the DSM leaves out the richness of human experience, and thecontext behind people's use, and the 'technical descriptions' of the diagnoses often lookvery different than peoples lived experiences with these diagnoses (Madsen, 1999).The Gergen's (1996) write: \"constructionism supports systemic views inproviding a rationale for therapists to step back from the typical 'rage to classify' clientsinto diagnostic categories and to canonize or universalize any particular mode oftreatment\" (Gergen & Gergen, p. 77). The social constructionist and postmodernframework in which this writing is located allows for the privileging of young women'sexperiences of substance misuse and disordered eating practices, rather than trying to fittheir experiences within the classifications of the DSM. Young women's experiences ofdistress can be dismissed when expert categories of health and illness are privileged. The DSM focuses on behaviour, while overlooking the personal experience andmeanings that these problems have in someone's life. The level of distress that a personfeels does not necessarily translate into meeting the DSM criteria for eating disorders orsubstance misuse.This dissertation describes an approach to working with the problems ofsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices that honours the young women's117knowledge of, and personal experience with, the problem. Stepping out of the \"rage toclassify\" (Gergen & Gergen, 1996, p. 77) allows us to step into relationships with ourclients, and co-construct preferred stories for their lives. Our questions becomeinquiries into trying to get a better sense of their experience, as opposed to askingquestions to determine if the client fits better in category A or B. My therapeuticapproach fits with what Michael White (1997), borrowing from what Geertz (1973),describes as contributing to thick or rich descriptions of persons lives, rather than thethin descriptions that are afforded by those based in the DSM (i.e. 'all people who havethese problems are like this').In ClosingIn summary, substance misuse and disordered eating have undergone manytransformations since their initial inception. I traced the history of substance use fromtheir natural forms, to the resulting chemical isolation of their psychoactive properties,their increased use by the medical community, and the criminalization of somenarcotics, which has created a large black market for these substances (Musto, 1992).The resulting effect of criminalization of drugs has negatively impacted the view of andtreatment of persons who use illicit substances (for example, illegal street drugs likeheroin, and cocaine), and misuse licit ones (for example, legal substances like alcoholand prescription medications). I also looked at the changes in our cultural understandingof substance use itself. I traced the history of food refusal, it first being a practiceassociated with female saints, its understanding based in religion. Later when foodrefusal could not be reduced to a definite biological cause it was understood as aproblem in the young women or in their relationships with others (especially their118mothers) (Gremillion, 2003). It wasn't until the 1960s that it was understood that thosestruggling with anorexia or bulimia had not lost their appetites, but rather they weredenying their appetites. Lastly, I discussed some of the historical and linguistic shifts that occurredmaking it possible for persons to be viewed as individuals. This dramatically changedthe way we began to view persons affected by the problems of substance misuse anddisordered eating. With this shift, both anorexia/bulimia and substance misuse began tobe viewed as biological problems in need of medicalized treatments. Seeing persons asindividuals paved the way for the dominant approach to mental illness as described bythe DSM (APA, 2000). The underlying 'biological' cause for both problems has yet tobe found, yet the search continues. In the next chapter, I offer an alternative perspectivefrom which to understand ourselves, the world around us, and the problems of substancemisuse and disordered eating practices.119CHAPTER 4SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONThis dissertation is located in the larger frame of postmodern and socialconstructionist thought (Gergen, 1991; Burr, 2003; Foucault, 1989). Socialconstructionism is a orientation that was developed by Berger and Luckmann (1966),Gergen, (1985, 1994, 1999), McNamee & Gergen, (2000), Anderson & Goolishian(1988) and John Shotter (1989) to name a few. This philosophical movement hasemerged over the last 30 years and is a radical departure from the ways in which wetraditionally understood reality (Gergen, 1985). As such, social constructionism has hadfar-reaching implications on how we understand self, identity, meaning and truth,dialogue, and the significance of relationships (McNamee, 2004a; Gergen, 2005). Asdescribed by Ken Gergen (1985) \"social constructionist inquiry is principally concernedwith explicating the processes by which people come to describe, explain, or otherwiseaccount for the world (including themselves) in which they live\" (p. 266).Social constructionism is a philosophical response to individualism, theenlightenment, and modernist ideas that have profoundly influenced how we understandthe individual and the world around us. To gain a sense of the significance of socialconstruction it is helpful to trace the history of the modernist and positivist ideas fromwhich social construction emerged. Prior to the 17th century, the Church and nobilitygoverned society in a manner that emphasized an unquestioned faith in God andreligion. People had little freedom of choice, and were expected to live life by thedoctrines of the church and as they were instructed. The Enlightenment era120philosophers Locke, Hume, Descartes, and other empiricists of the 17th century began topublicly question the taken for granted ideas of religion, the church and the power thatthese institutions held (Cushman, 1995; Gergen, 1985). The Enlightenment sought togrant power to each individual choice over their actions, and emphasized eachindividual's ability to think, to reason, and to observe, which threatened the sovereignrule of the church.23 Until this time, the church had ruled with unquestioned authority. Philosophers imagined a self that was separate from the dogma of the church,and a self that could reason independently from the will of God (Cushman, 1995).Reason and observation became one way that individuals could challenge the power ofthe Church. If through reason and observation individuals could choose courses ofaction that were appropriate for themselves they no longer had to rely on God's doctrinefor moral order and direction (Gergen, 1991).Rene Descartes (1596-1650) is described as being the father of modernphilosophy (Robinson & Groves, 2004) with the term Cartesian being coined from hisname (Burr, 2003). Rene Descartes' well-known quotation, \"I think, therefore I am,\" orCogito Ergo Sum (Robinson & Groves, p. 56) epitomizes the importance placed on eachindividual's ability to reason. Descartes prioritized the act of thinking (which hebelieved occurred in the mind) above all other forms of knowing. This revelation,referred to as the Enlightenment transformed the way in which self and activity wereconceptualized as we see the re-emergence of a dichotomy between the mind and body(Gergen, 2005). Geertz (1973) describes how the focus of the Enlightenment was tofind the essence or core of \"actual men\" (p. 51) and this was believed to be possible 23 I am referring solely to men as during this time period women were not believed to be capable ofrational thought.121once man was stripped down to the core. In order to truly know the individual, theculture surrounding the individual needed to be removed, and then the essence or\"natural man\" (Geertz, p. 51) was left to be seen and known.The Enlightenment prioritized knowledge that was based on fact, reason, andobservation. Descarte's 'Discourse on Method' (1637) introduced the idea of doubt, andprioritized objective certainty above all forms of knowing (Robinson & Groves, 2004).He began questioning all that he had previously known and taken for granted, believingthat our senses lie to us. Therefore he believed that we can only be certain of what weknow through reason derived from mathematics. The general consensus being that ifindividual's possessed enough knowledge then they could predict and control thebehaviours of others, the environment and, in theory, the world (Gergen, 2005). Societybegan to be conceptualized as composed of individual thinkers, and activities werefocused on the acquisition of knowledge (Gergen, 1985). During this time people beganto advocate for their own rights, and important advances in law, democratic thought, andinstitutions appeared (Gergen, 2005). Cushman (1995) writes, \"the self becameconstituted by rationality and the scientific empirical process, the material word becamethe realm properly controlled and dominated by humankind, and the new empiricalscience became the vehicle of domination and the measure of all things\" (p. 31).The Romantic period that followed the Enlightenment, with its emphasis onlove, powerful emotions, the soul, and \"the deep interior\" (Gergen, 1991, p. 20). Thiscontrasted the emphasis on reason alone that the Enlightenment proposed. During theRomantic period, art, poetry, and literature were celebrated, as were romantic notions oflove that are still prominent today.122Dating from the late 19th century, modernism brought with it a revitalization ofthe ideas of the enlightenment. Modernism emphasized individualism and privileged 'aself-contained' individual (Sampson, 1993). Individuals began to be conceptualized asindependent from the world around them, separate from their social context. Sampsondescribes the conditions that needed to occur in order for this to occur as:We first need to think of the self as a kind of bounded container, separate fromother similarly bounded containers and in possession or ownership of its owncapacities and abilities. In order to ensure this container's integrity we need tothink of whatever lies outside its boundaries as potentially threatening anddangerous, and whatever lies inside as sufficiently worthy to protect. Thesebeliefs establish a possessively individualistic view of the person and theassumption of a negative relation between the self and other, both of whichunderstandings permeate much of western civilization (p. 31).With these ideas firmly in place our modern day notion of the individual self wasborn (Gergen, 1989; Geertz, 1973; Sampson, 1993).Modernism is based in the philosophical approach known as positivism.Positivism describes knowledge as existing within the confines of observation, rationalethought and science. Armed with these tools, the researcher is positioned to discovernew knowledge. Gergen (2004) describes how these ideas are lodged in a\"metaphysical dualism\" (p. 46). He writes, \"here one presumes a real world (objective,material) somewhere 'out there' and a psychological world of the experiencing agent 'inhere'\" (Gergen, 2004, p. 46). He goes on to say, \"Knowledge is essentially achievedwhen the mind of the individual agent has mastered the complexities of the material123world. And this knowledge is ideally reduced to propositional networks (theories anddescriptions) for purposes of communication\" (p. 46).With people considered to be separate from their surroundings and others, peoplewere thought capable of observing the world in a non-biased way. Gergen (1991) writesthat \"reason and observation\" began to be seen 'as the central ingredients of humanfunctioning'\" (p. 19). Describing the traditional \"positivist-empiricist conception ofknowledge\" (Gergen, 1985, p. 266), Gergen writes how it is assumed that \"scientifictheory serves to reflect or map reality\" (p. 266). There are two popular understandingsof the way that information is garnered and transmitted. One view is that if we observethings correctly, then we can map and transmit our understanding of the world to others.In this approach, our knowledge is believed to mirror the way things actually are\u2014 outthere in the world\u2014\"knowledge copies (or should ideally copy) the contours of theworld\" (Gergen, p. 269). This is what Gergen refers to as the \"exogenic perspective\" (p.269). Gergen describes a second popular way of understanding knowledge as the\"endogenic perspective\" (p. 269). In this view, the drive to think is internal and inherentto humans. This view of human nature is the foundation for the popular cognitivebehavioural approach to therapy (Gergen). Traditional approaches viewthinking/knowledge as an internal individual mental process that can be measured(Gergen, 1994), for example through intelligence tests.Within this paradigm, language becomes an expression of the mind (Gergen,1985). Indeed, in a modernist perspective, language is representative of reality; when aperson speaks, s/he is expressing what is in his/her mind, and the knowledge that s/hepossesses. Now people can describe their private world of mental events, what they124think, what they see, what they feel, and what they know (Gergen). The above conceptsunderscore our current notions of scientific progress and universal knowledge, whichpervades universities, positivism, scientific classifications and individualism.Relationships, Language, and RealitySocial constructionism offers another perspective illuminating how we come toknow what we know, a perspective that privileges language and relationships as centralto our understanding and the co-creation of our world. In this way, language is a way toshare and build information and knowledge, a conduit of knowledge. From a socialconstructionist perspective, our words do more than transmit information: they constructand constitute our understanding of our world (McNamee, 2004b). This section willdescribe some of the central assumptions behind social constructionism, specifically thecentrality of language, meaning making, relationships, and reality.The power of language in the construction of realityWhile the modernist view of language contends that language represents reality,social constructionism proposes that our language use constructs reality (Gergen, 1989).This means that through our language use, we actively construct the world around us inrelationship with others. Language plays a central role in how we make and sharemeaning (Gergen & Gergen, 2003). Through language we communicate, describe,explain, organize and make sense of each other and our surroundings. Language doesnot simply refer to the words we use, but also encompasses our body movements, ourtone of voice, and the subtleties of how we use words (Andersen, 1992, 1998).125The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's ideas regarding language have stronglyinfluenced social constructionist thought. Wittgenstein proposed that we \"look at theway we use the word to find out what it means\" (de Shazer, 1985, p. 89). Words inthemselves do not mean anything, or hold any particular essence or meaning; it isthrough the use of words that they gain their meaning (Wittgenstein, 1953). AsSampson (1993) writes \"our task is to examine how language used in the public, socialworld of communication between people holds the key to our understanding\" (p. 98).The words we use constitute the reality in which we are surrounded. While I can say thatI feel sad, or disappointed, Wittgenstein proposes that the words we use, for examplesad or disappointed, do not in themselves reflect actual inner mental representations(Gergen, 1989). Rather, our words are brought to life through social interactions.Through language we create and bring things, ideas, and objects to life.One can only participate in language once we know the rules of language andthese rules determine how we use language. Social constructionism emphasizes how\"words gain their meaning through their use in social interchange, within the 'languagegames' of the culture\" (Gergen, 1991, p. 102). Wittgenstein's (1953) concept oflanguage games describes how the use of language is an activity and there are socialrules governing the ways in which we use words. For example, in order for us to haveconversations with one another there needs to be some shared understanding of whatwords means, in order for us to understand and converse with one other. Socialconstructionism proposes we have arrived at this shared consensus in relationships withone another. As McNamee has described, we co-ordinate our actions with others, andrituals and patterns emerge, as do, rules, expectations and standards of behaviour, and126corresponding beliefs and values (McNamee, 1992; McNamee & Gergen, 1999). Thefocus then becomes on what we are creating together, in a performance with the otherthrough dialogue.In order to have conversations with others there needs to be agreed upon socialconventions as to how we will use language such as greeting a person with the words'hello' and departing with the word 'goodbye.' If we greeted a stranger by saying'goodbye' at the outset of the conversation, we would be breaking the conventionalagreed upon rules of language use. These rules emerge out of daily use, as do themeanings of the words we use and they are affected by their historical and contextualsurroundings. We socially agree on what words 'mean' and in doing so language is notneutral. We can accomplish things with language for example, someone can be'sentenced to death' or someone can be given a new identity, 'she is an alcoholic.'In addition, the idea that \"the meanings carried by language are never fixed,always open to question, always contestable, always temporary\u2014is fundamental to poststructuralism and has major implications for our understanding of the person, theiridentity and the possibilities for personal and social change\" (Burr, 2003, p. 53). Thereare many examples of the wide changes that have occurred in our word usage and somewords are virtually obsolete after many years of non-use. These changes support socialconstructionists claim towards anti-essentialism. If words described the 'real' truth, oressence of something, then with the exception of the object disappearing there should beno way to explain a word falling out of usage, especially if what it describes is 'thetruth.' This supports social constructionists practice of not defining people in127essentialist terms. People are not thought to have an essence or true self; instead peopleare always changing and renegotiating themselves depending on their surroundings.Relational BeingsMeaning making is not something that happens in isolation, it is co-constructed.As McNamee (2004b) writes, \"to the constructionist, meaning making is a relationalactivity\" (p. 39). Relationships play a crucial role in how we come to know ourselves,the world around us, and in the creation of knowledge. Within a social constructionistapproach, people are seen as socially co-creating and co-constructing the world inlanguage through interactions with each other. Social construction takes a profoundshift from modernist ways of knowing and proposes that it is through our relationshipsthat things come into being. Relationships create knowledge, language, and our sense ofsense. What we do with each other takes precedence, over what we independently thinkor observe.From a social constructionist perspective, there can be no knowledge withoutrelationships, as knowledge is created in our relationships with others. John Shotter(1999) writes \"all our meaningful social practices originate in and develop asrefinements of the spontaneous, responsive reactions occurring between us, out in theworld. Meaning originates between us not from within us\" (p. 129). Relationships arethe starting place for understanding the world and through relationships we negotiateagreed upon meanings and use for language, and that together creates knowledge.Knowledge has its roots in shared interactions with others and is gained through socialexchanges, relationships, and dialogue (Gergen & Gergen, 1996). As Vivian Burr128(2003) writes, \"Knowledge is therefore seen not as something that a person has ordoesn't have, but as something that people do together\" (p. 9).Power and Social ConstructionismSocial constructionism proposes that what we see and believe to be true has itsroots in communal exchanges with others and these exchanges are agreed upon bygroups of people as being the right or correct way of doing or thinking about things(Gergen, 1989). These collectively agreed upon ideas are integrated into the everydayfabric our lives (in a way that we can no longer see where they began) and granted thestatus of truth (McNamee, 2006). In these social exchanges, certain things areoverlooked while other things are granted a superior status. Social constructionismencourages us to look at how we come to know what we know and how taken forgranted ideas become such. In doing so social construction takes a hard look at\u2014andquestions\u2014our taken for granted ideas of truth. Why is this truth greater than that one,who benefits from one truth prevailing over another, and how did this occur (McNamee& Gergen, 1999)? This is especially relevant to consider when discourses becomefactified, for example the discourses of psychiatry, psychology and science.Ken Gergen (1991) writes: \"If our discourses are not derived from the facts, butonce embraced they create what we take to be the factual world, then a morecritical look at these discourses is in order\" (p. 96).To expand on social constructionist concepts of truth, I will discuss Foucault'sconcept of power/knowledge, which he describes as being inexplicably linked.Foucault's idea of power/knowledge differs from traditional ideas of power.Traditionally, moments or processes where an individual is seen as gaining power are129linked to the possession of knowledge. Instead, Foucault as quoted by Sarup (1993)argues, \"knowledge is a power over others, the power to define others\" (p. 67).Foucault, a French historian and philosopher, describes individuals as beingconstituted or made up by power relations. He addresses the ways in which disciplinarypower positions people as subjects or things to be acted upon (Foucault, 1980). Foucaultdescribes power not as a 'thing' to be had or owned, as it is not a commodity, but asbeing constructed with others in relationship.Foucault uses Jeremy Bentham's Pancopticon, a model for a prison, to illustratehow a discourse of social control is created (Foucault, 1979). The Pancopticon wasconstructed in such a way that the guard's tower was positioned in the centre of circularprison cells, which allowed the guards a constant watch over the prisoners. Because ofthe way the prison was constructed, the prisoners never knew when they were beingwatched and so they began to monitor their own actions and watch themselves(Foucault, 1979). Similar to Bentham's prisoners, people become subjects of power asthey begin to conform to the norms set out for them in society. Foucault makes referenceto how power is tolerable only on the condition that it masks a substantial part of itself.He writes, \"its success is proportional to its ability to hide its own mechanisms\"(Foucault, 1978, p. 86).The idea that people are under constant surveillance also offers insight into themechanics of problems such as body policing. The prevalence of the dominantdiscourses and pressures surrounding thinness and beauty in western society assures thatpersons are never free of the 'body police.' People watch their bodies (while alsoassuming that others are watching their bodies) in ways that may lead to their trying to130have their bodies conform to the standards of how they should look. Persons internalizeand monitor themselves to fit in to the standardized notions of what has been deemedattractive. The internalization of thinness as the correct way to be results in thesubjectification of persons and can help explain the collective dieting epidemicoccurring in most westernized cultures.In North America, the discourses that have traditionally influenced us and thatare often automatically granted a 'truth status' include economics, science, education,and medicine, to name a few. For example, a medical doctor could diagnose a patient ashaving bulimia, and because of the power relations involved in a doctor/patientrelationship, the patient may not question or challenge the diagnosis, and they willaccept that they 'have bulimia.' In fact, they might even start to refer to themselves as'a bulimic' or 'I am bulimic,' and, in time, this diagnosis might become part of, or all of,how they define themselves. According to Stephen Madigan (1998) the dominantdiscourse refers to\u2014what can be said, who can say it, and with what authority. If amedical doctor says you are bulimic and writes it in your chart, then you are. Our wordsare not neutral and they have serious consequences on the lives of others. Being able todefine someone's identity in ways that benefit you provides you with certain advantagesover other people (Burr, 2003; Foucault, 1982). For example, depending on yourlocation in western categories of wellness and mental illness, you may experiencecertain advantages or disadvantages based on how you are situated. If someone islabelled as mentally ill s/he might not enjoy such freedoms or rights as someone whohas not been defined as such.131Cushman (1995) makes reference to how the helping professions inadvertentlybenefit from having both a steady supply of mental illnesses and patients. He writes:Without psychotherapists realizing it, our theories have reflected the post-WorldWar II consumer landscape, normalized it necessary ingredients such as theempty self, and explained away its unavoidable consequences, such as emotionalisolation, selfishness, drug addiction, and the nihilistic use of others.Psychotherapy theories consider these consequences to be anomalies, deviationsfrom the healthy norm and therefore we set out to heal them (p. 277-278).He goes on to say that unwittingly our willingness to pathogolize those thingsthat could in fact be considered normal, creates the very 'patients' that we then treat(Cushman, 1995).Subjugated KnowledgeAs shown above, language has the power to define others, and thereby positionsus in specific ways in society. This positioning may be to our advantage ('I am asuccessful lawyer'), or to our detriment ('I am mentally ill') (Harre, 1990). In time, webegin to experience ourselves through the stories that we and others use to describeourselves. These stories can define what is possible for us, as our identities are createdin and through discourse. To quote Burr (2003) \"once we take up a subject position indiscourse, we have available to us a particular, limited set of concepts, images,metaphors, ways of speaking, self-narratives, and so on that we take on as our own\" (p.119). This is how power is constitutive in shaping our identities, and how the words weuse influence how we describe and experience the world and the people in it.132Foucault invites us to take a critical look at the process by which ideas andconcepts become normalized and taken for granted while other possibilities fall to thewayside. This intentional re-storying of history constitutes the 'knowledge' that we holdand 'truth claims' we make about the way things are (Foucault, 1980). On the otherhand, \"subjugated knowledge\" (Foucault, 1980, p. 81) refers to the historical ideas,theories, knowledge and events that are written out of history, as others are privileged,elevated to a truth status, and become unquestioned, the real chain of events. One coulddescribe subjugated knowledge as traditional or alternative health practices that do notfall within standardized western medical practices. Western medicine has beencentralized and granted hegemony to diagnose, treat, and cure people who are ill,thereby locating other healing practices (homeopathy or traditional Chinese medicine,for example) as 'alternative' (Madigan, 1992). Narrative therapist Michael White(1989) introduced the concept of subjugated knowledge into the field of therapy and heillustrates how therapists can work in ways that privilege their clients' subjugatedknowledge to re-author their lives in ways that they prefer. Foucault's (1980) ideas of\"subjugated knowledge\" (p. 81) remind us of the many truths and various ways ofseeing the world. When Foucault's ideas collide with therapeutic ideas the results can belibratory (Mart\u00edn-Bar\u00f3, 1994).Foucault's later writing focuses on the usefulness of power. He writes:We must cease once and for all to describe the effects of power in negativeterms: it 'excludes', it 'represses', it 'censors', it 'abstracts', it 'masks', it'conceals.' In fact, power produces; it produces reality, it produces domains of133objects and rituals of truth. The individual and the knowledge that may be gainedof him belong to this production (Foucault, 1979, p. 194).Within this frame, power is seen as producing reality; it \"produces domains ofobjects and rituals of truth\" (Sarup, 1993. p. 74). This view of power positions peopleas active agents in their lives and creates space for people to resist power that isoppressive. Utilizing subjugated knowledge and stepping 'out of the box' of traditionaltherapies can be an act of resisting power, and opening up new possibilities for people intheir lives.Social Constructionism, This Writing, and TherapyGergen and Gergen (1996) borrowing from the ideas of Wittgenstein, write, \"ifour language forms the limits of our relationship, than expanding the languages of thetherapeutic relationship may offer the greatest liberatory potential for participation incultural life\" (p.80). Social constructionism allows us to step outside of the totalizingand essentialist language of traditional psychology (Burr, 2003), and to question thetruth claims of psychiatric diagnosis, labels, and the idea of static personalities. In otherwords, it enables us to co-create new possibilities with our clients.Within this dissertation, social construction as an approach allows for new andgenerative ways of engaging with the young women struggling with disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse. Steve de Shazer (1993) quoting Wittgenstein writes,\"All of the facts belong only to the problem, not to its solutions\" (p. 85). And if we takethe facts to be constructions then we can question them looking at the real effects thefacts have on clients lives. Now we are positioned to talk to the solutions, to the youngwoman's hopes and preferences for her life.134In a social constructionist stance, therapists are not positioned as all knowingexperts set to tell their clients what is wrong with them. Instead we are positioned aslisteners (Andersen, 1992a), and conversational partners (Anderson & Goolishian, 1992)positioned to help keep the conversation going. In order to do this, we need tocoordinate our meaning with the other as opposed to putting our meaning on the other(McNamee & Gergen, 1999). Instead of listening to figure out what is occurring withintheir mind or listening with the intent to label or diagnose, we listen with the intent ofentering into a dialogue that is transformative. The focus is to open up conversationalspace rather than shutting it down. For example, if my identity is totalized and renderedto a label of an alcoholic, where do I go from there? What possibility does this mean formy life? It shuts down possibilities rather than opening new ones. Tom Andersen writes(1998), \"the listener is not only a receiver of a story, but also by being present, anencouragement to the act of making the story. And that act is the act of constitutingone's self\" (p. 66).As previously mentioned in chapter 1, social construction has influencednarrative therapies and creates new possibilities for therapists working with youngwomen whose identities have been constituted by problems new places to stand whichmay allow them to say \"Now I know how to go on!\" (Andersen, 1998, p. 79).The following chapter details the narrative methodological approach to co-research used in this study.135CHAPTER 5A NARRATIVE CO-RESEARCHMETHODOLOGICAL APPROACHIn this chapter, I detail a methodology that prioritizes the usefulness of theresearch to the participants involved. Rather than participating in an inquiry processwhere research is done to participants\u2014I propose a research style that is more of a doingwith. I will outline the ideas informing a qualitative narrative methodological approachto co-research, and describe the steps I took while conducting the research.The term co-research, as I am using it, stems from the ideas described by NewZealand narrative therapist David Epston (1999). He describes a process whereby theperson being consulted is believed to have knowledge about his or her own personalexperience that others, including professionals, cannot know or possess. This positionmakes possible \"the co-production of knowledge by sufferers and therapist\" (Epston, p.142). There are many ways to describe the process by which the researcher consultswith his or her clients (Katz & Shotter, 1996; Shotter 1986). Before elaborating on the contributions ofthe above writers, I wish to describe a brief history of the ideas that have contributed tothe evolution of the research practices I describe.My research approach can be contrasted to the modernist understandings ofscience described in the previous chapter. There I noted the traditions that began toappear in the sixteenth century (Cushman, 1995), that were strongly grounded in ideasof science and empirical knowing.136The ideas of the enlightenment, and modernism\u2014with their focus on essences,progress, observation, science, truth and knowledge\u2014contributed to the ideas ofempirical research. Social constructionist Ken Gergen (2005) describes five guidingprinciples of empirical research: \"remain dispassionate...control theconditions...convert observation to numerals... for the answer... and ...separatetruth from practice\" (p. 91-93). At the centre of empirical research is the search for thetruth, for the one single truth.In order to find the truth, empirical researchers position the research participantsas objects where they are done to and acted upon. The researcher is positioned as thesubject, separate from, yet looking in on those being studied (Parker, 2005). From thisperspective the researcher is located as outside of the research and positioned as anobjective observer, disconnected from, and not influenced by or influencing the researchparticipants. Empirical research assumes that researchers can yield a precise andunbiased understanding of the research participants' experiences and tends to bequantitative in nature. Scientific knowledge is exalted and granted a privileged statusover other ways of knowing\u2014the emphasis being on rational thought and on \"absoluteforms of knowledge\" (Crotty, 1998, p. 185).Philosophical HermeneuticsMartin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer are two 20th century philosopherswho influenced social science research by their views regarding the interaction thatoccurs between text and reader and ideas of the centrality of language (Eagleton, 1983).Heidegger felt that language breathed life into our existence, and is what creates the137world (Eagleton). Central to their work is the notion that in order to understand andinterpret literary texts, the texts needs to be considered in the historical and culturalcontext in which they are embedded. Heidegger proposed that the researcher's pre-understandings shape, influence, and inform the researcher's understandings of what itis that s/he is studying (Eagleton). Building on this notion, Gadamer proposed that theperson reading the text brings his or her presupposed knowings that influences his or herinterpretation and understanding of the texts (Eagleton). This understanding is not fixedin time; rather it changes with time\u2014this he referred to as our 'horizon ofunderstanding' (Gergen, 1991, p. 104). Both Heidegger and Gadamer \"argued that it isnot possible to exist as a human outside of a cultural context\" (Cushman, 1995, p. 20).Gadamer also proposed that language and understanding is a shared or \"social matter\"(Eagleton, p. 71). As a result, understanding is produced in dialogue (Gehart,Tarragona, & Bava, 2007). Given that understanding occurs with others and isinfluenced by our pre-understandings or biases, we can never be sure that we know thetruth of a matter. Gadamer questioned whether it is possible for a researcher to bedetached from the research that s/he studies (Gehart, Tarragona, & Bava). His ideas areimportant in regards to this dissertation as he proposes that all knowing needs to beplaced within its cultural context.Research and Social ConstructionSome of the new developments in research methodology were a response to theresearch practices of the sixties where research participants were treated as subjects andat times perhaps unethically done to or acted upon (Parker, 2005). Using a138constructionist stance positions the researcher to embrace the diversity that exists in theworld, privileges relationships, views language as generative, and aims to have multipletruths and perspectives co-exist. Constructionist research allows for the researcher tobring his or her biases and knowledge of what is being studied to the work. Theresearcher's knowledge is not seen as something that hinders the research. Rather it isseen to enhance it.Sheila McNamee (1989) advocates for \"blurring the distinction\" betweentherapy and research (p. 96). \"Blurring the distinction\" (McNamee, p. 96) embraces thesimilarities between research and therapy. Research becomes therapeutic and therapy aform of research. For example, in therapy, a therapist investigates the life of theproblem and the ways that it impacts the person s/he is speaking with, and an interviewfor research can be experienced as therapeutic. By stepping out of the traditionalconfines of researcher and therapist, I believe that the manner in which I conducted theinterviews with the young women, allowed for this blurring to occur.The History of Co-research/Collaborative Research/Narrative InquiryThe ideas of co-research have a rich tradition. Edward Bruner (1986) describedhow there is no clear distinction between researcher and researched yet how we have afalse sense of separation. Coming from this perspective, the researcher is no longerpositioned to discover (Bruner) new universal knowledge. Rather, the researcher ispositioned to resurrect subjugated or local knowledges (Geertz, 1983; Foucault, 1980)with those being researched, and this resurrection occurs in dialogue. Borrowing fromEpston (1999; Maisel, Epston & Borden, 2004) I use the term 'insiders' to refer to the139young women as it is a term that honours and elevates the young women's localknowledge as a result of their personal experience with substance misuse and disorderedeating practices. Insiders, is a term that refers to 'subjugated knowledges' whichFoucault (1980) defines as \"knowledges that survive only at the margins of society andare lowly ranked\" (p. 81) compared to so-called expert or professional knowledge.Collaborative research, as described by Andersen (1997), re-positions thetherapist (researcher) and client (researched) as exerting influence on each other. Fromthis perspective, knowledge and ideas are not contained in people. Rather, these areprocesses that occur between people (McNamee & Gergen, 1999). As Edward Bruner(1986) writes, \"Our ethnographies are coauthored, not simply because informantscontribute data to the text, but because . . . ethnographer and informant come to sharethe same narratives\" (p. 148).It is through collaboration, dialogue, conversation and our relationships withothers that the generation of new knowledge and meaning is co-constructed. There is nopresumption that the therapist does not influence the client, nor is it possible for theclient to not influence the therapist. The implications of this premise change the natureof our research. The focus changes from a doing to to a doing with. No longer can theresearcher remain a separate and unbiased observer regarding the entity s/he studies(McNamee, 1988). We cannot remove observer bias as it is embedded in the languagethat we use (Gehert, Tarragona, & Bava, 2007).140 Co-research Within the Field of TherapyCollaboration in the field between therapists and clients can be traced to thework of Tom Andersen (1987, 1991, 1992a, 1992b). Andersen derived a method inwhich he broke some of the 'rules' of therapy and brought into the open the privateconversations that therapists and consultants were having about their clients. He cameto call this work reflecting teams (Andersen, 1991). I will briefly describe this process.The therapist has a conversation with the family while team members watch. At anappropriate time in the course of this conversation, and with the permission of thefamily the therapist asks questions of the reflecting team members, inviting theirideas/thoughts/opinions about what the family and therapist have just discussed. Oncethe therapist and team members have had a conversation with each other, the family andtherapist converse about what they have heard.It is my understanding that these conversations generate new knowledge asconversations are built upon and added to. The families can correct or highlight whatthey are most interested in and what resonated for them. This process also forcestherapists to be more respectful of the words/descriptions they use to describe families.In Andersen's words, \"nasty\" (1991, p. 58) reflections were avoided. Andersen's workcan be seen as revolutionary as it challenged the idea that professionals know moreabout their clients' lives than the clients do. Reflecting teams positioned families andclients as having insight, awareness, and hopes about and for their own lives. Andersendescribed this work as creating more \"egalitarian relationships\" (p. 66) between clientsand therapists.141When describing his therapeutic approach Tom Andersen (1992b) writes, \"I cansay that theories and methods have been relegated to the backseat whereas relationships,language and prior assumptions have been given more attention\" (p. 87). In a similarvein, rather then prioritizing the research that I was conducting, I prioritized therelationship and the conversation that was unfolding between myself and the youngwomen that I was interviewing at the time.Harlene Anderson and Harry Goolishian introduced the idea \"the language thatwe use makes us who we are in the moment we use it\" into therapeutic practice (ascited in Andersen, 1992a, p. 64). In therapy and in co-research we are co-creating withclients their knowing of themselves, and our knowings of them, at that moment.Together at the Galveston Institute Anderson and Goolishian (1992) developed atherapy process where they positioned themselves as learners and the client as theexpert. Rather than make hypotheses about clients, they consulted with them, they tooka 'not knowing stance' and let the client lead the conversation. The therapist is simplyan expert in creating conversational space (Anderson & Goolishian), follows the clientsstory and the therapist's questions are informed by their curiosities rather thanassumptions or beliefs about what the client means or what the solution to their problemis. Their approach to therapeutic conversations placed therapeutic questions as tools toopen up space in a conversation in order to loosen the grip that the problems had overpeople, rather than as interventions, or to affirm assumptions the therapist had madeabout the client (Anderson & Goolishian).As mentioned in chapters one and two, narrative therapists White and Epston(1990) catapulted the idea of narrative and collaboration into therapy. They positioned142themselves as experts in the therapeutic process but not on the lives of the clients whosought consultation They made transparent their position that the client is the expert onhis or her own life. David Epston (1999) connects co-research to the work ofphilosopher Michel Foucault. Epston writes, \"The philosopher Michel Foucault advisedthe documentation, authentication and circulation of 'alternative knowledges' if theywere to do what he proposed was their work\u2014that of critique\" (Epston, p. 6). Co-research generates 'alternate knowledge' as it makes space for the knowledge of theyoung women to be brought forward. This knowledge is often in stark contrast to theknowledge generated by psychiatrists, physicians, psychologists and other professionalswho have been granted the power to label and diagnose others. Alternative knowledgealso refrains from positioning the young women as objects to be studied, which Foucaulthas written extensively about (1980).Positioning oneself as a co-researcher makes space for the generation of \"insiderknowledge\" (Epston, 1999, p. 3). Insider knowledge is distinct from ideas ofprofessional knowledge. These knowledges are often overlooked, and called local or\"subjucated knowledges\" (Foucault, 1980, p. 81). Epston's approach brings the voicesand wisdom of the young women to the foreground. Describing co-research he writes,\"co-research implies, firstly, that the answer is unknown but, secondly, that it can bediscovered by an experimental attitude on a day-to-day basis\" (p. 4). David Epson hasused co-research with a wide range of people and problems. For example he hasconsulted with young children suffering with medical problems, young womenstruggling with anorexia and bulimia, and men under the influence of depression (1989,1993, 1999).143Arlene Katz and John Shotter (Katz & Mishler, 2003; Shotter, 1983, 1993, 1995;Shotter & Katz, 1996, 1999, 2004) have written extensively about the ways that clientsand therapist lean into one another and become mutually responsive to the other. Theydescribe a synchronizing that occurs in the presence of another in actions, words,movement and body (2004). They introduce yet another way of conceptualizing thetherapeutic process, one where therapist and client inform what occurs between them.In this process there is an intentional 'dwelling' in words that resonate deeply withtherapist and client, and from this place, new possibilities for hearing, speaking, andways to go forward arise. Katz and her colleagues (Katz & Shotter, 1996; Katz,Conant, Inui, Baron, Bor, 2000; Katz & Mishler) have conceptualized a style of co-research that brings in the voice of the client to inform the creation of new knowledge.What is exciting about their collaborative research practices is how it has beenconducted within health care settings and the field of medicine, which traditionally havebeen dominated by quantitative research methodology and practices.Co-research has also been used in the field of education. Paulo Freire (1989) aBrazilian educator, was responsible for teaching poor and illiterate adults in LatinAmerica. Freire believed that through pedagogy, individuals and communities couldfind liberation. He describes liberatory education as a form of education where theteachers allow themselves to be taught and educated by their 'students.' Freire writes,Through dialogue the teacher-of-the students and the students-of-the-teacher and a new term emerges: teacher-student with student-teachers. Theteacher is no longer merely the one-who-teaches, but one who is himself taught indialogue with the students, who in turn while being taught also teach. They144become jointly responsible for a process in which all grow [italics added foremphasis] (1989, p. 67).Narrative Analysis \"Narrative analysis\u2014and there is no one method here\u2014has to do with howprotagonists interpret things, and how we can go about interpreting their interpretations\"(Bruner, 1990, p. 51).One could say that it has always been through narrative and telling stories thatpeople have made sense of events (Bruner, 1990). But what does the word narrativemean? Riessman (2002) points out that there are many definitions but not muchconsensus. I found the description given by White and Epston (1990) satisfying. Theywrite:In striving to make sense of life, persons face the task of arranging theirexperiences of events in sequences across time in such a way to arrive at acoherent account of themselves and the world around them. Specificexperiences of events of past and present, and those that are predicted to occur inthe future, must be connected in a lineal sequence to develop this account (p.10).The interest in narrative as a qualitative research approach has been described asthe \"narrative turn\" (Riessman, 2005, p. 1) in social sciences. In France, developmentsin structuralism in the late 1960s contributed to theories of narrative (Barthes, in Thody& Course, 1997; de Strauss, 1976; Herman, Jahn &Ryan, 2005) and narrative research has been described as an approach that cuts acrossdisciplines (Riessman, 2002; Herman et al.). It has been used in social work,145anthropology, psychology, and medicine (Riessman, 2005). I used a narrative qualitativeinquiry in this dissertation, as it was the method that resonated the most for me and onethat I felt was the most respectful with the young women's words. It allowed theirexperiences and their stories to be told in a way that honoured what it was that theyshared with me. It also allowed me to create a theory out of the resulting data, ratherthan create a theory and then find data that support it.It is my understanding that co-research and narrative analysis arecomplementary, as within this process both researcher and researched are seen as activeparticipants, contributing to the \"construction of the text\" (Riessman, 2005, p. 5). Theyoung women and I both participated in the conversation, co-constructing andgenerating ideas as we talked. I have not just included the young women's words orresponses to my questions. Rather both our contributions are included in the writing.Throughout the research process, during the creation of the interview questions, the fieldnotes I wrote, selecting sections of the transcripts, all these acts positioned myself as anactive participant in the research process and as interpreter of the text. \"Just as interviewparticipants tell stories, investigators construct stories from their data\" (Riessman, 2008,p. 4).Similar to grounded theory based on the work of Glaser and Strauss (1967)groupings or categories were generated from the interviews with the young women.From these grouping I organized the young women's narratives into themes that hademerged (or that I interpreted) from the data (Riesmann, 2005). In both narrativeanalysis and grounded theory it is the data that generate the theory, rather than thetheory generating the data.146Why this Approach FitsThe research that I conducted occurred while interviewing the young women(Andersen, 1997). In this process both myself and the young women werepivotal\u2014together we generated new paradigms from which to move forward. Thequestions that I posed brought forward their tellings and experiences of substancemisuse and disordered eating practices. Their answers then informed the questions that Iasked them and the other young women I had yet to interview. I am not an objectiveresearcher and I must acknowledge that I bring with me to all the conversations that Ihave had, all of my years of schooling, years of doing therapy with people strugglingwith disordered eating practices and substance misuse, and my personal experience ofliving as a woman in a culture where thinness and body image issues regularly confrontme. I cannot leave these things at the door. Instead they came into the room with mewhen I met with the young women that I interviewed. The young women brought withthem their struggles with disordered eating practices and substance misuse and all ofwho they are to the interview. In this sense, I could not walk away from the researchprocess with a clear sense of this is the sole truth of these problems, because each youngwomen's experience is different and each conversation generated something new.I used a narrative co-research analysis to:1) Explore the young women's account of the problems of disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse, and how these problems contributed totheir sense of self1472) Locate these problems in their social context and discuss the youngwomen's experience of how society may contribute to these discoursesand the problem's development3) Illuminate their voices and wisdom regarding how these problems worktogether and ways that therapists, family members and their own insiderknowledge may help other young women and themselves in findingfreedom from these problemsThe Research ProcessI decided at the outset of my research that there were certain research practicesthat I did not want to replicate. I once worked in a youth secure custody centre, andUniversity students would come in and interview the youth with questionnaires aboutwhatever it was that they were studying and then the researchers would leave. I wouldwatch the youth be called from their cells and enter the room with the researchers. Froman outsider perspective, the youth appeared to be 'studied and watched,' as if they wereinside of a fishbowl\u2014the researchers looking in, trying to make sense of the youths'behaviour. Later, some of the youth described the interviews as being hard, having beenasked about personal and difficult details of their lives. Something unsettled me aboutwatching and hearing this. It didn't seem right; the youth seemed too vulnerable. Iwondered who benefited from this experience\u2014the researchers or the researched? Theresearchers had gathered their data and were presumably content once the interviewsended. But what about the youth? What about the conversations or memories that had148been re-membered or touched upon? How was this of use to them? What did they gainfrom having their lives and experiences studied and 'dissected' in this way?With this in mind, I began imagining this dissertation and how it might unfold. Iknew the type of research in which I did not want to participate. I knew that I wanted toco-create something with the young women who I planned to interview. I also knewthat in dialogue something new would be created. I wanted the youth to get as much outof this as I thought that I and the other therapists, parents, teachers, and other health careproviders, who would subsequently be reading it, would be getting out of it. I did notwant them to tell me personal details about their lives just for the sake of the telling orbecause they had been asked. The questions needed to have a sense of purpose and bevery intentional. I wanted the youth to experience a sense of connection and engagementwith the ideas that we were exploring. I wanted them to have a sense of havingconnected more with what they knew about the inner-workings of substance misuse anddisordered eating while also having more ideas about what they needed to do to stay freefrom them. I did not want the youth walking away or waking up the next morningregretting what they had said, thinking that they had said too much or feeling as if theyhad been talked over or down to as if their ideas were second to mine.I did my best to ensure that this interview would be therapeutic, borrowing fromKarl Tomm's adaptation of Humberto Maturana's and Francisco Varela's ideasregarding love and its needed presence in the field of therapy (Maturana & Varela,1987). Karl Tomm (Tomm, Hoyt & Madigan, 2001) describes how we can choose toparticipate in practices of therapeutic love or therapeutic violence. In a conversationwith Stephen Madigan (Tomm, Hoyt & Madigan), Tomm in149the way that Maturana [Maturana & Varela] does, to talk about opening space for theexistence of the other\" (p. 256). Therapeutic violence, Tomm describes, shuts downpossibilities and can include knowledge that is possessed by a certain group ofprofessionals and is often used at the expense of others, to label them or to pathologizethem. For example, as Tomm (1990) describes the information contained within theDSM could be called therapeutic violence, as:The labelling process initiates permanent stigmatizing patterns of socialinteraction in the human network of relationships in which a person so embeddedis embedded. A person, once authoritatively labelled a schizophrenic is nevertreated the same again in his or her social network (p. 3). In order to avoid practices of therapeutic violence and to open up space for newand unimagined possibilities, I positioned the young people as the experts on their ownlives (White & Epston, 1990), prioritizing their lived experiences rather than the ideas ofother professionals or information contained within the DSM.The questions that I asked during our interviews were very intentional. I askedquestions about their ideas, about how these problems worked, and positioned the youngwomen as insiders and co-researchers (Epston, 1999), rather than as people who arebeing studied and in need of help. From this place, therapist and client can explore theways in which the problems under consideration work in their lives and the minutedetails and implications that it can have in people's lives. In order to position the youngwomen as co-researchers rather than 'subjects,' the young women needed to bepositioned and I needed to really believe and see the young women as the expert of theirown lives (White & Epston 1990; Anderson & Goolishan, 2000) with knowledges and150preferences for the direction of their lives. I asked questions that I was genuinelycurious about and to which I really didn't know the answers. With this framework asmy foundation, together we were both ready to go forward in conversation to discoverthe ways that substance misuse and disordered eating practices worked in their lives.And in this way, 'we' both gained a clearer understanding of these problems.I sought to know more about the ways that the problems worked in their livesand with each other, rather than trying to discern 'what was wrong with them' or 'whythey had these problems.' This position distinguishes postmodern social constructionpractices apart from more modernist ways of knowing and working. I consider theaforementioned practices having contributed to a foundation from which to moveforward, and this foundation contributed to the richness of our interviews, and what waspossible for the young women to speak with me about. And importantly, it made spacefor the young women to reflect on and consider the aspects of disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse that were relevant and important to them at this time intheir lives. I credit these practices to the young women's descriptions of our interviewsas being useful to them.Participant Selection CriteriaThe research described in this dissertation is based on semi-structured interviewswith 12 young women. All the young women interviewed were either attending or hadattended Peak House, a residential substance misuse program for youth. Thus, they hadall self-identified as having a substance misuse problem. There was, therefore, no needto meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for Substance Dependence and Substance Abuse, althoughsome of the women most certainly would. When deciding the selection criteria based on151their experience of 'disordered eating practices,' I was presented with a couple ofoptions. One option was to include youth who had attended or were attending PeakHouse who had been diagnosed with having or having had an eating disorder as definedby the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). Within theDSM-IV-TR, an individual can be diagnosed as either having or not having met thecriteria for a substance use disorder or an eating disorder, based on specific behaviouraland emotional criteria, and these criteria can then determine the types of support,therapy, or treatment that they can access. Choosing to only include young women whomet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for eating disorders option would have limited the amountof participants in the study, privileged the voices of the medical profession and moreimportantly have left out many young women who fall outside the traditional diagnosisof anorexia and bulimia, yet still struggle with disordered eating practices, for example,body image, dieting, food restriction, purging and over-exercise to name a few. Aswell, the DSM -IV-TR does not take into consideration the social context of peoples'lives nor the cultural support that both thinness and alcohol and, to some extent, drugsreceive in western culture.The second option was to include youth who had attended or were attendingPeak House and self-defined as either having or having had struggles with disorderedeating practices. This then included anorexia, bulimia and all spectrums of concerns asdescribed by Brown's (1993) \"weight preoccupation continuum\" (p. 53), which Idiscussed in chapter 1. This selection criteria privileged the young women's experiencesof disordered eating and weight preoccupation practices and allowed those who mightnot meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for an eating disorder a place to voice the distress152and/or impact that an experience of eating disorders, as well as substance misuse, hadhad or was having on them.I chose the second option, which was to have the young woman self-define ashaving, or having had, struggles with disordered eating practices, which includedanorexia, bulimia and weight preoccupation (Brown, 1993). This option privileges theyoung women's experience as the deciding factor for inclusion in the study andthroughout the writing of the dissertation. This option also honours the young women'svoices in determining the extent to which substance misuse and disorderedeating/food/weight preoccupation have been problems in their lives.Creation of the Interview QuestionsCentral to social constructionism is the idea that it is impossible for a researcherto be a neutral observer in the research process (Burr, 2003). By locating myself as aco-researcher, I am a central player in it. My theoretical orientation, values, and personalexperience inform the questions that I chose to include in the interview with boththerapists and youth. This includes questions that I could not ask as they were not yet inmy social lexicon/awareness. As part of this process, I had conversations with othertherapists about what would be of most interest to them when reading my dissertation,and I incorporated some of their ideas into the questions that I formulated for both theyouth and therapist interviews.I wanted the young women to benefit from their participation in the interviews,and made every attempt to ask questions of them that were thoughtful and intentful. Thequestions posed brought forward their strengths and resourcefulness as well as their153ideas about how therapists could be most helpful to their clients with both substancemisuse and disordered eating problems. In no way did I want to replicate practices ofwhat Karl Tomm, borrowing from the ideas of Maturana, refers to as 'therapeuticviolence' (Tomm, 2001; Maturana & Varela, 1987). Instead, I wanted the youth to walkaway from the interviews having a richer understanding about the ways that substancemisuse and disordered eating practices work or have worked in their own lives and theskills and resources that can support them in staying free from these problems, all ofwhich is more in line with the practices Karl Tomm refers to as 'therapeutic love'(Tomm; Maturana & Varela).Questions for TherapistsI began my interviews with therapists hoping that our conversations wouldilluminate gaps in the current research regarding the convergence of disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse. The questions were based in my curiosities about howother professionals in the field of eating disorders and substance misuse were workingwith these problems and to determine if this was a relevant area of study. (SeeAppendix A for the list of the Therapist Interview Questions).Questions for InsidersWhile creating the initial list of questions for the insiders, I paid close attentionto the language used, its accessibility, wording of the questions, and tried to askquestions that were generative in nature and that brought forward the young women's154personal knowledge, expertise and insight into the inner workings of disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse.An important part in the design of the interview questions was having thequestions reviewed by the young women at Peak House. As my questions will show myown biases and interests, I tried to interrupt this by having other youth play a role in theconstruction of the questions, as well as including other therapists' voices and curiositiesin the questions. Kenneth Gergen (2005) refers to this process as \"collaborativeinquiry,\" (p. 98) whereby the interests of the research participants help shape thedirection of the research. When I had created my initial list of candidate questions, therewere five young women in the program and I let them know about the research that Iwas doing concerning the interplay between disordered eating practices and substancemisuse. I asked if they would be interested in looking over a list of 20 questions thatwould be used to interview young women about their understanding of the connectionsbetween substance misuse and disordered eating practices. All five young womenexpressed an interest in reviewing the questions. When reviewing the questions, theywere asked to comment and give feedback in order to help determine the utility of eachquestion. They were instructed to pay specific attention to the language used, the easeof understanding the questions, the relevance of questions, and whether there were anyquestions that needed to be asked that were not currently being asked. In addition, theywere encouraged to ask for clarification if the wording of the questions did not makesense.The young women were informed that if they changed their minds and chose notto edit/look over the questions, that they did not need to give a reason or to explain why.155Given my positioning as an adult and therapist at the program, I was very aware of theimbalance of power that existed between the young women and myself. I wanted toensure that I did not replicate practices of power where the client's voice is not given thesame respect or weight as the therapist's. These practices of accountability wereextremely important in positioning the young women as consultants (Madsen, 1999) tothe work.The idea to have youth review the questions was inspired by Arlene Katz'screation of The Council of Elders (Katz, Conant, Inui, Baron, & Bor, 2000). In herwork, Katz invites a group of elderly patients to consult with medical students aboutsome of the cases with which they are having difficulty. The elders are consultedregarding best practices and advice for the medical students' work with elderly patients(Katz, et. al.). Over lunch, Katz suggested that, similar to her work with the Council ofElders, I could let other youth look over the interview questions that I planned to use asa way to make visible the questions that are most important (A. Katz, personalcommunication, August, 17, 2007).The young women who reviewed the interview questions were also told that ifthey wanted, they could be interviewed by the questions that they were helping to create.Of the five sets of questions that I handed out, one was returned with comments forediting and all five youth expressed an interest in being interviewed. Each was informedthat if she wanted to be interviewed, she\u2014along with her legal guardians\u2014would needto sign a consent form. Additionally, each young woman was informed that she coulddecide to change her mind at any time and withdraw from the research project. (See156Appendix B for the list of the Questions for Insiders).The Research ProcessRecruitment of participantsIn this study, 12 young women who were interested in sharing their experienceswith substance misuse and disordered eating practices were interviewed. The youth hadall attended Peak House a residential substance misuse program that was two and a halfmonths in duration. For a period of six months, all current female residents of the PeakHouse program were asked if they would be interested in participating in an interviewabout substance misuse and disordered eating practices as a way to investigate the innerworkings of both problems.Potential participants were required to meet the following criteria: They had all attended the Peak House program, which is a residentialsubstance misuse program They described having personal experience with substance misuse anddisordered eating practices They were willing to have a detailed conversation regarding theirexperience with substance misuse and disordered eating practices They understood the premise of the research project They understood that there are always certain risks associated withrevealing personal information about their experiences157 They were willing to provide signed consent and have our conversationaudio-taped Their guardian was also willing to provide signed consent to allow themto participate in the studyThere was also a period of time between the signing of the consent form and theinterview in order to let the young women fully reflect on their decision to participate inthe interviews. In order to keep the young women's identities' confidential,pseudonyms were used throughout the written dissertation. I have not included the datesor time frame that the actual interviews were conducted in order to help keep the youngwoman's identities anonymous.Two youth who had previously completed the Peak House program were askedto participate in the interviews based on their experience of having been in both ourprogram and a hospital based residential program for disordered eating. Prior toentering our program, they had been hospitalized for anorexia and were bothhospitalized again after completing our program. Given their experience with bothproblems, I thought that their personal experiences would add a layer of personal insightregarding the potential interplay between both disordered eating practices and substancemisuse.All youth were young women between 15 and 21 years of age and lived indifferent areas of British Columbia. Regarding substance use, Peak House requires allresidents to have a minimum of seven days free from alcohol and drugs prior to enteringthe program. And all the young women that were currently attending the program hadbeen in the program for a minimum of two weeks. I do not know as I did not ask how158much time free from substances the two young women who were not in the programhad. The young women's self-described substance of choice ranged from alcohol,marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, crystal meth, and crack cocaine. They all describedhaving struggled with disordered eating practices to some extent either currently or inthe past.Therapists were chosen because of the therapeutic work that they have beeninvolved in with substance misuse and/or disordered eating. Many of these therapistsare considered 'experts' in their field and have been published widely. I was curiousabout their ideas about the interplay between substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices and the decisions they make regarding the treatment of these problems. Oneother therapist was asked to participate, but declined due to the length of time he felt itwould take him to adequately and thoughtfully answer the questions.Data collectionI conducted private, semi-structured interviews with five therapists. Fourtherapists were interviewed at their place of employment and one therapist wasinterviewed at Peak House, as it was a location that was convenient for her. In theconsent form, therapists were informed that their identities would not be keptconfidential in order to fully credit and reference their ideas directly to them. Thetherapists all consented that they understood the nature of the research project, werewilling to provide signed consent and have the interview be audio-taped. (See AppendixD Consent Form for Therapists/Researchers).I also conducted private semi-structured interviews with 12 young women, all ofwhom were or had been residents in the Peak House program. All current female159residents at Peak House expressed an interest in participating in the interviews. BecausePeak House is a voluntary program, some of the young women who had expressed aninterest in participating in the interviews made a decision to leave the program or wereasked to leave the program prior to being interviewed. I choose not to track down theseyouth once the decision that they would be leaving the program had been made. Thiswas partly because many of the youth live outside of the Lower Mainland, making itdifficult to connect in person due to distance.Eleven of the interviews took place at Peak House, and one was held at a youngwoman's home. The participants and their legal guardians signed a letter of consent thatwas drafted in accordance with Human Research Ethics Committees. (See Appendix CConsent Form for Insiders).The interviewsThe interviews were conducted privately, and were semi-structured. I asked theyoung women approximately 20 questions, and the therapists/researchers were askedapproximately 10 questions. Depending on the answer to the questions, I might haveasked for them to elaborate further on their answers, or have asked a question inresponse to what they had just said. The interviews took approximately and hour to anhour and a half to complete.The interview processParticipants were told that they could stop the interview, the audio-taping, ortheir involvement in the study at any time. The youth were informed that they did nothave to answer any questions they did not want to answer, and that they did not need togive an explanation for their decision. This is based on the idea that therapists need to160be able to hear 'No' when working with clients. Additionally, clients have the right todecide what conversations they wish to have and what conversations are best leftunspoken. This means being able to hear 'no' in a myriad of ways, for example hearing'no' in actions (e.g., having a youth not return the consent form) or hearing 'no' by thefeeling in the room or noticing changes in posture after the asking of certain questions(Reynolds, 2002). These practices position the client as having some importantknowledge regarding what is best for his or her own life and the conversations that willbest assist them in getting there.At the start of the interview, youth were asked to think of a word that would bestdescribe their relationship with disordered eating practices. That word would be usedthroughout the interview. Youth were given a list of candidate language (Epston, 2004)if no words came to mind and the candidate word selected could then be played with andaltered to best fit their experience of the problem. This was an attempt to minimize thespecificity of language that might obscure a youth's experience, as well as an attempt tointerrupt the possibility of anorexia or bulimia or alcohol and drugs influencing people'sthoughts or causing them to doubt if their problem was significant enough to warrant theinterview. Once the young women had defined the problem in their own terms, theirwords could be brought into the interview, and hopefully something meaningful andrelevant to their own lives could occur. In addition, we could begin to bring to life theways in which the two problems work together. In this way, the interview became aprocess of discovery for both the participants and myself. With each interview, adifferent level of depth and richness was added. During the interviews I asked the youngwomen for permission to take notes, which all the young women gave. I let the young161women know that at any time during the course of the interview or afterwards theycould look at what I was writing and ask me questions about it if they wanted.ReflexivityWhen the youth were signing the consent forms, I asked them for their emailaddresses in order to send them a copy of their interview transcript. Of the 12 youngwomen only three said they would be interested in having a copy of their transcript andgave me their email addresses. As another level of accountability, I let them know thatwhile reviewing their interview transcript should they decide that they would like certainparts of the interview excluded from the dissertation, they could let me know and Iwould remove those parts. If interested they were also invited to give feedback andcomment on any part of the interview process\u2014perhaps thoughts they have had aboutthe interview, or if our conversation has showed up in their life in any way since thetime of the interview. This was an attempt to give more weight to the voices of theparticipants, and to interrupt my own 'interpretation' of the interview results. I did notwant to make my own meaning about the impact that these conversations had on thelives of the young women, and wanted their description of the usefulness or not of ourconversation.Compiling the interview resultsThe results of the interviews were very rich. After the interviews were recordedI found myself listening to them almost immediately, writing down words and phrasesthat stood out, or surprised me. Once the interviews were transcribed, I found myselfpouring over the transcripts. The young women's accounts of how the problems of162substance misuse and disordered eating worked together and their ideas regarding theways these problems received support in their lives was fascinating. In order to makesense of the information from the interviews, I printed out a hard copy of all 12transcripts. At first I gave all the transcripts a quick read. Ideas, words, and phrases thatstruck me and that I was moved by (Shotter & Katz, 1999) were highlighted and a wordthat might encapsulate the phrase was written next to it. Then I re-read all 12 transcriptslooking for themes, similarities and differences in the young women's accounts.Reading the transcripts together was like watching invisible ink come to life, and themesand connections began emerging between the young woman's accounts.While I was looking through transcripts, I kept the context surrounding theyoung women's responses intact. I did not want quotes to be taken out of context andmy meaning to be superimposed on the young women's words. As a result I had a veryhard time cutting down the transcripts, not wanting to erase the young women's words.I became very attached to what they had said and wanted meaning to come from theirinterpretation of events. During the process of data reduction, I did not want to replicatethe following qualitative research practice as described by Riessman and Quinney(2005), \"many investigators adopted reductionist techniques, similar in effect to whatquantitative researchers do with numbers: lengthy accounts of lives were abstractedfrom their contexts of production, stripped of language, and transformed into briefsummaries\" (p. 398).After compiling the young woman's quotes into 12 different themes, I gottogether a group of three therapists (Allison Rice, Dennis Dion, and Lorraine Grieves)whom I had worked with at Peak House to participate in a 'forced sort' (Stainton163Rogers, 1995). I wanted to ensure that, within a community of narrative informedtherapists, these categories made sense and did something meaningful with the data. Forthe forced sort I printed out three to five quotes from each of the 12 thematic categoriesI had created. These were; 1) requirements of the problem; 2) effects of the problem; 3)culturally sanctioned practices; 4) ways the young women were recruited by theproblems; 5) ways the young women described the problems being different; 6) theways the problems acted as tools of the other; 7) movement away from the problems; 8)folk psychology/modernist ideas; 9) communal solutions; 10) insider knowledge; 11)recursiveness, the ways research can be of use to both researcher and insider, and lastly12) the ways the problems defined peoples identities.I then pasted each quote on its own cue card. When we met to do the forced sorteach therapist was handed an identical package of 60 cue cards and a list of the 12themes. We had a discussion regarding the names of the themes and what I meant bythem and I answered any questions that they had. Then individually, each therapist wentthrough their pile of cue cards and assigned a number from 1-12 on each of the cuecards that corresponded with the theme that they felt that quote was best represented by.During the forced sort an interesting conversation arose. The therapists began tocomment on the questions that I had asked the young women. For example, \"Goodquestion,\" \"Nice question.\" They were very interested in the questions that I asked thatbrought forward the young women's responses. I then recognized the utility of the workI had co-created with the young women. After they had completed the task we hadconversations about the themes and questions I had asked and the young women'sresponses that they found interesting.164After I went home I complied the results of the forced sort. I analyzed this inthree different ways. I first looked to see if they had assigned the same themes to thequotes as I had. Then I looked at the quotes that they had assigned a different themethen I had. And finally I compared the three therapists results against each other to seeif any new categories had been created. As a result of the forced sort I combined thethemes 1) requirements of the problem with theme 2) effects of the problem, which Icall conditions and requirements in the next chapter. Themes 5, 7, 9, and 10 werecombined to create the theme movement away and communal solutions. Themes 3)culturally sanctioned practices, 4) ways the young women were recruited by theproblems, theme 11) recursiveness, the ways research can be of use to both researcherand consultant, and theme 6) the ways the substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices can act as tools of the other were left unchanged. Theme 8) folkpsychology/modernist ideas and theme 12) the ways the problems defined peoples'identities were combined and called folk psychology. When compiling the results into thematic sections I also wanted the reader togain a sense of the time line of events that resulted in the young women's struggles withsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices. And I wanted the reader to have anunderstanding of the ways that the problems began to work together, the way theydeveloped into their own problem. This would not have been possible had the readerbeen dropped into the story, they needed to watch the story unfold. Riessman andQuinney (2005) refer to this as \"sequence and consequence\" (p. 397). When relevant, Ialso brought in theory in order to further locate their words in context and/or furthersupport them. Both co-research and narrative analysis makes space for me to take into165account the wider societal discourses and contexts of production (Riesmann & Quinney)that support substance misuse and disordered eating practices. For example, equatingthinness with beauty and substance use as a form of socializing, as well as theirglorification in the media.The following chapter describes the results of the interviews with the youngwomen.166CHAPTER 6RESULTSIn this chapter, segments from the interviews that I conducted with the youngwomen will be used to illuminate the interplay and relational features that substancemisuse and disordered eating practices have in common. The chapter will be divided upinto seven separate sections. These are:1) Culturally Sanctioned Practices2) Folk Psychology3) Conditions and Requirements of the Problems for their Survival4) Ways People are Recruited/Ensnared by the Problems5) Tools of the Other6) Movement Away/Communal Solutions, and7) RecursivenessI will draw from semi-structured interviews with 12 young women, ten of whichwere attending a live-in substance misuse program. The other two young women hadpreviously attended the program and all 12 young women self-reported to struggle tosome extent with disordered eating practices. In this section my questions and responsesare denoted with the letter 'C' for Christine and the young women's responses areindicted by the letter 'A' for Answer.I will examine the cultural discourses that the young women described beinginfluenced by and which led them to believe that there are specific ways for them to be,act, and look. I will also explore their ideas about the ways in which disordered eating167practices and substance misuse interact together and the types of tactics these problemsuse and share in order to become influential. This will lead into a discussion about whathas helped them find some space from the problems as well as their ideas about whattherapists can do to help support young women who may be struggling with theseproblems. At the end of each section the questions that illuminated and brought forththese responses will be highlighted.The data were put into specific themes as they emerged across the interviews andby the patterns that emerged. I am aware that any classification is necessarily limiting(Bateson, 1972), yet in order to make sense of the data from the interviews I needed tocategorize and classify the data in a way that highlights patterns or a lack thereof. Allcategories were influenced by my ideas and experiences as well as by my position as awhite middle class, well-educated woman who is informed by feminist, post-modernistideas and lives within a culture where I too am surrounded by ideals of thinness andbeauty. The trouble with committing words to paper is that they can imply a certaintythat may not be intended by the writer. In no way do I want these sections to beassigned a 'truth status.' Rather, there is fluidity to all of the sections, themes andcategories in this chapter\u2014they are not distinct and isolated. Some themes appear toflow from one section to the next and others appear to belong in several differentsections, and many of the youths' responses could have easily appeared in a few or all ofthe sections.This chapter is intended to provide another lens from which to see the problemsand as a way to bring the readers into a different way of thinking. It asks what we seedifferently when viewing the problems in this way. I believe that in stepping outside of168the confines of dual diagnosis, 12-step, and traditional psychotherapy practices manynew and exciting possibilities arise.Section 1. Culturally Sanctioned PracticesGiven that I began the interviews with the young women by asking them todescribe how disordered eating practices and substance misuse may receive support(inadvertently or otherwise) in their lives, I felt it fitting to begin the results chapter inthe same fashion, as it is important to me to highlight the many ways in whichdisordered eating practices and substance misuse find support in western societalpractices (Orbach, 1978) and to locate eating disorders and substance misuse problemswithin the contexts that support their development and existence. Any discussion oneating disorders and substance misuse that omits this 'context' lacks substance, and riskspathologizing the young women. According to Brown and Jasper (1993), \"Women whodevelop anorexia or bulimia should not be singled out as pathological. Their behaviourand thinking needs to be understood within the context of a culture which producesweight preoccupation\" (p. 13). Widening the lens to include the context of youngwomen's lives de-centers the young women as problems and invites us to look at thecultural discourses and circumstances that can support substance misuse and disorderedeating practices to flourish in a young women's life.24 Bordo (2003) describes the body\"as a medium of culture\" (p. 165) and \"a text of culture\" (p. 165). In other words,culture imprints itself on our skin and shows up in the words we use to describeourselves, and others. Other writers have described anorexia as a culture bound 24 David Epston and Rick Maisel have written a wonderful article detailing the circumstances that cansupport disordered eating practices in young people's lives entitled Beyond Coercion & Surveillance inthe Treatment and Bruce Alexander (2001)describes the globalization of addiction that has resulted from mass social dislocationthat we as a culture have experienced since the industrial revolution. These writershighlight the importance of viewing the problems within the local discourses andcontexts that we live in. The Just Therapy Team (2003) stresses the importance of\"social, gender, cultural and political data\" (p. 8) whenever it is relevant to the problemsthat bring people to therapy. As I have previously shown (see chapter 3), theseproblems are very much informed by larger cultural discourses and practices and assuch, socio-political and cultural influences are very relevant to therapy.The questions that I asked the young women at the beginning of the interviewinvited them to consider some of the pressures that they experienced in regard to howthey should be, act, and look. These questions positioned the young women to considerthe impact of these pressures and the impact they have had on their ideas about how theyshould be, potentially exposing the limiting avenues with which these pressures haveleft them. These questions also illuminated some of the ways in which substance misuseand disordered eating practices use these pressures to their advantage. This practice oftaking apart and breaking down taken for granted ideas, realities, and assumptions isreferred to as deconstruction (Derrida & Caputo, 1997). When considering the meaningof the word 'deconstruction' I am drawing from Michael White's (1993) use of the term:...deconstruction has to do with procedures that subvert taken-for-grantedrealities and practices: these so-called 'truths' that are split off from theconditions and the context of their production; those disembodied ways ofspeaking that hide their biases and prejudices; and those familiar practices of self170and relationship that are subjugating of persons' lives. Many of the methods ofdeconstruction render strange these familiar and everyday taken-for-grantedrealities and practices by objectifying them (p. 34-35).White (1993), drawing from the work of Bourdieu refers to this practice as\"exoticizing \"everyday taken-for grantedrealities and practices\" (White, p. 34) allows young women to consider the structuresthat are in place in society that support a certain way of looking or being and theresulting impact on their lives. Therapeutic questions that highlight the genderedtraining that young women received can invite young women to consider the impact thatthis has had on their experience of their body and their relationship to it. What were they taught about how a young woman should look or act? How did substance use or their appearance/weight begin take up as much spacein their lives to the extent that it did? Were these practices in any way supported by others? If so, how? Why do they think so many young women struggle with the problems ofsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices?These questions can help peel back the many societal layers that supportsubstance misuse, privileged forms of beauty, dieting, and related ways of being.Therapist Lorraine Grieves (as cited in Madigan & Epston, 1998) writes,...the element of the sociocultural manufacturing and perpetuation ofanorexia/bulimia is a piece that is often ignored in therapy and research onanorexia/bulimia. Taking the focus off the person/self as the problem andreturning the gaze back to the place where the problem originates has been171incredibly empowering and relieving for me. Once blame is relieved, there is somuch energy available to use in the construction of a new storyline for one's life(p. 270).After mapping out the ideas women hold, we are in a better position to ask aboutwhere they think these ideas have come from, and we can ask questions regarding whobenefits from these ideas and what the costs of subscribing to them may be.Below the young women describe their ideas and the unspoken rules regardingthe ways that the media, relationships with families, friends and other young womenserved as important (and often inadvertent) 'training grounds' for disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse.MediaOne of the first things that the young women mentioned when I asked thequestion \"What are some of the pressures that young women face today about how theyshould be and how they should look?\" was the media. Young women described beingbombarded by pictures of thin, beautiful, perfect women. They described the lack ofdiversity in these images, the push towards sameness, and how the pictures do notaccurately reflect women's bodies. Women's bodies and their body parts have beencommodified to sell goods and services (Jhally, 1990; Hesse-Bibber, 2007). This hasled to a 'standardized' look for women, in which thinness is revered (Wolf, 1997). I amnot suggesting a causal effect between media and disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse. Instead I am suggesting that the media, combined with gendertraining that values female beauty over their skills/competencies, passivity, and172selflessness, can set the stage for body dissatisfaction, disordered eating practices, andsubstance misuse (Wolf; Bordo, 2003).Jill:C: What are some of the pressures that young women face about how theyshould be? And how they should look?A: Well the media is really bad for training women and how they think theyshould be. Blond, skinny, you know, big boobs, tight ass, a small waist. Theyshould be Barbie-ish. And like, they don't have very important roles.Jill later adds,A: Well, for drinking, you look at all the beer ads and everything, there are thesegirls being hammered, like drunk and it's like they're really pretty and they seemvery happy like and all the guys are around them. Like in advertisements, girlsare drinking Captain Morgan and guys are surrounding her and she gives thisimage that if you drink this you will be wanted. You know. You'll have a sort ofcoolness that you don't have without it.Jill clearly articulates the power of the media. Orbach (1978) writes:... she attempts to make herself in the image of womanhood presented bybillboards, newspapers, magazines and television. The media present woman ineither a sexual context or within family, reflecting a woman's two prescribedroles, first as a sex object and then as a mother (p. 7).Michelle:C: Can you think of some ways that young women are trained into thinking thatthey need to look or act or be a certain way?173A: Well a lot by the media. When you look at girls on TV and you don't seeanything wrong with them, their makeup is done perfectly, their clothes are nice.They're the perfect size. They have nice boobs, nice butt, it's like what all girlsare made to believe they should have.Jessica expresses similar perceptions.A: I don't know. Probably just like the media, obviously. Like, if you flipthrough a magazine and you see like ads, you see like there are no overweightgirls in ads, like none are like normal size girls. They all have like perfectstomachs and like perfect legs and they're basically all perfect, you know.C: Okay. Were there other forms of training that you can think of havinggotten when you were younger?A: It's really funny because YM magazine. You've heard of it, right? Theyused to have things on like exercises and like I remember this one that said yourthighs shouldn't touch. I remember there was this one article saying your thighsshouldn't touch when you put your ankles together. And if you order like friesat a restaurant, if you have a guy with you, you should like let him eat half of it.Instead of buying a whole bunch of candy if you feel like buying candy youshould get a tootsie pop and chew the gum after.Studies have shown that women who read fashion magazines and appearancefocused media tend to be less satisfied with their bodies than women who do not readfashion magazines (Morry & Staska, 2001; Anschutz, Van Strien & Engels, 2008;Dunkley, Wertheim, & Paxton, 2001). Michelle's comments below clearly illustrate thepower of this notion.174C: Did you ever experience pressure to look a certain way or fit in?A: Yeah.C: Was that like an external pressure? Like a pressure that people were talkingabout or was it a pressure that you just felt like it was there?A: It was both. Like I was always watching TV, like always at a young age andI was always watching like MTV and Much Music and I was watching likewatching reality shows where girls always wanted to be skinnier and all that so Ialways thought that I had to be skinnier. So it was like coming from outside ofmyself and then on the inside of me I was terrified. Like I had this fear ofweighing over a hundred pounds and like I still have that fear to a point. So it'sjust like you get it inside your head. Once you hear it on the outside you get iton the inside of your head.C: So it's a bit of an outside inside transfer?A: Yeah.These questions invited the young women to consider the type of support that theproblems of disordered eating practices and substance use receive in the larger society.My questions invited the young women to look at the ways that they were and are'recruited' into particular ways of being and the forces that dictate how they should be.Knowing these forces better enables therapists to help young women deconstruct theways that they are 'trained' and encouraged to be young women. We can also explorethe impact the media may have had on their ideas about how they should look, be, oract. I am not drawing the simple conclusion that the media causes disordered eatingpractices (or substance misuse for that mater). If this were true, then all women exposed175to the media would have an eating disorder. I am suggesting however, that the media,along with societal pressures toward thinness as ideal for women, views 'fatness' asbeing equated with poor health and laziness (Wolf, 1997 p. 187), and where women areraised to be more passive and men are encouraged to be powerful (Jhully, 2007;Gilligan, 1982), and women are more likely to be victims of sexualized and physicalviolence than men (Statistics Canada, 2008) that these factors contributes to a culturewhere disordered eating practices among women are perpetuated and encouraged.To further illustrate the magnitude of the influence that the media has in regardsto gender training, Susan Bordo (2003) writes:... now in 2003, virtually every celebrity image you see\u2014in the magazines, inthe videos, and sometimes even in the movies\u2014has been digitally modified.Virtually every image. Let that sink in. Don't just let your mind passivelyreceive it. Confront its implications. This is not just a mater of deception-boringold stuff, which ads have traded in from their beginnings. This is perceptualpedagogy, How to Interpret Your Body 101. These images are teaching us howto see. Filtered, smoothed, polished, softened sharpened, re-arranged...Trainingour perception in what's a defect and what is normal (p. xviii).This quote illustrates the power of the media, and how there are many ways thatwe are taught (pedagogy) how we should look and trained into what is the right way tobe. In therapeutic conversations we can take apart the aforementioned cultural trainingsin the hopes of supporting young women in finding some freedom from these ideas.Family pressuresMany of the young women described the subtle and not so subtle pressures that176they received from their families, regarding how they 'should' look, even at very earlyages. Girls as young as five report dissatisfaction with their bodies (Dohnt &Tiggemann, 2006). This section is not meant to contribute to ideas of mother blame,whereby parents especially mothers are held responsible for their children's actions.Family therapist Lynn Hoffman (2002) describes how within the field of family therapymothers have been described as \"... 'overinvolved' if they were seen to be tooconcerned about their children, 'disengaged' if they left them too much alone\" (p. 119).Parents, guardians, mothers, and fathers are part of and therefore influenced bywestern ideals of beauty. In the interviews some young women spoke about how theystruggled with weight in part because they witnessed their mother's struggles withweight and of wanting to be the same size or smaller as their moms. They alsodescribed the impact that their father's comments and actions have had on theirrelationship with their body. These comments may not have been intended as malicious,but may have been made to help young girls to fit in, knowing that being a woman ofsize will be painful and hard. This can be viewed as a response to oppression in a fat-phobic society.Savannah:C: Can you think of some of the ways that young women are trained intothinking that they need to look or act or be a certain way?A: Well my dad was always very image-focused, and focused on calories andhis body image. He always wanted me to jog with him. And I remember himmaking comments about only liking thin women.Later in the interview Savannah described how she used to take ballet lessons, and177later began to model. When she was 13, she started using cocaine as a way to loseweight, which she 'learned' from other people at the modelling agency.Megan:C: So I am wondering, is there a way that people in our lives might support theproblem of drugs or alcohol or disordered eating practices showing up in ourlives?A: Like support using?C: Yeah and thinness.A: Yeah, I found there was lots of pressure from my dad and stuff when I wasyounger, and also from my parents. Like when I was in figure skating anddance, to not looking totally different from all the other people in your class, andin competitions. There was a pressure to look, well, really skinny in your outfit.C: So that pressure came from dance and skating, as well as from your parentsto sort of look a certain way?A: Yeah, like without them knowing it, like from them pointing out littlethings.C: And was there a different kind of pressure from your dad and your mom?A: Well my mom was more like healthy, like let's go exercise together and mydad was more like, \"don't eat all the cookies\" kinda thing. So it got me thinkinglike if I want to have good relationship with my dad I can't be overweight. Ican't have the chubby thing going on.Michelle describes a similar perspective.178C: Were there things going on in your life that made the problems look like agood option?A: Yeah. Like, when me and my mom or my step-dad would fight, or likewhen my step-dad and my mom would fight or when I would hear my momtalking about my dad, I thought drugs would make it better.C: And how about disordered eating practices, did they ever get you thinkingthat they could make things better?A: Well I thought that if I was skinnier it would make my parents happier.C: Really?A: Yeah. I don't know why. And I know I was a really small kid but I alwaysthought the skinnier I was the happier other people were.C: The happier other people around you would be?A: Yeah. So I tried to be as skinny as I could but I didn't realize that they weregetting more worried about me.Some of the young women spoke about the impact that their mother's struggleswith weight and body size had on them growing up, which normalized disordered eatingpractices and showed the lengths that it is worth going to in order to be thin. Beth andAmanda described the impact of watching their mother's struggles with eating.Beth:A: Honestly a big thing had to do with the way I felt and how tiny my mom is.Because I want to be able to fit into like little tiny clothes like her and stuff,right?Savannah:179A: Well, my mom struggled with disordered eating, and we would try to loseweight together.Some young women describe their sense of worth becoming tied up in theirappearance or body size, rather than what they can offer to people or the skills andstrengths that they possess. Brown and Jasper (1993), describe how, in a culture:...where body size and shape are crucial to their social value, women learn tofocus on appearance. As a result, policing and controlling appearance becomesan imperative for achieving both inner satisfaction and social success. Womeninternalize the fashionable body image, recognizing that how they appear affectshow they are valued and treated. How women feel when they comparethemselves with other women, including women depicted in the media, inadvertising, and in the fashion industry, shapes their experience of their ownbodies and selves (p. 19).Rachel:C: Do you think that our family and friends can impact our ideas about how ourbodies should look?A: Yeah. Family and people that joke around, like don't have seconds or you'llget fat, ha-ha. But it's not funny because like it sticks with you. Like being a girlthose kinds of things automatically stick because there is such a pressure to looka certain way that the little things that seem harmless aren't.Jessica:C: Can you think of some ways that young women are trained into thinking thatthey need to look, act or be a certain way?180A: Well my grandmother always said that I shouldn't eat dessert and that Ishould cut my food up into little small pieces and eat it really slowly and takelots of sips of water between it so I get full faster, because women aren'tsupposed to eat a lot.Friends and schoolThe young women I interviewed also described how ideas of thinness wereperpetuated and encouraged by friends and other youth.Megan:C: So I'm wondering if there are some pressures that you think that youngwomen face about how they should be or how they should look?A: Yes definitely.C: What would those pressures be or how would you describe them?A: Like the misconception that really skinny, really pretty perfect girls are funand that they are good friends, and you know people who are social, and that tobe in that centre social scene that you have to fit somewhat of that mold.Beth:C: So you said that you think that the media affects our experience of how weshould be. Do you think that the magazines, our families and our schools affectour sense of how we should be?A: I think so. I think school is a huge one because everybody is like\u2014they'recombing their hair, they're going to get their nails done. They're wearing certainbrands of clothing. It's not just the weight, but it's everything. Like everybody iscategorized by how you look, how you act, what you eat, what you don't eat.181Below Jessica, Michelle and Alexa describe the power of 'the male gaze'(Berger, 1972; Mulvey, 1975). The 'male gaze' refers to the idea that females aretypically the objects or receivers of the male gaze and that males do the gazing. Mulveywrites:In a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in looking has been splitbetween active/male and passive/female. The determining male gaze projects itsphantasy on to the female figure, which is styled accordingly. In their traditionalexhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed, with theirappearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said toconnote to-be-looked-at-ness (p. 10).This contributes to a sense of women being objects for male attention in art andthe media, and is later acted out with men and women feeling free to comment on otherwomen's bodies.Jessica describes:C: Did you ever experience pressure to look a certain way to fit in?A: When I was in elementary school, yeah. Like in grade six or seven I noticeda lot of the guys started making fun of me. I remember this one trip we went on,it was\u2014this cruise thing you do on a sailboat, like an overnight thing and Iremember I bought a bikini and I wore it and I guess I got into a little bit trouble.I'm in grade 7 right, obviously, like people still haven't really lost their baby fatby then sometimes and I remember like most of the bigger girls in my classdidn't wear bikinis or bathing suits because they don't look good in them at all,so they avoided it. And the other girls who, like, had more toned stomachs they182did more sports, like there was this girl, Robin, she like went to the gym likethree times a week with her dad. Well the guys made fun of me because I wasthe biggest girl there and had like a bit of a tummy and one of them said I hadcellulite on my tummy, which I don't think I had.Michelle:A: Another thing is like when you're walking in the mall, you know a group ofguys and they are like, \"Oh, look at that fat chick,\" and right away you're likeokay I don't want to be the girl who he is talking about like that.Alexa:A: For myself, my self-esteem went down. I started hanging out with the wrongpeople and I started hanging out with guys that any time any slightly overweightgirl would walk by, they'd be like what a fat bitch, you know like look at her.Those thunder thighs. I'm already in a bad place because my brain is all fuckedup from all the drugs so it's like oh, maybe they're right. So like then disorderedeating practices comes in and you're like oh well maybe they would like it if Iwas skinny. I was just trying to please other people.The above quotes illustrate the ways that young women are indoctrinated intopolicing their bodies and how this is supported by the 'male gaze' (Mulvey 1975;Berger, 1972). These insidious comments contribute to people's understandings of howthey should be and their sense of what qualities are valued in young women. Whensurrounded by these discourses, young women learn that gaining weight is not desirable,and fat begins to be feared, while thinness is revered. The above discourses all suggestthat the correct way to be female is to be thin, not to have a healthy appetite, and183conform to the beauty standards portrayed in the media.Unspoken rulesThe young women I interviewed also spoke about the 'unspoken rules' that theysee as existing for young women.Rachel:C: What are some of the pressures that young women face in today's societyabout how they should be?A: How they should be? Personality or look-wise?C: Both, looks and personality if those are the areas you think women facepressures to be a certain way.A: Okay. Looks wise, nice hair, nice nails, nice clothes, like good teeth, goodbreasts, you gotta like, you know, do your makeup perfectly, you know, youcan't walk funny. You have to have like the ideal body and like personality, youhave to be funny. You have to be nice and you have to be confident somehowand all these other things at the same time. And like, yeah, I think it's really, like,unreal. I don't think I've ever met a person that perfect. And is that even perfectto me? No. That's society's view of being perfect.Rachel's comment about you have to be confident 'somehow' and 'all theseother things at the same time' suggests that it is a staggering feat or perhaps evenimpossible for someone to 'be' all these things. Her last statement positions her asquestioning the notion of perfection, indicating that her own views on perfection andsociety's views differ. Brown and Jasper (1993) make a similar observation whendescribing the many qualities that are required of women today; \"this perfect all-round184woman is expected to perform the contradictory roles of the nurturing and caringmother; the soft, sexy and giving wife; the sexually independent, competitive, andambitious, career woman\" (p. 28).Drugs as a right of passageSome young women described alcohol and drugs as a rite of passage; a way ofshowing that you are an adult. Teenagers often binge drink, which is problematic and ahealth risk. Drinking and drugging often places people in situations where they areunsupervised, for example a friend's home when the parents are out, or school fields atnight. In these places young women may be encouraged to try other substances, andthey might not have the full information that is needed to make an informed decision.Being intoxicated creates space for things such as coercive sex to occur which can thenbe a reason to use more drugs or alcohol (or make space for disordered eating practicesto appear) as a way to get rid of the memories and/or feelings.Emma:C: Do you think that drugs, alcohol, or disordered eating practices ever tried toconvince you that they could help you become the sort of young women thatsociety thinks you should be?A: Definitely.C: How did they do that?A: The more cocaine that I did, the wealthier I appeared. It also suppressed myappetite, and basically, I grew up in a part of town where you can never be toorich or too thin.185Emma astutely observes how her economic privileges in fact oppressed her (V.Reynolds, personal communication, May 19, 2009). Hannah describes having knownsince she was little that she would try drugs. She says,A: I don't know. My mom used to always drive me down to the area of townwhere the homeless people lived and say if you ever do drugs that's what you'llturn into, and she like wanted me to be afraid of them but I wasn't. I wanted tobe like them.C: What was it about them that you wanted to be like?A: I don't know. They just looked so happy and like free and could do whateverthey wanted and ever since I was little I said, \"I'm going to do drugs.\" I didn'tthink it would turn bad and I just met the wrong people and it kind of happenedbefore I even knew it.Ava:C: Did drugs and alcohol or disordered eating practices ever try to convince youthat they could help you become the kind of young women that society says youshould be?A: Well, I think with drugs you start so young, you're so naive about it and youdon't really know what it does. And so before you know it you're hooked rightand no matter what reason you started you're hooked and there is no turningback. And so, when I started it was more of a matter of like thinking that wasthe cool thing. Drugs are what everybody is doing. That's what's normal. Allteenagers do it. You have to do it, too. You know, get the best of your teenageyears while you can. And just drinking and smoking or drugs were just like a186part of that. That's what we do, right. I thought everyone else was a homebody,how boring you know.C: So doing drugs was in a sense \"the cool\" thing to do?A: Yeah that's normalized, yeah. And because at parties all the girls look thesame and dress the same and that's just the way it is, which I now know isn't. Ithink it's cooler not to be like that and I realize now all those people that weren'tdoing that knew the whole time we think we're the cool ones. And the popularcrowds in school they kind of claim that, because they go to all the parties andhave all the nicer clothes and do drugs and stay skinny. But it's not, it's madeup.In the above example, Ava can clearly identify some of the pressures that led herto drugs and alcohol and while doing so she also takes a position against them. Sheconsiders where these ideas come from, and the impact that they have on her and on herlife, and she is redefining her own ideas of what is cool. When speaking with clients weneed to be 'double listening' (White, 1986). That is, listening to what they are sayingwhile paying close attention to ideas that suggest change and for instances when youngwomen take positions against drugs and alcohol and disordered eating practices. Wecan take note of and highlight these moments, later inviting clients to speak more aboutthis, and about what supported them in arriving at these new conclusions/ideas. MichaelWhite and David Epston (1990) refer to this as \"resurrecting the subjugatedknowledges\" (p. 31) which then,... assists persons in challenging the 'truths' that specify their lives- to protesttheir subjugation to unitary knowledges. Also, in helping the person separate187from these unitary knowledges, externalization opens space for the identificationof and circulation of alternative or subjugated knowledges (p. 32).Dirty little secretInterestingly, the idea of eating disorders as a 'dirty little secret' showed up in afew of my conversations. This appeared to be supported by the assumption thateverybody diets\u2014people just don't always talk about it, and that disordered eatingpractices 'seemed' to be the lesser of the two evils.Beth:A: People think that if you use substances you can die, but if you get sick[purge] you don't.C: Hmmm.A: I think a lot of people think that, like I did as well, that's why I did it so often[purging] because I knew that drugs were gonna kill me faster. That kind ofthing.C: Okay like bulimia was the lesser of the two evils?A: Yeah.Megan:A: I never thought of like an eating disorder as a problem even though weworked on them in school. I never thought of them as problems. I alwaysthought addictions were bad. I never thought of eating disorders as an addiction.C: Okay. So addiction bad. Eating disorder not so bad?A: Yeah, that's a little dirty secret. But addictions, oh my gosh.188Therapeutic Questions Regarding Sanctioning and TrainingThe following therapeutic questions can be asked in order to track the waysmedia/parents/caregivers/friends/coaches/teachers may have inadvertently and againsttheir best intentions supported substance misuse and disordered eating practices inyoung women's lives. These questions can shed a new light on the problems, and helpyoung women evaluate these problems in new ways. Can you think of some of the ways that young women are trained into thinkingthat they need to look or act or be a certain way? What are the pressures that young women face regarding how they should be andhow they should look? How would you describe these pressures? Do you think that the media, or our families and friends impacts how we feel weshould look as young women? Are there ways that substance misuse and disordered eating practices may havebeen either inadvertently or otherwise supported by people in your life? How did they do this? Was this support 'invisible'? If it had been easier to see it occurring\u2014might thishave made a difference? Do you think that drugs, and alcohol, or disordered eating practices ever tried toconvince you that they could help you become the sort of young women thatsociety thinks you should be?189Once the young women have identified the pressures and rules that govern 'howthey should be,' we can inquire about the ways that disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse may have taken advantage of or convinced them that they can helpthem become the sort of young women that society says they should be. For example, ifyoung women 'believe' that they should be fun, outgoing, social, and thin, are thereways in which disordered eating practices and substance use might support them inattaining this way of being?Section 2. Folk PsychologyJerome Bruner (1990) describes the way in which folk psychology can influencethe ideas we hold about ourselves and others. Bruner writes:All cultures have as one of their most powerful constitutive instruments a folkpsychology, a set of more or less connected, more or less normative descriptionsabout how human beings 'tick,' what our own and other minds are like, what onecan expect situated action to be like, what are possible modes of life, how onecommits oneself to them and so on. We learn our culture's folk psychologyearly, learn it as we learn to use the very language we acquire and to conduct theinterpersonal transactions required in communal life (p. 35).In this section, I will examine the power of folk psychology (Bruner, 1990) andthe ways in which it can influence the young women's meaning making regarding theirexperiences and their relationship with disordered eating practices and substancemisuse. Given that the language of medicine and science has become increasinglycommon in the ways in which we describe ourselves and the people around us, I was190interested in the way that these ideas, when languaged, can in a sense become predictiveand therefore constitutive of peoples' experiences (Andersen, 1998).The discourses and categories that are used to describe people struggling withalcohol and drugs and disordered eating practices are more often than not 'addict,' 'alcoholic,' 'bulimic,' 'anorexic,' 'bum,' 'self-centered,' and'junkie,' being the norm. Along with these labels comes a common understanding aboutwhat these descriptions mean. If in conversation someone comments, 'look at thatjunkie,' or 'she looks anorexic,' people often nod their heads, or gesture a look ofagreement/understanding. No explanation is needed for what these terms mean. In thissection you will see the ease in which the young women whom I interviewed used theabove terms or other common deficit based understandings to describe themselves. Thelanguage of popular psychological and medical terminology has become increasinglycommon in the ways that we explain and understand our behaviours. Gergen (1991)describes the process whereby this occurs:As psychiatrists and psychologists try to explain undesirable behaviour, theygenerate a technical vocabulary of deficit. This language is slowly disseminatedto the public at large, so that they too can become conscious of mental-healthissues. As people acquire the vocabulary, they also come to see self and othersin these terms. They judge themselves and others as superior or inferior, asworthy, or not of admirations or commitment (p. 14-15).In the interviews this language of deficit was often used by the young women asan explanation for their experience of disordered eating practices and substance misuse.191Some commonly accepted ideas regarding substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices described by the young women: Addictions are diseases (Peele, 1995) Once you are an addict, you are an addict for life. The same goes for an eatingdisorder; once you have an eating disorder you will most likely always have aneating disorder. These ideas use the static nature of personality to solidify theirclaims (Bird, 2000) Hitting rock bottom is a pre-requisite for change Some people have addictive personalities; you are born with it There is an inherited gene for alcoholism (distinct from the idea of a geneticpredisposition to alcoholism) The only cure for alcoholism and drug addiction is abstinence Medical treatment is a requirement to combat substance misuse and eatingdisorders Both substance misuse and eating disorders are progressive diseases that if leftuntreated can result in death Addiction is a choiceThe above beliefs are very commonly held by treatment providers (physicians,counsellors, psychologists, correction officers), and constitute the dominant discoursessurrounding eating disorders and substance misuse. These ideas have slowly becometruths and are now used to explain people with eating disorders and substance misuse aswell as treatment options. Stanton Peele (1995) raised questions as to why it is that bad192habits get pathologized, whose interests this serves, and who gets to decide when a badhabit turns into an addiction.Individualized responsibilityIn the following section the young women allude to how it is their fault for havingdeveloped these problems. This understanding builds on the commonly accepted ideathat if people have lapsed into alcohol and drugs or eating disorders then they have noone else but themselves to blame. The individualistic perspective of the west holds thatwe are personally responsible for our successes and our failures. These young womenput the onus of the development of the problem on themselves.Beth:C: So why do you think that some people struggle with both problems and somedo not?A: I think it depends on your personality. Like some people they just think it isabsolutely disgusting when they get sick [purge], but they don't think it's bad totake a pill to lose weight. I don't know. I think it's all about who you are. And Ithink it also has something to do with like your addictive personality and stuff,right?Beth diagnoses herself and others who also have both problems as having an'addictive personality.' I am disconcerted by her participation in a language ofpathology. Many women like her are well versed in the language of psychologists andpsychiatrists and able to diagnosis each other on the basis of stereotypes. Thesediagnoses and labels do not come without costs. As McNamee (2002) writes:Most important in terms of the ways diagnosis stigmatizes people is the193observation that, in so doing, diagnosis is rendered a valuational process. It isnot, as scientific discourse would claim, value neutral. Diagnosis does notsimply describe what is there. Rather, diagnosis functions as a moral judgment.It conveys the deficit of one to others (p. 151).As McNamee (2002) and others have described, diagnoses and labels are notalways disempowering, they give people a sense of understanding about the difficultythey may be struggling with, giving them a name for something they thought wasnameless, and can connect them to others experiencing similar problems (O'Hanlon,1993). Yet diagnoses and labels also wipe out the complexity, diversity, and richnessthat we are comprised of, reducing people simply to 'a bulimic' or 'an addict.' Self-diagnoses like 'addictive personalities' speak to the insidious nature these ideas canhave on us. If substance misuse or disordered eating practices are indeed a result of anaddictive personality, then there is not a lot you can do about it, which in turn does notleave much space for exploring the context in which the problem may have developedand potentially supported in a young person's life. Sampson (1993) writes:Our view of addiction and co-dependence conveys our cultural folk psychology ofhuman development. An addiction has become any pattern of behavior in which aperson might engage that is done beyond a certain level of self-control, includingnearly everything that people do: sexual addiction, eating addiction, sleepingaddiction, waking addiction, walking addiction, jogging addiction, peopleaddiction, and so on endlessly (p. 39).This idea while perhaps abolishing people of all responsibility in a moral sense(they can't help it) - can leave people positioned as having no autonomy or say over194their life- things are being done to them.In the quote below, Emma describes how 'low self esteem' can cause eatingdisorders and substance misuse. She says that, 'she wants to say the media' but instead,she places more of the responsibility onto herself, however she does include her earlychildhood. She negates any possibility that the media might have contributed to herideas about herself, and the ideals of thinness and beauty that it perpetuates. This ideaalso makes the individual responsible for the problems, as if they are the sole cause oftheir own mental deficit. The person rather than \"patterns of behaviour\" or\"interactional patterns\" become responsible for the development of the problem(Dickerson & Zimmerman, 1995, p. 35; Tomm, 1991). These discourses place theresponsibility for the development of the problem on and inside the individual,absolving all other potential contributors.Emma:C: So can you think of some of the ways that young women are trained intothinking that they need to look or act or be a certain way?A: I really want to say the media, but I actually think that it stems from low self-esteem and how your environment affected you in early childhood. And I reallywant to say the media because it builds people up so much to think they shouldlook like that. But at the end of the day, we're the ones buying the magazinesand fuelling it so that's really a big copout.C: So don't put the blame on,A: On something that I kind of fuel.195C: What is it about the media that has you thinking that it has been a biginfluence?A: I sought it out as an influence myself because I felt so terrible about myselfand my body and all of my appearance for so long, and that just gave mesomething, like photos of models or Vogue magazines, it gave me validation inwhat I already believed.Emma's response negates the support that the media contributes towards ideas ofthinness and beauty and that while she indeed is responsible for buying magazines and'seeking them out,' the other contextual layers that contribute to ideas of beauty andthinness are missed in her explanation.Jill:C: Are there times when you might be more or less vulnerable to the teamingup?A: I think you could be more vulnerable to having a slip up, if you are notemotionally or mentally strong enough.The above comment, 'if you are not emotionally or mentally strong enough,' isinteresting. It implies that a person might resort to substance misuse or disorderedeating practices because of a lapse in strength, or a mental weakness occurs. Thisjudgment suggests that if a person had strong moral character, willpower, or a strongfaith in a higher power, then they would have the strength needed to withstand thetemptation of alcohol, drugs, and/or disordered eating practices.196Deficit identitiesSomehow, young women begin to define themselves as addicts or anorexicsrather than as daughters, best friends, or athletes. These deficit descriptions becometotalizing of people's identities. In this way, problems take over people's identities andhighjack their sense of who they are and what they can become. Stanton Peele (1995)writes, \"this discrepancy between understanding addiction within the larger context of aperson's life and regarding it as an explanation of that life underlies my opposition tothe 'disease theory' of addiction\" (p. 3). The prevalence of these deficit identity termsused by the young women to define themselves can be seen in the examples that follow.Hannah:C: Were there times when alcohol and drugs or disordered eating practicesdefined your identity, like they defined who you were?A: Yeah. Like I was still using or I wouldn't be but I still had the behaviours.Like I'm still a drug addict.Megan:A: kept that addict part of me\u2014the lying, the manipulating.A potential problem with the idea of becoming 'an addict' is the commonly heldbelief 'that once you are an addict, you are always an addict.' Hannah says above,\"Like I was still using or I wouldn't be but I still had the behaviours.\" Even if shewasn't using she still acted \"like an addict.\" It is like the lyrics in an Ani DiFranco(1999) song, \"they say that alcoholics are always alcoholics even when they're as dry asmy lips for years even when they're stranded on a small desert island with no place intwo thousand miles to buy beer.\" The idea of alcoholism as having staying power can be197traced back to the mid 1900s when alcoholism was first conceptualized as an illness or adisease (as discussed in detail in chapter 3). The idea of addiction as a progressiveillness that results in death if left untreated is a central concept of the disease model ofaddiction (Marlett & Gorden, 1985). For some, it is an idea that saves lives. Yet perhapsfor others it sets limits around what they can do, what is possible, and how others seethem under this label.Stanton Peele (1995) states, \"What people believe about their drinking actuallyaffects how they react to alcohol\" (p. 170). So consider then the impact of teachingyoung people 'that once they are an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic.' Howmight this notion influence their sense of self and of what is possible in their lives. Howmight this impact their relationship with alcohol and drugs? The same can be said ofdisordered eating practices. If a youth believes that once you have an eating disorder,you will always have an eating disorder, how does this affect her relationship with foodand her body? Especially as abstinence from food and eating is impossible.In the interviews, I explored the impact that these deficit based and totalizingdescriptions of self-the impact of seeing yourself as an addict or anorexic\u2014had on theyoung women's sense of who they are. Below Hannah clearly articulates how this 'thindescription' (Geertz, 1973) of her life caused her to be miserable. This is the paradox ofsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices. These problems create and causemisery in peoples lives, yet they also offer promises of escape and freedom from themisery, which they are responsible for in the first place. People are then furtherensnared in the web of disordered eating practices and substance misuse by promises ofpain relief just beyond their reach.198Hannah:C: So was that a useful way to think about yourself, as some one who has nocare for their family, no self respect, etc... ?A: No.C: No. How come?A: That I was a drug addict?C: Yeah, why wasn't that how you wanted to see yourself?A: I shut down and it made me more miserable than ever.Diagnostic lexicons and treatment practicesGiven the above, it is not surprising that the diagnostic lexicon also flows intoideas about treatment for substance misuse and disordered eating practices. Some of thefollowing ideas are common: You have to hit rock bottom before you can get better You have to want help to get better Once you are an alcoholic or anorexic then you will always be an alcoholic or ananorexic Abstinence is the only cure for addictionBelow Emma describes her understanding of the idea of hitting rock bottom.C: For other young people struggling with eating disorders and drugs andalcohol, what would you want them to know? What support, advice or insiderknowledge might you offer them?A: It only gets better from rock bottom, and I would actually encourage peopleto try to hit rock bottom.199C: Okay, how come?A: Because that's when you know you're going to die and that's when itbecomes real. It's not a game any more.The idea of hitting rock bottom can work in favour of the problem. The problemcan easily find others who are 'worse off' than the person considering stopping and canconvince someone that, 'you're not that bad, you have not hit rock bottom yet.' Ibelieve that this idea then could lead someone to die since rock bottom could, in theory,be the grave.Jessica:C: Are there times in your life that you might be more vulnerable or lessvulnerable to the teaming up between drugs and alcohol and disordered eatingpractices?A: Yeah, definitely. Like, I'll have a whole bunch of problems that I don'tknow how to deal with and there is nobody around to talk about with them.Obviously that's going to be like\u2014going to be something that's gonna gothrough my head. It's an option that I'm not going to consider but it's alwaysgoing to be there.Jessica alludes to the idea that once an alcoholic always an alcoholic, which mayinadvertently support disordered eating practices and substance misuse in incising theirway deeper into her life. When young women believe that disordered eating practice orsubstance misuse is a part of them, this can impact how they see and present themselves.As Sampson (1993) has discussed in order to enquire about problems differently we200need to see begin to see people as being more than what exists within the confines oftheir skin.Therapeutic Questions to Deconstruct the Power of the Language of Deficit and FolkPsychology Why do you think that some people struggle with the problems of disorderedeating practices and substance misuse and some do not? Where do you think that these ideas [for example, hitting rock bottom, addict,that once you are an alcoholic you are always an alcoholic] come from? What impact does seeing yourself as an addict/bulimic have on your sense ofself? Who might benefit from the holding of these ideas? Is this a way that you would prefer to see yourself? Why or why not? Does the idea of viewing yourself as an addict, limit or enhance your sense ofyourself in anyway? How might substance misuse or disordered eating practices benefit from the ideaof needing to hit rock bottom in order for change to occur? If substance misuse and disordered eating practices are considered 'lifelongproblems' what might this mean for your life? Do you think that some peoplemight be able to kick these problems out of their lives for good? How mightthey do this?Section 3. Conditions and Requirements of the ProblemSubstance misuse and disordered eating practices are very clever entities thatwill use whatever means and devices they have at their disposal to make themselves a201constant force in someone's life. The word requirement is defined as \"1. somethingneeded. 2. Something compulsory\" (Soanes, 2001, p. 767). And I wondered couldsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices create the conditions that would allowthem to invade someone's life? How might poverty, violence, sexualized violence,abuse, racism, homophobia, pave the way for these practices in a young woman's life?If disordered eating practices and substance misuse are parasitic problems, what feedsthem? How can these problems be so alluring that they tear people away from theirvalues and preferences regarding how they wish to be in the world? This section willexamine what the young women described as the conditions in which substance misuseand disordered eating practices flourish.This section is based on my assumption that there are structures that support theconstruction of problems in people's lives. These structures include our western societaldrive towards individualism, which can create isolation and a sense of disconnectionfrom oneself and ones community (Cushman, 1995). This drive towards individualismhas increased since the postwar era and is responsible for the creation of the \"emptyself\" (p. 79) which Cushman defines as \"...a self that experiences these social absencesand their consequences 'interiorly' as a lack of personal conviction and worth; a self thatembodies the absences, loneliness, and disappointments of life as a chronic,undifferentiated emotional hunger\" (Cushman, p. 79). I believe that eating disorderedpractices and substance misuse can take advantage of this 'empty self' and promise tofill the void.This \"empty self\" (Cushman, 1995, p. 79) thrives under cultural notions of whatis an acceptable body size, the demonization of fatness, comparison and competition202with other women, the normalizing gaze, and body surveillance (Orbach, 1978). Thehuman body has become something to be acted upon and altered, like a piece ofmachinery (Foucault, 1978), in an endless quest for the perfect body. Both problemsleverage themselves against the societal discourses of thinness, the idea of women beinga person for others, self-sacrifice and substance use being seen as an escape, and a 'rightof passage' for young persons.The search for reliefWhat becomes quite evident is how disordered eating practices and substancemisuse use the young women's experience of pain to their advantage. What gives theseproblems their strength is the young women's relationship with uncertainty, ideas ofcomparison/not measuring up, pain, or a sense of a lack of control. The young womenclearly are not resigned to a life of feeling badly and go in search of ways to feel better.Hannah:C: Were there things that were going on in your life at that time that disorderedeating practices took advantage of?A: Just like fighting with my parents and stuff, like I couldn't control my lifebut I could control how I felt and how I looked.Alexa:C: Did alcohol and drugs or disordered eating practices ever promise that it wasgoing to help you out in any way?A: Yeah, I would say like it helped me in\u2014like feeling better. It helped me outin the sense that like if I got in a fight with my mom and it's like after dinner or203something like I can just go to the bathroom and stick my finger down my throat.Like ha ha, fuck you. You still can't stop me from doing certain things.C: Hmmm.A: It helped me in other ways too, like when my Grandpa died I was free fromdrugs. How do I cope with it, don't eat. It's like 'don't eat and you'll feel fine.'C: How does not eating equal coping and feeling fine? How did that become away to cope?A: It's showing that you have control over something.C: And how did that make it better or easier to get through that period of time?A: You can't control other things like I can't control my Grandpa dying. I can'tcontrol my mom yelling at me so it's like here is something I can control.Alexa goes on to explain that this was not the kind of control over herself andher body that she preferred and that in fact she now believes that disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse controlled her.Emma:A: Like when emotionally I felt like I couldn't control what was going on, wheneverything seemed to keep building up, and I had the sense of mental loss ofcontrol. I would revert to anorexia. And when I was severely depressed, that'swhen I would go to the drugs. They killed that pain.Beth:C: Were there any problems that were going on in your life that alcohol anddrugs actually tried to convince you that they could help you with? I don't know204if there were things going on in your life, that drugs showed with promises tohelp or make you feel better?A: Oh, yeah. If I was pissed off, or if I wanted to make somebody pissed off. Iknew if I did drugs it pissed them off and I would feel better at that moment.The above excerpts illustrate the young women's agency, their attempts to gain asense of agency or control through substance misuse or disordered eating practices.'They hurt me, so I'll hurt them by doing this.' If our options or choices are limited, weuse what we have at our disposal, which may not be the choice we prefer to take but itjust might be the most easily accessible or most familiar. I would take this a step furtherand imagine that drugs are instrumental in this argument. Many young women havedescribed having 'picked fights' with people that they love in order to have a reason touse. Drugs are in the background orchestrating things to their advantage, and not caringwho they hurt in the process.One of the first requirements of substance misuse and disordered eating practicesis that the young women need to begin to believe 'the lies' that they are being told, orperhaps have a sense that what disordered eating practices and substance misuse isoffering might be better than the situation they are currently faced with. Anotherrequirement is not caring, when this occurs, these problems have much more power in ayoung women's life.Megan:C: Did you think about the negative?A: No. I didn't care.205In a sense alcohol and drugs and disordered eating practices can also serve as ameans to rebel and resist conventional norms.SecrecyDisordered eating practices and substance misuse flourish in secrecy. The morethey can keep people alone and isolated, the more the young woman can be consumedwith the thoughts that will benefit substance misuse or disordered eating practices. Forexample, if disordered eating practices can isolate a young woman in her bedroom infront of a mirror, they can keep her preoccupied with picking apart specific parts of herbody convincing her that her face is too round and the skin on the back of her thighs istoo dimply. Eating disorders can then offer up a 'solution' to correct this calamity, forexample by losing X pounds. By keeping the young woman in isolation and on anendless quest for the 'promises' the problem offers they are able to ensure that theywon't have anyone interfering with their plans to take over and destroy the youngwomen's life. Hannah speaks to the qualities that substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices tried to have her forget.Hannah:C: What qualities did alcohol and drugs and eating disorders try to get you toforget? Like, when you became a drug addict [this is how she described herselfearlier in the interview] what might you have had to question\u2014or did you haveto push aside?A: Care for yourself and other people, like love. Love for my family. Anythinggood.206When the young women are separated from important relationships in their lives,disordered eating practices and substance misuse benefit.Beth:A: Bulimia was like 'keep hiding me, don't tell anybody,' right.Michelle:A: Well disordered eating practices still affects your relationships with peoplebecause you have to lie in order to cover it up which is the same with drugs.You have to lie in order to cover it up but there comes a time when you can'tcover it up any more because it's right there.Foucault (1978), writes, \"where there is power, there is resistance\" (p. 95) andthis appears to be true in regards to substance misuse and disordered eating practices. Itis as if the problems can anticipate that there will be resistance from the young women ifthey knew where these problems were leading them (Wade, 1997). Substance misuseand eating disorders thrive in isolation because they have no one to contradict them. Inisolation, substance misuse and disordered eating practices can tell her how she is alonebecause she is bad/worthless (leaving out the fact that the young woman is alonebecause of what the problems demands of her and the rules she has to follow). Theproblems can also offer consolation in that if the young woman follows substancemisuse and eating disorder rules well enough, then maybe she will be good. Throughtactics of isolation, the problems steal her away from the people and things she likes andloves and that sustain her. Soon, substance misuse and eating disorders become theloudest voice in her life.207Secrecy builds distance between the young women and her friends, familymembers and community and creates wedges between herself and her loved ones.Below Alexa describes how both problems began to talk to her in ways that pitted heragainst the people that had her best interests at heart. When this occurs, it can cause theyoung women to become further isolated from their communities of support and careand even more alone with the problems.Alexa:C: Were there ever tactics that disordered eating practices and substance misuseused to make you second-guess your decisions?A: Like you're not strong enough. The real you would be strong enough to belying to these people. They're taking over you, they're changing you. You'reletting these people that think they know it all change you. They are taking awaythat special power you have over yourself.Alexa describes how substance misuse and disordered eating provide a'rationale' for why she should not listen to the people who are offering her support.Interestingly, they try to convince her that the 'real her,' the one that they are workinghard to create, would be strong enough to stand up to the people around her. Once theproblems have gained some space in a person's life, the problems work like a skilleddefense lawyer - refuting any evidence and arguing their position in a definitive andauthoritarian manner.ShameThe problems also use tactics of shame and embarrassment to further entrenchand isolate the young women. Beth, Michelle, and Rachel speak about their experience208with shame concerning their involvement with disordered eating practices and substancemisuse below.Beth:A: You can't talk about it with anybody else because you're so embarrassed andashamed.Michelle:A: A lot of the times we're really ashamed of being addicted to drugs and havingan eating disorder.Rachel:A: It spawns more and more of those things you want to cover up and you don'twant to feel it anymore. Cause it's so shameful and you feel so guilty and thenyour confidence is like ruined because you're like 'Oh my God.'Disordered eating practices and alcohol and drugs can cause shame, whichserves to keep them silent about disordered eating practices and substance misuse 'spresence. The presence of shame speaks to what Michael White calls the absent butimplicit (White, 2000). Meaning that this sense of shame may speak to what they holddear or cherish in their life (White). This shame and embarrassment is a double-edgedsword as disordered eating practices and substance misuse can use this experience totheir advantage, promising to take away the discomforting feelings. Disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse act as 'saviours' while trying to keep obscure how theyhave contributed to the development of these feeling of shame. Young women becometrapped in a cycle of substance misuse and disordered eating practices and feelingshameful.209Defining identitiesDisordered eating practices and substance misuse can lead people to feeldisconnected from their sense of who they are and how they know themselves. Whenthe problems take over, people can begin to see themselves as single or mono-storied(White & Epston, 1990). Other, non-problematic, storied parts of them may begin todisappear. When this occurs, people's lives lose their sense of richness and meaning,and as Geertz (1973) explains, people's descriptions of themselves become thin.Reconnecting with their preferences of how they wish to act in the world and theiractions prior to substance misuse and disordered eating practices appearing in their livescan be potential antidotes to these problems (this concept will be discussed further insection 5. Movement Away and Communal Solutions). Below Alexa, Aimee, andRachel all describe themselves as defined by the problems of substance misuse anddisordered eating practices.Alexa:A: You loose who you are. It's like a new you, and not a positive thing.Substance misuse and disordered eating practices can launch an identity attackon the young women, which leaves them questioning and feeling disconnected fromwho they know themselves to be and act in the world.Hannah:C: Were there certain qualities about yourself that alcohol and drugs did notwant you to remember? Like that you were a dancer, or to forget the things thatyou were good at.210A: Yeah, like it's a little circle and nothing can get in and nothing can get out.But maybe there is a little part of you that stays with you\u2014or else I wouldn't beclean right?C: Yeah, that's a lovely way of putting it.A: Yeah there is that little part that stays with you but I don't think that there isanything you used to do, it doesn't seem important. Like all the stuff youwanted to do when you were clean doesn't exist any more.Hannah described how substance misuse and disordered eating practices camebetween her and her dancing. Originally, Hannah had been seduced into believing thatbeing thin would make her a better dancer, and her chances at joining a larger dancecompany would increase. Yet soon the goal of being thin and obtaining drugs andalcohol took over the goal of being a successful dancer.Hannah:C: What happened to your dancing the thinner you got?A: I couldn't do it.Substance misuse and disordered eating practices made it impossible for her todance. In this way the problems 'promises' soon prove to be false.Below Ava describes what the problems needed to do in order to become such ahuge influence in her life.Ava:C: So what did the problems need to take advantage of in order to become a partof your life in the way that it did?A: My confidence. My worth.211Rachel:A: Yeah. It's [the eating disorder] supporting your addiction and you're likealtered, like your view of who you should be and stuff. It was like horrible.Ava describes how it was that disordered eating practices and substance misusebegan to define her sense of who she was.Ava:C: Were there times when eating disorders and drugs and alcohol defined youridentity?A: Oh yeah. Fuck yeah. Absolutely.C: Absolutely?A: Oh God.C: Did they do this separately or together?A: Together. Altogether.C: Okay, how did they do that?A: I was so angry and like you just want to like fight people and get fucked upand do stupid shit, and have this sort of lifestyle that right now I do not want.You'll see people going from being completely normal to totally different and Icould feel when I was smoking something, not cigarettes. I would go from beinglike kind of normal, I could feel it go, kind of like a blindfold being put over myhead and I'm different and it changed the way I looked at people, the way Ithought, talked and everything. It totally changes you. That's like a given. Likepeople, you hear about people who will like drink and kill someone, they wouldnever do that normally, like it totally changes you and brings out the worst in212you. Like totally absolutely. And that's not my preferred self. What I did whenI was drinking or when I was under the influence, oh my God. There are somany things that I can think of that I would never do if I was my preferred self.Disordered eating practices and substance misuse change the young women'srelationship with themselves, tearing them away from the ways that they want to beknown and act in the world. White & Epston (1990) write,And there are persons who are endeavoring to situate their lives in preferredstories and to embrace alternative knowledges, but who are finding it difficult todo so because of the dominant and disqualifying stories or knowledges thatothers have about them and their relationships (p. 76).Taking this a step further it is my understanding that the problems also createtheir own \"disqualifying stories,\" (White & Epston, 1990, p. 76) which are used againstthe young women in a way that strengthens the problems standing in a young women'slife. For example, should a young woman get in an argument with someone in her life,the problem might berate her for her 'inability' to get along with people. This mightlead to the young woman doubting herself and feeling bad which then leads to theproblems showing up offering ways to take the feelings away, however temporary thismay be.Alexa:C: Were there times that substance misuse and disordered eating practicesdefined your identity?A: Yes.C: What would it have defined you as at that time do you think?213A: As a party animal, I changed who I was. I've always been a tomboy and Icared about people, my friends, family, and the people that were close to me.And then when eating disorders came in I was lying to everybody abouteverything and you couldn't tell me what to do. I was right. People would say'you look too skinny.' No, I look good. 'You are doing too many drugs' No,I'm just having fun; you're jealous that I don't care as much about school so Ican skip whenever I want. Your jealous that I have an eating disorder and I canbe as skinny as I want. They defined me as that.Both problems work to turn Alexa against the people who care about her.Substance misuse and disordered eating practices are always ready with a response toanything that may threaten their survival. Often, once the problem begins to take on alife of its own, friends and family in the young women's lives begin to disperse thisproblem-storied notion of the young women. Friends, family, and teachers get caughtup and participate in the construction of a new problem-dominated story of the youngwomen (White & Epston, 1990). Stories about the young women's strengths andaccomplishments are in the background, while stories about the young women'sfailures, wrongdoings, and troubles are increasingly in the foreground. Alexa who wasonce well known for her abilities in school and at sports, might be relegated as analcoholic. Hannah was once described as a talented dancer but is now depicted as ananorexic and a drug addict. Below, Beth describes how drugs gave her a reputation thatshe then began to be known by.Beth:214C: Were there times that anorexia and bulimia or substance misuse defined youridentity? Did they do this separately or together?A: Separately.C: Separately, okay how?A: Drugs, totally defined who I was, because almost everybody knew me acertain way and that's because of the drugs and stuff where a lot of people knewme because of the drugs and the things I was doing. Like everybody knew myname kind of thing. And that's just totally who they think I am now.In our conversation, Beth also touched upon how she thinks that is going to bedifficult for her friends to imagine her as anything other than the ways they have knownher as, and that if they knew she was in treatment for substance misuse they would be'killing themselves laughing.'Below Emma describes the pain of the realization of how just how far she hadbeen separated from herself.Emma:C: Were there certain qualities that alcohol and drugs and disordered eatingpractices had to get you to forget in order to take over your life the way that theydid?A: Um-hmm.C: What did you have to forget about you?A: I had to forget everything about myself at a certain point in my addiction.And I think that's actually, at that point it's a very serious physical addiction. Icould not function physically without a substance and that's when it wasn't215Emma anymore, it was addiction. And I couldn't remember who I was becausethen I would not be physically well. Yeah. Like a lot of this stuff that you do inyou're addiction, you look back at now from a healthy perspective and it'scompletely disassociated from you. That's not you doing those things. It's likean out-of-body experience. But that's just it. You have to forget in order to feedthat addiction.C: What happens if you were to remember?A: Oh my God. There were times when I did, too. Then you want to killyourself.The discussion above has hopefully illustrated that disordered eating practicesand substance misuse have a myriad of ways in which they can enter into a youngwoman's life. The above is only a small sampling of some of the conditions that can setthe stage for this to occur. Disordered eating practices and substance misuse harnessthemselves on lies, secrecy, shame, embarrassment, guilt, fear, and a loss of care foroneself. In this process, the young woman disconnects from the ways she knew herselfand away from her family, friends, and activities or hobbies that used to fulfill her. Thestage is now set for these problems to really take hold.Questions to Highlight the Requirements of the Problems What did the problems need to take advantage of or convince you of in order tobecome apart of your life in the way that they did? Did the problems sneak into your life or immediately highjack it? Why do youthink they operated in this way?216 Did you find that your life began to revolve around the problem? How did thisoccur? At what point did you notice that this was occurring? What did youmake of this development? Were there things that got in the way of you noticingthis sooner? What difference might it have made if you had noticed it sooner? Were there certain qualities that alcohol and drugs and disordered eatingpractices had to get you to forget in order to take over your life the way that theydid? How did they get you to believe those things? What was the impact of this? Were there certain things that the problems required of you? If you had known what the problems were going to ask of you, would you havebeen okay with this? Why or why not?Questions Regarding Identity Construction How did disordered eating practices and substance misuse impact the way yousaw yourself? What was the impact of seeing yourself in this way? Where there parts of you that eating disorders or substance misuse tried to getyou to forget about yourself? Why would they do this? Did eating disorders practices and substance misuse begin to define the kind ofperson that you were/are? Were there times that alcohol and drugs and eating disorders defined youridentity? Kind of defined who you were? How did substance misuse and eating disorders practices impact yourrelationship with yourself or your sense of yourself?217 How would you prefer to see yourself? Since stepping away from the problem's description of you have you begun tosee things or re-remember qualities that you had forgotten or perhaps not seen inquite some time? What has that been like?Section 4. Ways in Which Young Women are Recruited/Ensnared by the ProblemsIn this section I will explore how the young women I interviewed describe beingrecruited and ensnared by substance misuse and disordered eating practices. Substancemisuse and disordered eating practices are initially very real attempts at problemsolving. This notion is often overlooked. There are many reasons why people becomeinvolved with disordered eating practices and substance misuse, the scope of which isbeyond the focus of this writing. However, it is important to mention that pain,violence, homophobia, racism, sexism, curiosity, friends, and the empty-promisesoffered by disordered eating practices and substance misuse often inform people'sdecisions to enter into this territory. For some young women, these promises andcuriosities do not come without a price. And this price is that their life soon begins tocentre on attaining alcohol and drugs and/or food/ thinness at all costs. For example,'dieting' takes on a whole new shape when it becomes the focus of everyday life, when'what to eat', 'what to not eat', 'calorie counting', and 'how to hide that they are noteating' takes over. I will also take a closer look at some of the empty promises thatsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices make and the ways that it then createsnew promises to absolve itself of any responsibility for the pain or discomfort that it iscausing in the young woman's life.218In order for disordered eating practices and substance misuse to become such alarge part of a young woman's life, they must offer them something invaluable. Youngwomen can become convinced that it is through the use of disordered eating practices orsubstance misuse that they will achieve what they are searching for. It is the youngwomen's search for this 'something' that the problems use to their advantage. Aspeople get farther down the path with substance misuse and disordered eating practices,these problems have more and more say as the young women begin to live by the rulesthat the problems stipulate. When this occurs, the young women become increasinglydisconnected from how they previously acted. When thinness or substance misusebegins to play a central role in a young woman's life, there are often costs to this. Asthe young women's lives begin to revolve around the problems they begin to beseparated from their values and move away from what gives their life meaning andpurpose, be it a job, hobbies, academic or sports pursuits, friends and family. (In somecases the lack of these things may be the driving force behind substance misuse anddisordered eating practices). It is my understanding that when this occurs, people aremore likely to continue to act in ways that would otherwise not fit for them as theproblems can condemn them for the actions that they took while under their influence.Using excerpts from the interviews, I will illustrate the interplay of relational featuresthe problems use to capture and captivate the young woman and how difficult this canbe when both problems are 'working' together.The intent behind this section is to render transparent some of the many waysthat substance misuse and disordered eating practices manoeuvre themselves into aperson's life. If we as therapists are aware of the ways in which these problems become219entrenched in young women's lives, then we are better equipped to help the youngwomen identify these tactics in their own lives. The descriptions of the problems'tactics and empty-strategies included below may not be identical to other women'sstruggles but they may be familiar enough to use as a springboard. Ali Borden (2007), atherapist who has worked extensively with women struggling with disordered eatingpractices writes about her surprise that the voice of anorexia and bulimia is often thesame regardless of the country the young women is from. Luckily tactics often repeatthemselves, perhaps using different words, but the general way they go about doingthings is similar from one person to another. Madigan describes how therapists need to\"know where the problem is arguing from\" (S. Madigan, personal communication, April24, 2009). What follows is an attempt to do just that: to give a rich description of wheresubstance misuse and disordered eating practices are arguing from.While disordered eating practices and substance misuse do kill pain (and oftenmake people feel good) and in a sense 'help people out,' it becomes quite clear, quitequickly, that they also cause much more pain than they purport to relieve. In order forthe problems to work effectively in the young women's lives, the problems need to tryto keep this hidden. If the young women were told up front by the problems 'I am goingto temporarily relieve your pain, but in exchange for this relief I am going to rob you ofyour hopes and dreams, your family and perhaps your will to live. I will take control ofyour life and you will have to live by my rules and do as I say' young women may thinktwice before walking down this road. And this soon becomes one of the ways that itkeeps young women close. Disordered eating practices and substance misuse creates220more pain, which then requires more pain killers, and so on, which contributes to thecycle we will look at below.The empty promisesAlcohol and drugs and disordered eating practices bear promises of what lifecould be like with their assistance. These may be promises of friends, popularity, self-improvement, thinness, escape, freedom, a way to cope, or happiness. However, thecost of these promises is often much higher than anyone would have imagined orbargained for. Enquiring about the 'promises' of substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices creates a relational space for young women to understand how these problemsgained such a hold on their lives, and what they may need in order to develop otheroptions for coping with the difficulties in their lives. Once the problems gain an edge insomeone's life they both work very hard to get people believing that you can never useenough drugs/alcohol or lose enough weight. Both problems are sustained and supportedto some extent by the problems promises of 'what will be' if only the young womenfollow the problem's rules, and the imagined misery they will endure if they fail tofollow them.Rachel explains how the problems became a part of her life.Rachel:C: So what did it need to take advantage of to become part of your life in theway it did?A: You needed to believe those lies.C: Okay. How did it convince you of those lies? How did it get you to believethem?221A: I don't know. When you're so submerged in that kind of life and all yourfriends and everyone is like\u2014it didn't really have anything to do with the factthat everyone else is doing it, you are just so submerged in it that you believe itwithout questioning anymore.Rachel describes the impact of having been submerged in that kind of life andhow she began to believe 'those lies.' Rachel refers to disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse as lying to her. Rachel is now aware that the promises that disorderedeating practices and substance misuse originally offered her, were, in the long runempty. Though substance misuse and eating disorders may have helped her out at theoutset, and perhaps continued to be helpful to some degree, disordered eating practicesand substance misuse did not come without costs. For example, the problems left outthat she might end up in a treatment centre for substance misuse. In this sense sheexperienced the problems as 'lying' to her as they left out the possible consequences oftheir use, she was only informed of what she would gain.Rachel's use of the word 'anymore' suggests that there was a time when she didhave some questions about the life she was beginning to lead, perhaps about the impactthat it was having on her sense of self, her health, and her family. Yet, once this'submersion' occurs, disordered eating practices and substance misuse have a strongfoothold in the young woman's life and no longer need to work as hard to entice peopleto follow them. Instead it's like the fable of the Pied Piper where the children followedthe Piper willingly. Substance misuse and eating disorders are 'nice' at first, offeringthe young women some 'help' with their struggles. If they were cruel and caused themmuch pain at the get-go, young women might be more inclined to ignore them222Hannah describes the promises of disordered eating practices and alcohol anddrugs in the following way:C: What did drugs and alcohol and disordered eating practices need to do or needto convince you of, in order to become part of your life in such a big way.A: To make it better, it promises you these good things, things that you can'tsee.So the promises are often far off, but the promise to 'make it better' is oftencaptivating enough to take a risk and see if substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices can offer what they say they will. She continues,C: Were there any other promises that eating disorders made?A: That I would be pretty.C: Pretty.A: Um-hmm. And happy. Happy with myself, like more self-confidence.C: Were these the same promises that drugs and alcohol offered?A: No.C: What promises did drugs and alcohol offer you?A: Only good ones, like nothing negative. Fun, like anything good. It wouldmake my life so much fun, I can stop when I want to, it will be cool, and I'll lookcool in people's eyes.Beth continues along the same lines:A: Just like, well, if you do this you'll feel better. It's not how will it make youfeel worse. It's how this will make you feel better. You're not thinking aboutanything else.223C: So if you do this you'll feel better that's one of the promises?A: Yeah. I'll make you thinner, I'll make you forget, kind of thing, right.You'll feel better about yourself.Female gender training can encourage young women to prioritize self-sacrificeand selflessness (Gilligan, 1982). This gender training can lead to diminished care forone's self, which and can be taken advantage of by substance misuse and eatingdisorders. Substance misuse and disordered eating practices can masquerade as care,taking advantage of the fact that for the young women this is a real attempt at trying tofeel better or to have a say in their life, regardless of the costs. Young people will arguethe merits of drug use as a way to help them concentrate and stay focused at school.This may be true. Amphetamines were used by fighter pilots during WWII as away tostay alert (Rasmussen, 2008). Yet drug use and disordered eating practices do haveconsequences in people's lives. In the example below, disordered eating practices talksitself into being a health solution and as a way for self-improvement.Alexa: I was like when I had disordered eating, like\u2014well last year.... everyonecares about how they look and I'm like oh its not that bad. I'm just doingsomething about it and I'm happy about it. So like there are fat people out therewho aren't happy about it or aren't happy about their self and so I'm just fixing itfor myself, I'm doing something good for myself.I'll help you cope and make it all betterThe young women described how drugs and alcohol and disordered eatingpractices offered them 'solutions' to the difficulties that they were facing. Theydescribed being enticed with promises of feeling better about themselves, and224importantly, they are deceived into believing that they would be able to stop wheneverthey wanted to. The problems position themselves as offering them the solutions towhatever it is that ails them like a magic elixir promising to take it all away.Emma:C: Were there things going on in your life that made them [substance misuseand disordered eating practices] seem like a decent option?A: Yes. I think that everyone has the experience where the coping mechanismdoes help them in the beginning. It does. It's just that it turns into somethingreally horrible.Emma acknowledges that while it helps in the beginning it begins to take on alife of its own. (This of course the problem leaves out).Beth:C: Are there ways the problems tries to convince you that they can help youout?A: 'Oh if you just do me for a little bit, and if you just lose a little bit of weightthen everything will be fine and dandy'- those types of empty promises. But Iknow that's not how its gonna be.C: What is it that you now know that has you saying 'that's not how its gonnabe'?A: Cause I know that was my original plan in the first place, the first time I gotclean and then I was like, 'Oh I'll just use and loose a little bit of weight andnobody will know and it will be all fine and dandy.'C: And did it stop there?225A: No, No. No.Jessica below speaks to how disordered eating practices and substance misuseserved a purpose and how 'she took them for her problems.'Jessica:A: Yeah. Yeah. Because I did take them for my problems, right. They maskedmy problems for a long time. They were a good cover up. When people werelike, 'Oh, what the fuck is wrong with you.' It wasn't like, 'well this, this, andthis is wrong with me and this is what actually happened to me and this is whyI'm feeling sad.' Instead it would be like, 'Oh, I'm a drug addict,' or, 'I have aneating disorder.' It was a good excuse.Jessica touches on something very important. Disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse can obscure and divert both helpers and the young women from whatactually may be going on in the young women's life that contributes to the problems.For example, all energy may be focused on not eating, leaving none left to invest intolooking at the possible solutions to the problem. Or as Jessica said, addressing thereasons behind her sadness. Disordered eating practices and substance misuse get in theway of school, turning them against the people that love them, and thus, the youngwomen get stuck in a vicious cycle in which substance misuse or disordered eatingpractices works as a smoke screen to distract and deflect all attention that may come itsway.Rachel articulates this idea very clearly. She reflected on how 'she starteddrinking and doing drugs for fun' but soon found that it began to take on a life of itsown, and became a way to ease the pain of the memories that it was causing.226Rachel:A: Okay, I started drinking and doing drugs for fun or whatever, but I ended updoing so much stupid shit and having to do things I didn't want to do to get moredrugs. But like it ended up being a coping mechanism to get rid of thosememories and like it's just kind of like a vicious circle because every time you doit, it spawns more and more of those things you want to cover up and you don'twant to feel anymore. Cause its so shameful and you feel so guilty and like andthen your confidence is like ruined because you're like oh my God, I have tolook okay so people don't think there is something wrong with me so then theeating disorder part comes in. And its like the problem just keeps getting worseand worse.She continues,A: And then it's like all of a sudden you can remember more things and it's likeoh, you tried to forget when that thing happened or this thing and you're like youused again after this to try to forget but then this happened and it's 'Oh my God,there is so much shit.' And somehow, in some crazy way it makes you want touse again. Which is just like 'make some new worries.'Shape-shiftersDisordered eating practices and substance misuse are shape shifters, they bothhave the ability to morph into whatever form of 'help' the young women requires at thetime. For example, disordered eating practices and substance misuse might describethemselves as experts in weight loss, pain removal, creating a sense of specialness, or away to cope. They also have the ability to fine-tune their promises in order to meet the227needs of each young woman as closely as possible. Like a well-groomed salesperson,they can sell you anything and make you think that you are getting a fantastic deal.Emma: A: A constant. I needed something constant in my life and I didn't care what itwas. And so an eating disorder stays with you forever, and I just wantedsomething that was mine. I wanted something that I could almost like I couldsteer it, and something that would reassure me that I was actually doingsomething. With every pound that I've lost, it was weighed on the scale. It's likewhen you get a report card and it says this is the percent you got. You got an 'A'and you're like sick, I can put this on my fridge for my parents to see andeveryone is like 'wow, you did a good job.' But this one is kind of, kind of likeyour own personal report card where you're doing it just for yourself.Ava:A: Drugs and alcohol, you know, it's covering up the emotional pain and it helpsyou know. Like oh, I'm pissed off at my parents or boyfriend I'll go get drunkand this is a temporary remedy.Aimee:A: Yeah, they promised that they could help me get through the tough timesand stuff and they could get me through anything. I don't know why I wouldthink that, but drugs are like if you do this everything will go away, but itdoesn't. It all comes back harder.228Get male attention, join the popular crowdInterestingly, many of the young women's responses about the promises thatlured them were tied to ideas of thinness that would gain them attention from men, andthinness as a way to hang out with the 'popular' crowd. This highlights the prevalenceof idea of thinness being equated with notions of beauty, and the power of the 'gaze'(Foucault, 1981; Berger, 1972) in regulating and controlling woman's actions. This isnot a neutral idea and has far reaching consequences, specifically in relation to ideas ofworth and what is valued regarding women's bodies and women's appearance. We livein a pro-anorexic culture, which endorses and encourages a thin and fit body for bothmen and women (Hesse- Biber, 2007; Orbach, 1978). In many cultures, beauty equatesthinness and wealth, men have more power than women, sexualized violence towardswomen is promoted by media, and pornography flourishes (Jhally, 1990). It makessense that young women begin to internalize and live this very specific gender trainingat an early age, as this becomes gender normative behaviour. In fact it begs the questionof how is it that more women are not taken in by these pro-anorexic notions.In my conversations with the young women it appears that for heterosexualwomen, being thin is believed to be a requirement for attracting and capturing attentionfrom the opposite sex (Malson, 1998). The young women described how disorderedeating practices and drugs and alcohol teamed up together and worked to supportthinness in their lives. In the examples below, young women are comparing themselvesbased on their body size rather than what they have to offer intellectually, orconversationally. They describe the hoped for result for all their efforts was that they229would attract male attention. Below the young women describe their ideas about the'benefits' that will occur if they are thin.Ava:A: It's a pressure. I think it's a pressure to impress the guys and compete withthe girls.From this perspective, women become the enemy, and women are pitted againstother women, rather than as allies supporting each other in challenging traditional ideasof thinness and beauty.Hannah:C: In terms of using drugs and alcohol, why would you want to be thinner thansomeone else?A: Because I felt I was pretty that way.C: So if you were smaller than your friends or if your friends pants didn't fit you[In reference to what she had said earlier].A: I was the one the guys would pick first.Alexa:C: Did drugs, alcohol or disordered eating practices offer you any promises?A: Yeah. For me it was always, I'll be happy if I'm skinny. I'm gonna behappy. I'm going to get attention from guys and I'm going to have more fun.Aimee:C: Were there things going on in your life that made the problems seem like agood option?230A: Maybe a little bit. My ex-boy friend and stuff and other girls were skinnierand I didn't think I was skinny enough so I was using a lot more.C: In order to get thin?A: To get thin so he would like me. But he always did like me, but I justthought he was looking at all these skinny other girls and I already was skinnybut I was starting not to think it, so I started to use a lot more I thought would heliked it so I used more and it got me down to a lower weight.Thinness, fun, male attention, competition with other women. When thisbecomes the focus of young women's energies, their appearance can take centre stageover other qualities such as academic achievement, sports, friendships, and workpursuits. Naomi Wolf (1997) writes, \"beauty is a currency, like gold\" (p. 13) and fromthe conversations it appears that young women learn the value of this currency quiteearly.Aimee:C: You said that disordered eating practices got you thinking that you would beable to hang out with certain people?A: Yeah. I used to think that if you're a certain weight you can hang with acertain group. And I figured, I always thought if I'm the skinniest one in thegroup then everyone will like me. The guys will like me more and I'll have achance to hook up with them faster before everyone else.Megan:C: Do you think that drugs alcohol or disordered eating practices ever tried toconvince you that they could help you out to be any of those things?231A: Yes, definitely.C: How or in what ways did they do that?A: When I started using and like when I started losing weight I had moreconfidence and it was easier to fit in with more people and to get that status that Iwanted.C: What kind of status did they promise you?A: Just popularity and everyone wants to be your friend, and you're alwaysbooked for the weekend and every night you have more plans than you canhandle.C: And that was true for both disordered eating practices and drugs and alcohol,they kind of came hand in hand?A: Definitely.C: In a way did they convince you that you should be a certain way or that inorder to be popular you had to look a certain way?A: Yeah, you had to fit those smaller sizes and look great in them no matter whatyou wore, and if you went to a party you'd have to wear the tightest jeans thatyou owned so that every one would want to talk to you, those kinds of things.Rachel:A: And like I think the idea like is that if you're ugly or whatever, nobody cantake the time to listen to what you have to say. They're all going to think you'restupid and just you know, you'll die alone and you'll be miserable.Referring back to section 1, culturally sanctioned practices, in this chapter, manyof the young women mentioned being made fun of because of their weight, or wanting232to be thin in order to avoid being picked on. The above comments can then be seen as away to avoid being punished or disciplined by way of abusive comments about theirbodies. As Rachel alludes to 'you are destined to die alone if you are ugly.' Bothproblems benefit if they can convince young women that if they can succeed inbecoming or staying thin, then they can perhaps avoid being ridiculed, or perhaps worse,be alone. Orbach (1978) states:This emphasis on presentation as the central aspect of a woman's existencemakes her extremely self-conscious. It demands she occupy herself with a self-image that others will find pleasing and attractive\u2014an image that willimmediately convey what kind of woman she is. She must observe and evaluateherself, scrutinizing every detail of herself as though she were an outside judge(p. 7).It is through this very specific type of gender training that young women learnhow they should be and act which benefits substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices.From friend to captorOnce substance misuse and disordered eating practices have moved themselvesinto a person's life the young women often begin to describe the voice changing fromthat of a 'friend' to that of a 'captor' that is relentless with its demands. The voice ofsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices slowly begins to erode and overridethe young women's voice. Substance misuse and disordered eating practices questiontheir actions and shames them when they don't follow the rules that they have laid out.233These problems have been compared to that of an abusive partner, they start out niceand then they develop into something horrible.Rachel:C: So the voice of drugs wasn't always a friendly voice then?A: No. But it is in the beginning and then eventually it becomes the voice thatyou listen to because you haven't ever questioned it before. Like until that pointusually.C: In terms of the voices, are the voices of alcohol and drugs and disorderedeating similar voices? For example, is one more caring than the other or do theytake turns being caring?A: No. Like at the beginning when you start not eating and you're happy, right,oh yeah, its like 'oh my God you're so fat like just like stop eating already', right.'Look at you, you're disgusting' and everything like that. So both of them workover time. Like once they've got you, they've really got you and they think youknow, 'all right like now we can just lay it out just like it is.'Megan:C: Did drugs and alcohol and disordered eating practices, did they talk to you ina voice of a friend? Were they mean friends?A: Sometimes. Yeah, when you're looking in a mirror it's like 'oh my gosh,what's that, look at those thighs and what are you doing. Like you obviouslyhaven't been exercising, you obviously have been eating way too much.' Friendswouldn't say that but thoughts did. Then like if one day you are happy with whatyou see its like-it's like the best friend you can imagine, 'Like that's so good!'234C: Yeah.A: Or like if you were purging and afterwards 'yeah, that looks better or youdon't have to worry about that any more. That's gone.'Hannah in a similar vein describes the degrading voice that the problem began tospeak to her in when she began to gain weight once she stopped using alcohol anddrugs.Hannah:A: That you're fat and ugly and no one will ever like you, and you'll have nofriends.Rachel explains the process by which when she was trying to free herself fromthese problems they would degrade as a way to keep her close.Rachel:A: When you're like trying not to use and if you think to yourself like 'I'm notgood enough, like I don't even deserve this anyway, like why do I deserve cleantime after all the stupid shit I've done?' You kind of think 'oh well, then I mightas well go back and use again because I'm not worth it.' But same with likeeating disorders, you're like, 'I'm so ugly,' or 'I'm like not worth like, you know,trying to be healthy' or like 'at least I can be thin' then.It is important to gain a sense of how these problems gained a strong hold inpeoples lives, in order for the young women to gain a sense of the problems tactics.Once these tactics have been uncovered the young women are better able to notice whenthey begin to appear.235The Lies are UnveiledBelow the young women describe what is left off of the list of empty promises(lies), which is generally that disordered eating practices and substance misuse takecontrol over their lives. It has replaced the control that they imagined to be gaining ontheir lives.Ava:A: They trick you, completely, 'you'll be thin, you'll be beautiful.' It totallytricks you and you think if you just keep using it, everything will be fine. You'lljust keep getting skinnier and more beautiful. But really you're not.Hannah:C: What kind of things did they promise you that you know now that they don'tactually do?A: That it will be fun. They'll make your life better. That it's just something funto do. It doesn't show you how much you'll get sucked in and how much it willruin everything.You can always do better and the bar always movesIn order to keep its victims ensnared, the bar needs to keep moving. What is'thin enough' is always changing, and what was once 'enough drugs' will no longer do.Ava describes this.A: Because, well for drugs and alcohol it is changing your mood, changing youroutlook on things. With the eating disorder, maybe, let's say you don't feel goodabout the way you look, it changes the way you look but it doesn't change theway you feel about yourself you know what I mean? You're always looking for236something. You're always like, trying, you're always just looking for somethingbut I find that I never found it. I could never ever find it. It was never enough. Ihad to always lose a little bit more weight.Ava describes an important tactic that substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices use. If the bar of what is 'good-enough' is constantly moving, the solution thatpeople are looking for is always just out of reach. The problems try to convince theyoung women that this is because 'they are not trying hard enough.' If they were tryingharder they would achieve the results they are searching for.Information filterDisordered eating practices and substance misuse acts as a filter where it morphsinformation to best serve its own purposes. The following is an excerpt where Bethdescribes ending up in the hospital.Beth:C: Had you seen bulimia as a health issue before?A: No. I always thought the doctors were trying to scare me.C: You thought they were making it up?A: Yeah. I was thinking no, this isn't bad. Its just cause I took one too manypills, it's not that I'm that underweight. It's not because of that. I'm fine; you'rejust over exaggerating.C: Was that your voice or was that bulimia speaking for you?A: I think that was the bulimia speaking for me. Yeah. And not letting me, like,get at the full information or letting me hear it.237Alexa describes how disordered eating practices and substance misuse played offof each other and had her thinking that in order for her to attend a treatment centre forsubstance misuse that she needed to look like a 'drug addict.'Alexa:A: Like\u2014I stopped using drugs. Then the eating disorder came in\u2014and at firstwhen I was trying to stop having an eating disorder before coming here drugs,and the eating disorder got bigger as well. It thought, okay like, it's actuallygood\u2014well there is a certain drug addicts look - so I should go into thatprogram looking like a drug addict.Other young women whom I have worked with have described disordered eatingpractices getting worse prior to attending a program for disordered eating. They havedescribed thinking that they don't look sick enough or thin enough to attend. Insubstance misuse programs things are always not much better, young people cancompare how many drugs other people did, how much they drank, or compare bodies.In this way the problems can be encouraged and sustained by comparison with others.Many young women have talked about how this process contributed to their gettingworse, in the extreme leaving treatment to lose more weight or do more drugs.Questions Regarding Recruitment Tactics and StrategiesIn order for young women to consider the impact that disordered eating practicesand substance misuse had or is having on them, we can begin to ask questions thathighlight and make transparent substance misuse and disordered eating practices'recruitment tactics. Once young women are aware of the ways in which the problems238gained so much authority in their lives, the young women are better positioned to resistthem. What did drugs and alcohol and disordered eating practices need to do or need toconvince you of, in order to become part of your life in such a big way? What were the promises that substance misuse and disordered eating practicesmade to you? Did they offer the same or different promises? What kind of things did they promise you that you know now that they don'tactually do? Were there things that were going on in your life at that time that disorderedeating practices or substance misuse used to their advantage, or made them seemlike a decent option? How is it that substance misuse disordered eating practices began to tear youaway from your self, your family and your friends? How did substance misuse and disordered eating practices get in between youand the people you love? What did substance misuse and disordered eating practices begin to do in orderto create a wedge between yourself and the people that love you? What do you think of this? Are you okay with that? Why or why not? Were there things you had to forget about yourself in order for substance misuseand disordered eating practices to become such a large part of your life? Are there ways that substance misuse and disordered eating practices might playoff of or benefit from western notions of beauty?239 Did substance misuse or disordered eating practices ever speak to you in thevoice of a friend? Was there a time when they may have become a mean friend?Why do you think they would do this?Section 5. How Substance Misuse and Disordered Eating Practices Become Tools of theOtherThis section describes how disordered eating practices and substance misuse canwork together to keep a person ensnared. I am describing them as 'tools of the other,' asit is my understanding that when the problems of substance misuse and disorderedeating practices are both present in someone's life, they begin to work together in orderto keep people trapped in problems. As Ali Borden (personal communication, May 14,2007) described it, if you imagine disordered eating practices loosing its grip on a youngwoman, disordered eating practices might yell out 'I don't have her!' At that moment,substance misuse, working as an outfielder, might respond, 'It's okay, I'll get her!' (A.Borden). The alliance between disordered eating practices and substance misuse canmake it difficult for a person experiencing both to break free from them. When theybegin to resist or take some steps away from one problem, the other one begins totighten its grip. If therapists are aware of the possibility of disordered eating practices orsubstance misuse lurking in the background, then they may be more likely to enquireabout them. Therapists are also in a better position to prepare a young woman tomanoeuvre her way through the problems' attempted comeback. The more prepared ayoung woman is for this possibility, the better she will be able to resist disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse's tricks and tactics.240How substance misuse and disordered eating practices can work togetherI was curious about the ways in which disordered eating practices and substancemisuse can serve the same purpose or help people achieve similar goals by workingtogether. Can one stand in for the other if one is not available or convenient in aparticular moment? And, if so, how does this occur? I was curious about the youngwomen's experiences with the two and their ideas about how substance misuse anddisordered eating practices may have recruited the other problem into their lives. In thissection, I will look at the times young women are aware of being vulnerable to theteaming up between both problems, how the problems can start to team up (specificallywhen they try to step away from one or the other), and then offer descriptions of theways in which these problems can work together when a young woman enters treatment.Emma explains the ways that she sees these two problems co-existing in her life.Emma:A: It's kinda cool this is how I've always imagined these two in my life though,is like here's a closet door. And here is one of the monsters creeping out likethat. Here is me, like, in my bed and I'm safe underneath the covers, you know,and then there is one crawling up and pulling them off of me. It's not aboutoverlapping, it's about this one already got it started and so this one can come inand take advantage of the fact that the ball is already rolling. They're buddies.Rachel:C: How do you explain the fact that they shared so many of the same tactics?A: Well, I think they're both an addiction. They're both like so strong in yourmind, like drugs like just push you to use them again and again. Promising241you'll be happier when you use them and like this time it will be different. Thistime you won't do anything stupid. It will be just like the first time and samewith like the eating disorder, I'll make you skinny, and then I'll make you happy.Everyone will love you.Hannah:C: Okay. If you were to describe it to or explain to someone the way that theyboth worked in your life, how would you describe how they kind of showed uptogether?A: Like one brought on the other and it feels like they fed off each other.Below Ava astutely makes connections between the images of what someone istrying to project or achieve through substance misuse or disordered eating practices asbeing similar. In this way, the problems have a common goal with which to attractpeople.Ava:A: I would say they unconsciously lead you to one another whether you know itor not, its linked because it all has to do with some sort of image. The cigarettein hand. Its because you want to be part of that image. The alcohol, the martini,the joint or the line, its all about image. The eating disorder, the stars do it, theimportant people do it, you can do it too. It's all about the image.Ava describes her understanding of their shared tactics as follows.Ava:A: They even have the same tactics it's all down to the same thing and comesfrom the same pain.242C: What are some of the same tactics that they share or the pain they takeadvantage of?A: Doubting yourself, people and yourself telling you that you aren't goodenough. That feeling of acceptance and acceptance from a community. And likewhat you're told, is right. It's what you're supposed to do. Instead of whatyou're really supposed to do, you know what I mean? Does that make sense?Ava alludes to a sense that there is a certain way that she was being recruitedinto acting and a way that she knew she was supposed to be acting.Disordered eating practices recruit substance misuseHannah:C: Do you think disordered eating practices and substance misuse share any ofthe same promises, like play off of each other in any way?A: Like how?C: Like one kind of compliments the other?A: Well, like being skinny and having an eating disorder and if you do drugs it'sa lot less work and better resultsC: Okay, so how did you begin to figure that out?A: I wanted to do it and then I saw what it did and I was like 'Whoa.'C: When you saw what it did? When you saw what it did on your own body orother people's bodies?A: On mine, I remember looking in the mirror and I thought, 'Oh my God that'sso skinny. That's fantastic.' And seeing other people that I hung around withgetting skinner too.243Previously in the interview, Hannah told me that disordered eating practicesappeared in her life before misusing substances. She had already become accustomed toideas and practices of losing weight. Above she describes the thinness attained throughdrug use as 'fantastic.' Young women quickly learn that drugs can intensify the thinnessthey may be looking for, and in this way, drug use becomes a tool of disordered eatingpractices.Alexa describes how some of the requirements of disordered eating practices (forexample purging, over exercising, calorie counting) begin to subside as drugs begin toplay a larger role in her life. Alexa soon learns that drugs can be used to quell herappetite, and in this way drug use can begin to increase in young women's lives.Alexa:A: But then I just really didn't care because I was like fuck it I'm so skinny Idon't need the exercise. So the drugs became part of my eating disorder, too. Iwas using them more and more to get skinny. Like if I woke up and I washungry, I'd be 'Oh, I'll just do a rail.'Beth:C: Given that bulimia showed up first in your life, how do you think it was thatalcohol and drugs then showed up? Do you have any ideas about that?A: I saw how much weight my girlfriend had lost but I hadn't known how and Iwas like, oh my God, and that was the first time she gave me a cap of Ecstasyand she said they were weight loss pills. I didn't know they were drugs and I justsaw that she had lost so much weight in such a short period of time. Like easy X244pounds, a lot of weight, and I was like holy crap. I didn't care how she wasdoing it, right.Beth spells it out quite clearly: thinness at whatever cost. Both Beth above andJill below speak about learning about thinness as a 'side effect' from drugs from theirfriends. They saw their friends bodies begin to change in ways that they themselveswere after.Jill:A: I tried the whole bulimia thing; I tried throwing up after meals and that kindof thing. Like I did it one or two times but like it didn't feel right doing it, youknow what I mean? But like when it came to drugs and alcohol, I used to usecrystal meth. I wanted to be really skinny, so I would like do that to look goodand be skinny.C: So I can look good if I do this drug, is that right? How did you figure out thatyou could look this way if you did this drug? How did you come to know that?A: Well, I have friends that were doing the drugs. They got really skinny.C: Okay.A: And I figured, okay, well, they're going to be skinny, why can't I. I want tobe skinny too. Because I've always had a weight problem when I was young Iwas chubbier and everything, like I was always too big. I could never be happywith the way I looked so when I started using drugs and alcohol, I got to wearsmaller clothes. I could wear tight T-shirts that showed my belly button, which Inever wore before. It was just, it's attractive that whole lifestyle, being really fit.245I was struck by Jill's use of the words 'look good' and 'it's attractive that wholelifestyle being really fit.' I wondered how these words became the words that describedher experience of crystal meth use. As I write this I am confronted with images ofcrystal meth and cocaine users that have been driven to the streets by their habit; left toscour the streets of East Vancouver looking for 'rock' that someone may have dropped.Their faces hollow and scabbed. Their bodies malnourished and dirty. How is it thatsubstance misuse can keep young women from seeing its darker side even when this iswhere they are being driven? I realize that this is an extreme example, and that not allsubstance misuse takes people to the places I just described. Yet, I wonder how adrugged image of 'high society' and 'fun' can get in the way of people seeing other realpossibilities of where drugs can and do take people. I am especially interested in howdrugs keep this hidden from the young women that I interviewed given that they wereall (or had been) in a substance misuse program at the time of our interviews.Substance misuse recruits disordered eating practicesBelow Megan describes 'the state of mind' that contributes to thinness becominga focus in a person's life.Megan:C: Some women struggle with both disordered eating practices and substancemisuse. Why do you think this is?A: I think it's because when you start using or drinking you're already kind of inthat state of mind where you like to have fun you have to be using and drinking.And then you also start thinking that to have fun you also have to be as small orbe smaller than the other girls you're partying with or you have to look just as246good, so you end up using to lose weight or to maintain your weight and as wellas resorting to disordered eating practices, if you can't get your hands on drugs oralcohol.C: How does disordered eating practices fit in? Like if you can't get your handson drugs or alcohol how might disordered eating practices show up?A: Just like because using and drinking kind of help you to lose weight and so ifyou didn't have access to drugs, then you can resort to like portion control, orlimiting what you eat or purging, that might come up too.Megan describes how substance misuse began to co-opt her ideas of 'fun.' Inorder to have 'fun,' she describes how important drinking or drugging is and eventually,in order to have fun, she 'has to look as good as the other girls.' Slowly alcohol anddrugs begin to redefine fun as 'alcohol and drugs' and creates rules and conditions thatneed to be met in order to have fun. She also describes how drugs can create theconditions for disordered eating practices to appear in someone's life. If you want to'stay thin' but don't have access to drugs, then disordered eating practices can appear,offering 'solutions' to help you maintain the thinness that you desire. According toMegan, these solutions take the form of 'portion control, limiting what you eat orpurging.'Megan:C: Did you notice any similarities in the way drugs and alcohol and disorderedeating practices worked in your life or did they share any of the same tactics orfulfil the same purposes?247A: When I used to lose weight or used to fit a certain pair of pants kind of thingthen yeah they did because it was both to lose weight or to wear a pair of pantsor to feel good on the first day of summer, to fit a bikini. For that kind of stuff,yeah.A: But they also kinda worked together. It wasn't just using and then eating all Iwanted. It was using and making sure that I wouldn't eat during the day, but likeif you don't eat during the day you'll be dead tired. So I would use and then Ihad energy and I wouldn't get quite so tired.C. So that kept you tied to both of them then.A: Definitely.Megan explains how at times 'drug use' became a means to attain thinness. Shealso explains how they began to work together, as drug use gave her energy that she waslacking as a result of not eating.Ava:C: At the time when you started to lose weight as a result of doing drugs, whathappened with ideas of thinness? Did they become more of a preoccupation foryou, like did ideas of losing more weight begin to show up?A: Yes. I didn't think of it at first\u2014no one said drugs will make you skinny. Ilearned that on my own. Like the more drugs I did, the more weight I wouldlose. And I kind of went like oh, okay that's kind of a new realization, how thedrug brought that on. But I didn't know that before. But the more drugs I did themore weight I lost. And then the more drugs I would do, cause the more weight Iwould loose.248There is a moment when Ava slows down in our conversation and appears tomake some meaningful connections between the ways that substance misuse anddisordered eating practices worked in her life. In fact, she says 'Oh, okay, that's kind ofa new realization, how the drug brought that on.' This illustrates how havingconversations about the ways that these problems work in people's lives can supportyoung woman in beginning to see the actual 'strategies and tactics' used by theproblems. It helps bring the known and familiar into a different light, which may createnew, richer learnings to help the young women recognize the inner workings of theseproblems in their lives.Below Emma describes the seriousness of where these problems took her\u2014tonot knowing if she was going to live or die. Disordered eating practices will usewhatever it can to its advantage. In this case, thinness from the drug and alcohol use.Disordered eating practices takes things a step further mandating over-exercise alongwith not eating and continued substance use.Emma:C: Okay. You had said that there was a time that they both overlapped?A: Yeah.C: How did that look?25A: It looked terrible, frightening. I had gone from being six feet tall and Xpounds, just fresh out of the eating disorder unit, and in two months I had gone down toX pounds and that was with drugs and alcohol and the eating disorder. That was the 25 Some of these questions and the responses they draw could be referred to as what the Fifth ProvinceApproach (Byrne & McCarthy, 1999) calls \"questions on the extremes\" (p.97), as they are attentive tohow these problems at times can be about life and death for people.249point in my life where it was the crossroads of if I was going to live or if I was going todie.Times vulnerable to the teaming upThe young women I interviewed were all very clear about the times thatsubstance misuse and disordered eating 'worked together' in their lives. It is myunderstanding that if the young women are aware of the times that they are morevulnerable to the teaming up of the two problems, then they can begin to avoid fallinginto the problems traps. During the interviews I asked questions that began todeconstruct the ways that these problems worked together. I wanted find out from theirexperience the ways that these problems worked together, what fed them, and whatmight provoke them. It is important to enquire about when they are likely to team upbecause it helps the young women to begin to recognize, in detail, how it is that theseproblems work in their lives. It also helps them recognize the times that they are mostvulnerable to these problems. As my therapeutic supervisor Heather Elliott describes, ifyou want to be able to track an animal, you need to know where it eats, where it lives,what times of the day it is active, when it sleeps, what its predators are, and what itlooks like (H. Elliott, personal communication, September 13, 2004). It is only whenthese details are unveiled that we can begin to 'track' the ways that the problems workin people's lives. Then the young women are better equipped to 'catch' it as they knowwhat they are looking for, and what form it can take. Helping them to take small stepsor large leaps away from these problems.Alexa:250A: Like they sneak in when I'm not feeling good you know. Sometimes I lookat myself and think, 'you know I used to be so skinny, why can't I be like thatany more?' And then that's when the disordered eating practices come in andthen the drugs come in. Then I just want to binge on Ecstasy for like for twoweeks, you know, like I'd be so skinny, cause I won't be eating for two weeks.But then sometimes it just helps me and I\u2014it's not a positive thought but just tothink, even the thought of just saying if I do that the second I start eating againI'll gain it all back.Disordered eating practices berate Alexa for not being as skinny as she used tobe. Drugs piggyback on the idea of Alexa needing to loose weight, and show up as afriend offering a suggestion. Alexa has begun to resist both problems and talks back tothe problems. This act of playing the tape through26 is an important act of resistanceagainst the problems she talks back to and questions the promises that disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse offer her. Having had some experience with theseproblems, she knows when they are promising her lies, and can see through them.Alexa:C: How do substance misuse and disordered eating play off of each other?A: They get you when maybe you're not feeling good; you know when you'refeeling down, like not self-confident and you give up on some things. Drugs arelike, 'we'll make your life fun again,' and disordered eating practices, 'wellcome to me. I'll make you skinny and beautiful.' 26 This is a practice often used by Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous and persons inrecovery, as a way to move through drug or alcohol cravings. It involves thinking through what wouldhappen if you were to use again, where it has taken you in the past and where it would most likely takeyou now. The idea being that in thinking through the consequences of where substance misuse may takethem it might interrupt a person's craving to use a substance.251Jessica:C: Have you found that these problems have a way of kind of teaming uptogether?A: Yeah. Well I found for a while when I would get clean off of, like, drugs Iwould go back to, like, the eating disorder. It was either one or the otherhappening until, like, a couple of years ago.C: How did that work? Do you have any ideas as to how come when you triedto quit drugs you went back to the eating disorder?A: Because I needed, like, something else there. Like, I hadn't dealt with theproblems that were actually like the rooted problems of it. I hadn't dealt with thewhole mental aspect, so I was just like basically trading one addiction for theother.C: Okay. So once you stopped using drugs. I'm quitting, I'm done?A: I'm done, yeah.C: Did it take a while for disordered eating practices to show up again?A: Maybe like a week or two.C: So do you remember ...,A: When I stopped doing drugs, I started gaining weight back, right, so then Iwent back to an eating disorder because I couldn't go back to drugs. Like then, Iwould like do my eating disorder shit and then I would relapse, like go get drugsand then the whole eating disorder would be put on hold because I wouldn't haveto worry about it because I wasn't eating anyway.252A pattern begins to emerge, when a young woman begins to step away from oneproblem, say substance misuse as Jessica describes above, then disordered eatingpractices resurfaced as an attempt to deal with the problems that had not yet been dealtwith, and/or to try to lose weight. As Jessica says, 'I needed something else.' When ayoung woman is making an attempt to stop using, disordered eating practices can showup with promises of taking away the feelings/memories a person may be having, or away to maintain their weight. In bringing the private conversations that either problemis having with the person into the open, we can examine the promises for what they are,look at what they are trying to convince them of and explore their ideas about this(Andersen, 1998; Madigan, 2007). This highlights the importance of talking about anddeveloping with young woman other ways to deal with, be with and learn that feelingspass. Unless people develop other ways to be with pain other than numbing it out [forexample, with drugs, alcohol, over-exercise, purging] the problems can always show upwith promises of taking it all away. Below, the young women all describe how drugsshowed up with promises that they would be able to lose weight quickly and then theywould no longer need to use, and they would be happy with their bodies.Jessica:C: What was it promising you?A: The promise for me was do drugs for about two weeks. About two weeksand that way your stomach would shrink to a certain point and you would feelconfident enough not to use the drugs and your stomach would feel small, whichis what happens, you know, you won't be hungry anymore.Megan:253A: When I stepped away from drugs and alcohol I realized that I was dealingwith eating disorders and if I wasn't putting substances into my body I stillwanted my body to stay the same way. I didn't want to start gaining weight backwhen I was eating and having an appetite. So without really thinking about it Ijust carried on with disordered eating practices and then I realized this wasn'tnormal.Hannah:A: Like when I was using there was so much weight loss right, and I thought thatwas like the total like way to be and then I stopped using and gained weight andI didn't like the way I was looking and that resulted in not eating and then eatingso much and then throwing up.Emma also describes the ways the problems used each other to get back into herlife.Emma:C: Did one ever use the other to get back into your life?A: Definitely.C: How did that happen?A: When I was doing well in terms of substance abuse, when I would stopusing, I would gain weight naturally. Like, when you have bean starvingyourself for so long and putting so much substances into your body, when youstop that, your body will change. That's natural. But the eating disorder was stillthere and still in full motion. And so, I would try to starve myself or diet even, I254still call it dieting. And that little voice would creep up and say 'I know how youcan lose the weight faster.'C: And what was that little voice? What did it say?A: That and it is true, is put things up your nose and you won't put things inyour mouth.Emma catches herself when she uses the phrase 'starve myself,' and quicklyreplaces it with the word 'diet.' And comments how she 'still calls it dieting.' It isimportant to note the difference between the meanings of the words. The words, 'starvemyself' calls anorexia for what it is. The word 'dieting' sugar coats anorexia andminimizes the inherent violence of anorexia and disordered eating practices.27 So whenthe young women began to take steps away from substance misuse, disordered eatingpractices is right there waiting on the sidelines ready to pull them back in. The youngwomen describe similar patterns of disordered eating practices re-appearing in theirlives when they begin to notice their body gaining some shape. Disordered eatingpractices can show up promising to take that shape away or help them to deal with thefeelings that substances may have been numbing.Megan talked about the ways that disordered eating practices and substancemisuse tried to get themselves back into her life.Megan:C: So like what kind of promises did drugs make you in those moments whenyou started to notice that your clothes weren't fitting? 27 For more see Coates & Wade (2007) regarding the ways that language can be used tominimize violence and responsibility.255A: Just that drugs can make you go back to how you were before. Make yousmall again and make you fit all your clothes again. So 'have fun.'C: So was that drugs voice speaking? I can help you with the weight and thenyou'll be done after that, like did the idea of just one more time, just lose Xpounds and then you'll be done ever show up?A: All the time, yeah. Just use this week and then you'll be back and then youwill go to the gym everyday and you won't need to use drugs or, disorderedeating practices because you'll be healthy and exercising and everything elsewill be fine because your exercising.C: So then once you quit using drugs did disordered eating practices start toshow up and make promises as well?A: Yeah. If you don't have time to go to the gym today, then you can just purgeeverything you ate today. Or just don't eat today. You don't need energy causeyou are not going to the gym.C: Wow it sounds like an evil tag team.A: Oh yeah, it was one or the other. Like if I didn't have enough money fordrugs, then I guess I won't eat today.It is interesting that when disordered eating practices and substance misuse showup, they present themselves as quick solutions to get Megan to where she wants to be. Itappears as a way to help her. It is as if both problems know that she does not want themin her life, but they offer her a fast way to achieve thinness, and then in a week she canstop the drugs and the disordered eating practices, and she'll be 'healthy and exercising.'256They work out what 'she wants' and knowing that she doesn't want to use again, offer itas a temporary way to achieve what she does want.Below Hannah describes how she used eating disorders as a cover up for herdrug use, one problem taking the fall for the other. People can then attribute her'thinness' to an eating disorder rather than to drugs and alcohol. We can see how in thisexample disordered eating practices become an alibi for substance misuse. It takes theblame and diverts the attention from the substance misuse problem. Clever, very clever.It also speaks to her understanding that disordered eating practices may be a more'acceptable' problem for a young woman to have than a drug habit. During theinterviews another young woman described how she felt justified in 'having an eatingdisorder' as it was just her 'dirty little secret' and thinking 'everyone does it.'Hannah:C: Like, did eating disorders ever try to define your identity? Did you ever referto yourself as anorexic?A: If I said I was it was like to hide that I was, like using at first. I told people Ihad an eating disorder. Don't worry about it.Any means necessary to lure people backIt is often when people begin to gain some freedom from one problem or theother that the other problem begins to rear its head.Beth describes how the problems attempt to 'get her back.'A: Or it's like you try on an old pair of pants that don't fit any more. I thinkthat's a big one, too.257C: So how would drugs and alcohol team up with a pair of pants not fitting inthat moment?A: Because I'm really skinny when I'm doing drugs. I may not have looked ashealthy but I was a lot thinner.C: And could you go quickly down that path?A: Oh yeah.Megan:C: Did you find that disordered eating practices affected your thoughts orshowed up at points when you were at Peak House?A: At first, yeah, when I started like eating regularly and like regularly eatingthree meals a day and even though it was healthy, you know I noticed that I wasgaining weight because my body is like, 'Oh my God, what's going on?'Beth:A: Well with the whole, anorexia that totally made drugs come back into mylife.C: Yeah?A: Oh, yeah. Like when I quit, I had a year clean, right, and I wasn't purging oranything and then all of a sudden I got back into that [disordered eatingpractices] and shortly after that, I was back into drugs.C: Okay, so how do you explain that?A: I didn't lose enough weight and I was like so focused on weight that I wasn'tdealing with anything anymore. I was trying to figure out something else topush it off to again and it was a hell of a lot easier like I said.258C: At the time did you know that's what pulled you back, like, were you awareof it at the time?A: No.C: No? What did it have to do to get you to not really notice what washappening? Like, how did it sneak in there without your knowing?A: Because I wasn't dealing or looking at anything, right?Beth describes how the problems begin to take up all of a person's time andenergy. She became distracted with losing weight and stopped dealing with other thingsin her life, which then made more space for the problem to show up and become a wayto help her cope with whatever she needed help with.Hannah:C: Okay. Did one ever use the other to sneak back into your life? Or did youever try to quit drugs and then maybe gained a little bit of weight and then,A: Yup.C: Do you want to say more about that?A: Like, when I quit drugs I gained the weight back. I would eat so much andthen I would be so unhappy with myself that I was actually eating so I would likethrow it up. Then I would go days without eating and I became so unhappy withmyself that I went back to drugs. And I remembered how fast it worked [losingweight] like the first time.C: So when you went back to drugs was it like I'll go back and I'll be loaded fora long time or was it like, I'll go back and lose X pounds and then stop using?A: Yeah. I'll just do it a couple of nights and then I'll be fine.259C: And did that work?A: No. Not at allC: So it lied to you in order to get back into your life?A: Um-hmm. Yeah.Teaming up in treatmentInterestingly, the places that are designed and set up to help people find freedomfrom their problems are often the places where people find other problems rearing theirugly heads. The 'other' problem (substance misuse or disordered eating) is most oftenshrouded in secrecy, which helps the problem flourish. Jessica astutely describes thiswhen she entered treatment for substance misuse. She did not mention struggles withdisordered eating practices so it could be her back-up to fall on should she need it.Because of this sort of reasoning, we need to find ways to support young women incoming forward with these problems so that they are not left at the mercy of eatingdisorder practices or substance misuse.Jessica:C: When you were working with therapists or other counsellors did you everhave the experience of having to hide one problem or the other?A: Yeah. I felt like I did. I wasn't completely honest.C: And which one ended up getting hidden?A: I think the eating disorder. I never really told people about that.C: How come?A: I don't know. I thought it was embarrassing.C: Did people ask you questions about it at all?260A: Yeah. They're like have you ever had an eating disorder and I was like 'No,I haven't.'C: So you kept quiet about it because you thought it was embarrassing. Werethere other reasons that you kept quiet about it?A: Yeah, that I won't be able to go back to it [to the eating disorder]. If Idecided I wanted to go back to it, it would be harder for me to go back to it whenI was there [in a treatment program]. If I found that I couldn't handle not havingdrugs, I could go back to the eating disorder without people being suspicious ofme because they wouldn't be looking out for it. That was my thinking back then.C: Do you think the eating disorder was influencing your decision not to tellanyone?A: Yeah, I had something to fall back on if I couldn't handle not doing drugs.In this way disordered eating practices shows up as a safety net, promising tohelp her out should she need it. This begs the question, what 'safety nets' can treatmentproviders put in place for young women as they are getting free from both problems sothat either substance misuse or disordered eating practices do not seem so appealing.Beth:C: When you were at Peak House did you think that you were going to have tohide it? Like did you think that you'd get kicked out if you were caughtthrowing up here?A: Yeah.C: So in a way did that put more pressure on you that you couldn't say anything?A: Yeah.261C: Was that a useful kind of pressure? Or was that a pressure that worked orsided with bulimia?A: The pressure sided with bulimia, bulimia was like keep hiding me, don't tellanybody right.Emma:C: What did like drugs and alcohol and eating disorders need to take advantageof or convince of you in order to become part of your life in the way they did?A: Yeah. That's a really, really good question.C: It is? How come?A: Yeah. That's a really good question. Because I can't honestly say that therehas been a time where I have been getting treatment for one thing where theother hasn't been secretly active. Like I felt like I had to hide it.Beth:C: You said purging showed up for you here [at Peak House] once you quitusing drugs?A: Yeah.C: Did it show up in a bigger way than it had been around in your life before, orthe same kind of way?A: I think in a bigger way because I knew that this time I actually wanted to quitusing drugs. People kept telling me I was going to gain a lot of weight intreatment and I flipped out because I didn't want to gain weight, so I startedpurging really bad.262C: So when you were purging was it just about trying to lose weight or did italso serve other purposes?A: No, it helped me through my feelings of anger and like upsetness. Instead ofcrying you can just get sick [purge] and get it all out, I guess.C: When you were here did bulimia offer you different promises about helpingyou out when drugs were not in your life? A: Yeah, it substituted something. It replaced the drugs because like I stillknew that it was going to make my feelings like not so bad. It was going tomake me thinner like you know. All those kind of thoughts. It became justanother way of escaping and not dealing with everything, right?It is interesting how disordered eating shows up as a way to take care of herproblems, promising to help her feel better. They promise an escape.Alexa:A: Doing drugs like you know, I didn't feel anything for maybe a year\u2014sincegrade nine, I've been smoking weed or drinking regularly since then. Thenwhen I started using 'blow' it took all my feelings away. Whereas withdisordered eating practices, well it was still there, but it snuck in a lot more here.It was like it knew that I was trying to get on with other things.C: How do you explain that it snuck in a lot more here?A: Because I was gaining weight back and I didn't want to turn to drugs to losethat weight, you know, but I didn't think it was wrong to have disordered eatingpractices. But then slowly, you know when I was here I was looking at myself,like I'm such a fuck-up and I'm18 years old, my best friends are going to school,263or working, you know, and I have my little niece coming to rehab to visit herauntie, you know. It's fucked up. Fucked up.C: Did that thinking ever make more space for disordered eating practices inyour life because you were thinking that you're such a fuck up?A: Yeah. It was like well at least I'm not doing drugs, so it doesn't matter if Ihave disordered eating practices you know. Its like fuck it. Like I don't care.The above section has illuminated the ways that the problems of disorderedeating practices and substance misuse can work together to stay active in a youngwoman's life. By unmasking the tactics that the problems use we are better equipped toask questions about them, and change our practices to better reflect the ways that theproblems work in the young women's lives. Below are some questions that can be ofuse to help unmask the 'relationship' between substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices.Questions Regarding the Interplay between Disordered Eating Practices and SubstanceMisuse Did one problem ever try to use the other to sneak back into your life? How didthey do that? How do substance misuse and disordered eating play off of each other? Have you noticed any similarities in the way drugs and alcohol and disorderedeating practices worked in your life? What do you now know about the ways that the two problems interacted in yourlife? How did you begin to understand this?264 Have you noticed that substance misuse and disordered eating practices shareany of the same tactics or fulfil the same purposes? Did they offer you different promises? Or were they the same promises Are there times when substance misuse and disordered eating practices weremore likely to try to use one or the other to sneak back into your life? Are there times or places when/where you may be more vulnerable to theproblems trying to sneak back into your life? Did the problems ever try to get you to stay quiet about them? Why do you thinkthey did this? Did they ever bully you into doing so? Do you have any ideas about how one problem or the other might flourish in atreatment centre?Section 6. Movement Away and Communal SolutionsIn section 3 of this chapter I described the requirements of the problems for theirsurvival as secrecy, a changed sense of who you are, diminished care for oneself, andbelieving the empty-promises that the problems tell. In section 4 I looked at how youngwomen were ensnared, and recruited by the problems of disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse. This section will focus on ways in which young women begin tomove away from these problems and keep some space between themselves and theproblems. This section will be sub-divided under four headings: (1) what the youngwomen describe as helping them gain some space from the problems, (2) what familymembers and supportive people in their lives did, (3) what therapists did or what theywould like them to do in order to support them in gaining space from the problems, and(4) the advice that they would give to young women struggling with similar problems.265Throughout the interviews, the young women were invited to reflect on theactions that they had taken to begin to free themselves from disordered eating practicesand substance misuse and to reconnect with how they preferred to be acting in theirlives. Inviting youth to take a reflective position supported them in accessing theknowledge they had about themselves and the problems interconnections. When peopleare involved with substance misuse and disordered eating practices, they are rippedaway from what Adams-Wescott, Dafforn and Sterne (1993) refer to as self-knowledge.Having therapeutic conversations that highlight this knowing positions the youngwomen as capable of challenging the problem-storied notions that they may believedefine them and creates alternate possibilities for these young women's futures. KarlTomm (1989), describes how \"...reflexive questions [that- deleted] enable self-healing...these questions embed the notion that the patient does have choices, and thatthe patient is an active agent in the course of their own lives\" (p. 56). It was my hopethat during our conversations the young women experienced a sense of agency in theirlives and over the problems (Tomm).A large part of the therapeutic work with the young women involves unveilingthe lies of the problems. Doing so supports them in seeing the actual effects that theseproblems have in their lives. A slow and careful line of questioning about the impactthat the interconnections of these problems have on their lives can open the door tonoticing or articulating the effects of these problems. This part of the work ofteninvolves a detailed exploration of the influence that disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse has been having on their lives and then asking the young people what266they make of this (White & Epston, 1990). A dialogic space is created where the youngwomen can question the impact that the problem is having on them.For example Are you okay with the impact that disordered eating practices and substancemisuse have been having on your life\u2014that they have ripped you away from thepeople that you love? Why or why not? Are there any aspects of the problem that you did not sign on for? If you had been given a full disclosure as to where these problems planned totake you would you have signed on for them? Why or why not? Are there any aspects of the way that the problems are treating you that youhave questions about or are not okay with?In taking a position against these problems, the young women begin to take aposition for themselves and their own lives. Therapists should be aware that while weare having a conversation with the young women, the problems may be countering andinterpreting every question that the therapist asks. Given that we are taking a positionfor the person and against the problem, we are a threat to the problem. In order tocounter this, therapists can inquire about what the problems are making of ourconversations, and what the problem thinks about the questions that we are asking. Forexample, we might ask the young women what they think substance misuse ordisordered eating practices thinks about our conversation, or if the problems are tryinghard to influence the way the questions are being answered. We can also ask aboutanorexia's and substance misuse's rules that they had to break in order to attend therapy.267One of the things that the young women described as helpful was looking at theactual effects and impact that these problems were having in their lives. Therapists cansupport young women in breaking the spell of substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices by asking about the young women's strengths and about the things substancemisuse and eating disorders have ripped them away from. We can support them byenquiring about qualities that they might have forgotten because of the focus ondisordered eating practices and substance misuse. It may be helpful to speak to theirloved one should the young women have a time remembering preferred qualities(Maisel, Epston, & Borden, 2004). In doing the above we are supporting the youngwomen to reconnect with themselves in preferred ways.What Young People Described as HelpfulNo longer believing the promisesThe young women described different ways to get some space from theproblems, but some of the recurring themes were that they 'got fed up' or 'tired' of theimpact these problems were having in and on their lives. They described a sort of spacedeveloping between themselves and the problems, which enabled them to see thepromises of disordered eating practices and substance misuse for what they are. Someyoung women described beginning to see that the 'costs' of the promises no longeroutweighed the 'benefits' of disordered eating practices or substance misuse. Slowlythe young women see through the problems' lies and question the promises that theyoffered them. In regards to the promises, Savannah says she now knows \"that they are abunch of bullshit, and that they [disordered eating practices and substance misuse] keepyou stuck in one place.\"268Jill describes a similar experience below where the cloak of lies surroundingsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices appears to have been lifted.Jill:C: How did you begin to figure out that there were other ways to feel good aboutyourself that were not dependent on your appearance?A: Well first I had to realize that those things didn't help me, they didn't helpme! They may have changed the way I looked, but they didn't change the way Ifelt about myself. They did temporarily, but then I wasn't happy. It didn'tchange my life, it didn't work for me and it didn't solve anything, it just madethings worse.As previously mentioned all the young women I interviewed (with the exceptionof two) were attending a residential substance misuse program and were free from drugsand alcohol. For many of the young women this was the first time in a long while thatthey were free from substances. After being in the program for a couple of weeks, thewomen described noticing that their thinking cleared once the fog of drugs and alcoholbegan to lift, better enabling them to see the consequences of substance misuse anddisordered eating practices for what they are and just how much of an impact they hadon their lives.Rachel describes how shortly after arriving at Peak House she recognized thatchange was possible.Rachel:A: Like when I first got here, things were a little hard, like you know, not easyor whatever, but after like the first few days, I actually started to notice how269things can be different, and seeing a few changes in myself right at thebeginning. It kind of made me feel that things really can be different and it mademe, like, not want to go back. Like okay, if just being here has made somechanges, what can I do when I'm really trying to change.When people get some time away from substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices, their thinking becomes clearer and they begin to see the impact that drugs andalcohol has been having on their lives. In stepping away from the problem even just alittle, they have a different perspective from which to view the problems. If the problemis not running their lives and directing their thinking, they are better able to see thedevastation the problems have caused in their lives and their relationships. When peoplegain a sense of agency, they can begin to have some hope that they can gain somefreedom from the problems. One of the ways that substance misuse and disorderedeating practices keeps people captive is by convincing them that they don't have aproblem and that they can stop at anytime. Both problems work very hard to keeppeople believing that they don't have a problem. For example, 'look at that person, theyare way worse off than you' and telling them 'you can stop anytime you want to.' Oftenthe young women only begin to recognize just how much of a problem they have whenthey attempt to stop. As Rachel said above, she began to notice changes in herself, andthese changes had her wondering if she might be able to make more changes in her life.In recognizing these changes she may begin to have some hope that things can bedifferent.270Using the strategies of one to get free from the otherOnce young women find some freedom/distance from one problem, they mightnotice that they are still struggling with another problem. For example, when a youngwoman enters a substance misuse program and has some time away from drugs andalcohol she might notice that thoughts or practices of weight preoccupation, restricting,bingeing, or purging begin to show up, reappear, or increase. These may be familiarthoughts and practices or they may be new. This is where the knowledge of what it tookto get free from one problem can be useful in finding freedom from the other. In otherwords, the strategies that a young woman uses to get free from alcohol and drugs mayalso free her from disordered eating practices. Alexa describes how she used what sheknew about freeing herself from drugs and alcohol to help her get some space fromdisordered eating practices by thinking about it as a drug.Alexa:C: So what did you have to do to get free from drugs and disordered eatingpractices in a way that you're no longer vulnerable to them teaming up together?A: Learning here that all the things that drugs do, and then once I learned allthose things that made me strong against drugs. I learned more and more aboutdisordered eating practices by myself. You know we don't have therapy sessionseveryday on disordered eating practices, so it's like, I learned by myself, byalmost thinking of it as a drug and if I thought of it as a drug - I'm still\u2014I'mbeing weak like I was to the drugs. I'm just letting it [disordered eatingpractices] take over me. Like 'You're still depending on me ha-ha ha, sucker.'271That's not me, I didn't - I had disordered eating practices when I was using. Itwas part of my using habits and I don't want my using habits any more.C: So you began to think of it almost like a drug. What did you begin to noticeabout the two that led to that discovery or way of thinking?A: Just thinking about the fact that it takes over my mind. It's not a questionwhether or not I was going to use every day. I was going to use every daybecause you use, you know. I'm a drug addict. I use every day. And I was like Ihave an eating disorder. I'm going to eat as little as I can each day and throw upwhatever I eat, each day. It is not a question it was part of my lifestyle, whichtook place while I was using, so it was my using lifestyle. Like lying, stealing,and cheating. That was all part of everything.Alexa describes how both problems made her 'weak' and had her 'depending' onsomething other than herself. Alexa knew that substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices were intertwined in her life and that if she wanted to be entirely free from oneproblem than she also needed address the other. In recognizing this she realized that ifshe wanted drugs and the lifestyle that went with it out of her life, then all of thepractices that went with it; lying, cheating, stealing and disordered eating practicesneeded to stop as well. Below Megan speaks of a similar experience, and how cuttingout drugs and alcohol led her to consider the impact that disordered eating practiceswere having in her life.Megan:A: Yeah. It came hand in hand for me, and now I'm glad that they cametogether so that when I cut drugs and alcohol out of my life it wasn't as hard for272me to cut disordered eating practices from my life too. It wasn't two totallyseparate problems for me. Like, I kind of learned to deal with drugs and alcohol,and then thought well why am I still doing this? It doesn't make sense. Justbeing open to criticizing yourself.C: What do you mean? Say more.A: Like, kind of getting mad at myself too. Like why are you doing that? Forthe first week I was still trying to purge, cause I didn't like what was going on.C: Like what was going on with your body?A: Yeah. I didn't know anybody here so I wanted to still be that smaller person,cause people would then want to be my friends. But now I look back and I thinkthat was stupid. Like now if I ever get those thoughts I think why would you dothat? That doesn't make sense. It's like calling yourself on what you're doing.Megan describes how one of the tactics that disordered eating practices used totry to sneak back into her life was that it would be a way to help make her body smaller,and that if she was thin then other people would want to be friends with her. Justrecognizing these tactics makes a person less vulnerable to them appearing in their lives,as they can notice when the problems are making a play for them, and interrupt themrather than acting on it.From the interviews it became apparent that the realization that they go hand inhand is very important. There appears to be a turning point when the young womendecided that they no longer wanted any of these problems in their lives, as they were notin line with their hopes for their lives. When people begin to see both problems as 'aproblem' rather than separate problems, they begin to realize that in order to break free273from one there can be no room for the other. At this point the recognition that oneproblem can lead to the other and can feed off of the other can be very helpful. Forexample, if a young woman is taking a firm position against drugs, and knows thatdisordered eating thoughts and practices bring her closer to drugs, then this gives her allthe more reason to be on the lookout for the ways in which disordered eating practicescan sneak back in. When young women become astute at recognizing the 'tactics' of theproblems they are less vulnerable to them sneaking back in. This discovery appears tobe important in helping people get free from both problems.Michelle articulates her knowings of the interconnections as follows:A: If I don't keep up the healthy eating habits then I'm going to fall back todrugs. Because for me, they go hand in hand. Other people, they, other peoplecan just have one, which in a way I kind of, I don't know. Like sometimes Ithink it would be easier to only have one of the problems. But at the same time,I think it would be a lot harder, because - like being in here, I know once I getout, if I start doing drugs, the eating disorder will come back. But if I starthaving the eating disorder again, then the drugs are coming to come back. But ifI only had one, I don't know what would be - like holding me up - keeping meaway from them.C: Having both keeps you away from both?A: Yeah. Yeah. And I don't, like, a lot of people don't think like that but that'skind of what keeps me holding on to staying away from both of them.As people take steps away from problems they also take steps toward acting inways that are more in line with their values for how they wish to be in the world.274Below, Alexa describes how she wants to be honest with the people in her life, whichthen leaves no room for substance misuse or disordered eating practices as they bothinvolve lying to people around her.Alexa:C: Are there things you tell yourself that help remind you of how when you arehappy with yourself you don't need disordered eating practices or drugs?A: Yeah I remind myself of all the people I have hurt by lying and that I washurting them by lying all the time.C: How does that keep you away from disordered eating practices?A: Cause I don't wanna be lying and I'm not gonna tell my mom 'Okay I'm justgonna go puke now.' Like disordered eating practices can lead me back, and Idon't want to go there. And I just remind myself of that on days where I think'Ahh, I ate a lot, and I don't want to feel this way.' But I just think about thefeelings on other days that I felt that I'm too good for it I know I'm better thanwhat I'd be putting myself through. Cause it hurts people and I remind myself ofwhat people said. Like I have friends that tell me Alexa you're beautiful. Or I'llremind myself of the days when I thought that I looked too skinny. And peoplehave told me, 'you were too skinny, like you look so gorgeous now that you'rehealthy.'Alexa also gives a detailed list of the ways in which she speaks back todisordered eating practices. This keeps her from acting on the thinking 'Ahhh, I ate a lot,and I don't want to feel this way.' As Michelle describes,275A: I mean I still have that craving to use drugs but I also have that fear in me thatI'm going to turn into one of those girls that weights X pounds and they're like25 years old, and I don't want that. And I know that if I keep doing drugs theeating disorder will stay with me.People begin to take positions based on what it is they want for their lives ratherthan allowing disordered eating practices and substance misuse to run their lives. Indoing so they begin to have more agency in their lives. As therapists we can askquestions that highlight these new developments. For example, Is there a disconnect between what you want for your life and what the problemswant for your life? What type of plans do you have for yourself given that substance misuse anddisordered eating practices are no longer directing your life? How do these plans differ from the types of plans that disordered eating practicesand substance misuse may have had for your future?Asking questions that highlight these new developments can be seen as askingthickening the stories the young women's may prefer to tell about their lives (White &Epston, 1990; Geertz, 1973).Preferred selvesWhen the young women get some space from these problems, their actions beginto line up with how they wish to be living in the world. People are then in a betterposition to imagine different possibilities for their lives. People also begin to contradictthe stories that disordered eating practices and substance misuse tell about them.According to White and Epston (1990):276...when persons seek therapy, an acceptable outcome would be the identificationor generation of alternative stories that enable them to perform new meanings,bringing with them desired possibilities-new meanings that persons willexperience as more helpful, satisfying, and open-ended (p. 15).To this effect, therapists can ask clients to distinguish between how they want to beacting versus how they are acting. For example,Megan:C: It sounds like there is a disconnect between what you want for your life andwhat disordered eating practices and drugs and alcohol want for your life andthose things don't fit together.A: No. Like being skinny doesn't make you successful.C: So if you don't want to see yourself as a partier and someone who is all abouttheir looks. How would you prefer to see yourself?A: I'd rather be seen as someone who does what she says she's gonna do\u2014someone who follows through with her word. I see myself as a person who isstrong, like a strong person. Like if I say I'm not going to do something, I'm notgonna turn around and do it.Drugs and alcohol and disordered eating practices disconnect people fromthemselves, and rob them from knowing who they are. If they had lived differently inthe very far off past, the problems try to convince them that is now unreachable andunattainable. 'That's the old you.' When people gain some freedom from theseproblems, their preferred actions are often radically different than when they areweighed down by these influences. As we can see above, Megan wishes to be known as277'someone who follows through with her word.' By getting some space from theproblems she was able to see that the problems were influencing her actions in ways thatwere not in line with her values.Navigating a new territoryAn important part of the work in getting free from substance misuse anddisordered eating practices is finding ways to get some space from the problems, and tofind a way to turn down the volume on the voice of substance misuse and disorderedeating practices. When the problems have an enormous influence on how people viewthemselves and over their lives, there is little space left for the young women to assertinfluence over their own lives. Once people are aware of the ways the problems work intheir lives, such as the times that they are most likely to appear, people and places theymight show up around, times when they don't appear, people can begin to learn tonavigate themselves away from the problem's territory. People also gain a sense of justhow it was that these problems gained the upper hand in their lives. When this occurs,young women can question and talk back to the problems; to the promises, and the lies,and remind themselves of where the problem has taken them in the past and where it cantake them again in the future. Below the young women describe the actions that theyhave found helpful in not getting lured back in by substance misuse and disorderedeating practices.Alexa:C: Are there things that you do to keep some distance from drugs and alcoholand eating disorders? Are there things you do to keep them from showing up inyour life?278A: Yeah.C: What do you do? Are they the same strategies for both or are they differentstrategies?A: These days it's getting more control over my thinking. I am writing in myjournal positively. It's like me having a choice in that happy self. And when Ilook at everything in a good way then I constantly keep seeing things in a goodway, then I don't need disordered eating practices and when I'm happy withmyself I don't need those drugs. You know they are nothing to me. And beingtruthful and like honest to myself and others.Beth describes what she needed to learn in order to step away from the problems,Beth:C: Okay. So, what did you have to learn to be able to break free from alcoholand drugs and eating disorders?A: What did I have to learn?C: Yeah.A: Yeah, I had to learn different techniques of dealing with things. Like insteadof throwing up, I'll go journal, that kind of thing or I'll go sit with people andnot sit by myself. And then sometimes I just, like, take a hot bath or put onreally comfy clothes so I feel better. C: Were there things you had to learn to move through cravings for alcohol anddrugs? Like maybe how to be with the feelings that alcohol and drugs tookaway?A: Yeah. I had to learn how to deal with feelings again.279C: Were there specific feelings you had to learn to deal or sit with?A: Like, I had to learn that it was okay to cry. I had never really done, that's nothow my family is and then it's learning that it's all right to cry. Like oh my godif I ever saw someone cry, I started laughing. Like 'what are you doing?'because I was so like nervous 'Oh my God, why is this guy crying?' So I reallyhave to learn, like, to deal with emotions.Below Jill describes how caring about 'an image' was getting in the way of herstepping into a better life for herself.Jill:C: Were there things that you did that helped catch the problem's reappearance?A: Catch the problems' reappearance? Hmm, umm I just stopped caring. I juststopped caring about that image that I wanted to be. I just stopped trying toachieve the unachievable.C: Okay. What did that allow you to step into?A: A better life, happiness, good self-esteem.In my experience this is one of the most important aspects of therapy\u2014helpingpeople move forwards in ways that they want to be living their lives. Michael White(2007) writes:...intentional state categories like purposes, aspirations, quests, hopes, dreams,visions, values, beliefs, and commitments. It is into these filing cabinets of themind that people file a range of conclusions about their own and each other'sidentities. ... All of these conclusions, including those of the internal statecategories, significantly influence people's actions; they are shaping of life. Put280another way, it is not actually \"things\" like motives and needs that shape life, butsocially constructed conclusions about life (p. 107).It follows that the questions we ask in therapy can be influential in shaping ofyoung women's lives. Our questions are not neutral and they can begin to beconstitutive of a young woman (Andersen, 1992a).Megan:C: Okay. So in order for you to break free of this view of yourself, that you hadto look a certain way, and had to fit a certain size of clothes and had to be the girleveryone wants to spend time with, what did you have to do to break out of thatway of thinking?A: I had to take a serious look at what I was doing and if that's what I wanted tobe remembered for. Like I don't want to look back at myself and think I was atevery party and don't remember any of them. And like, yeah she was probably asmallish girl in grade 11 but she looked disgusting. I don't want to beremembered as that. I'd rather be remembered as somebody who was superhealthy, right. Like she may have been at a few parties right but she was neverlike the person passed out on the floor and locked in the bathroom all night.Our conversations can act as resources to further strengthen how the youngwomen want to be in the world.Becoming comfortable with ones' selfIt appears that care for oneself is an anti-dote to the practices and ways ofdisordered eating and substance misuse. The young women described how when theybegan to have care for themselves they were no longer willing to act towards themselves281in the ways that disordered eating and substance misuse require. Breaking free from thegrasp of substance misuse and disordered eating practices helped people be OK withthemselves on their own terms. The young women described starting to speak tothemselves with care, and this appeared to be a turning point in their lives.Ava:C: What did you have to do or did you have to learn, in order to break free fromtaking drugs or say the idea that you have to look a certain way in order to fit in?A: I used to like looking a certain way, and I think when you get enough self-love, self-care and confidence, it doesn't matter, right. I'm totally comfortablewith my body and I'm really comfortable with my face now and I can wear lessmakeup. I don't care.C: What did you have to do to get there?A: Go to treatment.C: Really and how did that make a difference? How did treatment help you findself-love, self-care, and self-confidence?A: For the first time in five years I'm not using drugs. I'm not being fooled. I'mtaken out of society and the brainwashing and the commercials and the people.Away from the people in my community, where I have to be a certain way andit's just, it's real here. And it's just like accepting I look the way I look. I'malways gonna look the way I look so deal with it. And I know that if I amconfident then I'm much more beautiful than the way I actually look and when itcomes to like my body and stuff, it's the confidence. If you have the confidence282it shines through more than your actual look, you know. And real people seethat. And if you want real people in your life then you gotta be real.C: Is that the same thing then for drugs and alcohol, self-care, self-love andconfidence, that those things act as an antidote to the drugs and alcohol in yourlife as well?A: Yeah. Because like when you are using you don't have self-care.Ava describes how she developed a different understanding of what it means tobe beautiful. This new understanding led to a different relationship with her body and toself-confidence. She speaks to how getting some distance from 'society and thebrainwashing and the commercials and the people' allowed her to question thesepractices. She now wants to surround herself with the types of people that support thisway of being. Interestingly, Ava remarks that she learned this in treatment. What doesthis say about the way in which we are raising our young women that they need to leavetheir people and communities and come into treatment to learn about care forthemselves?Megan:C: With drugs and alcohol and disordered eating practices are there times whenyou might be more or more or less vulnerable to the teaming up say in the past oreven now?A: Like now is when you find that self-love, and self-worth and you are happy,not a hundred percent happy but happy enough with yourself that one little thingwon't affect you as much as it would have before when everything else iscrumbling down. Like if I gain an extra X pounds it's not the end of the world.283Cause I still feel comfortable with myself, in other aspects. Like weight is noteverything.Disordered eating practices have lost their grip on Megan; she no longer believes'that weight is everything.' Disordered eating practices flourish when they can convinceyoung women that weight is everything\u2014then they will be willing to submit themselvesto extreme measures and regimes that disordered eating practices requires. But asMegan states, 'like if I gain an extra X pounds it's not the end of the world,' she can seethat she is more than what she weighs or what she looks like. And with this mindset,anorexia looses its power. Hannah describes something similar when she starts to re-think ideas of beauty, and in fact she describes the thinness that she once idolized as'disgusting.'Hannah:C: Okay. So at Peak House when you quit using substances were there timesthat eating disorders tried to sneak in here?A: At first, yeah. Like I was eating regularly, like I have to eat when I'm here soit's like 'Oh my God, I'm going to gain so much weight.' Especially the firstcouple of weeks, right.C: The first couple of weeks, what happened after the first couple of weeks thatmade it easier?A: Well then I started to look at myself and become happier like yeah, I lookdisgusting. I don't have to look like that any more. I can learn to be happy withwho I am. I don't need anything to make or that change that.284The young women spoke of no longer being influenced by the problems in thesame way. It was almost like a curtain had been lifted, and they could see the impactthat these problems had over their lives. When the curtain lifted they could seethemselves, and they were no longer seeing themselves and others through theproblems' eyes.Alexa:C: So what did you have to learn or what did you have to figure out in order tobreak free from substance misuse and disordered eating practices so that it didn'thave the same kind of power over you.A: What did I have to do?C: Yeah?A: Find self-love.C: For both problems?A: Yeah. I didn't love myself while I was using and I didn't love myself while Ihad disordered eating practices. And as soon as I started seeing that it, it was ohI don't need it. Once I started recognizing all the good things about myself, Ididn't need either of them.C: Very cool.A: And I recognized that I was fun you know and people cared about me so Ididn't need to use drugs. I was looking for more in life. Like I was looking formore friends, more fun, but it's just because I took for granted\u2014I tookeverything I had for granted already like my good friends. I took them forgranted while using and I was looking for new friends. Taking for granted like285how I acted, and how good I looked being sporty kinda thing you know. Butthen the eating disorder came in.I was surprised by the amount of times that the young people mentioned self-love as an antidote to these problems. The simplicity of it struck me. As did thediscourses, media, dialogue, and practices that rip us away from this place. This simplenotion is not so simple when we think of the structures that would need to be dismantledin order to do just this.Beth:A: I think just getting away and realizing that it's not what's on the outside thatmatters it's on the inside. Beauty is on the inside it's much more than skin deep.It's totally your inner beauty that counts and it outweighs the outer beauty by far.Like, you can be totally gorgeous but just a nasty person, you know. Like,would you rather be like this nasty person that looks absolutely gorgeous or anaverage looking person that has a gorgeous personality.The young women described developing a gentleness with themselves. Theyrecognized that the re-appearance of thoughts of disordered eating practices or substancemisuse does not mean they have to act on those thoughts. In this way they began havingmore of a say in their lives and over their actions.Jessica says,A: In my life, I'm always going to have body image issues and I haveacceptance over that. But any time where it's been sobriety from both, the eatingdisorder is still there, it's just about managing the thought. It's keeping it as athought and not practices.286Rachel:C: And how about eating disorders? How long has it been since you've beenfree from those ideas, and practices?A: I don't know. Like the ideas reappear all the time and it's just knowing whento be reasonable with yourself.This suggests that when the young women reconnect with the care they have forthemselves that it works as an anti-dote to these problems.Learning to Keep the Problems at BayThe young women described learning how to get free and stay free fromsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices by piecing together what worked andwhat didn't. As therapists we can support people in their journey away from problemsby enquiring about the times they feel farthest away from these problems, the momentsthe problems are not around, the times that the problems feel the closest, and about thepeople who they feel safest around and who support them in staying free fromdisordered eating practices and substance misuse (Berg & Miller, 1992). Therapists canalso inquire about the feelings that disordered eating practices and substance misuse aremost likely to take advantage of, and learn with the young women about the details ofjust how it is that the problems try to make a comeback in their lives. In this way wecan support people in making safer choices with these problems and to be safer withthemselves.Below Emma has conceptualized 'relapse' as existing outside of black and whitenotions of 'you are clean' or 'you are not clean.' When young women think that relapseequals failure, problems can take advantage of this and convince them that they might as287well keep drinking or purging. However, if we can slow this discourse down we areable to find movements away from the problem, which can develop into a rich storylinefor what it is that they want and prefer for their lives, and the ways that they are takingsteps towards this. 'Relapse' within this framework is seen as normal, predictable andpart of the learning process.Emma:C: You know as you say that I have this image of someone deciding to walk offa cliff.A: Yeah, that's what it is. Yeah. That's exactly the best way to imagine that,because that's what it is.C: And I'm also thinking about what you have been doing and what you cancontinue doing to slow down. So that you have a guardrail to catch you beforego over the cliff?A: Yeah. Once you relapsed enough, you kind of get to the point where youhave\u2014well, you have that moment of maybe this isn't the best idea, and everytime that happens and you do you know, the first time it happens you struggleand struggle and struggle and struggle and work so hard to get back up. Thesecond time you're just like, 'My God, did I do this again?' and it's still reallyhard. And the third time, like, okay, I know how to do this. It's going to bedifficult but I can do it. I've done it before. And then the fourth time it's almostlike you've built yourself a little roadblock.C: Nice, something to slow yourself down.A: Exactly.288What follows is a list of some of the strategies that the young women describedin the interviews as having been helpful in finding some freedom from the problems, aswell as strategies that they have used to keep some space between themselves and theproblems. These answers were in response to the question, 'Are there things that you doto keep some distance from the problems and/or strategies to catch the problems re-appearance?'Strategies that Young People Described as Helpful Not comparing yourself with others Reminding yourself that you are healthier than you were before Not glorifying substance misuse or disordered eating practices, and throwing outpictures that do Not isolating your body into parts and picking it apart Keeping busy and having a schedule Distracting oneself when thoughts /ideas of substance misuse or disorderedeating practices appear (for example, reading, listening to music, going for awalk with a supportive person) Keeping on top of things so that it doesn't lead to feeling overwhelmed Writing positively in a journal Building important things into your life, so that you have things that you don'twant to loose Remembering where substance misuse and disordered eating practices took you,playing the tape through, and reminding yourself where it will take you again Surrounding yourself with a solid community of supportive people289 Staying away from friends who misuse substances or are preoccupied withweight Giving away clothes that no longer fit Looking at pictures that remind you of where you don't want to be again Remembering everything you are getting back in your life Making connections between the ways the two problems work together and howone can use the other to sneak back inQuestions to Address Movement Away and the Communal Solutions that theseProblems Can ShareThese questions are focused on helping the young women begin to recognize theways that the problems may be similarly operating in their lives and ways that they maybe able to use the strategies that they used to get free from one problem to begin to getfree from the other. Some young women may prefer to find freedom from one first andthen the other; others may choose to address the two simultaneously. What did you have to learn to begin to break free from substance misuse and/ordisordered eating practices? Are there strategies you have been using to get free from one problem that mighthelp you get some space from the other? Or, Are there strategies that you mayhave used to get free from one problem that you are finding helping in gainingsome freedom from the other? Since getting free from disordered eating practices or substance misuse whathave you learned about yourself (skills, preferences, abilities) that may assistyou in finding freedom from the other problem?290 With drugs and alcohol and disordered eating practices are there times when youmight be more or more or less vulnerable to the teaming up? Are there certaintimes of the day, people or places that you need to be careful around? Are there things that the problems may try to use to their advantage to try tosneak back in your life? How might they use the other problem to help themsneak back in? What are the things that you do to help catch the problem's reappearance? Arethese the same for both problems? Different? Are there things that you do to keep some distance from substance misuse anddisordered eating practices? What do you do? Are they the same strategies ordifferent strategies? What did you have to do or have to learn, in order to break free from substancesor disordered eating practices so that it didn't have the same kind of power overyou? How did you begin to figure this out? Did anyone help you in this? If you continue to gain freedom from these problems where do you imaginebeing in a months time? In 3 months time? What Family Members/Important People in Their Life DidThis section stands against mother blame and individualism. It also supports myargument against individualist notions of self: people need people to live and createchange in their lives. As therapists, an important part of our work is to create audiencesand communities for the witnessing of new meanings, practices, and understanding. It isthrough this process that a preferred or re-remembered performance of self can emerge.291People come to know what they know and to know themselves through community andconnection with others.This also speaks to the importance of having support in women's lives in orderto find and maintain freedom from substance misuse and disordered eating practices.Sometimes this is difficult, as disordered eating practices and substance misuse can ripthrough families and cause huge divides. Its difficult for families members to hold ontotheir memories and knowings of 'their little girl' when their daughter is acting in waysthat they could never have imagined possible. Disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse gain even more strength when they manage to turn the young womenagainst their families and their families and friends begin to lose hope that they will eversee their daughter or friend again. Disordered eating practices and substance misuse alsowork hard to turn family members and friends against the young women. Yet the peoplein the young women's lives are important resources and can act as memory keepers(Maisel, Epston & Borden, 2004); gently reminding them of who they are, until the fogof drugs and alcohol and disordered eating practices begins to clear and they can seethemselves again. Therapists can work to create a community of concern (Madigan &Epston, 1995) to stand alongside them as a way to begin to break up the isolation anddisconnection from community and families that substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices strongly try to impose. People need connections and support to stay free fromsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices. Countless other therapists havewritten about the importance of having an audience and a community to witness andhold a person's memory. Tom Andersen (1987, 1991), Barbara Myerhoff (1982, 1986),Michael White & David Epston (1990), Stephen Madigan (1999), The Just therapy292Team (2003), all work hard to connect and reconnect people with important communityand family members in their lives and 'back with themselves.' Letter writing campaignscan act as counter-documents to the words/voices/lies of drugs and alcohol anddisordered eating practices (Madigan & Epston; White & Epston).Family members and other supports offer a different perspective than theperspective that substance misuse and disordered eating practices give. So it seems thatwhen people become self-reflexive, they can start to change, and take steps away fromthe problems they are faced with. This is good 'evidence' that the modernist,individualist discourse, which tends to be unreflexive can generate further pathology (S.McNamee, personal communication, August 23, 2009). Given that the modernistnotions of psychology locate problems internally there is little space for the generationof new knowledges that relational externalizing allows for (Bird, 2000).In the interviews it became apparent that the problems worked hard and oftensucceeded in ripping the young women away from their support and turning them awayfrom the people that loved and cared for them. When this occurred, the problemsappeared to gain more strength. Below I have included examples from our conversationsthat describe the importance of connection and community as an antidote to theproblems of disordered eating practices and substance misuse.Family, Friends and Community Members as AlliesFamilies and friends can act as allies to support young women in getting theirlives back from substance misuse and disordered eating practices. They are memorykeepers, supporters, and helpers in the process. If family members engage with the ideathat disordered eating practices and substance misuse are external intruders, they can293leverage themselves against the problem. Family members can be instrumental inhelping young women question the impact that these problems have in their lives and ingetting them to a counsellor or treatment program. Hannah and Rachel both reflect onthe importance of support in helping them get to Peak House.Hannah:C: In order to break free from this view of yourself what did you do, did anyoneelse help you break free from that view?A: PaulC: What did he do to help you?A: And his mom. I don't know, just gave me like support to get help. Like hedidn't force me to do anything. They let me live with them and they were likewell maybe you should go to treatment because that would be the best thing togo and if you don't like it you can come home. I wasn't being told, like I had tocome to the conclusion I wanted help. But just having people being there tosupport me no matter what I did.Rachel describes her friends and family as instrumental in getting her to PeakHouse. She describes how her mom thought she was 'getting really depressed and stuff'so she got her to see a counsellor.C: Were there times when alcohol and drugs and eating disorders have beenless of a problem in your life, and if so what actions did you take to make thispossible.A: Being here. And being with certain people.C: Were there certain people that lessened the strength of the problem?294A: My friends, my family, and I went camping, and I remember I broke downbefore we left and I didn't want to go back. I told my family that I was scaredthat I'll start using again and having this time away from drugs and being herewith you guys like, just changed everything so much I don't want to leavebecause things will go back to the way they were. And they said, you know, itsup to you to change; 'we can't live here forever, this isn't our house.' So wewent back and things did go right back to where they were, but it really didlike\u2014I think that going there that time, after trying to clean up so many timesreally made a difference and like I remember shortly after that I was cleaning myroom and I found the Peak House flyer that the drug and alcohol counsellor gaveme and I just found it and actually read it and that really helped me.In the time that Rachel had away from the problems she was able to see adifferent perspective on how things could be if the problems were no longer in her life.Counsellors can plant seeds of information (H. Elliott, personal communication October3, 2006). Perhaps young people are not ready to act on the information now but theymight at a later point, as Rachel describes her counsellor had previously given her aflyer for Peak House but it wasn't until later that she entertained the notion of attending.Given the power that substance misuse and disordered eating practices have torewrite people's identities, families and friends can act as allies against this (Maisel,Epston, & Borden, 2004). Families can refuse to side with the view that the problemsare trying to have them see.Jill:295C: In order to break free from this view of yourself, what did you do or didanyone else help you do in order to break free from that view of yourself.A: My guardian helped me get through it, and see who I am, he reminded me ofwho I am. He's known me most of my life and he kept reminding me of who Iam.Megan explains the importance of her mother having held on to her memorywhen Megan was under the influence of the problems.Megan:C: So how or did anyone help you take that serious look at yourself andrecognize this isn't what I want; I don't want to be that girl in the bathroom?A: My mom. Because she was really close to me my whole life. She saw thechanges and I didn't want to see them. She kept pointing them out slowly andmaking me look at myself even if I didn't want to. She kept making me look atwhat I was doing and saying this isn't you. I don't know who you're trying to bebut it's not you.C: What did she help you see?A: She made me feel like\u2014like the daughter who she knew, like the daughter Iwas\u2014who a few months ago, was always prepared for school, always organizedand just like on top of everything, and then looking at who I was then, I didn'thave anything organized because I was too busy worrying about how I looked orhow other people were seeing me. But not important people like the teachers.296Friends, Family and Community to Help Keep some Distance from Substance Misuseand Disordered Eating PracticesA supportive community of concern (Madigan & Epston, 1995) can act as anantidote or barrier to the empty void that problems attempt to drown people in.Ava:C: So are there any things that you do to help keep some distance from eatingdisorders, drugs and alcohol or any strategies that you use to catch the problemsreappearance?A: There are meetings for substance misuse and meetings for eating disorders aswell so, meetings and being around people. And one of the big things isknowing you are not alone and knowing that I can say anything at a meeting.Feeling alone is such a bad shitty feeling 'Oh I'm alone and I'm the only onegoing through it'\u2014but really you aren't. So being unable to say it feels like noone else in the world knows what I feel\u2014and just being able to share thatemotion with someone kind of helps to take it away. It kind of helps whenyou're having a hard time and you see someone who's gone through it and theyare happy now, that gives you hope.Hope that change is possible is such an important part of change. As therapists,part of our job is to hold onto hope when others' hope is thinning. The possibility ofhope is often what keeps people moving forward, and refusing to give up. The youngwomen all described how their hope expanded in connection with others.Megan:297C: Are there things that you do that help you keep some distance fromdisordered eating practices and drugs and alcohol or are there strategies that youuse to catch the problems from reappearing?A: Being around people who don't\u2014like who aren't using and people who wantto have lives free of drugs and alcohol and disordered eating practices, peoplewho aren't\u2014who you know aren't using behind your back right.C: Why is that important? How does that keep drugs and alcohol far from you?A: Because it's not\u2014like it's not in your life. It's not in your life at all.Below Megan offers her observations on the ways that strong relationships notonly helped her get free from problems they are also what continue to keep her fromproblems.Megan:C: Are there strategies that you use to catch the problems from sneaking backin?A: Mmm, I haven't really put that to the test yet so I don't really know.C: What do you imagine doing?A: If I have strong relationships with my family, I know that I don't want tohurt them anymore. Also like I don't want to lose their support, so I keep that inmind. And my supportive friends I don't want to let them down. Just keepingthem and my health in mind.When a young woman begins to take steps or even begins to contemplate thepossibility of freeing themselves from disordered eating practices and substance misusethis is a huge feat. Family, friends and therapists can act as important resources in298helping people remember who they were prior to alcohol and drugs and disorderedeating practices making an appearance in their lives. In our work as therapists we caninvite others to stand with the person against the voice of disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse. Connecting and reconnecting people with others helps make real thesupport-it is an embodied connection with others. It helps take the power away fromdisordered eating practices and substance misuse if someone is standing with them.Ava:A: You're less vulnerable when you're happy.C: How is happiness an antidote to the teaming up?A: I think when I'm truly happy I'm being supported\u2014and I can see clearly. Ican see that drugs won't make me better and it's not going to make me look anybetter or be any better or be any cooler, and certainly not like any eatingdisorder.Ava continues,C: Did it make a difference having other people around you helping you quit?A: Yes. Because you know, people think they can do it on their own but youcan't. The drugs in your brain, they're making you think you can, but you can't.Family members, parents, and friends, can hold onto their knowing of a youngwomen until she is able to join them in this (Maisel, Epston & Borden, 2004). Justas problems counter the words of loved ones, loved ones can counter the words ofthe problems. For example, parents can speak to their concern that the problems arecausing in the young persons life, and can express their worry about the299ramifications this is having. They can ask questions about how these practices mightbe interfering with the young women's dreams or hopes.For example, I was working with a young person struggling with disorderedeating practices and she was describing a party that she was invited to go to on theweekend. In a very anti-anorexic move she was planning on attending, but wasnoticing that since she had made up her mind to go, anorexia had been ramping upits strategies to keep her from going. Anorexia had given her permission to go if shedidn't eat for four days before the party. Anorexia was also trying to convince herthat she had nothing to wear, telling her she was too fat to fit into any of her clothes.She described the painful process of trying on many outfits none of which metanorexia's requirements. As she described in detail her agony over getting dressedfor the party she was invited to imagine her best friend standing alongside her as shewas getting dressed. We discussed what her friend would say about how she looked,and what anorexia would be telling her about her friends opinion of her. I asked herwhat her friend would say back to the voice of anorexia if she was able to speak onher behalf. What would her friend think about the way that anorexia was talking toher? Would she be okay with this? Would her friend agree with what anorexia wassaying or would she have a different opinion? The young women's friend was animportant voice to counter the all-powerful voice of anorexia, and supported her innot having to be alone with anorexia, thus beginning to build a community ofconcern (Madigan & Epston, 1995).300Questions to Enquire About What Family and Friends Did That Was Helpful Have there been ways that your family and friends have been supporting you ingetting some distance from substance misuse and disordered eating practices? Who in your life do you think would have known that you would have been ableto find some space from these problems? What do they know about you thatwould have them knowing this? What person, place or thing has most supported you in finding freedom fromsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices? What would you like the person's in your life to know about how they can bestsupport you in moments when you are struggling?What Therapists Did That Was Helpful and/or What Young Women Would Like Themto doThis section highlights the intimate local knowledge (Geertz, 1983) or insiderknowledge (Epston, 1999) that the young women have regarding their lives and theirexperience of the problems of disordered eating practices and substance misuse. Itspeaks to the importance of listening and honouring the young women's wisdom and thedirection they wish therapy to go in (Anderson & Goolishian, 1988). In the preface totheir book, Insoo Kim Berg and Scott Miller (1992) write, \"this book is based on ourfaith that all clients have the resources and strengths necessary to solve their ownproblems, that they know and want what is good for them, and that they are doing thebest they can\" (p. x). I wholeheartedly agree with that. In fact, this dissertation is atestament to that statement. During the interviews I asked the young women what their301experiences with therapists was regarding what they had found helpful and or unhelpfulwhen addressing the problems of substance misuse and disordered eating practices. Theyoung women had many ideas about what was helpful and unhelpful for therapists to do.These ideas are 'not truths' pertinent to all young women experiencing these problems.Rather, they suggest some potential avenues for conversation regarding the interplaybetween substance misuse and disordered eating practices.Communal conversationsPart of what motivated the interviews was my curiosity to hear the youngwomen's ideas about how the problems may have worked together in their lives andtheir ideas regarding how to use the interplay between the problems to gain somefreedom from them. As all of the youth I spoke with noticed and described some sort ofinterrelatedness, I became curious about how therapists could have been more adept atenquiring about this interplay, and if they did what difference might this have made.Beth:C: How could therapists have been more helpful to you when you werestruggling with these problems? Are there things they could have done orasked?A: Just talk about how they do go hand in hand and how a lot of people strugglewith it. Because I honestly didn't think that many people struggled with it.C: When did you figure out that more people struggle with it than you thought?A: Just talking with people and sitting down and talking with your crewmates. Ifound that so helpful having crewmates coming and asking me questions. At302first I was overwhelmed but then I realized I can actually help someone andthat's cool.Problems thrive in isolation, and they flourish when people are convinced by theproblem that 'they are the only person experiencing this problem.' In isolation, theproblems can convince people that 'If other people knew they'd ... (fill in awfulconsequence here).' The problems grow in silence, and often as the problem grows, theyoung women's shame grows as well. When therapists wonder out loud, 'other youngwomen have mentioned that they have found that disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse sometimes have a way of teaming up together. Has that been yourexperience?' they can contribute to a young persons experience of 'I'm not the onlyone....' This development could then lead to a person unmasking some of the other'lies' that the problems have told them, because if the problems lied to them once theymay begin to wonder, could they have told other lies?A few minutes later in our conversation Beth adds:C: What difference would it have made if both were addressed at the same timeversus addressing the eating disorder first and substance misuse second or,alcohol and drugs first and then the eating disorder?A: I think it would have made a huge difference to do them both at once becausethen you're able to actually do all your work instead of you're still like runningaway from doing one or the other, right. But if you're just addressing bothproblems at the same time, then it gives you a lot more headspace, and like a lotmore time to like make realizations about things right. It's much easier to doboth at the same time than one at a time. Because the more you get sick [purge]303and stuff you realize you don't loose as much weight as when you are doingdrugs and then you want to do drugs or vice versa, right.C: Would it be difficult to deal with both at the same time do you think?A: Well, it's not easy to do in the first place.C: Good point!A: I think it would be easier to do them both at once. Although you may think itseems harder at first because you know that's just like quitting smoking, andquitting drugs, they're both two hard things but still if you do them together, it's ahell of a lot easier.It is interesting that Beth wants to address them both at once as for her thiswould be easier. If young people had previously been having conversations about theinterplay between the two problems and were 'prepared' for the problems to ramp uptheir tactics in order to get them back, they might not be so vulnerable to the teaming upof the problems. As Beth described above, knowing that drugs can take advantage ofideas like 'I can make you thin again' could be advantageous for her, and she could in asense be prepared for this should it happen. If the silence and secrecy that these twoproblems flourish in is unveiled then young women might be more prepared to speakabout it, as shame might not weigh so heavy into keeping them silent about one problemor the other.Rachel describes wanting therapists to start talking about the connections moreas well.Rachel:304A: I don't think people really realize the connections between the drugs andeating disorders.C: So should therapists and young women be having more conversations aboutthe connections?A: Yeah.C: What difference do you think that would make if that were happening?A: I don't know. I think it would be easier to help ourselves.C: How come?A: Well, we can't help something that we don't understand, that we don't knowabout.C: Now that you know what the connection is between the two.A: Yeah.C: What difference does that make for you?A: Well, it's easier for me to stay away. Knowing that it'll just lead me rightback to where I was.Michelle further articulates this concept.Michelle:C: Do you think that it is always important if there are both going on to talkabout the connections and about the overlap?A: Yeah.C: Rather than just saying okay, you take care of your alcohol and drugs at thisplace and then go deal with the eating disorder?A: No, that's no good.305C: How come?A: Because once they overlap, they're not separate problems, they're a problem.C: Can you say more about that?A: Like, it's not like you're eating is a problem and your drugs are a problem.They're a problem together and it's once they overlap its not just drugs getting inthe way or eating getting in the way. It's both of them in your way right now.Just because you get one out of the way doesn't necessarily mean you'll get both.C: Okay.A: And then like what if we were at a treatment that was only for drugs andthen we get out and we don't go in [to a program to address disordered eating]for two or three days, there's pretty small chance we'll be able to cause theeating's still there, eating away at us. So right away we're going to want to goback and do drugs [as a way to lose weight]. And then we jilt our eating becausewe just went on a drug binge and so shit out of luck again for the next one [beingable to enter the program for eating disorders].Michelle mentions an important aspect of the risks involved with the time delaythat often occurs when entering a treatment program. She says that even in two or threedays if the 'eating' hasn't been dealt with that drugs could show up as a way to loseweight which then could lead to a drug binge. This leads to an important aspect of carethat therapists can provide, prior to a person entering a treatment program. Other youngwomen also describe how both problems often show up in a huge way before they arescheduled to enter a treatment program. Drugs can try to convince them to have 'onemore binge' as 'this is the last time they will ever be able to use.' Disordered eating306practices can also take advantage of this perhaps by telling a young woman that she isnot thin enough to enter a treatment program, no one will think she has a problem unlessshe loses more weight. The problems will use whatever they can to interrupt a persongetting help. Michelle continues,C: So together is better?A: Yeah.C: Do you think it would be difficult to address both at the same time?A: It can take a lot of work. I don't think -like, it's not impossible but it takes alot more work than just working on one problem.C: How much work has it taken for you to be able to work with both?A: I haven't really done the work for both, but just staying away from drugs,has made me realize that not eating isn't healthy and that isn't the way to go andso like eating properly. Like just, I don't know. For me there is so much to likenot eating, it's almost like a high you get when you don't eat because you havethat happiness and attitude like, 'Yeah, I did it again. Another day gone.' But Ifound like without the drugs I've been eating properly because I haven't beengetting guilt trips, and I haven't been high all the time, so I wanted to eat. Myhunger is there so I eat when I'm hungry. But otherwise eating properly makesme not want to do drugs because I feel better from not doing drugs and so it'sjust, like, together. It's like I have been working more on the drugs part but atthe same time eating's following it.It appears that when people start to get their lives back from drugs an attitude ofcare for oneself can begin overflow into other aspects of their life. If therapists can find307ways to harness this care, and talk about what might be some potential threats to theirnewly found care (for example, disordered eating practices), it might help to keep theother problems at bay.Interrupting neat and tidy categories of problemsThe concept of compartmentalizing people and their problems is an idea that isincongruous with the way we live our lives, yet it is the way that science is structuredKutchins & Kirk, 1997). As described in chapter three, as way to make sense of illness,people's experiences were categorized and coded into \"medical classification ofdiseases\" (Caplan, 1996, p. 38) Yet these categories that were once set up as a way tohelp physicians have a common language has resulted in these categories being used as\"an explanation of people's lives\" (Peele, 1995, p.3). Placing persons and problemsinto fixed categories may result in our missing the connections between people's livesand the problems that plague them, as well between problems and problems.Decontextualizing people makes space for quick cures and treating people as ifthey were machines, by which I mean that if you can find the piece that's broken thenyou can fix it and the machine will run smoothly again. Unfortunately (or fortunately)people are not like that. If we can expand our thinking away from the binary andcategories of this or that, we are better able to contextualize people's lives and look atproblems contextually and as interrelated to each other. Cushman (1995) writes,The individual's feelings and thoughts, because they were located bypsychotherapy inside the bounded, masterful self, were considered to be productsof intrapsychic processes, and not the products of culture, history, orinterpersonal interactions. Psychological problems have been interpreted as308illnesses that are conceptualized as residing within the person and caused byintrapsychic conflicts or malfunctions (p. 157).Emma discusses her reasons for why she thinks a program that addresses bothproblems would be a good idea.Emma:C: Okay. If you were asked to design a perfect program or group for peoplestruggling with both problems, what would it look like? Like, what kind ofthings would you include? What that be a good idea, a bad idea?A: I think that is a good idea. I would be really happy to see that happen oneday where both of those things would just be treated as addiction, and that wasthat. It wouldn't matter if you had anorexia, bulimia or alcohol dependency orsubstance abuse, you know. If it was all put together on the same plate asaddiction that would be a lot easier for a lot of people to deal with.C: What makes you think that that would be the case?A: It's a lot easier to - to explain addictions, you know, you're doing somethingthat's bad for you, that you feel like you can't stop.C: You're eating, drinking, drugging?A. Anything, yeah. Then sit back and address one problem solely and try to nitpick through all the things that it could be or it could stem from.Emma:C: Would it have made a difference to you when you were in a program fordisordered eating practices to have been able to talk about your struggles withsubstance misuse?309A: Yeah, it would have. It really, really would have.C: What difference do you think it would have made?A: It would have made the problem real.C: Can you say more about that?A: It would have made my drug problem real, just as real as the eating disorder.C: Okay. And if the drug problem had been as real what difference would thathave made?A: It would have been easier to deal with. And I don't think it would have beenas severe, had it not have been pushed back. Like I kinda had to hide it andpretend that it wasn't a big deal.C: Okay.A: Yeah. It's really funny. In that program I learned how to be a really goodliar. Yeah. That was actually like the biggest thing that program taught me.Yeah. That just really paved the way for drugs.When programs don't create space for both problems or multi-problems to bediscussed, problems can go underground. For Emma, 'this taught her to be a good liar.'Of course this is not the intention behind these guidelines, but a young person may thinkthat she will be asked to leave the program if they talk about their struggles with theother problem (especially if these other problems are currently active). The tactics theproblem uses can exasperate this sense of secrecy, which serves to isolate and alienateyoung women from therapists and support staff. The problems might try to convince theyoung women, 'you have too many problems, you are unfixable,' 'you are so screwedup, no one will ever be able to help you,' or 'here you are throwing up everyday and310talking about how happy you are and how good you feel since giving up drugs, you'resuch a liar.' Those tactics can all contribute to a person's sense of 'falseness' or lyingwhich substance misuse and disordered eating practices can use to their benefit whenthey are trying to entice a young woman back to them.Beth describes why she thinks addressing the two problems together is useful forher,C: What do you think that might have happened when you left here, if you hadn'tdealt with the bulimia while you were here?A: I don't know. I think I would be more tempted to do drugs.C: How so?A: Because then I would still be purging and I would still be having majorweight issues and body issues and emotional issues right. And when that doesn'twork anymore, then there comes drugs right back in. I wouldn't have really beenlearning how to deal with my problems when I was here cause I would havebeen purging.Megan echoes the above,C: If you've had done that. Lets say you purged the entire time you were here,would that have influenced your thinking about how successful you had been atPeak House?A: Yeah. I would have felt like I was lying to everybody and kept that addictpart of me- the lying, the manipulating.C: And do you think that drugs could have turned that and twisted that aroundonce you were done this program and used it to its advantage in anyway?311A: Probably just that you gained back trust from a lot of people andyou have a lot of people who have trust and faith in you now, so they have faiththat your not gonna go use, and no one's gonna be drug testing you once you aregone. So knowing that it'll still be there when you get out. So it would havekept that thought running the whole time, 'that once you get out, I'll still be thereto help you.'Creating space for both problems to be addressedEvery young woman who consults us has different ideas about counselling andhow it can be effective. As therapists we need to collaborate with young women aboutthe therapy and whether it is helpful. Stepping away from an expert stance and seeingthe client as an expert in her own life helps us to become curious about the youngwomen's ideas. Some of the young women spoke about addressing the problemsseparately at first, beginning with the problem that is most concerning for them, andthen exploring the interplay between the two problems. We can still work on oneproblem at a time while becoming curious about the ways various problems may worktogether. Jill brings up an important point: the possibility that we miss the details if wedon't spend enough time talking about one problem first. It's often in the details that welearn how problems stay alive and thrive in a young woman's life so going slow andreally becoming curious about just how these problems work and manoeuvre themselvesthrough a person's life is very important.C: Would it make a difference if both were addressed at the same time or wouldyou address one first and then the other one?312A: Different. You might miss the detail about one or the other things whiletalking about both.C: So if you were not going to address them in detail, together, would it beuseful at least to kind of make some kind of link or ask them about the ways theywork together?A: I think that's a good question. How do they work together? Yeah or how dothey feed off each other? Yeah. Good question.Given that the young women described that space should be created for bothproblems to be addressed if this is relevant to the young person seeking therapy, I wascurious about their ideas about how this could look and how therapists could bring it upin conversation.Rachel:C: Would it have made a difference if both problems were addressed at the sametime verses eating disorders first and alcohol and drugs second or vice versa?A: Well, it depends on what the person comes to you with.C: How about for you though?A: Okay. Well for me I guess addressing the drug problem first and thenshowing the link.C: Why would you want the drugs addressed first?A: Well if you were just like, 'Rachel you have an eating disorder.' I'd be likewhat is wrong with you? So introducing the one you already know about thenhow they prey off each other and then maybe addressing the other onesseparately, kind of like phasing it in.313C: And why do you think those links need to be brought in?A: Because if you just start talking about eating disorders they'll think, 'whatare you talking about'?C: Why do you think they should talk about it anyway? Why not ignore it?Why not talk just about the drugs?A: Because some people don't realize it.C: And what difference does it make if you do?A: Then you might realize when you're doing it and try to help yourself or helpother people help you. But if you're not aware of what is going on then nothingcan be done about it. Unless like you're captured and force-fed every day.In regards to disordered eating practices Megan later adds,A: But I never really thought that it was a problem. I guess, like that could be adanger with leaving it up to people to address when they have a problem causesome people might not.Some of the young women just wanted therapists to bring it up, ask about it, becurious and talk to them about it.Megan:C: What could therapists have done to bring it up in order to have moreconversations about it?A: Like if they bring it up, to be up front with it. Like to actually ask. Likestraight out.Jill concurs,314C: What would you like therapists to know about the two problems? Like howcould someone have brought it up, or made the connection back when you wereusing say three years ago in a way that might have made a difference for you.A: Somebody could talk to me about my weight because I got really skinny for abit, like it was extremely unhealthy how fast I got skinny and how skinny I was.You know what I mean. Like maybe somebody could have talked to me aboutlike why have you lost so much weight like ask me if I wanted to talk aboutit\u2014all I really wanted to do was talk to somebody about it but it never reallycame up.Jill's wanting to talk to someone about her weight highlights once morehow these problems flourish in secrecy. As therapists we can help with thenaming of the problems in a tentative way, so that young women don't have tobe alone with these problems.The power of a communityThe strong cultural push towards individualism and the internalization ofproblems serves to further isolate and divide people from each other and theirsurrounding community (Gergen, 1991) and contributes to the sense of keepingstruggles private as 'we should be able to deal with things ourselves, and if we werestronger we would be.' Group therapy can be a way to interrupt this isolation. Many ofthe young women expressed an interest in having conversations with other young peopleabout the interplay between these problems.Megan:A: At Peak House we talked about it in gender group.315C: Was that useful?A: Definitely. Just knowing that other people here went through the samething, too, and I didn't think that disordered eating practices and drugs andalcohol can go hand in hand for a lot of people.C: What difference did it make when you did realize that it went hand in handfor a lot of people?A: Just knowing if I needed help I could talk to them. Like with a past resident,hearing about what happened with them and being like, 'Oh my gosh, that'salmost the same as me,' kind of thing. And seeing how she got through thingsand her strategies and kind of taking them and applying them in my own life,that really helped.C: How do you make sense with that? The fact that they do go hand in hand forso many young women?A: I don't have a worse problem than anyone else. It's something that is justlike, drugs and alcohol can be dealt with and disordered eating practices can bedealt with. Not easily but you know what I mean, it can be dealt with.It appears that the tactics that problems use do not vary much from person toperson. Problems it seems are not that creative. Fortunately, this works to our benefit,as we can see Megan describes having a moment of 'Oh my gosh, that's almost thesame as me.' In this moment the problems loose some of their power, and the sense ofisolation that young women may be experiencing is interrupted. This demonstrates thepower of group therapy when working with these problems as group therapy can helpbreak the isolation and secrecy that these problems are fuelled by, and can even give316young women ideas for how to break free from the problems. As Megan said above sheborrowed from the strategies of others.Beth:C: What about if it was talked about as these two problems often show uptogether? They can be really sneaky.A: I think that would be awesome.C: Really?A: I think you should do a group on that. I think that would help people, it'd helpeverybody. Cause we do groups on how drugs piggyback on friends andrelationships. But we have never done it with like bulimia or anything.Beth later goes on to say how if we had done groups on the two problems oreven included it as part of their orientation to the program it would have made it easierto have said something about her own experience of struggling with both problems. Itsimportant to mention that in any group therapy conversation we want to be mindful ofthe ways in which problems can show up in these spaces, and use what is beingdiscussed to their advantage. For example, young women have spoken to me aboutcomparisons that can leave them wondering if 'they have enough of a problem.' Forexample, disordered eating practices can have someone questioning if they are thinenough, bingeing enough, or purging enough to warrant help from others. In the samevein, drugs and alcohol can have a young woman wonder if her problems withmarijuana are in the same realm of the problems of a young woman sitting next to herdescribing where intravenous heroin use has taken her. Drugs might work hard toconvince her that she doesn't have a problem, and that she is taking up a space from317someone who deserves it more than she does. All these tactics could result in herleaving a treatment program. Then the problem can take this one step further andconvince her that 'they are such a failure\u2014you couldn't even stick out rehab!'Ava's comment below emphasizes how a dialogic space of openness andcuriosity opens doors to new possibilities for everyone (Anderson & Goolishan, 2000).A: Like just discussion. Like learning\u2014you learn from each other, youcome to realizations and epiphanies together. Well you know the bottom linepretty much and I think the guys and girls could do more sessions together. Youknow because we learn from each other and girls learn from each other ingroups. We should have more discussions to get everyone talking.The difficulty involvedSo many of the young women mentioned wanting therapists to be aware of thedifficulties involved in trying to get their lives back from the two problems. Theywanted therapists to have a sense of just how hard it was, and how hard they wereworking to get some space from these problems.Ava:C: Is there anything specifically about eating disorders and drugs and alcoholthat you want therapists to know about how to work better with the twoproblems?A: That we're definitely struggling, and we're trying.Aimee:318C: For therapists working with people who struggle with eating disorders anddrugs and alcohol, what would you like therapists to know about these twoproblems?A: That it's not an easy thing to get over.They also wanted therapists to be aware of the shame that the problems can bringwith them. Michelle articulates how therapists need to be sure that they are not beingjudged as this can only build the sense of shame.Michelle:C: For therapists working with young people struggling with eating disordersand drugs and alcohol, what would you like the therapists to know about thesetwo problems and how they've could possibly have been more helpful to you inyour struggle with both problems?A: A lot of the times we're really ashamed of being addicted to drugs andhaving an eating disorder. I find that we always think people will judge us rightaway and to, like if the therapist showed us that we're not being judged and itmakes it easier for us to talk. I know that I always thought that I was, like, I wasalways ashamed of not eating. But I always, like, I still didn't eat and I still, justlike I, what is the word I'm looking for? I don't know. Denied that I hadtheproblem to everyone because when I did ask for help, I was told that I didn'thave a problem. So like any therapist or counsellor out there, if the kids knowthey're not being judged then it's a lot easier for to us talk, which makes it easierfor us to get better.319Below Emma describes the art of having a conversation about the two problems.She speaks of the need for delicacy, for the conversation to be gentle and for things to beslowly teased out together. She describes how it can be confusing and how theproblems can end up arguing as a result of addressing them in conversation togetherwhich is not helpful.Emma:C: So like was there ever a therapist who you were able to discuss both eatingdisorders and alcohol and drugs at the same time?A: Yeah, but it's so difficult to do it, it's like this is really confusing.C: What's confusing about it?A: Cause I have always thought of them as completely separate issues andwhen you put them into the same\u2014the same conversation it's like\u2014it's almostlike they're arguing in my head. 'I'm more important, no I am.' You know.C: Okay.A: They help each other out cause they both want to be active. But if one ofthem\u2014if the attention is on one of them right away then, one of them wants itmore, you know. Like I'm the one that defines you.Talk About the PainIn therapeutic conversations, it can sometimes feel like there is not alwaysenough time to 'talk about everything.' Fear for our clients, session limits and trying tosift through so many issues can overwhelm even the most seasoned therapist, and keeptheir attention on the immediate. This can be increased when we are concerned that320these 'problems' may kill our clients.28 The problems of substance misuse anddisordered eating practices also try to ensnare therapists in their webs using tactics ofdistraction, which can leave the therapist feeling incompetent, under-knowledged, and inneed of more training. This sense of 'I don't know what to do' from a therapist canelevate the problem's status, and perhaps leave a young women wondering if anyonecan help her. When someone is medically stable and the drug and alcohol fog and spellof disordered eating practices may have lifted (even just for a bit) the young womenmay feel ready-enough to talk about the 'pain' behind the use, and the 'pain' that thesepractices have caused in the young women's lives. Talking about reasons behind theuse, and what 'purpose' these ways of coping through substance misuse and disorderedeating practices served can be an important part of the work. We can begin to storyyoung women's experiences of what is unsaid yet spoken through their bodies (Bordo,2003) as a way to support them in freeing themselves from these practices. Brown(2007) writes:If we respect that symptoms of eating problems are meaningful clues to women'sand girls' subjugated stories, we can begin to unpack their displaced meaning.Giving space to these stories, making them visible, and hearing them are likelyto make body talk of eating 'disorders' and weight preoccupation unnecessary. 28 I am not referring to cases where a young woman needs to attend detox or be admitted to a hospital forre-feeding. I am referring to situations where they are nourished enough and have enough time free fromsubstances to participate in therapeutic conversations. Even in these moments the problems can seem sooverwhelming that they keep the therapist focused on the immediate and doubting themselves. This Ibelieve is a tactic of the problem that serves to keep the therapist second guessing themselves and feelingincompetent in their work.321Focusing on changing behaviour without making space for unheard stories isunlikely to entrench the need for such body talk (p. 280).29Ava astutely describes that the 'problem' is not simply just about substancemisuse and disordered eating practices, something else is occurring.Ava:C: What do therapists need to pay attention to when working with people whostruggle with both problems?A: That it's not just the drug use and the eating disorders, there's somethingunderlying it. There is some kind of childhood emotional pain, there issomething behind it and like it's those things that need to be dealt with, not the,not the addiction. Once that's healed, it'll make it a lot easier to get rid of theaddiction and stuff once you've dealt with the underlying problem. If your wristbreaks, you don't just go and take a temperature\u2014there is an underlying problemright, if you don't fix it your wrist is gonna break again you know, same witheverything. Everything on earth so fix the underlying problem and figure outwhat it is, heal it, somehow and then once you have this shit dealt with its 'oh,that's why I do this, that's why this is happening.' And it stops you wanting touse those drugs.C: What does that understanding do? How does it get you wanting to stop usingthose drugs? 29 Catrina Brown (2007) defines 'body talk' as \"Body talk refers to the culturally specific ways thatwomen speak or communicate through their bodies. Body talk begins to speak the unspoken, or yet to bespoken, through with preoccupation struggles. It has begun to draw attention to women's struggles at acultural level and to make them visible\" (p. 269-270).322A: Self-awareness. And understanding it's normal. And that there is a way todeal with it besides drugs. And like permanently though.If as counsellors we start with the assumption that all people seeking therapyhave the knowledge and wisdom needed to solve their own problems then we need tocreate the space for young persons to address what is important to them. Everyonemakes different meaning of their experience, and we need to work with the peopleconsulting us, and travel along the paths they wish us to walk alongside them on.Weingarten (1998) refers to a therapist as a 'fellow traveller' in this regard. Shouldyoung persons wish to address the pain behind the use, we are looking at the context inwhich the problems arose, and how it might make sense that it showed up at thatparticular time. Talking about the context of the use takes us farther away frominternalized notions of problems, and problems residing inside of people and closer topeople's experience and knowledge of how to become free of problems. Tom Andersen(1998) borrows from and builds on Wittgenstein's idea of \"Now I know how to go on\"(p. 79) and applies it to therapeutic conversations, where the hope for therapy is that it,if successful, gives people a sense of knowing 'how to go on.' So together therapistand young woman can have conversations about the pain in a way that might dissolve it,allow new meaning to be made, or just help people come to a place where they can say,they know what they need to do in order to move forward.Insiders as Consultants: Program DesignGiven that the young women have first hand knowledge of these problems, I wascurious about their ideas specific to program development, and I asked them what they323thought would be important to included in a program that addressed both substancemisuse and disordered eating practices. Some of their ideas were:- An all-young-women live-in program- Increase the length of time of the program (longer than 10 weeks)- Having conversations that link up the problems- Having structured groups/programs after meals (to help alleviate ideas andpractices of purging or over-exercising after meals)- Making sure there is no talk that glorifies alcohol and drugs and disorderedeating practices- Flexibility- Treat people with respect- Provide education about substance misuse and disordered eating practices- Include the medical aspects of how these problems impact your body- Have good healthy food for people to eat balanced and nutritious meals- Including different activities, people are able to try different things and learnnew hobbies- Offer certification programs- Offer fun exercise programs like rock climbing, kayaking (exercise that is notfocused on burning calories, rather focuses on fun and moving your body)- Work with what the person loves to do- Normalize and explain why people might be gaining weight, especially whengetting free form substance misuse and disordered eating practices (makes it lessscary for people)324- Talk about overall lifestyle changes- Have pets around for their therapeutic value- Giving people space to say 'I'm in a struggle right now' and having peopleavailable for them to talk to- Learning how to pay attention to what your body needs- Not weighing yourself, no scales, and no practices of measuring food and/orbody- No magazines or speaking in ways that glorify alcohol and drugs, beauty,thinness, or objectify and stereotype women- No televisionQuestions to Ask About the Interplay Between Substance Misuse and DisorderedEating Practices Have you noticed that these two problems often show up together? Have you noticed any similarities between the two problems? Other young women have described disordered eating practices and substancemisuse as being very sneaky. Have you noticed this as well? How might substance misuse piggyback on disordered eating practices, or howmight disordered eating practices piggy back on substance misuse? Are there ways that you have noticed that the problems can work together attimes? How do they feed off each other? What do you imagine you'll need to learn in order to break free from disorderedeating practices and substance misuse?325 Since you've stopped using substances or disordered eating practices have younoticed that the other problem has been lurking in the background? If so why doyou think this is? Are there things that you do to keep some distance from drugs and alcohol anddisordered eating practices? Do you use the same strategies for both or are theydifferent strategies? How might what you want for your life and what disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse want for your life differ?Insider Knowledge: Advice for Other Young People and Therapists Working withPeople Who are Struggling with Similar ProblemsDuring the interviews I asked the young women what insider knowledge theyhad for other young people struggling with these problems. What would you want themto know? What support, advice or insider knowledge might offer them? I also askedthem, what advice would they give to therapists, working with young people strugglingwith eating disorders and alcohol and drugs? What they would like therapists to knowabout these two problems? What follows are their responses to the questions.Emma:A: [to therapists] That they're the same. Actually, I just remembered an incidenthere, one time with one of the staff members, and I tried to talk to him about theeating disorder problem that was coming up and he even said, 'Well, like, I justdon't understand it,' and I was like 'you've been through substance abuse. It's thesame thing.'Beth:326A: [to young women] Definitely, I know it's hard, but try to be more accepting ofyour body.C: How did you deal with that? How did you start to gain more acceptance ofyour body?A: I think just getting away and realizing that it's not what is on the outside thatwhat matters is on the inside. Beauty's on the inside it's much more than skindeep. It's totally your inner beauty that counts and it outweighs the outer beautyby far. Like, you can be totally gorgeous but just a nasty person, you know.Like, would you rather be like this nasty person that looks absolutely gorgeousor an average looking person that has a gorgeous personality?Hannah:A: [to young women] That everyone is beautiful, that you don't need to putsomething in your body or like inflict pain on yourself to make yourself beautifulor love yourself, make that guy want you. Like if he doesn't like you for whoyou are, then it's not worth it.Later she adds,A: Don't look in the mirror and pick out whatever is wrong with you. Justknow that what you're doing is better for you in the long run and you don't haveto be sick all the time.Michelle: A: [to young women] There is help. It's not impossible to get better and it's justa matter of admitting that you're powerless over it and once you do that you cansee that help is there.327C: Okay.A: I find if you're still in control a bit there is no way you can get help. Once Iadmitted, admitted that I was powerless I could not only ask for help, but liketake the advice that I was given and I didn't take it all. I mean there is no wayyou can take all the advice that you're given but it definitely made it easier forme to like talk about it and to want to get better, once I realized I couldn'tcontrol it.Savannah:A: [to young women] keep going and keep trying, if you fall back into it, knowit's okay. The importance of building a support network of friends who don'tuse. Meet people who've been through it. Build connections with others, andhave good supportive people around.Alexa:A: [to young women] It gets better and to know that you're not alone. Thatpeople are not jealous of you as much as you think it, they're not. Sometimesyou need a harsh reality check. You're thinking crazy. The drugs are getting toyour head. This is not who you are.Megan:A: [to young women] That it's not normal. It's not healthy. Not the whole kindof school bit they give you, it causes this and this and this. But just saying likeyou're not going to feel good about yourself no matter how thin you get. Nomatter how much you use or how long you can go without eating, you won't feelhealthy. You're not going to gain popularity by the positive people, you're328going to get the negative attention and negative friends at school, who all thinkthat using and like disordered eating practices is okay and that they wouldsupport it. And those aren't people you want to hang around for the rest of yourlife because they won't help bring you up to where you should be, and they'renot gonna help you get farther in life.C: So if you had got that kind of advice, what difference might that have madefor you?A: If I was just starting here, it would be different I might hear it, but if I wasstill out in the community, there I'd be 'like what are you talking about.' Likewhen people's minds are clear it's easier to take things in. So if I was here Iwould probably hear it and relate it to my own life. Like yeah that's true and thatwould stop me from or make me think twice before I go do something. It mightnot have stopped me right away but eventually it builds and grows when youkeep hearing it.Ava:A: [to young women] Consequences for sure, but I know everybody thinks thatthey are the one that can prove them differently, even I do that, right. I'd say, ohgod there is so much I would say. There's some much to say I don't even knowwhere to start. I would say find your self-worth. That's really important. Wehad this epiphany in gender group one day like self-worth; everything leads backto it. That's the beginning. Knowing your worth and knowing you're worth itand you're not dirt and drugs won't make it better. You alone will make it betterno matter what cards you're dealt in your life or the environment you grew up in.329You make your own future, don't fuck with it and don't let some kinda substancecontrol you. Take control.C: So if you had been offered this information that you just shared, whatdifference might it have made for you?A: Well no one can change my mind, and I can't change anyone's mind but themore awareness you have, like with smoking, the more I know about that themore and more stupid I feel when I'm doing it you know what I mean?C: If someone told you what you had said like, 'find your self-worth, it all stemsfrom there' would that have made a difference for you growing up?A: When I was younger, yeah. When I was in my bad days. Fuck you, right?You can't help someone that's in it until they want to help themselves, until theyfind their own self-worth until they come to the same realization. But if I wasreally young and I had been told that I think I would have made smarterdecisions. I can't say I may never have tried anything but I think I would havemade smarter decisions and not put myself in certain situations and not havebeen so stupid. But you know you learn, you learn. You learn from it and youhave to go through the fire to be better and your experience will make yourfuture different and better.Questions to Highlight Insider Knowledge So for other young women struggling with disordered eating practices, orsubstance misuse what would you want them to know? What support or adviceor insider knowledge might you offer them?330 If you had been offered this same advice that you just mentioned, whatdifference do you imagine that it might have made?Section 7. RecursivenessI sought to know more about the ways in which the problems worked in youngwomen's lives rather than trying to discern 'what was wrong with them' or 'why theyhad these problems.' This position distinguishes postmodern social constructionpractices from more modernist ways of knowing and working. I consider theaforementioned practices having contributed to a foundation from which to moveforward, and this foundation contributed to the richness of our interviews, and what waspossible for the young women to speak with me about. And importantly, ourconversations made space for the young women to reflect on and consider practices ofdisordered eating practices and substance misuse that were relevant and important tothem at this time in their lives. I credit these practices to the young women'sdescriptions of our interviews as being useful to them. This section speaks to the ideasof research as being recursive, and being of use to the participants involved. The youngwomen described the interviews as being useful for them, and they were tremendouslyuseful for me. My hopes are that other therapists and young women will benefit fromthese conversations and subsequent understanding of the interplay between theseproblems.What follows are the young women's descriptions of the ways in which theyfound the interviews to be of use to them.Emma:331C: Yeah. What did they need to convince you to become part of your life in theway that they did?A: That's a really good question. Can you say it one more time?C: What did drugs and alcohol and eating disorders need to take advantage ofor convince you of in order to become part of your life in the way they did?A: And this is exactly for me, right?C: Yeah, just for you.In the above example, Emma says 'that's a good question' and clarifies that thisis 'exactly for me, right?' I attempted to centre the youth in the interviews; Iwanted to know what 'their' experience was like and their ideas about the waysthat these problems worked in their lives. There were no right or wrong answers.I checked in with the young women throughout the interviews, asking how theywere doing and how the interview was going. During one of the interviews I noticedthat Alexa was yawning, so I asked her how she was doing, and she let me know thatshe was tired and would like to stop the interview and complete it the next day. At theend of each young woman's interview, I enquired as to how each was doing and howeach person felt about what she had said. The following is an example of this, and ofthe youth's description of this being a useful experience and her ideas that this will alsobe of use for other youth.A different kind of talkThe young women described the interviews as being a good experience. Notonly did they speak of the interviews as having some therapeutic benefit, many young332women described having garnered new ideas as a result of our conversation about whatit will take for them to stay free from both problems.Jill:C: We've finished all my questions. How was it?A: Cool. I like this.C: What was cool about this?A: Just things I never talked about with anybody before or thought about andthere were some really insightful questions and I think if you asked other peoplethose questions, like it would get them thinking.C: Given that you said you talked about things you never talked about before.A: Yes.C: Or even thought about. How are you doing having had thought about andtalked about them?A: They're not affecting me because I'm not like that anymore you know what Imean. Like, I'm not using drugs and I'm sober so I can talk about them.[Laughing] It's good to talk about it, that's all.As Jill shared, this was the first time she had ever talked about this with anyonebefore; it was important that I follow up with her to see how she was doing after havinggiven voice to new ideas. Ethically, as a therapist/researcher, it is my job to follow upwith her to help ensure that she is doing well enough to end the conversation and thatshe will be okay afterwards. If she mentioned feeling unsure of how she was doing, orhaving painful memories, together we could make a plan for how she could take care of333herself for the evening, who could support her in taking care of herself, and check outhow safe she feels with herself.In the excerpt below, Emma articulates how our conversation was different thanother conversations she has had regarding disordered eating practices and substancemisuse. I believe that stepping into a new conversational space is central to the processof creating change in therapy. Putting a fresh perspective and taking a closer look at oldand familiar problems in a new way supports people in renegotiating their relationshipswith and knowings of these problems. As McNamee (2004a) describes, \"Socialconstruction, as a therapeutic stance tunes us into the interactive moment wheretherapeutic change might be possible\" (p. 269). In the example below it appears thatnew meaning was made together in our conversation and that as a result Emma now hasa different way to understand these problems, and move forward in her life.Emma:A: I was just saying how, how this interview was really difficult. It's sointeresting because although both problems have been acknowledged at once,never to this degree. Never. And I'm 18 now and I started treatment when I was12. This is the first time that anyone has given the attention to both issues.C: So what difference do you think this type of attention to those issues mightmake for you in your life?A: I think it's good. I think it's very good and that I'm going to see positivechanges from actually noticing the feelings and thoughts that this specificinterview has brought up.334Above Emma mentions how 'this is the first time that anyone has given attentionto both issues' and that as a result of our conversation that she is 'going to see positivechanges' as a result of our conversation together.Emma continued,C: I'm really glad that this has been useful to you because it's been really usefulto me.A: Yeah, this is really cool. Now I feel like I am better equipped. Wow. Like Ifeel so much relief, already.The above section highlights the way that research can be beneficial for both'researchers' and 'participants.' Emma is walking away from the interview with newideas about how to navigate these problems should she be faced with them in the future.She is also fully engaged in the conversation, her energy demonstrating that she is reallyconnected to the above ideas and that they resonate for her.During our conversations there were many instances of the young womenexclaiming, 'Wow so they really do go together!' New realizations were made and theydescribed thinking that these realizations would be 'stuck in their heads.'Aimee:C: How was this for you? Was this useful?A: Yeah good. I realized a whole bunch of stuff; I kept catching myself like,'Oh my God.'C: What did you realize?A: Just thinking how tiny I was and one thing I said about how drugs and eatingdisorders are together. Sort of like, well, its hard to quit drugs because you have335fun with it and it makes you skinny but you don't want to lose the skinniness, sothat was like whoa.C: Do you think this conversation in itself might help you when you leave PeakHouse?A: Probably. Because now I know like, now that I've said this stuff out loud,what to do or how it happened, it's stuck in my head now.Aimee mentions that 'it's stuck in my head now.' One of the useful aspects oftherapy is that in speaking aloud ones hopes for oneself, young woman begin to knowwhat it is that they want for themselves and for their lives.Some youth such as Beth and Ava (mentioned below) had new realizations,which is exciting as it suggests that together in dialogue we have co-created somethingthat is of use to them. Ava was able to hear perhaps the familiar in an unfamiliar way, orspeak something that she did not yet know.A: Like I just made a lot of realizations doing this.C: What did you realize?A: Like things like I didn't even realize when I was using the drugs.Beth:C: Was this useful?A: Yes.C: Yes. So what was useful about it?A: I don't know. Just being able to talk about stuff. The more I talk about it themore realizations I get for myself and even though I've said it a million times themore I hear it the more it sticks.336C: As a result of this conversation is anything sticking a bit more?A: Well yeah cause today I felt pretty depressed about my body and right now Ifeel absolutely great! [laughter]C: What was it you heard yourself say that's making you feel so great? Causeyour body hasn't changed in the last hour. So what is it that you heard yourselfsay that's got you feeling absolutely great?A: That it doesn't matter. I just have to get that through my head. Like peoplearen't gonna love you for what you look like. And if they do just love you forthe outside than that's really bad.C: Okay. How can you hold on to this remembering right now? This feeling?A: I don't know. I talk to Shawn usually that helps me hold onto it, that's truelove. I just gotta remember the good things in life.In the above piece, others are invited into our conversation adding to its richnessand usefulness. Beth mentions that her boyfriend helps her to hold onto these knowings.In this example I am inquiring as to who can help her remember this knowing. Thispractice helps build and create communities of concern (Madigan & Epston, 1995) tostand as allies with them and against problems.The following quote is an example of the benefits of having these types ofconversations and how they can in a sense insolate people from the problems ofdisordered eating practices and substance misuse. Demonstrating the importance thattalking about the interplay between the two can make in peoples lives.Hannah:337C: Had you not talked about the connection between disordered eating practicesand substance misuse and left treatment without even acknowledging disorderedeating practices, do you think your stay here would have been different? Wouldyou be leaving with that still lingering in the back of your head?A: Yeah, I would probably go home and stop eating.C: Really?A: Yeah.C: Okay. And then what would have happened?A: I would be sick. Unhealthy. Well old behaviours would have showed up.C: Do you think drugs could have shown up at some point?A: Yeah.C: What difference did it make to talk about it then?A: Knowing that they're linked and that one can bring, like bring on the other.C: Um-hmm.A: That's the way for me that it's worked in the past and like if I don't payattention to it, then, you know, they can come back without me even noticing atfirst.Michelle:C: Was this useful for you?A: Yeah.C: What difference does it make might this conversation make in terms of yougetting free from both problems?338A: I've never, up until now I haven't completely thought about them beingtogether. I have to a point, but like I don't, it made me realize more that thedrugs and the eating does go hand in hand. I never really looked at it like thatbefore.C: Now that you do?A: It's going to be easier to stay away from both.C: Interesting.A: And I'm still not going to be able to walk out the door right now and stayaway from either. But by the end of my stay, I think just realizing that togetherthey're going to destroy me.Questions That Can be Used to Explore the Idea of Recursiveness/usefulness WithYoung Women How is this going for you? How was this conversation for you? Did you experience any new or re-remembered ideas/thoughts/feelings that you did not have when we first beganthis conversation? Did you hear yourself say anything new or anything that you were intrigued by? Is there anything from this conversation that you want to hold onto, or take withyou as you leave the room? How will you hold onto these ideas/thoughts/ practices? Who can help you holdonto this experience/knowing? After this conversation how might these ideas/practices begin to show up in yourlife?339 Who can you share some of these ideas that we spoke about today with as a wayto further strengthen them? [for therapists] How have you been \"moved\" (White, 2007, p. 191) as a result ofthis conversation?340CHAPTER 7DISCUSSIONIn this dissertation, I examined the interplay between substance misuse anddisordered eating practices in the lives of 12 young women and the ways that helperscan use this understanding to their advantage. A review of related literature,supplemented by conversations with seasoned therapists working closely with theseproblems indicates that disordered eating practices and substance misuse often occurtogether. However, what has not been as clear is how to best approach these problemswhen they co-presented in a young women's life.Drawing on the ideas of co-research as developed by family therapist DavidEspton (1999), I embarked on this project alongside a small group of young women togain a better understanding of their insider knowledge about the intricacies and interplaybetween the problems of substance misuse and disordered eating practices. Ispecifically looked at (1) the ways these problems can be supported culturally, (2) howthese problems are often individualized, thereby supporting the development of anensuing vocabulary of deficit, (3) the conditions and requirements of the problems fortheir survival, (4) the ways that young women are recruited and ensnared by theseproblems, (5) the similarities between the problems and the ways they can act as 'tools'for each other, and (6) actions that the young women have taken to find some freedomfrom the problems, with specific examination of the actions that young women havefound helpful with both problems. Finally, I explored how this research can be of use toothers - not only does it appear to be helpful in liberating those ensnarled by these two341powerful problems, but it may also be beneficial to practitioners looking to find a way tobe of use to those suffering in the grips of these problems.In this final chapter I will describe the contributions that this particular narrativetherapeutic approach to working with the problems of substance misuse and disorderedeating practices offers to therapists. I will also discuss how a research inquiry can inviteparticipants to become reflexive about their own experience (Tomm, 1987). I alsoexplore how the idea that these problems are in relationship with each other appears tobe new to the therapists, yet not necessarily new to the young women. Then I brieflydescribe the importance of co-research practices. Finally, I discuss possible limitationsof this study and recommendations for future use of this research.Specific Contributions for TherapistsThe descriptions offered by the young women illustrate the relational featuresand similarities that the problems of substance misuse and disordered eating practicesshare. The questions that I formulated (often in the presence of the young women)elicited generative and detailed accounts of the problems' interplay. These questions ledto exciting co-discoveries regarding the similarities and interplay between the problems,the tactics that problems both use, and the ways that substance misuse and disorderedeating practices can work together to devastate a young woman's life. The resultssection was replete with interesting suggestions for how therapists can provide moreadequate therapy for persons struggling with both substance misuse and disorderedeating practices. In this section I will summarize these suggestions.In the interviews, the young women and I unpacked the many ways thatsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices had been supported in their lives342(inadvertently or otherwise) by the media, society at large, family and friends.Commonalities in their experiences suggest that the pressures to look a certain way and'fit in' permeate their lives on a daily basis. They described these pressures existing attimes in very subtle ways. For example, they identified nuanced messages to maintain aparticular body image in advertising, gestures, glances, and comments; all suggestingthat there is a certain way to be a young woman. They also described the power ofdiscourse, specifically of folk psychology. They described these influences leading themto believe that they are responsible for the creation of their problems and, subsequently,to see themselves as labelled with the identities of 'addicts,' 'alcoholics,' bulimics' or'anorexics.' Conversations that deconstruct the above ideas appear to relieve some ofthe guilt, blame, shame, and hopelessness that this pathologizing discourse can place onpersons, making space for the co-construction of preferred stories to be developedthereby creating hope that there will be freedom from these problems.The young women astutely described the conditions that support the flourishingof these problems in their lives, as well as the strategies that the problems used to recruityoung women. For example, they described how the problems flourish in secrecy,attempting to isolate young women. The young women also described commonalities inthe ways that the problems worked to maintain a close relationship with them byoffering, for example, empty promises, coping strategies, and tools for forgetting 'whothey are' and what is important to them in life. These conversations supported theyoung women in gaining a clearer sense of just how these problems worked in theirlives, which can contribute to their having a sense of what they need to do to findfreedom these problems. We also discussed the times, places, things, and people that343may contribute to the young women's vulnerability to the problems' appearances or re-appearances. The young women described these questions as being especially useful toconsider in order to avoid the problems' attempts to make a comeback in their lives. Forpractitioners, these questions could be useful when developing relapse prevention plansand plans for staying free from substance misuse and disordered eating practices.The young women's accounts of their experiences with both problemsdemonstrate a need for therapists to enquire about the presence of the other whenworking with young women struggling with substance misuse and/or disordered eatingpractices. Further, their accounts speak to the importance of having conversations aboutthe interplay between the problems of substance misuse and disordered eating practices.Throughout chapter six, potential ways of having these conversations weredemonstrated. In particular, emerging common descriptions included how: One brought on the other and it feels like they fed off each other They unconsciously lead you to one another whether you know it or not, itslinked because it all has to do with some sort of image Being skinny and having an eating disorder and if you do drugs it's a lot lesswork and better resultsFrom the interviews, it became clear that young women quickly learn that drugscan intensify the thinness they may be looking for, and in this way, drug use becomes atool of disordered eating practices. They also described how the problems can worktogether. For example, drug use can give a young woman the energy that she is lackingas a result of not eating. Therapeutic questions to address specific aspects of theproblems and their interplay were also offered. These questions can act as resources for344therapists when having therapeutic conversations with young women struggling withthese problems.I found it interesting that some young women wanted the problems to beaddressed together as they described them as becoming 'a problem' when they occurredin their lives together. Yet other young women wanted the problems to be addressedseparately, as they thought the process of navigating the ways they work together wouldbe difficult or confusing. Regardless of the ways in which these conversations were tobe navigated, all young women who were interviewed spoke to the need for bothproblems to be discussed and their connection highlighted and addressed.The young women's comments suggest that treatment programs for bothdisordered eating practices and substance misuse should consider making space forthese conversations to occur. This could take place in a variety of ways: individualconversations, group therapy conversations, and psycho-educational presentations, toname a just few. The young women all described the importance of connecting withother young women who have experienced similar problems, as this helped them toknow that 'they are not alone.' They described this connection being important for tworeasons. First, it supported them in moving away from the problems as they describedno longer feeling isolated and alone with the problems. Second, they could then borrowfrom the knowledge and strategies that others had used and found helpful in gainingsome freedom from these problems. The young women also described conversationswith others as aiding them in developing a supportive community of concern, whichthey described as necessary in order to find lasting freedom from these problems. Thisresearch also suggests that treatment providers working in these settings need to be345educated about both problems and have an understanding of the tactics and strategiesthat the problems use in a young woman's life as well as how the two problems canwork together to create their own problems.ReflexivityThis dissertation highlights the utility of therapeutic approaches and researchpractices that invite participants to become more reflexive about their experiences. Inorder to invite participants to become reflexive, particular questions can be utilized.Karl Tomm (1987) defines reflexive questions as:...questions asked with the intent to facilitate self-healing in an individual orfamily by activating the reflexivity among meanings within preexisting beliefsystems that enable family members to generate or generalize constructivepatterns of cognition and behaviour on their own (p. 171).The questions I asked placed young women in a reflexive position as I invitedthem to look back on their experiences with substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices.Looking back in this way made space for young people to articulate and makeconnections between the two problems in ways that they had previously not seen. Thequestions asked also invited the young women to look towards the future, for example,imagining what difference this conversation might mean for them in staying free fromsubstance misuse and disordered eating practices. Both past-focused and future-focusedquestions positioned the youth as having important insight into the ways that theseproblems worked in their lives.346During the interviews I was offering a new idea about the interplay betweendisordered eating practices and substance misuse. Initially the young women had to takesome time to think about the shared relational features or interplay between the two butonce the connections were made, and once the women started using examples of theways that they had experienced the problems working in their own lives, there wasalways an expression in some form of 'Wow, so they really do go together.' The youngwomen had previously lived and experienced the interplay, but had not yet voiced orarticulated their experiences. The ideas were new, but yet not new or familiar, at thesame time.When the young women and I were talking, I was offering a new idea, yet theyoung women responded as if they had known this all along. There was a familiarknowing to the content of our conversation, as if bumping into an old friend, 'Hey, Iknow you from somewhere.' Asking the young women questions about the interplay inways that they had perhaps not yet been asked allowed them to hear what they may havesensed, or known, but not yet articulated. Once it was voiced or in hearing theirexperience reflected in the words of another young women, clients often exclaimed,'that's the same as me.' They were no longer alone with their experience and had thewords to describe it. The therapeutic conversations I had with the young womensupported them in seeing connections (Wittgenstein, 1953) between their experience andour conversations.The Importance of Co-researchAs previously mentioned, this study is, to my knowledge, the first study that hasbeen done that focuses on young women's experiences with both substance misuse and347disordered eating practices and on their ideas about how to address these problems.Interviewing young women was my attempt to address the silence from youth inprofessional literature about their personal experiences and their ideas forsimultaneously addressing the problems of substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices.By positioning the young women as co-researchers during the interviews,exciting and generative possibilities for addressing these two problems were created.During the interviews I was struck by the idea that the young women had previouslylived the interplay between substance misuse and disordered eating practices so it was afamiliar idea. On the other hand, for some therapists, this was a new idea. This led tomy questioning some of the traditional therapies and research practices that I addressedthroughout this dissertation.The examples of the young women presented in chapter 6 illustrate that youngwomen have definite accounts about how disordered eating practices and substancemisuse worked together in their lives. But this raises questions. If there is a generalconsensus among the young women about the interconnections between the problems,then how is it that there is a void of information regarding therapeutic practices toaddress the interplay in clinical and professional work and literature, especially researchliterature that includes the clients' voices and preferences for the direction of therapy?The thoughtful and insightful contributions that the young women have offered to thefield of substance misuse and disordered eating literature and therapeutic practicesuggests that researchers and/or therapists should seek to position clients as co-researchers and consultants whenever possible.348Hannah:Christine: For therapists working with people who struggle with eating disordersand anorexia and bulimia or eating disorder, alcohol and drugs. What would youlike therapists to know about these two problems? Do you think they thinkabout the link?Hannah: I don't know. Do they?Christine: I think some people do but I don't know if a lot of people do.Hannah: They should know that.Christine: Yeah?Hannah: Yeah.Of particular interest was how the young women reported feeling better or morehopeful, often in relationship to their body or in regards to staying free from substancesafter the interviews. This demonstrates the utility of these conversations and thepotential benefit of incorporating these conversations into eating disorder or substancemisuse programs. This also demonstrates the therapeutic benefits that co-researchpractices can offer when conducted in ways that are respectful, ethical, and honouring ofthe voices that consult us. As researchers, it is important that we begin to create spacefor 'insiders' to document their experience and their ideas for how to best move forwardin their lives. Their ideas, practices and insider knowledge should be written about andcirculated widely and legitimized in order to open up new therapeutic possibilities forpersons trying to free themselves from problems.The dynamics of this co-research practice has also benefited me in ways otherthan as a researcher. In other words, I have been moved by it in the way Michael White349(2007) describes being moved and transported by the stories to which we are witnesses.Michael White commonly described being \"moved\" (p. 191) and changed by the peoplewith whom he met. I too wish to touch on how I am no longer the same since the initialconception of this writing and my conversations with the young women. I felt honouredto be trusted enough with these young women's stories of strength, hope, courage, andprotest. I was reminded of the strength it takes to re-claim one's life from problems andof the importance of having a supportive community to stand alongside you as youembark on this journey. Since these initial conversations, I have carried these youngwomen's voices with me. Their voices and insider knowing accompany me in the workthat I do with other young persons struggling with similar problems. I have also becomeattuned to the liberating effects of a narrative co-research approach to therapy, in that itchallenges the silencing and oppression that can occur when persons consult with'experts' (therapists) for help.As a result of hearing these young women's stories, I have been reminded of whyI stepped out and stayed out of the box of traditional therapy approaches that often viewpersons as complicit with problems, see problems as the result of defective genes or thatcan be explained by biochemical explanations. Therapy, in itself, is political work thatprovides a space for us to take a stand with our clients about the injustices theyexperience, exploring the ways the problems may be supported in larger society. Asdemonstrated in this writing, narrative therapy offers us a platform to protest theinjustices and indignities to person's lives as well as offering a compassionate,respectful and transformational way to engage with the persons who consult us.350LimitationsIn the concluding chapter of his dissertation Alan Wade (1999) writes that he hasmade claims, yet,...provided no empirical proof in support of this claim. Rather I have presenteda small number of illustrative cases, mostly from my practice as a therapist. Thereader is right to remember that I have inevitably interpreted the examples andcould have misrepresented the individuals and their circumstances to support myclaims (p. 359-360).One could say that this is also true and a limitation of my dissertation. I createdcategories based on common themes described by the young women; themes that struckme. However I did my best to ensure that these categories made sense to others andexamined my own biases by engaging three colleagues in a forced sort (Stainton Rogers,1995), described in the methodology chapter. Another limitation of this study has to dowith the method of co-research that I employed. It could be argued that due to issues ofpower, the young women were simply answering the questions in the way they believedI wanted them to or, that I was feeding them or suggesting the answers I wanted to findin the questions I was asking. During the research process I addressed this to the best ofmy abilities. I had them put their own name on their experience of disordered eatingproblems, I asked the young women to describe their own experiences of the problems,and clarified that the answers were to be based in their experiences. For example in aninterview with Emma, she says:C: What did like drugs and alcohol and eating disorders need to take advantageof or convince you of in order to become part of your life in the way they did?351A: And this is exactly for me, right?C: Yeah, just for you.Another limitation of this study and the use of co-research is that it is not easilyreplicable. The context of this study would be difficult to reproduce since interviewing12 young women with similar experiences may produce different results simply basedon the dynamics between the interviewer and interviewees. Additionally, theinterviewer's knowledge of the interplay of substance misuse and disordered eatingpractices as well as the interviewees' experiences with these problems could producedifferent results. In the methodology section I attempted to clearly articulate my role asresearcher so that the readers could have some trustworthiness in my attempts toproduce a useful and reasonable piece of workAnother limitation of this study is generalizability. The study had a smallsample size as I only interviewed twelve young women. The young women were allclose in age (15 to 21) and were currently in or had attended the Peak House programfor substance misuse, and self-described as struggling with disordered eating practices.As a result, the findings of this present study may not be widely generalizable to otherpopulations. For example, the results of this study might not apply to young men or toadults participating in similar substance misuse programs who also self-report asstruggling with disordered eating practices.Another limitation of my dissertation could be the criteria that determinedwhether the young women could participate in the study or not. As mentioned inchapter five, the requirements for inclusion in the study were that the young women hadattended or were attending Peak House and that they self-described as struggling with or352having struggled with disordered eating practices. This criterion was selected ratherthan including them only if they met the diagnostic criteria for substance abuse,dependence or eating disorders as defined by the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000). I also didnot make direct correlations between the substance(s) that the young women were usingand their specific type of struggle with disordered eating practices, for exampleanorexia, bulimia, or compulsive eating. For example, given that cocaine can act as anappetite suppressant, it would be a drug that would make a young woman lose a lot ofweight in a short amount of time.Furthermore I limited my study to Peak House, an inpatient co-ed treatmentcentre for substance misuse problems. Studying similarities and differences betweenyoung women's responses in different treatment settings would also have been veryinteresting. For example, interviewing young women attending inpatient treatmentcentres for disordered eating about their experiences with substance misuse problemswould have been fascinating. Similarly, it would have been fascinating to conduct thestudy with young women attending individual or group outpatient therapy for substancemisuse or disordered eating practices. This would offer therapists insight intotherapeutic practices unique to specific treatment settings.Future DirectionsThere are always things we wish we had done differently, and if I was given theopportunity to do this study again there are a few things I would do differently. I wouldhave liked to have had the opportunity to go over the transcripts with the young womenonce they were transcribed, asking questions about their experience of the interviews,what changes they may have noticed since our interview, and allowing them to question353me about my experience. It would also have been interesting to have had lead areflecting team30 with a new group of young women either in a treatment centre fordisordered eating practices or substance misuse after they read the results section of thisdissertation (Andersen, 1991, 1992a; Katz, Siegal, Rappo, 1997). I would be curious tohear their responses to words of the young women, their responses to my interpretationsof the results, and their own ideas about the interplay between substance misuse anddisordered eating practices.I hope this research will stimulate discussions regarding how therapists andtreatment programs can best serve the needs of young women struggling with disorderedeating practices and substance misuse problems. I hope that young women are includedin these conversations. Other questions have emerged during the writing of thisdissertation. Can traditional alcohol and drug and eating disordered treatment practicesbegin to be more inclusive and reflective of the experiences of young womenexperiencing both problems? And how might this research potentially inform newtherapy practices? Building on this question I have included in the Appendix (AppendixE) a potential outline of a six-week therapy group for young women struggling withboth substance misuse and disordered eating practices. I am also curious if theanticipation of a relationship between the two problems might disable the potentialinterplay between them, since young women might begin to predict the ways that theproblems could appear or re-appear and the ways they work together in order to keepthem ensnared. Questions regarding how this work might also be preventative emerge. 30 For a detailed explanation and description of reflecting teams please see Tom Andersen's (1991) bookThe reflecting team. New York: Norton.354The main thing I think this dissertation offers regarding future directions is theneed to expand our horizons of research inquiry to position 'insiders' (research'subjects') as co-researchers. By positioning the young women as co-researchers, aninterplay between my world and theirs occurred which opened up space for newpossibilities and connections to unfold. In this opening, both the young women andmyself made connections between disordered eating and substance misuse that we hadnot seen or known before our conversation together. In this way, the interview became aprocess of co-construction for both the participants and myself. With each interview, adifferent level of depth and richness was added to my understandings of the ways inwhich disordered eating practices and substance misuse can work in a young women'slife, and the ways in which young women can begin to find some freedom from theseproblems. I hope that this research inquiry can open up space and lend credence toyoung women's voices within the field of therapy research. As well, I hope that voicesof other 'clients' struggling with problems are added to the breadth of therapeuticliterature in the hopes of offering new possibilities and new ways to go on (Andersen,1998).355APPENDIX ATHERAPIST INTERVIEW QUESTION1.

In your work with people that struggle with problems of disordered eating haveyou come across people who have also struggled with problems of substancemisuse?3. If so, did both problems present at the same time or at different time periods?4. In your experience is there a difference for people experiencing both problems ora difference in their experience of the problems, compared with someone whoexperiences one problem or the other (disordered eating practices or substancemisuse), and can you speak to that difference?5. Did you notice any similarities in the ways the problems effected people's lives?6. In your experience are there ways that alcohol and drugs might becomeappealing to someone struggling with disordered eating, or in your experienceare there ways that disordered eating might become appealing to someone with asubstance misuse problem?7. What are your ideas about the interconnectedness or the points of convergencebetween alcohol and drugs and substance misuse?8. In your own work have you developed ways to address both problems together?If Yes, how do you do this, and what led you to doing this.

What are some of the pressures that young women face about how they should beand how they should look? Did you ever experience 'pressure' to look a certain wayor fit in and did substances or disordered eating practices ever try to convince youthat they could help you 'fit in'? If so how did they do this?2. Are there ways that the media, our family, and friends might inadvertently supportdisordered eating practices and substance misuse?3. Some young women struggle with both eating disorders and substance abuse, whydo you think this is? Why might some people struggle with both problems and somedo not?4. Have there been times when alcohol, drugs, and disordered eating practices havebeen a problem in your life?5. Were there things going on in your life that made the problems look like a goodoption?6. Were there any promises that substance misuse or disordered eating practicesoffered you to convince you that they would help you out?7. Were there any differences in the ways that substance misuse or disordered eatingpractices 'helped' you out?8. If they did 'help,' what have YOU had to do or learn in order to break free? Whatdo you know now about their 'promises'?9. In regards to timing, was there ever a time that disordered eating practices andsubstance misuse overlapped in your life or did they appear at separate times. Didone ever use the other to sneak back into your life? 31 Questions 1, 2, 6, and 20 are adaptations inspired by Helen Malson's questions from the book The ThinWoman: Feminism, poststructuralism and the social psychology of anorexia nervosa (1998, p. 194-196).35710. Have you found that these problems have a way of 'teaming up' together? Can youdescribe these times be? Do they share any of the same tactics, or fulfil the samepurposes? How do you understand/explain this? How did you figure this out?11. Are there times when you might be more or less vulnerable to the 'teaming up'?12. How would you describe the meaning or link between alcohol & drugs anddisordered eating? What did it need to do (take advantage of, convince you of) tobecome part of your life in the way that it did?13. How would you draw/or what would a diagram look like for they way that theyinteracted in your life?14. Are there any thoughts, feelings, times, situations that have made you morevulnerable to their appearance either in the past or presently?15. Were there times when disordered eating practices and substance misuse mighthave been less of a problem in your life? When? What actions did you take to makethis possible?16. Are there any things that you do that help keep some distance from disorderedeating practices and substance misuse's strategies that you use to catch theproblems' reappearance? Are the strategies that you use the same for bothproblems?17. Were there times that disordered eating practices and substance misuse definedyour identity, did they do this separately or together? What qualities did they try toget you to forget?18. Was this a useful way to see/think about yourself? Why or why not.19. How would you prefer yourself and others to see you?20. Did disordered eating practices and substance misuse ever have you questioning thisway of seeing yourself? Or did it affect your relationship with yourself in anyway?21. In order to break free from this view of yourself what did you do, did anyone elsehelp you to break free from that view? Were there certain qualities that you neededto remember?22. When you were working with therapists or in a treatment program did you everexperience having to hide one problem or the other? If so how did that come about?If not what did you or the therapist do to be able to discuss both disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse at the same time. Was it important that you wereable to do so?35823. If you were asked to design the 'perfect' program/group for people struggling withdisordered eating practices and substance misuse what would it look like. Wouldthere be things that would need to be included?24. For other young people struggling with disordered eating practices and substancemisuse what would you want them to know? What support, advice or insiderknowledge might you offer them?25. If you had been offered the same information that you just shared, what differencemight this have made for you?26. For therapists working with young people who are struggling with disordered eatingpractices and substance misuse what would you like therapists to know about thesetwo problems? How might people have been more helpful to you when you werestruggling with both problems?27. What do therapists need to pay attention to when working with people who havestruggled with both? Would it have made a difference if both were addressed at thesame time vs. addressing disordered eating practices first and substance misusesecond or vice versa? Would it be beneficial when working with a counsellor to havethese issues addressed simultaneously? What might be difficult about doing this?How would this look? Are there ways that therapists can help when you havestopped either substance misuse or disordered eating practices and you are starting tonotice changes in your body (what could they say/do, etc...)28. Are there things that we have not yet talked about that you feel are important?

Discuss what types ofpreparations are needed as people begin on their travels. Where going to, what theyneed to bring with them on their journey, what they need to say goodbye to? Alsodiscuss ideas of identity migrations (White, 2007)Journaling Homework: How did they prepare to take the step of attending the group,what developments have happened that have them coming to the group. What helpedthem become ready-enough to attend? What actions were most helpful for them andperhaps others in getting them to this group? What ideas/voices did they have to resist inorder to attend this group. Or perhaps it is the hope of what may happen. Also writeabout what they need to bring with them on this journey as discussed in group today.Week 2: Getting to know the tactics of the problemsBrainstorming the promises of substance misuseBrainstorming the promises of disordered eating practicesLooking at the ways the problems may have been an attempt to solve problems/feelbetter/copeLooking at the ways these promises are actually empty promises (lies) and at the realimpact they have been causing in persons lives.Looking at what feeds the problems and things/events/contexts that the problems cantake advantage ofJournaling Homework for week 2: each person picks three 3 ways that the 2 problemsare most influential in their lives. Write about what feeds the problems, what makesthem bigger. Then what makes them smaller, takes away their power. Actions, specificpeople, things, and places that support them in this.366Week 3: Looking at the interplay between the two problemsRevisiting the promises of the two problemsExploring the similarities between the two problemsExploring the possible interplay between the two problems: the ways that substancemisuse and disordered eating overlap/connect, for example the similar promises theymay tell, similarities in the ways they work in peoples livesJournaling Homework for week 3: Each person draws the interplay between the twoproblems (Discuss ideas about how perfection may sneak in and try to wreck thisexercise, and ways to keep it at bay). Notice and journal anti-anorexic/ anti-alcohol anddrug actions that you may have begun taking or that you would like to imagine yourselftaking.Week 4: Movement AwayDiscussing the pictures of the interplayReflecting team group: Have someone come in and be interviewed who is now free fromthe problems- discuss the history of this development, what they had to learn, ways theykeep moving forwards.Building a community- places ways to find support for these ideas outside of the group.Journaling Homework for week 4: Begin to imagine other possibilities ways to movethrough pain/cope. What you would like to begin to fill up your life with when theseproblems are no longer around in this way. Continue to notice and journal anti-anorexic/anti-alcohol and drug actions that you may have begun taking or that you would like toimagine yourself taking.Week 5: Moving towards new possibilitiesDiscuss homeworkTalk about moments/places/spaces where you have felt free from substance misuse anddisordered eating practices. Actions that they have been taking that support thesedevelopments. People and places in their lives that support these moments.Set backs & slip ups- how to move forwards after a setback- what you learn aboutmaking change in these moment.Witnessing of personal qualities that cannot be measured by appearance.Journaling Homework for week 5: Journal about the moments/places/spaces/personswhere you have felt most free from substance misuse and disordered eating. What is itabout these persons/places/moments that contribute to this development? How are youdifferent in these moments?Week 6: Noticing & Holding onto Moments of FreedomNoticing Change. What changes have happened over the course of the last 6 weeks,what helped prepare you to make these changes? Was there a significant person, place367or thing that helped you make or begin to make these changes? (Epston, D., Workshop,October 14, 2009. Vancouver, BC)What developments are important for people around you know? Videotape or writecomments down for people in their life to be a witness to the changes, and the ways theycan help you hold onto these changes.Witnessing/Reflecting Group. What others can do to support them in finding andholding on to freedom from the problems.Everyone in the group discusses where they would like to be, and what their relationshipwith the problem will look like. 'Imagine in 6 months from now...' Take it with themwhen they leave.Journaling Homework for week 6: Finding freedom from the problems- how to continueholding on to the changes that you have made and continue moving forward.368REFERENCE LISTAdams-Wescott, J., Dafforn, T., & Sterne, P.
