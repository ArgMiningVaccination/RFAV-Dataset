It explains the nature of life in all its totality, and teaches you how to live in a way that supports your constitution and temperament in order to unfold your potential to experience life more fully. The word ayu-r-veda is formed from two smaller words in Sanskrit, the ancient language in which all ayurvedic scientific texts are written. The first, ayu, refers to all concrete (physical) and subtle (non-physical) aspects of life. The second, veda, refers to knowledge in the deepest sense of the word -- the wisdom that allows you to understand and experience yourself as part of a conscious universe which is inherently creative and self-organizing. Ayurveda is not just a system of health care; it is a complete approach to living which embraces and nourishes all aspects of human existence, from the most concrete -- human physiology -- to its most subtle -- thought and intuition. Together with its sister science of yoga, ayurveda illuminates the most extensive and detailed system for promoting longevity through self-care in human history.

Unlike its western counterpart, ayurveda recognizes that because much of life is non-physical, it cannot be completely understood through objective means alone. Therefore, it incorporates a wide array of analytical tools, including subjective and intuitive methods of scientific inquiry as well as objective ones. Likewise, treatment options are more vast, including therapies that evoke healing on subtle levels (mind and consciousness) as well as on more superficial ones (physiology and anatomy). See the discussion of [self-realization](energy-medicine.html) for an explanation of why anatomy and physiology are considered to be \"superficial\", i.e. on the surface, in Ayurveda. [Learn More](javascript:;.html) Samkya Ayurveda is grounded in samkya, a philosophy of the cosmos, that recognizes that the universe is intelligent. Purusha is the term that samkya uses to refer to this universal intelligence. It is described as \"pure undifferentiated consciousness\". Modern physics calls purusha the \"unified field\". Samkya considers purusha to be the first organizing principle of the universe. The second principle is prakriti -- the potential to manifest in physical form. It is the union of purusha and prakriti which makes it possible for the world as we know it to exist. The two principles of purusha and prakriti are interdependent: without prakriti, there can be no form (body). But without purusha, there is no intelligence and the form would never animate (become alive). This understanding of the universe accounts for ayurveda's holistic approach to health, one that attends to both physical and non-physical aspects of human healing, and distinguishes four different levels of healing: disease treatment, disease prevention, life enhancement, and awareness development. Samkya posits that the outer (concrete) world exists as a platform for purusha to experience and understand itself. But how can something formless become concrete? In samkya, the fact that we exist in physical form constitutes evidence for the second principle of the universe -- prakriti. Unlike purusha, prakriti has no inherent intelligence. However, it has something that purusha does not have -- the ability (potential) to manifest in concrete (objective) form as what western scientists call \"matter\". If this seems complicated, it may help to think about your own experiences with death, perhaps the loss of a beloved parent or a family member. When they are alive, they are animated, vibrant, full of what we call \"life\". When they die, their body remains, the physical components are still there, but the thing that animated your beloved is gone. In its absence, you can see for yourself that what was there, and is there no longer, was that person's or that animal's unique expression, or version, of purusha. What remains, is the physical body which begins to distintegrate as soon as its consciousness disappears. This is why purusha is considered to be the first principle of the universe; without it, nothing can exist.

These three aspects combine in various proportions to give rise to all phenomena found in nature. They are present everywhere; if something is observable, then it contains the guna. The guna possess different, sometimes contradictory properties. This is the source of their power to manifest the material world. They act as one, with different aspects balancing one another. It is this dynamic, ever-changing, ever-equilibrating nature of the material world that accounts for the dynamic way in which Ayurveda understands the nature of life, including the phenomena of health and disease, and how to promote the former and discourage the latter. Lifestyle guidelines and medical therapies are all based upon a dynamic view of life where different energies can be purposefully used to balance one another as a means to restore and maintain health. Sattva is the guna that manifests the qualities of balance, equality, and stability. It is light and luminous, and moves inwards and upwards. It is conscious and intelligent, bringing with it the potential to experience happiness. Rajas is the guna responsible for activity, change, and disturbance. It is movable and excitable, capable of motivating and expressing. It has a force that causes dispersion and disintegration and its capacity to disturb creates the potential to experience pain. Tamas is immovable, still and inert. It is heavy and capable of obstructing perception. It moves down and is responsible for all degeneration. Because of this, it holds the potential to give rise to delusion and confusion.

First, prakriti receives light from purusha to manifest mahat, the all-knowing intelligence of the cosmos.Your personal embodiment of cosmic wisdom is buddhi, your intellect. Buddhi is capable of discriminating and understanding what it is experiencing. Buddhi allows you to comprehend yourself in a deep and abiding way, as part of something beyond your individual, separate self. It is different from manas, the mind. Manas is responsible for your experience of yourself as an identity separate from everything else. This sense of \"I-ness\" perceived by manas is called ahankara. Because Ayurveda recognizes that each person is a unique embodiment of the universal principles of purusha and prakriti, it understands that everyone is unique, requiring different types of support in order to remain healthy as well as different therapies to regain health after it has been lost. [Learn More](javascript:;.html) Dosha At the level of the physical manifestation of ahankara, matter comes from the five elements of earth, water, fire, ether and air. They combine in various ways to form three different types of energy that animate all life forms in different proportions at different times, depending upon that being's life circumstances and state of health. They are called vata, formed from air and ether, pita, formed from fire and water, and kapha, formed from earth and water. These three energies are called dosha in Sanskrit,which literally means \"fault\" in Sanskrit, and relates to the prefix \"dys\" from Greek (both considered to have evolved from a single language that predates them), that we see in words like \"dysfunction\" and \"dysregulation\". Although it might seem odd to call the three energies that animate us all \"faults\", they are so named because they have the capacity to corrupt, i.e. cause disease, in the body and mind. Like the guna, each dosha is associated with different qualities. And because these qualities are found throughout the natural world, they form the basis for Ayurvedic medical practice: Substances and therapies that possess a quality that is missing in someone can be used to replenish the deficiency. Likewise substances or therapies that reduce a particular quality can be used to calm or limit an excess. Vata is dry, cold, light, mobile, subtle, rough, astringent, and clear. The primary location of vata in the body is the colon. It is responsible for all movement in the body - the flow of the breath and the blood, the movement of nutrients and waste in and out of cells and in and out of the body. It regulates the nervous system and stimulates the intellect. Therapeutically, for example, substances that are moist, sweet, warm, liquid smooth, heavy, oily and unctuous can be used to calm a vata excess. Similarly, therapies that moisturize, warm, soften and oil will reduce a vata excess or aggravation. Pita is pungent, greasy, oily, liquid, hot, sharp, spreading, sour, and penetrating. It is responsible for all metabolic activity involving the endocrine (hormonal) system, digestion and body temperature regulation. Mentally, it helps us digest sensory impressions. Its primary location is in the small intestine. Therapeutically, substances that are cool, dry, subtle, soft, and sweet (for example) can be used to calm a pita excess, while substances that are pungent, oily, hot, sharp, and sour can be used to replenish a deficiency of pita. Therapies that are cooling and drying can used to treat a pita aggravation. Kapha is heavy, cool, soft, dense, slow, greasy, cloudy, unctuous, sweet and sticky. It holds the body together, providing cohesion by giving shape and form, , lubricating and protecting, and aiding in growth and development. Its primary location is in the stomach. Therapeutically, substances that are dry, warm, light, hot, sharp, sour and astringent can be used to balance an excess of kapha, while substances that are heavy, cool, soft, dense and unctuous can be used to replenish a deficiency of kapha. Therapies that are light, cool, rapid and drying will reduce a kapha excess.

Thoughts will rush to judge that flower. Take a long breath. Return again to the looking. See the color, the beauty, the total existence of the flower. The past memory will rush toward you. But remain in the art of looking. When there is pure observation without thought, your mind will be like a blank screen, clear to reflect the intelligence of the cosmos itself. This profound intelligence is called Mahat. Vasant Lad Strands of Eternity 2004 "}
