Menopause is not an unnatural or uncommon condition to occur, and it is very important to remember that while hormonal change is inevitable, there are actions that you can take to naturally improve the side effects that come along with it. Menopause does occur at different times in women, but the most common time for it to occur is in the late 40s and early 50s. Most of the time, women experience menopause and the [symptoms of menopause between the ages of 45 and 55](https://www.healthline.com/health/menopause/symptoms-of-menopause). Menopause and its symptoms can occur outside of this timeframe, but it is generally agreed upon that this is the most common window for menopause to occur. Menopause is a transition that can last anywhere from several months to a few years. Generally, it lasts no longer than 5 years and no less than 12 months. The length of time and when it occurs can vary from woman to woman. The vast majority of women do experience menopause during their lifetime, but that doesn't mean that every woman experiences menopause. In fact, each woman's experience with menopause is unique and contains different nuances that must be examined if she hopes to treat it with a natural remedy. During the ages of 45 to 55, at least 66% of women experience menopause as well as the symptoms that are associated with menopause.

Here are some of the natural remedies that you can use to help lessen the side effects of menopause and make the transition through menopause a bit easier on yourself. If you are having problems with the symptoms of menopause, then one of the first things that you should examine is the vitamins and minerals that you are taking in. One of the side effects of menopause is the weakening of bones, which can lead to an increased risk for osteoporosis. Both calcium and vitamin D are great for bone health, so it is important that when planning your diet, you include them. Though weaker bones is not a side effect that many people necessarily complain about when going through menopause, it is something that can cause problems down the line. For that reason, it is very important that you get out ahead of it. One of the most important factors in maintaining as little severity of side effects as possible is achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. As you can guess, physical health plays a large role in determining the severity of the side effects that you experience not only during menopause, but for a number of medical conditions that you might otherwise experience. As a result, it is very important that you give attention to your weight and ensure that you are at a healthy body weight. Studies have shown that women who were able to lose 10 pounds were more likely to eliminate the side effects of hot flashes as well as night sweats during menopause. Part of maintaining a healthy body is eating right and a huge component of that is consuming more fruits and vegetables in your everyday diet. When you invite more fruits and vegetables into your diet, you are going to be consuming more vitamins and minerals that are essential to keeping the side effects minimal and lessening the long-term effects of menopause. Fruits and vegetables can also help you to feel more full, possibly resulting in an easier time losing weight. With a healthy diet and weight, you can prevent diseases such as heart disease and prevent bone loss, which can occur from menopause. When you start going through menopause and experiencing the symptoms that come along with it, you'll quickly notice that foods can be one of the biggest triggers for symptoms. If you find this to be the case, it can be helpful for you to record [which foods you eat and what symptoms they cause](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/menopause-diet#bottom-line). When you know which foods prompt you to feel the side effects of menopause more severely, you can start to eliminate those foods from your diet or consume them less. While it may be inconvenient to have to eliminate foods from your diet, you'll find that it's worth it to lessen the side effects that you have to feel from menopause. As you already know, your physical shape and fitness has a lot to do with the severity of the symptoms that you'll feel when it comes to menopause. One way to ensure that you remain in good physical condition is to get more exercise during your daily routine. You should seek to include physical exercise into your life as much as possible if you want to put your body in a good position to overcome the symptoms that frequently come along with menopause. With increased exercise and improved physical condition, you can improve energy, metabolism, joint health, bone health, decreased stress, and better sleep. All of these can lead to minimize impacts from menopause. One thing that you might not have ever heard of, but is very important in combating menopause side effects is phytoestrogens. These are plant compounds that occur naturally that can help to recreate the effect of estrogen in your body. Since they [act like estrogen does in the body](https://balancemyhormones.co.uk/what-does-estrogen-do/), they can help to balance the hormones in the body and ensure your body remains in good balance. To [help overcome the symptoms of hormone imbalance](https://balancemyhormones.co.uk/what-is-hormone-imbalance/), you should seek to consume foods that are high in phytoestrogens in your diet. Water is important for maintaining general health, but it is also important for helping to lessen the effects of menopause and the side effects that come along with it. Women do tend to experience dryness during menopause as a result of decreased estrogen levels. If you can drink more water during the day (usually 8-12 glasses of water is recommended), then you can help to prevent this from happening. Drinking water is also known to help decrease bloating, which is another common side effect of menopause. For women going through menopause, consuming sugar and processed foods is bound to make the side effects worse, not better. When women consume diets that are high in carbs and sugar, it can cause volatility in the blood sugar level. This leads to a feeling of fatigue and irritability, which is made worse by the various side effects that come along with menopause. Studies have found that diets that contain high amounts of refined carbohydrates can increase the risk of depression in women going through menopause. If you are going through menopause and are experiencing bad side effects, one thing you may want to do at the start is make sure that you aren't skipping meals. Eating regular meals and getting the right amount of meals each day is very important in maintaining your health and ability to overcome the symptoms of menopause. Eating on an irregular schedule can worsen the symptoms and make it much more difficult to lose or maintain weight. Eating more protein is one of the most proven ways to prevent the loss of muscle mass, which is a symptom of aging and menopause. If you can include a bit of protein with each of your meals or get the proper amount of protein each day, it can greatly decrease your chances of losing muscle mass and enable you to regulate your weight more easily. Finally, you can also [take supplements to help with the symptoms of menopause](https://www.webmd.com/menopause/ss/slideshow-menopause). When the female body is going through menopause, there are several vitamins and minerals that fluctuate wildly. If you can take the proper supplements, you can ensure that your body has all the supplies that it needs to go through menopause and protect you from some of the most negative side effects that menopause has to offer. It is recommended that you consider taking phytoestrogens, black cohosh, and other supplements such as probiotics to help give your body everything it needs. One thing that you need to be aware of before you start seeking natural remedies for menopause is that there are many companies and content providers out there that have other motives. When you research natural remedies for menopause, you should avoid purchasing products or investing in services that claim to eliminate menopause instantly or provide a magic solution to the symptoms of menopause. You should always seek to involve your doctor in a conversation about how to keep the symptoms of menopause at bay and at a tolerable level instead of blindly trusting products that promise to lower the effects of menopause. In addition, be sure that the sources that you consult are to be trusted. When you are considering natural remedies for menopause, one thing that you need to keep in mind is that natural remedies, while often safer and better for your body, are often going to take some time to take effect. When you decide to try natural remedies for menopause and the side effects that come along with it, you should be realistic in your expectations. These methods can be effective over time, but expecting any one solution to instantly have an impact is unrealistic. Make sure that you are patient with yourself and allow yourself to try a few methods of naturally helping the symptoms of menopause before you give up.
