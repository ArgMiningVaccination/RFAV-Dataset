Molecular biology has become the foundation of modern medicine with the result that today's medical industry chases after technology to solve all its problems. In the process it is losing its own essence as it moves into fields increasingly alien to human nature as a whole. Nevertheless, many doctors are beginning to reexamine this exclusive worldview in favor of a more wholistic approach to healing. To this end, anthroposophical medicine encompasses a wide range of healing modalities, including orthodox, allopathic medicine. The Anthroposophical Approach to Medicine explores the body's relationship to soul and spirit on the basis of Rudolf Steiner's insights into the activities of the spiritual world. Edited by doctors Friedrich Husemann and Otto Wolff, this book invites us to an in-depth view of a true alternative to materialistically oriented medicine.Chapters include essays on childhood development and diseases; the disorders of old age; neuroses healing plants; biochemistry and pathology; blood-work; and special diagnostic techniques. This first of a multi-volume series is an invaluable tool to all who want to extend the practice of medicine to include the whole human being. Author Biography: Dr. Friedrich Husemann (1887-1959) wasborn in in northeast North Rhine-Westphalia in north Germany, the first son ofa Protestant pastor.

Hedivided this model into three areas: physical therapy through medication andexternal applications; artistic therapy; and psychotherapy. In 1930, he foundedthe Wiesneck Sanatorium. It was later named after him as the Friedrich HusemannClinic in Buchenbach near Freiburg im Breisgau, which specializes in psychiatryand psychotherapy. The clinic continues to be based largely on Husemann's work.During the Nazi period, Friedrich Husemann sought to save the lives of hispatients and prevent them falling victim to the Nazi authorities. He died inBuchenbach, a municipality in the southwest Black Forest. Dr. Otto Wolff was born in 1921 in Glatz, Silesia (at the time, a region in northeast Germany). He studied biochemistry and medicine and first worked as a hospital physician, then as a general physician and school doctor. Later he worked many years in the pharmaceutical industry to develop new anthroposophic medicines. He wrote numerous publications on anthroposophic medicine, including the standard work: The Anthroposophic Approach to Medicine (three volumes). During his last twenty-five years, Dr. Wolff taught anthroposophic medicine to medical doctors worldwide. He died in Arlesheim, Switzerland, in 2003.

Walter Holtzapfel, MD (1912-1994), was born in Kiel, Germany, and in 1931 moved to Freiburg/Breisgau to study medicine. At the age of nineteen, while a tourist visiting Dornach, Switzerland, he met Ita Wegman and became involved with studying anthroposophically extended medicine in a study group of young physicians. The rest of his life was dedicated to practice, teaching, and writing involved with anthroposophic medicine. At the age of fifty-two, he became leader of the Medical Section of the Anthroposophical Society, a position he held until 1977. Dr. Holtzapfel was the author of numerous books, including Children's Destinies and The Human Organs. Wilhelm Pelikan (1893-1981) was born in the ancient city of Pula (now in Croatia). A chemist by training, for nearly forty years he was a director of laboratories for Weleda in Germany. He died in Arlesheim, Switzerland. Alla Selawry (1913-1992) was a Russian scientist, anthroposophist, doctor, homeopath, and theologian. She graduated from the University of T\u00fcbingen in 1939 with a master's degree in medicine and worked with Hans Krueger under the guidance of Ehrenfried Pfeiffer to develop Pfeiffer's medical diagnostic technique based on interpreting crystal formations of blood mixed in a copper chloride solution, which Pfeiffer called biocrystallization. She later established a private practice that thrived for the rest of her life. She developed homeopathic treatment regimens based on various metals, many of which had properties described in mythological. In addition, Selawry wrote a number of theological books, including a biography of John of Kronstadt. She died in Stuttgart.
