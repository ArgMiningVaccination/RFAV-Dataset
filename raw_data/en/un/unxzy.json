The three-year Initiative will deploy $1.5 billion for targeted intervention in critical areas to save the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in Africa and hasten the continent's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Initiative was launched in June 2021 and is the largest public health partnership between a global philanthropic organization and an African institution. The partnership will build on the tremendous and ongoing efforts of the [African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVATT)](https://africacdc.org/news-item/african-vaccine-acquisition-trust-avat-announces-108000-doses-of-vaccines-arriving-in-mauritius-as-part-of-the-first-monthly-shipment-of-johnson-johnson-vaccines/), [COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX)](https://g.co/kgs/qAqMg7), [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/), and governments to provide access to safe COVID-19 vaccines to the African population. The Initiative aims to: 1. To purchase COVID-19 vaccines for at least 65 million people; 2. To drive millions more vaccinations by enabling the delivery and administration of vaccines; 3. To lay the groundwork for vaccine manufacturing by focusing on human capital development; 4. To strengthen the capacity of the Africa CDC The Saving Lives and Livelihoods Initiative guiding principles: 1. Inclusivity - Include all African Union Member States and communities; 2. Equity- Reflect African Union Member States' circumstances and needs; 3. Accountability- Use resources appropriately, efficiently and transparently; 4. African-led - Empower African Governments, public health institutes and implementing organizations; 5. Collaboration - Work together with Member States and relevant partners in the field and ensure there is collaboration and no duplication of effort; 6. Improvements to national health systems - Strengthen national health systems through smart investment into vaccine deployment without harming routine immunization; 7. Iteration and learning - Apply a test-and-learn approach while scaling up the programme, with a focus on knowledge and institution building. Key Result areas The Initiative through various implementing partners, extends support to the Africa Union Member States in the following areas - Procurement and Logistics to Central medical warehouse: - Supply core vaccine units(vials) - Supply ancillary products for vaccines - Coordinate overall supplier management - Ensure required systems and tools for vaccine supply chain management are in place - In-country logistics: - Manage and monitor in-country logistics of vaccines and ancillaries - Store, repackage and distribute vaccines and ancillary consumables - Ensure required systems and tools for vaccine supply chain management are in place - Risk Communication and Community Engagement - Understand the drivers and scale of vaccine hesitancy and develop a strategy to combat it - Implement RCCE strategies across selected Member States - Set up systems and tools for effective communication - COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) - Set up new and expand existing CVCs - Hire, train and manage CVC staff to deploy or administer vaccines at the CVCs - Safety Surveillance: - Set up a system for reporting adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in Member States - Build investigation and analysis capabilities at national, regional and continental levels - Establish a safety surveillance network - Genomic Sequencing: - Strengthen the existing laboratory and sample referral network - Manage data and IT systems - Conduct training - Ensure overarching programmatic governance - Implementation Science: - Conduct research on real-world vaccine effectiveness and public health impact - Identify and codify barriers and success factors for rapid immunization The above result areas are anchored on the direct support from the Africa CDC that includes: - Technical assistance to Member States to ensure robust strategies and micro plans for successful implementation. - Data and information systems in setting up an Information Technology (IT) function in Africa CDC to provide real-time data collection and reporting tools for the programme - Hiring of Programme Staff to support the project implementation Implementing Partners The SLL initiative is implemented with a team of implementing partners at two (2) levels.
