Introduction Tens of millions of sharks are caught and traded internationally each year-both legally and illegally-the majority for their meat and fins but roughly three million or more for their squalene. It takes the livers of between 25000-3000 to extract about a ton of squalene. Hypothesis Covid 19 vaccines and flu vaccination differ in provision by doctors, an issue has its pros and cons - several do it together, several people do not want to do it at all. Squalene, a hydrocarbon obtained for commercial purposes primarily from shark liver oil and other botanic sources, is increasingly used as an immunologic adjuvant in several vaccines, including seasonal and the novel influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic flu vaccines. As more and more consumers are becoming aware of the issues facing sharks, the market is starting to see a shift towards ethical, plant-based squalene and synthetics. Some companies have already shifted to plant-based sources or didn't use shark squalene to begin with-including Ponds, Dove and L'Or\u00e9al. However, on a global scale, shark remains the primary source of squalene.

In Latvia there have been doctors` who must have to leave their practice due to not wish to support vaccination. Not just because of squalene, but also other things like some parts of feet eggs in vaccine. Education is of a great importance about vaccination, as illnesses like measles reappear [especially at an early age] in regions, where is the highest parts of denial of the necessity of the country. There is also a burden and pain in the doctors' eyes, who cannot go on with their work as usual, also because they do not support vaccination. Yesterday, an information, about those 25 general practitioners announced, they are quitting their jobs. As Family Doctors' leave their practice due to unwell and hard conditions, and in spite of their will and high papers. This will make larger exhaustion in more 25 practices, as they will have double workload, that will also affect vaccination of Covid19, flu, measles etc. These 25 practices showed they give in and go to pension much earlier, because of bureaucracy and an immense problem, that are caused by E-Health also, which does not work as it should have and take more and more out of the recourses especially in solo practices. There are also a lot of challenges in management Covid19 and other vaccines, as there are 10 amps in one box of vaccines and they must be vaccinated in 6 hours, and if the patient does not come, the vaccines must be utilized. Please remember, how many sharks are killed to save human lives [1]. In rural areas, family doctors' work requires to take a wider look at observing field of registered and unregistered patients asking help to cure their illnesses and solve health issues, providing feeling of safety in places, that might be challenging to call home. The poorest places for inhabitants cover addictions of alcohol, drugs, smoking, all that develop unhealthy ways of living for individuals and their families, raise mortality and morbidity. Sometimes conditions are so bad, that a person does not have a family as we have got used to consider its usual way - for instance- mother, father and child/children are far away from reality. Families de facto are of various kinds. Case 1 A girl 10 years of age is left alone at home with grandparents [grandfather suffer from alcohol abuse; grandmother makes dinner in the kitchen. All of a sudden the granddaughter sees a white mouse and gets scared and grandmother gives her a shovel and tells a girl to kill a mouse, putting a granddaughter into funk, as she has never killed a mouse- in the very meantime grandfather comes inside and sees what happens, that a girl pets a mouse and cannot kill it- he asks to move aside a girl and takes a mouse with naked hands and says a girl to look at him and while he smashes a mouse in his hand so tight, that rectum and inner organs are seen to be pushed out [inner organs] from a mouse. A girl got really scared and could never forget that. The girl had four grandparents then - and later in a few months, she visited other grandparents. The situation was different but involving similar situation. A teenager was in the kitchen all alone and suddenly saw a white mouse and got frightened again and jumped on the seat chair and shouted so aloud, that out of the cry, the mouse stopped and did not even move. The other grandfather heard the cry of a granddaughter and took the little mouse with the shovel and threw it in the kitchen fire while it was alive. The granddad told it was more scared than the girl herself, but did not explain, why it was done so. A girl felt guilty all her life. Later the girl went to school and became a doctor, but while studying, the Medical program involved then studies with frogs- a young medical student needed to put it in the coma and later kill the frog, however she could not do it, the frog got away, and other colleague did it, and later took the skin of the frog, to study reflexes of a dying frog. That girl and teenager was I- the doctor with a 10 years' experience- and still remember it as yesterday. It was scary to catch that frog, knowing what I had to do with it- I could not, and feel relieved it was not me to initiate her sad destiny. The World needs us with clear mind and good heart, and not just humans. We have the power to help those who are weak - no matter how strong we are and how many resources we have, we must never forget the responsibility in front of those, who need us. Conclusion In Latvia the population grows older and older, the same is happening to the doctors. There is an issue during vaccines usage and in medicine it must be especially accurate to make proper dosage and timing to do the best for patients, and still, recommend to take it with you- that lessening utilization in proper way, not only thinking plastics, can save lives in animals, and keep that in our minds, that we are also animals, higher developed- especially after we have been vaccinated against Covid19 and flu by ourselves, we as a doctor must show an example to our patients. But guess what - who is the patient- the vaccinated person or shark with cut fins off and let down to sink at its environment by violence? This vaccination and swinging with our DNA or RNA must have been overthought. As vaccination is linked to spirituality often also- a proper analysis is needed in long term and short term of the events. References 1.
