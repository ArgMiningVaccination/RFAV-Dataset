Swasthasya swasathya rakshanam \" is the very first aim given in Charak Samhita. Modern science based medical practices also pragmatically accepts the value underlying this dictum. Invention of microscope led to a revolution and gave excellent knowledge about bacteria, germs, viruses and diseases (caused by them in human body) like T. B., Cholera, Malaria and so on. There is now a big list of the infectious diseases that ends with AIDS. Once microscopic cause of infectious diseases was established, the next question to be addressed is - can we prevent infections? Can we find any solution to train our body to fight infections? Can we kill the infecting germs etc? Inoculation and vaccination came as answer to these questions and antibiotics were invented to kill the infections. Developed nations started this prevention program with a big bang. Soon they found that these methods do not provide fail-proof prevention. Good nutrition, fresh and pure drinking water, non-polluted environment and good sanitation etc. are very important in prevention of diseases. They started with the serious implementation of preventive program along with vaccinations and achieved much gratifying results. In under- developed and developing nations this was not followed seriously. Consequently death, disease and disabilities continue to stalk the population of these countries despite This paper elaborates the Ayurvedic perspective on preventive medicine in children, with specific reference to vaccination. It explores alternative approaches to boost immunity in children.mega immunization programs, with no immediate solution in sight. Infections do produce diseases but that is not the only cause of 1diseases. There should be a suitable environment in the body for the growth of these invaders. If that climate is not made available, body will not be diseased. This is the basic principle of Ayurveda. That is why \"krimi\"(infection) is called as \"aagantu hetu\" the cause which fails to produce disease if the body is strong and healthy.\" In short, if the host environment (body) is not conducive for the infection to take root, one can safely pronounce it healthy. Strong body and mind can disallow the infection to produce diseases, so acquisition of good strength becomes one's prime health objective. This is a key principle of Ayurvedic approach to infectious disease. 1QUESTIONS ABOUT VACCINATION One can imagine the wild and rampant presence of viruses on earth as on today. Is vaccination program in a position to control this critically grave situation? Is it possible to prevent each and every invading bacteria/virus with prophylactic measures today? If yes what about cost, effort & time involved? Most of us know about a smallpox. It took about a hundred years, large-scale money and countless efforts of numerous scientists world over to be effective. I feel seriously concerned about the fact that one vaccine protects against one specific disease only. What it does to the whole body is a big question? Now doctors agree that the risk of reaction to the vaccine is greater than the risk of catching smallpox itself. One gets confused after knowing this fact. What will happen to man's natural immune system? Although rare, such adverse reactions have known to occur, which may be minor or severe, and can be produced by any V AIDYA R. M. NANAL 102 Anand Bhuwan, Gore Wadi, Pt. Satavalekar Marg, Mahim, Mumbai - 400 016 Email: rmnanal@indiainfo.com55 Pages 55 - 58vaccine. Minor reactions are mainly fever, swelling, redness at the spot of the injection; muscle pain, joint pain and some of the severe reactions are hypersensitivity reactions, hives, severe allergic shock or anaphylaxis, paralysis and even polio. Women are usually advised to avoid pregnancy for three months after vaccination. People with severe egg allergies are asked not to take mumps vaccine, which is prepared in eggs. Same is the case with flu vaccine. In India large section of Brahmins, Jain etc. are purely vegetarian and will not take Mumps vaccine if they know the truth. How do we resolve this problem? Or simply ignore it? It is not known yet as for how long protection against pneumonia lasts. We have just touched the tip of a bigger and complex problem. People are likely to contact Hepatitis B through their jobs, social or family life, and illness and through exposure or travel. Is vaccination sufficient safeguard in this case? Routine Typhoid vaccination is not recommended in Australia and New Zealand. Unfortunately the vaccine is only about 50% effective and does not prevent transmission of the disease. As with typhoid and cholera the best prevention is to carefully avoid potentially contaminated substances. Sanitation, hygiene and pure drinking water are the critical measures that can be taken to prevent cholera and typhoid. India is totally dependent on western biomedical science to give her people advantage of vaccinations and protection. But we have not been able to stop deaths and disabilities despite the availability of vaccines and our aggressive \"Universal Immunization Programmes\". The question I want to raise here is why are we yet to explore and take advantage of the prophylactic methods, given to us by our rich medical heritage of \u00c2yurveda? It is our claim that when it comes to raising the immunity of the individual bodies, Ayurveda has a distinct advantage over modern vaccine based approach. Following points sum up limitation of vaccination programs 1) Its scope is limited to infections only. 2) Food borne diseases, malnutrition, sex, sleep etc, are out of scope 3) There are known and unknown side effects and complications are. 4) There are problems of resistant bacteria problems.. 5) Difficulties and gaps in its implementation.6) Changing theories and practices of modern medicine is also a point of concern. Questions about safety and efficacy of the vaccines are still subject of ongoing research in Modern medicine. Thalidomide case in the recent history is an important fact. We should never forget that. PROPHYLAXIS AND AYURVEDA Prophylaxis means prevention of disease. Ayurveda gives prime importance to this management. The approach is totally different, as Ayurveda is a complete \"Shastra\" (knowledge system), based on its own philosophy and practice that gives very specific principles of disease. In the classical texts we find large taxonomy of diseases but mainly there are eleven categories as given below. A) Sharir (physiological) and Manas (psychological) B) Nij (congenial) and Aagantuj (arising accidentally or causally) Kalaj diseases caused by 1) Vaya sapeksha (Caused due to age) 2) Avastha sapeksha (period or stages of life & its diseases) 3) Ritu sapeksha (seasonal diseases) 4) Kulaj Rog - ( diseases transmitted generation to generation?) 5)Swabhavaj - (diseases caused by nature) C)Deshaj (diseases caused by a specific province) D) Sankramaka (Contagious) E) Janapadodhwnsa (Epidemic diseases) F) Vishaj - Poisonous origins and diseases G) Asatmya-Indriya-Artha Sanyogaj - diseases caused by unsuitableness of sensory organs & stimuli (Artha) from the outer world. H) Pragyaparadha - diseases caused Intellectual blasphemy. Wrong food items and their combinations, wrong methods of eating I) Sex and diseases. These are the main categories that need to be accounted for. We are not going to deal with them in details, here I want to make point, i.e., only some of the above mentioned types are relevant to modern immunization and vaccines. They are 1) some of the 'Aagantuj' types, 2) some from epidemic diseases, and 3) few from Kalaj category. Rests of the categories remain out of the scope of modern immunization. Ayurved gives different principles and methods of prophylaxis. 1) Nidan parivarjan - to avoid the known causes of disease e.g. avoid drinking contaminated water to avoid diarrhea, 56 Pages 55 - 58cholera, Jaundice, fever etc. 2) Dinacharya - Daily regimen. When to get up in the morning, mouth cleaning, putting oil in the nose and ears, exercise, proper bath, breakfast, lunch, dinner, attending natural calls in time, sex life etc. 3) Ritucharya - Seasonal regimen. This gives extensive details of the ways to cope up with the seasonal, climatic variations and how to stay healthy. 4)Proper wholesome food - Ayurveda emphatically says every human is a product of food and so is the disease. Diet if observed properly will work better to prevent disease. Food, if used wrongly will cause diseases. 5) Viruddha Ahar - Incompatible food is a wrong food, says Ayurveda. This can produce severe diseases like impotency, blindness, Ascitis, Erysepalus, Hyperacidity, diseased progeny and even death in some cases. To prevent all these possibilities some specific method is given by Ayurved, e.g., \"One should practice the Viruddha Ahar in smaller amounts for longer time to train the body to digest it. Once a person gets accustomed to it, he will not suffer from ill effects\" This seems to be same principle as of prophylaxis vaccine. Here the food is advised and all the other poisons etc are also permitted with judicious supervision of expert Vaidya. Germs or bacteria and viruses are not subject of Ayurveda. 6) Shodhana Kriya - For preventing the Kalaj Rog (seasonal diseases) this is the effective management. Seasonal provocation of three doshas in the body cause diseases To avoid the Vata disease Basti kriya is advocated by by Virechan in Sharad Ritu. Diseases of blood can be prevented by timely blood letting i.e. Rakta-mokshana and purgation in Sharad Ritu. 7) Rasayan Management - This is a unique contribution of Ayurveda to the world of medicine. This concept is similar to chemo prophylaxis i.e. specific medication base on the drug used in the same disease as per doctor's advice. Milk is the best Rasayan for all, \"Inoculate yourself.\" Take small amount of milks or ghee each day; gradually increase the dose to build up your power of digestion. However change the prophylactic regimen if your Agni refuses to digest it. 8) Agni deepan - There are appetizers which provoke the digestive power and strengthen the digestive system. If the Agni is strong and 'Sama' (optimum functioning) all the diseases are prevented, says Charak Samhita. 9) Prakriti and preventive foods for disease proneness--. Body constitution is very important factor in preventive regimen. Food which has opposite qualities to the Dosha in the body is good prevention against the dominant diseases. e.g. Vata Prakriti person should eat sweet, salty, sour tasting, hot, unctuous, smooth, heavy food, like wheat, milk, curd, jaggary, sweets, fleshy food etc., Kapha Prakriti should eat pungent, bitter and astringent tasting, hot, light, dry food. Pitta Prakriti should eat sweet, bitter and astringent tasting, cold, soft, heavy, unctuous food like ghee, bitter gourd, gram flour, sugar, jaggary etc. These habits, once they become part of one's life, prevent the onset of vitiation of Dosha. 10) Avastha Sapeksh disease: These pertain to a particular stage in life like puberty, pregnancy, post partum, lactating period etc are crucial stages in woman's life. Each stage produces some complications. Ayurved advocates \"Charya\" i.e. a regular performance of all wholesome deeds or customs. For puberty Rajaswala Charya, for pregnancy 'Garbini Charya vidhi etc. For instance, pre menstrual spasms, which trouble the young and old women alike, can be prevented if one avoids acidic, pungent and cold foods. Also to be avoided are garlic, curds, bean sprouts and sweets prepared with colostrum of cow. 11) Manas Rog - Psychological disorders can be prevented by observing 'Sadvritta' (Shastric code of right conduct). Since \u00c2yurveda never dissociates body from the mind, many bodily regimens really prevent manas diseases. For instance, properly oleated body (both internally as well externally) seldom gets diseases like Alzheimer or Parkinson. (Which are also called dry brain diseases) 12) Sankramaka Rog - can be prevented by avoiding the exposure and taking particular prophylactic measures. We have indicated this point while dealing with Rasayan. If there is a spread of conjunctivitis we require local hygiene and drugs that can be used with proper guidance. If the fever is in society one should try fasting (langhana) for one or two days and can use medicines like Sudarshan Churna or other medication with proper consultation. 13) Epidemic diseases - We can observe common preventative remedies like boiled water for drinking and specific prophylaxis as recommended by Vaidya. 14) Kulaj Rog - Preventive methods and medicines are 57 Pages 55 - 58available for safe guard against many congenital diseases. Some preventives are given to both husband and wife before conception. By this way total prevention may or may not be possible but we can delay the onset in the pregnancy to a great extent. STRONG POINTS OF \u00c2YURVEDA IN PREVENTIVE CARE 1) Scope of prevention is very large. 2) No side or after ill effects 3) Gives importance to food regimen - Charya, Sex, Sleep 4) Takes care of Mind and its disease. 5) Rasayan practices can be safely promoted. 6) Individuals can participate in their own health management, instead of being only passive patients. Universal Immunization program of Govt. of India has only 30 to 40 % coverage in this land of over 1 billion population. Efficacy, safety and availability of preventive measures in the form of vaccines come under doubt now and then. Using methods and principles of Ayurveda, we can prevent the diseases and contain the sufferings of the large population in India. With children and mothers dying from mal nutrition and diseases, prophylactic methods of Ayurveda can change maternal health scenario in the country. It is high time to look into the knowledge resources of our traditional medical systems, and to be made available to the people in our society though a visionary policy reforms and committed political will.
