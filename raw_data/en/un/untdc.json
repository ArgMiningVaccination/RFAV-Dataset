He pointed out that conversion is not just for atheists but also for those who already consider themselves Christians: \"No one can say: I'm fine. Not true, it would be pre- sumptuous, because we must always be converted\". The term 'conversion' is used in many di fferent contexts and in a variety of ways. No single de finition can be o ffered which could do justice to the polysemic and dynamic nature of this concept. Meanwhile, we are faced with a theological concept which each and every theologian will somehow have to come to terms with. This has also been the case for Professor Henk Witte, who held the Xaverius Chair for Ignatian Spirituality and Theology at the School for Catholic Theology at Tilburg University, the Netherlands, between 2011 and 2016. Admittedly, Witte has never written a full- fledged study on 'conversion' , but he did not cease to touch upon the subject from various di fferent angles. For those who study his work more closely, the concept of 'conversion' is quietly present as a leitmotiv throughout his theological writings, from the very first years to the most recent period. In 1986, when Witte was finishing his doctoral dissertation on the notion of the hierarchia veritatum , the hierarchy of truths in the decrees of the Second Vatican Council, he came across the word when studying the conciliar inter- ventions of Archbishop Eugene Louis D'Souza. 1 The young systematic theo logian seems to have been triggered by D'Souza's focus on the conversio cordis . In his dissertation, Witte devoted some re flections to the term, clarify- ing that a true conversion of the heart involved an interplay of personal modesty, and the avoidance of 'hypertrophia' , the over-accentuation or exag- geration of dogmatic truths. Conversion then could be de fined as a capacity for reflection (without 'overdue rationalizations' , Witte warned in his early work), and above all as a discernment that leads to a certain balance and nuance. 1 H. Witte, \"Alnaargelang hun band met het fundament van het verschillend is\". Wording van waarheden van Vaticanum II, (Tilburg: Tilburg University Erp And Schelkens Consequently, he considered conversion to be related to renunciation and humility, rather than to self-manifestation or certainty. This, in a nutshell, determined his lifelong theological agenda, and those who are acquainted with Henk Witte and his work, will recognize how well these words fit not only his theology, but also his personality. But there is more to it: these early statements by Witte on the notion of con- version were placed well within an integral part of his interest in the ecclesial reforms of the Second Vatican Council, an interest that would prove a lasting one throughout the development of his theology. Soon, not only the aspect of individual or spiritual conversion would become more prominent, he also developed a growing awareness of the importance of conversion as an eccle- sial process. The complexity of conciliar renewal became a key element in Witte's theological interests and it combined rather well with his commitment to ecumenical dialogue. His colleagues in networks such as the Klingenthal Group and the Peter and Paul Seminar praise him for showing theological sensibility and prudence, important qualities in a dialogue partner. Anyone who reads the many studies Henk Witte has published on ecumenical issues, will be struck by the diligent and receptive approach of non-Roman-Catholic Christianity they re flect. As an ecumenical theologian, Witte has shown him- self to be quite aware of the fact that in interdenominational and interfaith dialogue, the notion of 'conversion' often has connotations of proselytism. Very recently, he published a study on the 'apostolate of conversion' by Dutch Catholics who would later become pioneers of ecumenism, such as Cardinal Johannes Willebrands, focusing precisely on this tension. Again, it became clear that a distinction should be made between individual and ecclesial con- version. In his recent writings, he frequently returns to the topic of conversion from his new interest in Ignatian spirituality and theology. The Dutch term 'omvorming' - perhaps best translated as 'spiritual transformation' - played a central role in Witte's inaugural lecture for the Chair of Ignatian Spirituality at Tilburg University. 2 In it, he spoke about conversion as a 'displacement of the centre of consciousness from the self to the penetrating and all-encompassing secret of God'. Rereading these words after hearing Pope Francis's appeal, on December 6 of 2015, that \"we must always be converted\" , Witte's enthusiasm about Pope Francis's call for a pastoral conversion of the Church and his stress on the Ignatian principle of discernment can hardly come as a surprise. We may perhaps close the circle, by referring to Witte's valedictory address in 2016. Focusing on the Ignatian 'way of doing things' as a source of inspiration 2 H. Witte, AMDG Een Tilburg University Press, 2011).3 The Church and the Challenge of Renewal for understanding Vatican II, he touched upon the theme of conversion once more, this time linking pope Francis's call for a decentered church with the Ignatian principle of the modus operandi. Such a decentered church, he insisted, demands, in the very first place 'a conversion, a new way of doing things'. 3 The contributions in this volume have been written in honour of Henk Witte. By now, we hope to have made clear why this Festschrift is not merely a collection of articles of colleagues and friends, a liber amicorum , although it certainly is that too: a book written by his colleagues and friends. It has how- ever also been constructed (inspired by the idea of unity in diversity) around one single theme, which runs through the various theological fields in which Henk has been active: Systematic Theology, Vatican II-Studies, Ecumenism, and Ignatian Studies. Precisely these four areas form the framework within which the seventeen contributions to this book are placed. Together, they o ffer a kaleidoscopic view of the notion of conversion, with a focus on the Church and the churches, and the variety of conversions that occur between and in the churches. In Part One of this volume, a set of five contributions approaches the phe- nomenon of conversion from a variety of systematic and historical-theological perspectives. The section opens with an article by Nico Schreurs on the conver- sion experience of the first disciples. The biblical account of the disciples' conversion is intimately linked with the experience of Christ's resurrection. Through the lens of the theology of Edward Schillebeeckx, Schreurs investi- gates the reception, critique and sustainability of Schillebeeckx's hypothesis of the disciples' conversion in connection with the Easter appearances and the resurrection creed. Next, Mathias Smalbrugge studies Augustine's account of conversion in terms of dei fication, and he discusses the image-character of the theme of dei fication. Are we able to come nearer to God once we remember what we are, i.e. His image? Or are we completely dependent on His interven- tion, and will there always be this unbridgeable di fference between God and man, implying that dei fication is nothing other than God's grace that allows us to be renewed? These questions try to find a balance between conversion as the work of God's grace and the work of human imagination. Human creativity is also the key theme in the third essay by Wiel Logister. In it, he focuses on the medieval period by discussing the problem of the relationship between con- version and providence in the writings of Dante Alighieri. Through a close reading of Dante's texts, he stresses the role of Christ in bringing to light what 3 H. Witte, De ignatiaanse 'manier van University Press, 2016), 14.4 Van Erp And Schelkens human creativity really is. After this chapter, Marcel Sarot in turn o ffers a thor- ough theological investigation into the idea of conversion after death. The notion of post-mortem conversion is studied in confrontation with patristic voices such as Augustine and Clement of Alexandria, and contemporary theo- logians like Gavin D'Costa. Stephan van Erp's contribution, the final article in the systematic section, examines the conversion of David Jones, a British sol- dier in the First World War, and a painter and a poet. This o ffers the occasion for re flections on the sacramental aspects of conversion, by showing that a work of art follows the basic sacramental structure of every human conversion. Like art, conversion has at its heart the discovery that the convert is not search- ing but being found, a discovery that turns the convert into a sign of that which makes a sacrament possible. Grounded in the experience that God is active in our world and invites or even tempts the Christian toward conversion, the Ignatian tradition has played a central role in the development of theological thought and ecclesial praxis regarding conversion. From this angle, Part Two of this volume contains four studies focusing on the Jesuit tradition. After Van Erp's focus on the impor- tance of the arts and imagination, Arnold Smeets continues this approach with a study investigating the Jesuit architecture of the Sant'Andrea al Quirinale, and its connection with the sixteenth-century Roman novitiate house of the Society of Jesus. Smeets approaches the issue of conversion through the lens of Gregory the Great's experience of conversion as temptation. This is followed by a study on the three stages of conversion of the British Victorian poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, by Joep Van Gennip. Here too, the interest lies in the inte- gration of Jesuit spirituality and the notion of conversion. Finally, this section contains two studies on the calls to conversion by Pope Francis, one written by Catherine Cli fford on mission and one by Eugene Du ffy on Church reform, both highlighting the importance of conversion on both the individual level and on the ecclesial need to turn away from spiritual worldliness. The reform and conversion proposed by Pope Francis, however, not only refers to the Ignatian principle of discernment, it is also deeply rooted in the reforms decreed by the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, which is the cen- tral theme in Part Three of this volume. At the heart of the conciliar legacy, as is underlined by the contribution of Erik Borgman, was the Catholic Church's rediscovery of contemporary society and its willingness to enter into dialogue with the modern world. Borgman emphasizes the importance of theology for this continuing conversion of the Church. Within this renewed relationship of Church and world, Christians are challenged to an ongoing theological conver- sion, especially on the level of ecclesial structures. This theme is developed further in the Thomas Green's contribution, which studies the renewal of 5 The Church and the Challenge of Renewal ecclesiology from the angle of the canonical implications and possibilities opened by Vatican II. The part on conciliar renewal closes with an article by Jos Moons studying the 'rediscovery' of the Holy Spirit in Lumen gentium . Through an in-depth analysis of conciliar and preconciliar magisterial discourse in the field of pneumatology, the author illustrates that Vatican II did in fact imply a 'pneumatological conversion' , embedded in a broader turnabout on the level of both Christology and ecclesiology. With Part Four, this volume concludes with a section devoted to the study of conversion from an ecumenical perspective. Here too, the link with the renew- als of Vatican II is evident: the fundamental insight of this part lies with the fact that the ecclesiological turnabout of the latest council did not only imply a renewal of ecclesial structures but also a combined awareness of the sinfulness of the church and its members and the need for a turn toward dialogue. In this context, the notion of 'conversion' especially appears as problematic, in that it may include conversion from one confession to another. Clearly, a tension is felt between the 'work of conversion' on the one hand and 'ecumenical dia- logue' on the other. The latter tension and the way in which the so-called 'apostolate of conversions' developed before and during Vatican II is the object of a careful study by Peter De Mey. This is followed by a contribution by Annemarie Mayer on the way in which conversion from one church to another poses an ongoing problem and challenge to Christian life in the postconciliar ecumenical movement. She shows how conversion as a key ecumenical con- cept remains a 'hot potato' because the di fferent meanings of conversion (i.e. moving from one church to another and the fundamental principle of conver- sion to God) are not su fficiently distinguished, and because of the abuses that tend towards proselytism among Christians. The third essay in the final part is by Adelbert Denaux, who develops the interrelatedness of the notions of sin- fulness and conversion within the perspective of the Anglican Roman Catholic Dialogue, in particular in its recent phase, ARCIC III. The closing essay was writ- ten by Andr\u00e9 Birmel\u00e9, who re flects on the 1991 Document of the Groupe des Dombes, on the conversion of the churches, and highlights the importance of conversion as an ecumenical theme. Together, these essays present an overview of the concept of 'conversion' in the Christian churches and the Roman Catholic Church in particular. Through detailed analyses of the developments before, during and after the Second Vatican Council, and of the challenges in ecumenical dialogue, the complex- ity and richness of the concept will become clearer. Most of all, however, the authors' approaches and scholarship do justice to the meticulous work of Henk Witte. As a teacher, he has been an inspiration to younger genera- tions of theologians for whom the language of traditional Christian theology 6 Van Erp And Schelkens has become increasingly more di fficult to understand. Witte has been at his best when building bridges between the language and worldview of a global Church and the life world of students in a secular culture. Building bridges has also characterised his theology, not only thematically in his ecumenical studies, but also stylistically, in his approach and understanding of di fferent factions and sensibilities within the churches. The fact that he, not being a Jesuit himself, became the first holder of the new chair of Ignatian spirituality and theology in the Netherlands, is clearly a sign of the trust that people have had in the reliability and thoughtfulness of his theology. With this volume, the editors and the authors are honouring Henk Witte's work. Like conversion, it is work in progress, motivated by the ongoing challenge of renewal. To conclude, we would like to thank those who have helped the project of this book to come to a fruitful close. We are much indebted to the members of the editorial board of Brill's Series in Catholic Theology for the time and e ffort they spent in reading and commenting the manuscript. The book has improved considerably thanks to them. We also owe much credit to the editorial sta ff at Brill, not in the least to Mirjam Elbers, who guided us through the whole pro- cess with a keen sense of e fficiency and a strong commitment to publishing high quality books. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to Geo ffrey Turner, for his willingness and diligence to reread and revise the chapters in this volume.7 The Church and the Challenge of Renewal Part 1 Systematic Theological Perspectives 8 Van Erp And Schelkens9 Schillebeeckx 's View of the Resurrection of Christ Chapter 1 The 'Conversion' of the Disciples: Schillebeeckx's View of the Resurrection of Christ Nico Schreurs In this contribution I shall deal with an understanding of conversion which will probably di ffer from the way in which many of the authors in this book - devoted to my colleague Henk Witte, with whom I once had the pleasure of sharing an o ffice - will treat the subject. I would like to investigate what role conversion, or perhaps rather: being converted, plays in Edward Schillebeeckx's theology of Christ's resurrection. The heading Schillebeeckx used to introduce his reconstruction of the Easter experience of Jesus's disciples runs as follows: 'The Easter experience: being converted, at Jesus's initiative, to Jesus as the Christ - Salvation found conclusively in Jesus'. 1 In this title Schillebeeckx was trying to express almost all the signi ficant features of his view of this conver- sion. One element, however, is missing: there is no mention of the people who are being converted: Jesus's disciples. It may seem strange to speak of the disciples 'being converted'. Were they not Jesus's followers from the beginning? Why should they, who left every- thing to follow Jesus, be in need of conversion? At this point it becomes clear that Schillebeeckx was using the word 'conversion' to denote something not implied in the common use of the word. In general, conversion involves a radical change of life, as in the case of someone who changes from one reli- gion to another. In his inaugural lecture, our mutual colleague Professor Rein Nauta chose the apostle Paul as a model for his argument. He concluded that conversion is motivated by the recognition of failure, sin, guilt and shame. Conversion has the e ffect, amongst other things, of a radical reconstruction of one's life and becoming a new person. 2 In recent history, conversion was primarily connected with missionary activity in order to convert the heathen or non-Christians to Christianity. This is the transitive sense of the verb. But 1 E. Schillebeeckx, Jezus, het verhaal van een levende (Baarn: Nelissen, 1974, 3rd enlarged edition 1975), 310. I refer to his book as JN. The standard English translation is: E. Schillebeeckx, Jesus. An Experiment in Christology , in: The Collected Works of Edward Schillebeeckx , vol. VI (London: Bloomsbury T&T Clark, 2014), 347. I refer to this book as: JE. - I would like to thank Ted Schoof o.p. for his encouragement and support during the composition of this study. 2 R. Nauta, Over bekering conversion can also refer to an act of the convert himself. In that case it may start from a situation of stress or it can be a reaction to an urgent appeal and may entail the personal decision to opt for a radical new orientation in life and moral conduct. 3 In his landmark study, A Secular Age , Charles Taylor describes conversion as the transformation of a person beyond the usual range of our experience. He calls this: making contact with the fullness of being. Individually, this kind of conversion may reach this fullness by contemplation resulting in a mystical encounter or vision, by experiencing utmost negativity or by engaging in a moment of life-changing intensity. Collectively, conversion may lead converts to adopt the transformation of their way of life into a totally new paradigm. 4 Transformations of this intense and all-encompassing kind run the risk of cre- ating an attitude of fanatical absolutism, as might be seen in cases of conversion to fundamentalist forms of religion and, in extreme cases, to jihadism. Taylor stresses, therefore, that in the process of conversion the role of experience should be connected with the context - i.e. the event or the person - that causes the conversion. Experience is not exclusively something on the part of the subject, the person who is being converted, but is also in fluenced by the circumstances in which the conversion takes place. In this article I want to describe the part conversion plays in Schillebeeckx's most in fluential book: Jesus. An Experiment in Christology. In particular, I shall try to reconstruct the part conversion plays in what he called the Easter- experience of the disciples. In a first step I shall analyse his understanding of conversion in the pre-Easter relationship of the disciples with their master; next I shall reconstruct, describe, and analyse the part the conversion of the disciples plays in the origin and development of the early Christian communi- ties' confession of Jesus's resurrection; thirdly, I shall examine the reception, critique and sustainability of Schillebeeckx's hypothesis of the disciples' con- version in connection with the Easter appearances and the resurrection creed; and I shall end with some conclusions. 1 The Conversion of the Disciples as Followers of Jesus In his book Jesus Schillebeeckx wanted to tell the story in such a way that the message of salvation in Jesus of Nazareth and the belief in this Jesus as the 3 J. Werbick, \"Bekehrung, 4 C. Taylor, A Secular Age (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2007), 728-737.11 Schillebeeckx 's View of the Resurrection of Christ Christ that arises from that message can be meaningful for people today ( JE, 16). Although not explicitly apologetic, the aim of the book was to search \"(in faith and in a critical spirit) for possible signs in the historical Jesus that might direct the human quest for 'salvation'\" ( JE, 84). To this end he used the histori- cal-critical method, grounding his choice in a balanced discussion of the schools of exegesis current at the time, and drawing on a set of criteria for identifying the historical Jesus. ( JE, part I). In part II of his book he therefore committed himself to the task of a careful historical reconstruction, directed at the message and praxis of salvation, proclaimed and lived by Jesus until his death on the cross and written down by four evangelists in di fferent text layers, redactions and implicit theological views. At the end of the second and third parts, he concentrated on the reconstruction of the continuation of this salva- tion after Jesus's death. His disciples played an important part in both histories, the story of Jesus before and after his death. Schillebeeckx repeatedly described their story as a transformation of their belief in Jesus before his death into their Christological confession of Jesus as the Christ. ( JE, 193). First I shall pay atten- tion to the companionship of Jesus and the disciples during Jesus's lifetime. Schillebeeckx started by analysing exegetically the beginning of Jesus's proclamation of God's coming salvation. One would expect that a lengthy investigation of the expected reaction to that proclamation would follow immediately: Jesus's proclamation of the gospel, the good tidings, was at the same time a call for metanoia , for a radical conversion towards a new life. Schillebeeckx, however, undertook this investigation only at the end of his full explanation of Jesus's message of God's Kingdom and his praxis of liberation, when he deals with the 'pre-Easter fellowship with Jesus and disciples who 'go after him' ( JE, 193). In this section Schillebeeckx examined carefully and at length what conver- sion meant in this context. Earlier he had in fact mentioned conversion when he described John's baptism. But in Schillebeeckx's view, the conversion Jesus asked of his followers was quite di fferent. As an apocalyptic prophet, John pro- claimed the judgment that was on hand from which there is no escape because of the evil perpetrated by his audience. He announced a baptism of repen- tance as a condition for the forgiveness of their sins (Lk. 3,3). The way in which John is introduced in what Schillebeeckx identi fied as the Q text was similar to Mark's introduction of Jesus's preaching: a call for conversion ( metanoia; meta- noeite ) in view God's Kingdom (Mt. 3,2; Mk. 1,15). There were, however, two main di fferences between John and Jesus: whereas John o ffered a baptism as a sign of new life (Mt. 3,11), Jesus did not make baptism a condi- tion for entering the Kingdom of God and his preaching was not focused on the repentance for sins but rather on the message of an euaggelion . What, then, 12 Schreurs was it that, in Schillebeeckx's section on the pre-Easter fellowship of his disci- ples, Jesus asked from his followers; what was the meaning of his call for metanoia ? Was metanoia the same as conversion? Schillebeeckx explicitly compared the stereotyped scheme by which the calling of the disciples was described in the Synoptic Gospels with conversion in late Judaism to Israel's God ( JE, 197). The analogy with Jewish parallels is a main feature of his book Jesus . Elements in common were: abandoning one's possessions and forsaking family and home in order to follow God uncondition- ally. A radically new element, however, was the conversion to Jesus ( JE, 199). Schillebeeckx quali fied this conversion to Jesus as an eschatological metanoia and called it 'an authentic conversion' ( JE, 199). It was a religious conversion in as far as it made people turn away from the salvi fic scheme of the Jewish law, and by following Jesus they acknowledged that God's still-to-come rule had become a reality already present ( JE, 199). Strictly speaking, the conversion to Jesus was a conversion to God 'on the authority of Jesus' , because conversion to Jesus with a truly soteriological e ffect was only possible after Easter ( JE, 200). Conversion as used by Schillebeeckx in his analysis of Jesus's pre-Easter fel- lowship, involved a complete turn-about, in which there was no distinction between ordinary and perfect followers. There was no question that it was sin or an immoral life that prompted a conversion. The story of the rich young man (Mt. 19, 16-22) showed that he did not fail to keep the commandments, but was reluctant to give up his possessions to follow Jesus. None of the tradi- tional aspects of reconciliation, such as the confession of sins, repentance and giving satisfaction, 5 were needed. In fact, this kind of conversion was not a form of reconciliation or conversion at all. It was the readiness to transform one's life completely in order to join the fellowship of Jesus. This conversion was not in the first place an act inspired by human decisions, but in the end an act of divine grace, announced by Jesus in his preaching of the coming Kingdom of God, whose cause is the cause of mankind; in other words: salvation imparted by God ('Heil van Godswege'). 6 5 The traditional In his analysis of Jesus's pre-Easter life, Schillebeeckx already stressed the soteriological implications of the fellowship of Jesus. When Walter Kasper in his review of Schillebeeckx's Jesus said he missed the soteriology in the systematic re flection, he probably meant a classical, traditional soteriology, which included Christ's work of salvation in the sense of the Chalcedon dogma. W. Kasper, \"Liberale Christologie: 13 Schillebeeckx 's View of the Resurrection of Christ The consequences of the conversion of Jesus's followers were, first and fore- most, participation in God's eschatological plan of salvation, then the mandate to commit oneself to preaching the Kingdom of God that was at hand, and finally the obligation to be loyal to Jesus, their master or 'team leader' ( JE, 201), even to su ffer martyrdom in the service of God's Kingdom ( JE, 201-202). That is why, in Mark's version of the passion story, the fact that the disciples pan- icked and abandoned Jesus at his arrest was taken so seriously by Schillebeeckx. Leaving Jesus and reneging on their discipleship constituted, even more than Jesus's death, a breach in the sharing of Jesus's life and message and that demanded a new conversion. 2 Conversion and the Easter Experience of the Disciples Conversion is the 'working hypothesis' ( JE, 348) with the help of which Schillebeeckx tried to reconstruct historically the events after Jesus's death. His aim was to get at the historical origins of what later the apostolic creed called Jesus's resurrection from the dead. Conversion is the key word with which Schillebeeckx hoped to establish a convincing historical reconstruction of what happened after Jesus died on the cross and was buried, and before the formal apostolic resurrection kerygma was established. Why did he choose this word to develop his unusual and untraditional view on the resurrection, the appearances and the sending of the Spirit, a view that was so unfamiliar that it has been attacked by (some) theologians? In his supplementary re flections on the resurrection, which were added to the third edition of the original Dutch book in order to prevent misunder- standing, Schillebeeckx pointed out two main disputed questions. First, there was the question whether Jesus's resurrection was exclusively an act of God, objecti fied in miraculous events and actions, or the outcome of purely subjec- tive re flection on and memory of Jesus's life and praxis that should be continued in the Christian community. He called this the dilemma between fideism and empiricism ( JE, 605-608). A second, minor question was whether resurrection is just the salvi fic dimension of Jesus's death. Conversion played an important role in the first dilemma, and I shall concentrate on that here. One may raise as a question: Why was Schillebeeckx forced to resort to the historical construction of a renewed conversion of the disciples? Why did he not follow the kerygma of the early Christian communities and re flect on the Soteriologie Schreurs stories of the empty tomb and the appearances of the living Christ to Peter and the other disciples as evidence of the resurrection? As far as I can see, he had a cluster of motives for not following the traditional paths. As for the empty tomb, he agreed with many exegetes at the time that this was a later local tradi- tion, and with systematic theologians that an empty tomb could not have been a basis for the acceptance of a resurrection from the dead ( JE, 304-313). 7 The reference to the appearances implied a more complicated question. In a lengthy and careful analysis of the way Jesus's appearances or manifestations after his death were treated in the Gospels and in Paul's letters ( JE, 315-329), he distinguished the speci fic redactions of the evangelists and of Paul. Only the Gospels of Luke and John contained detailed descriptions of Jesus's appear- ances, which were modelled after the Hellenistic rapture scheme ( JE, 312). He concluded that the manifestations of the risen one were \"as it were, an 'empty vessel'\" ( JE, 326), filled with the apostolic kerygma. This o fficial apostolic tradi- tion or kerygma conveyed the meaning of the Easter event by interpreting it for the growing (and meanwhile established) Church with special attention to the legitimation of the Church's missionary mandate ( JE, 323). According to him, the stories of the appearances, therefore, presupposed the existence of the early Christian communities. 8 That is why he denied that the appearances belonged to the earliest references to the risen Jesus ( JE, 321). The reality of the Easter event and the original Easter experience was, he concluded, indepen- dent of the traditions centred round the Jerusalem tomb and the appearance traditions ( JE, 363). Schillebeeckx tried to reconstruct this preceding Easter faith historically by means of the term conversion. Why did he turn to this conversion process, of which there was no mention in the Gospel texts nor in the later kerygmata or creeds? From the start, Schillebeeckx's Jesus was an attempt to get access to the life and praxis of the historical or earthly Jesus by using historical methods. To that 7 In his answer to some critical reviews of his Jesus books: E. on the Books Jesus and Christ , in: The Collected Works of Edward Schillebeeckx , vol. VIII (London: Bloomsbury T&T Clark, 2014), here referred to as IE) Schillebeeckx discussed at length Albert Descamps's views on the empty tomb ( IE, 74-7 7). He agreed with Descamps that by integrat- ing the story of the empty tomb into other Easter traditions the disappearance of Jesus's body might have had some special signi ficance to people of the time. 8 Schillebeeckx distinguished the event of the appearances and the later stories of these mani- festations. He did not deny the historicity of the encounters of Peter and the other disciples, but he did not agree with the view that these stories were evidence of Jesus factual, bodily resurrection ( JE, 307-308; IE, 75-76).15 Schillebeeckx 's View of the Resurrection of Christ end he analysed the movement Jesus had evoked. He distinguished several pre-Gospel traditions, like the Q source, and reconstructed what the redactors of the Gospels had added as their personal basic theology. He then went on to analyse the echoes of Jesus's life and praxis in four early Christian 'creedal trends' which eventually gave rise to the o fficial apostolic Easter kerygma. ( JE, 27-31). In this whole sequence of sources in which the Easter experience has been articulated, he singled out an event that according to him was at the basis of all later proclamations of Jesus as the cruci fied and risen one, an event that Schillebeeckx reconstructed as central to the conversion of the disciples that manifested itself in the form of an appearance vision ( JE, 357). What exactly did Schillebeeckx mean by conversion in the situation of the disciples after Jesus's death and burial? Let us first examine to what extent con- version in this new situation di ffered from the conversion Jesus asked from his followers during his lifetime. The fellowship of Jesus's followers did not entail forgiveness of sin. Conversion at that time implied a complete turn-about, a metanoia , which meant leaving behind kinship and possessions, as in the Jewish model of conversion, with the exception that the decisive new element was faith in Jesus. Compared with this pre-Easter conversion, the conversion model that he used to reconstruct what had happened after Jesus's death, had two new elements: there was now need for forgiveness, and moreover, faith in Jesus had become the Christological faith in Jesus as the Christ. A full description of the way Schillebeeckx used conversion as a means of depicting the Easter experience of the disciples should start with the descrip- tion of a more or less 'sinful state' that the disciples were in and from which they turned away. He found traces of such a sinful state, or to put it more mildly, an embarrassing situation that the disciples had manoeuvred themselves into when they abandoned their master at his arrest in the garden of Gethsemane. At various places in his book he alluded to this event 9 before actually making it a special topic as the opening paragraph of the section headed: \"The Christian story after Jesus's death: the kingdom of God takes on the appearance of Jesus Christ\" - a section he particularly pointed to as a an example of the compli- cated relationship of scholarly (in this case historical-critical) assessment and the irreducible identity of persons in history ( JE, 83-84). This proved to be true. His exegesis of the disciples' defection and even betrayal of Jesus was a careful, laborious and painstaking examination of the versions that the Synoptic Gospels and St. John o ffered of this event. Schillebeeckx stated that the versions of Matthew and Luke implied much less 9 E.g. when explaining the renewed need for a post-critical history ( JE, 58) or when discussing the consequences of the fellowship of Jesus's followers ( JE, 202).16 Schreurs an accusation of Peter and the other disciples than the one in Mark, even to the point that they did not mention the general flight of the disciples. It was mainly the Gospel of Mark that, in accordance with the theological standpoint of his redaction in the whole Gospel, pointed out the weakness of the disciples and their inability to rightly understand Jesus, and finally their flight and defection. But this exegetical form- and redaction-critical analysis of the Markan tradi- tion was by no means easy. Schillebeeckx was even forced to accept Peter's denial as a separate, independent tradition added by Mark ( JE, 294; 296; 297). All the same, he laid much stress on the betrayal of all disciples as part of his conversion theory. He had to admit that it was mainly a theologically biased and exaggerated redaction by Mark of the general defection, and that this rested on a 'very flimsy basis' ( JE, 298). Nevertheless he finally came to the conclusion that all the disciples stopped following Jesus at his arrest ( JE 294- 295). This was perfectly in line with his argument that this failure of the disciples' faith ( oligopistia - a general theme in Mark's Gospel) provided the basis for their potential conversion ( JE, 296). The actual conversion of the disciples after Jesus's death was, in Schille- beeckx's view, the experience of being forgiven at the initiative of the living Jesus. The outcome of this experience of forgiveness was that the disciples linked their belief in the earthly pre-Easter Jesus with their post-Easter experi- ence of Jesus as the Christ and that they reassembled as a group, at the example of Peter ( JE, 347-368). Was this a usual concept of conversion, we may well ask, especially when we compare it with the characteristics of the metanoia conver- sion we discussed previously and with what people traditionally understand by conversion? The reconstruction of the original Easter experience of the disciples still fol- lowed the model of Jewish conversion, as Schillebeeckx has done earlier. This Jewish model essentially followed the structure of the conversion of a gentile to the Jewish religion, but in this procedure no forgiveness was involved and there was no question of apostasy. It was a conversion in a commonly known fashion: a change of religion. Schillebeeckx, however, in his analysis of the dis- ciples' conversion as the historically earliest Easter experience, pointed to yet another element of the Jewish model: illumination, the bright light which accompanied the vision of God revealing himself ( JE, 450-351). Paul's Damascus conversion was structured after this example ( JE, 329-345). Schille- beeckx called this a disclosure experience ( JE, 354, 357 cf. 592), drawing on his familiarity with analytical philosophy. This illumination, the light in which the disciples saw Jesus after his death, is not directly mentioned in the New Testament, just as, for that matter, virtually no conversion terminology can be traced in its traditional Easter texts. But just as the account of the story of 17 Schillebeeckx 's View of the Resurrection of Christ Paul's conversion evolved from a vision of light to a legitimation of his mission to the gentiles, so Schillebeeckx assumed a visual light element in the conver- sion of the disciples as well. In this light they could, after Jesus's death which enabled them to survey the totality of Jesus's life and recognize this completed life as God's revelation in Jesus of Nazareth, explicitly express their Christological confession of Jesus as the Christ, the de finite salvation-in-Jesus imparted by God ( JE, 354; 599). Reviewing the elements of Schillebeeckx's understanding and use of the term 'conversion' , it strikes me that this concept is not so much one model, but rather a combination of di fferent processes and corresponding models. First, there is the model of confession and forgiveness. The disciples abandoned and betrayed their master. This was a serious breach of their faith in Jesus whom they had followed, but even according to Schillebeeckx, it was not a total lapse of faith, or apostasy ( JE, 354). In the confession model, the conditions for receiving forgiveness are the confession of guilt, repentance of the wrongdoing and rendering satisfaction. In Schillebeeckx's use of the conversion model the grace of forgiveness was not explicitly linked to these conditions: forgiveness was indeed a divine grace. Therefore, the process he described bears more resemblance to the model of enlightenment or disclosure. The Easter experi- ence of the disciples was to recognize the man they had followed, whom they had turned away from and who had died at the cross, as the living Christ who had o ffered them the grace of forgiveness. Even a third model could be distin- guished if one considers the Easter experience, as Schillebeeckx expressly did, as a call for the reassembly of the scattered disciples. This call renewed the appeal to start a new life, as the metanoia appeal did, but now in the commu- nity of the cruci fied and risen one. There is room for discussion as to whether in this sequence the term conver- sion is always used adequately. It certainly is a very complex denominator for what Schillebeeckx wanted to present as the original Easter event. Now, I think, it will be well to examine a few critics of his hypothesis. 3 The Hypothesis of Conversion as the Original Easter Experience Criticized and Defended In his Interim Report , Schillebeeckx defended his view on conversion, as he did in the supplementary re flections that were added to the third Dutch edition of Jesus and are integrated into part four as part of the Christological problem. In his discussion with the Belgian exegete Albert Descamps he stressed that the conversion of the disciples is a historically determinable fact ( IE, 66; cf. JE 348) 18 Schreurs as opposed to the resurrection itself that was a meta-empirical and meta-his- torical, eschatological reality, an event that without an experiential basis was 'non-existent' for us ( JE, 348). For Schillebeeckx the conversion process was an all-encompassing experience with a mainly cognitive aspect, \"namely the experience of the new (pneumatic or spiritual) presence of the risen Jesus in the regrouped community\" ( IE, 69). This conversion process, which included the sending of the Spirit, the constitution of the Church and even \"baptism with Holy Spirit by the Lamb\" ( IE, 68), was for him the key element why he chose to approach the Easter event through conversion ( IE, 69). The discussion with Descamps in the Interim Report concerned mainly the difference between conversion and the appearances. For Schillebeeckx these two were, as we have seen, not identical. While discussing Descamps's critique (IE, 63-78), 10 he stated that conversion was mainly a cognitive and emotive happening, whereas appearances were mainly visual. The appearances of the risen Jesus to Peter and other followers implied that Jesus has been seen or, in the technical term, has shown himself, a terminology that in his view belonged to a later phase in the development of the Easter faith ( IE, 69, note 43). Historically, conversion was the first experience of the living and forgiving Jesus. But this did not imply that for Schillebeeckx the appearances were not an important factor. He did not deny that shortly after Jesus's death some people claimed to have seen Jesus. He even conceded that the parallels he ascertained between Old Testament reports of revelatory visions in the Jewish conversion model, such as the visit of Abraham's three guests, and visionary elements of the Easter experiences, were not always merely literary analogies and might also be the accounts of historical events. He even acknowledged that the dis- ciples' conversion experience took place in the form of an appearance ( JE, 357). Nevertheless, in his view the visual element was not the main point ( IE, 70). The visual - by which he meant that which characterizes the appearances - was \"never a source of kerygma, but merely a medium for receiving and artic- 10 A.L. Descamps wrote an on the whole 212-223. Although he had a high esteem for the work, Descamps found it too ambitious. His main objection against what he called Schillebeeckx's deduction of the conversion of the disciples as the original Easter experience (deduction, because there was no written evidence in the New Testament texts) was that if this at all preceded the stories of the empty tomb and the appearances of Jesus, it would soon be overtaken by those two well documented stories (220). In other words: although Descamps thought that the conversion hypothesis was well grounded and compatible with the faith in the resurrection, he opposed the order in which Schillebeeckx placed the various events and traditions of the Easter message in his historical-genetic research (221). I shall return to this criticism later.19 Schillebeeckx 's View of the Resurrection of Christ ulating a revelation\" ( IE, 69, note 43). The di fference between conversion and appearances could be characterized by an image that Schillebeeckx used in his analysis of the three accounts of Paul's conversion: he called Paul's Damascus vision (the visual element) the vertical, and the various actual accounts of Paul's conversion, the horizontal scheme ( JE, 331). This discussion between Descamps and Schillebeeckx about conversion versus appearances is crucial. Descamps called Schillebeeckx's conversion hypothesis a deduction, since it had no basis in the texts of the New Testament. For Schillebeeckx, on the contrary, the conversion model was the 'echo' of the very first foundational event in the Christian community ( JE, 349). Appearances with their mainly visual aspects had signi ficance only as 'a redundancy ele- ment' ( IE, 70) of the original conversion event, the essence of which is cognitive: the recognition of the new presence of the risen Jesus. Why did Schillebeeckx so consistently stress the originality of the conver- sion model compared with the vision of Jesus in the appearances? The main motive, I think, was an apologetic one, as was the whole enterprise of his book that aimed at critically looking into the intelligibility of the Christological belief in Jesus, especially with regard to its origin ( JE, 15-16). Behind many complicated exegetical analyses and systematic re flections his motive was to do away with much 'hocus-pocus' 11 that characterized the reports of the appearances of Jesus; he wanted to make Christian faith, especially faith in the cruci fied-and-risen one, accessible to human analysis ( JE, 607). Appearances entailed too much 'supernatural hocus-pocus' ( JE, 610). Schillebeeckx did not explicitly point it out, but the rapture scheme and the theios aner model, which Luke and John used in their Gospels as a matrix in their stories of the appearances, did contain a lot of such supernatural hocus- pocus, as when Jesus entered through closed doors like a phantom or other features of the rapture scheme. Luke did so, not to present a mythological interpretation, but to render the Christian message accessible and intelligible for his Greek readers. In the same way, Schillebeeckx wanted to make the transformation of the panic-stricken disciples after Jesus's arrest and death into men who boldly claimed that Jesus was alive and raised from the dead, psychologically intelligible for people of our time ( JE, 348). The conversion of the disciples was a revelatory grace from God, which 'is no \"sudden invasion 11 Schillebeeckx used this word in order to express what in his eyes was a too literal under- standing of metaphorical language. Cf. his contribution to the article by B. Westera, \"Opstanding of hocus-pocus? other words, no hocus pocus, but is e ffective in and through psychic realities and human experiences ( IE, 65). In the discussion with Descamps on the visual element of both conversion and appearances, Schillebeeckx openly confessed that he wanted to \"free this visual element from the heavy dogmatic signi ficance which some attach to it, namely of being the foundation of the whole of Christian faith\" ( IE, 71). By this he meant the fundamentalist position of a form of orthodoxy that for its artic- ulation of the resurrection faith only relied on the Gospel stories of the appearances, instead of acknowledging the historic process of human conver- sion experiences. This led in his opinion to the unreserved acceptance of supernatural intervention, magic and the often mentioned 'hocus pocus' (cf. IE, 11). This was the reason why in Jesus he mostly kept silent about the visual elements in the conversion process, although he frequently pointed out the analogy with the Jewish conversion model with its mystic vision of the light of God's law, and the fact that in the culture of that time visual phenomena and not only rational, cognitive elements were an usual choice ( IE, 70). The discussion with Descamps led to another result that sheds a new light on Schillebeeckx's conversion hypothesis. In order to get a clear picture of Schillebeeckx's view on the genesis and development of the Easter creed, Descamps enumerated the various stages in Schillebeeckx's reconstruction of the original Easter experience until the o fficial apostolic creed. He came to the following phases: the conversion experience, the identi fication of Jesus as the eschatological prophet, the four early Christian creeds of which only the most recent one, the 'Easter' Christology, elaborated the idea of resurrection for the first time, the expression of this in the images of the appearances, and finally the appearances stories which in the New Testament were placed anach- ronistically a few days after Jesus's death. 12 This reconstruction showed that Schillebeeckx's hypothesis of the conversion experience re flected his intention to postpone the idea of a physical resurrection as an expression of the Easter experience until a much later date than the o fficial teaching of the Church does. Descamps interpreted this intention as the outcome accepts this scheme as generally correct ( IE, 73, note 51).21 Schillebeeckx 's View of the Resurrection of Christ systematic, rather than exegetical interests. This systematic interest consists of the conviction that for modern people the inner, psychologically traceable pro- cess of conversion is a better, more acceptable sign of God's activity in human history. 13 Both Descamps and the German theologian Hans Kessler were con- vinced that Schillebeeckx's conversion theory was wholly compatible with orthodox faith, unlike other reviewers, like Walter Kasper and Werner L\u00f6ser, who accused him either of a reversion to the Protestant liberal theology or to the reduction of the resurrection faith to a minimum. 14 The impact of his conversion hypothesis on his resurrection theology as shown by Descamps, is con firmed by Schillebeeckx's own re flection on what he called the ambiguity of the term 'Easter experience' ( JE, 359-369). First, he reflected on what experience would mean in this case. The Easter experience was not a purely subjective phenomenon: Jesus himself was its source. Moreover, experience is not just a pre-linguistic item; it is always found in a language context from which it receives its articulation ( JE, 359). Conversion was the Christian interpretative element of what Schillebeeckx considered to be the real, historic experience ( ervaringswerkelijkheid , JN, 322), undergone by the disciples, and seen in the context of the Jewish conversion model. At the same time he also claimed that this was an experience of reality ( werke lijk- heidservaring , JN, 322), the reality of the new initiative of forgiveness by the living Jesus ( JE, 360). If conversion was the articulation of the Easter experience, it followed that the resurrection idea was not self-evidently the earliest and original expression or interpretation of this reality. Other interpretations were also possible, such as the coming of Christ as judge at the end of time in the so-called parousia Christology ( JE, 360-361). Here the sequence of successive stages of the Easter kerygma, enumerated by Descamps, proved to be relevant. Descamps assumed that in Schillebeeckx's genetic schema the parousia Christology preceded the Paschal Christology. This early Christian community did not have an explicit resurrection terminology. Obviously, here Schillebeeckx's view on resurrection 13 de conversion tel que le S. est un bien 'meilleur' signe de l'action divine\". At the same dogmatic or apologetic interest of Schillebeeckx's conversion hypothesis hinted H. Kessler, Sucht den Lebenden in IE, 23-30; 78-81.22 Schreurs was challenged. Although in answer to Descamps he stated that there was not just one homogeneous early Easter tradition succeeded by three others, but that there were more diverse early Christian communities at the same time that mutually in fluenced one another ( JE, 73-74), nevertheless he seemed to agree with Leo Bakker's reconstruction that it was a small step from the pre- Easter identi fication of Jesus as the eschatological prophet to the maranatha or parousia Christology of Jesus's coming at the end of time. 15 Bakker also questioned the self-evidence of the resurrection idea. In the Jewish context, the expectation of a resurrection in the present could not be presupposed. Schillebeeckx agreed with him in as far as his analysis of the non-apocalyptic late Jewish literature ( JE, 477-491) showed that the Christian idea of resurrec- tion \"di ffers radically from the notion of 'coming back alive to our world'\" ( JE, 362). To end this section I quote a passage in which Schillebeeckx connected the conversion model with its Jewish context. In this context the resurrection idea, in its traditional form as in the apostolic kerygma, was not yet self-evident: In the creedal a the first Christians] 'He is risen' the deter- mining factor is their recollection of Jesus's days on earth and their experience of salvation through conversion; but to express this reality in words the whole tradition of Judaic religious experience was almost as important ( JE, 486). Investigating the conversion model that Schillebeeckx used finally comes down to asking whether he could question e ffectively the self-evidence of the resurrection creed of the o fficial Church. Descamps considered as 'defensible' the thesis that the conversion experience preceded the image and terminology of the resurrection, and he thought that it was the most innovative contribu- tion that the book Jesus had brought about. 16 At the same time he and Kessler were convinced that they could prove that the exegetical basis of this conver- sion thesis was very weak if not non-existent. 17 What remains is that the 15 L. Bakker, \"Het oudtestamentisch tegoed van de christelijke here 88-90; Schillebeeckx declared that \"the reconstruction of my line of thought is more accurately [than Descamps] reproduced by Bakker\" , pour un grand nombre, la plus Toten , 191.23 Schillebeeckx 's View of the Resurrection of Christ conversion model has theological and apologetic value as mediation between the earthly Jesus and the o fficial apostolic resurrection creed. 4 Conclusion At the end of my contribution, I can now summarize the e ffect of Schillebeeckx's use of the model of conversion in his reconstruction of the Easter experience. Three elements are crucial here. First and foremost, Schillebeeckx used 'conversion' as a model to link the post-Easter experience of the disciples with their pre-Easter fellowship with the earthly Jesus, using elements of the Jewish conversion scheme. He did this in order to avoid using the concept and the images of the resurrection too early on. This way he created room for an understanding of God's new initia- tive after Jesus's death, which is more intelligible and acceptable for modern humanity. This working hypothesis was part of his hermeneutical approach to the historical Jesus and had a clearly apologetic intention. Conversion was not used here in the common sense, but was the expression of the forgiving and appealing encounter of the disciples with the living Jesus. As a human experi- ence it had a subjective, 'interiorizing' character that enabled Schillebeeckx to generalize what the disciples had gone through and to apply this to present- day Christians as well ( JE, 608). No \"hocus pocus, supernatural invasion, crude, na\u00efve realism\" ( JE, 315) were presupposed, as the images of the appearances suggested. Schillebeeckx's critical dealing with the empty tomb made it clear that resurrection was not the reanimation of a corpse. The eschatological char- acter of Jesus's physical resurrection was quite di fferent from the late Judaic apocalyptic notion ( JE, 306). 'An eschatological, bodily resurrection, theologi- cally speaking, has nothing to do with a corpse' ( JE, 308, note 17). This seems to pave the way for a modern understanding of the resurrection. Next, the model of conversion, as Schillebeeckx used it, was not a purely subjective interpretation of Jesus's life, as theologians such as Kasper and L\u00f6ser had feared. The creative and saving activity of Jesus's God presents itself on every page of Jesus . How did Schillebeeckx combine his historical, genetic approach with his theological faith in God's creative presence in the world? This was his own question right from the start of his project, which he de fined as searching for possible signs in the historical Jesus that referred to the saving action undertaken by God in this Jesus of Nazareth ( JE, 84). In the fourth part of his book, he returned explicitly to this question under the heading: 'God's saving action in history' ( JE, 589-597). There he distinguished two ways of speaking about the same reality: by using profane, e.g. historical language and 24 Schreurs by using religious language. They are not mutually exclusive as most of our contemporaries in Western Europe tend to assume. 18 For believers, human per- sons are as much 'beings of God' as they are autonomous, history-making persons. Being of God and being oneself are 'total aspects of one and the same reality' ( JE, 591). This means that when God acts in history as a source of salva- tion, as Schillebeeckx claimed he does, speci fically in Jesus, this is not an intervention in the normal course of history (supernatural hocus-pocus etc.), rather \"it is this so-called 'profane history' of God'\" ( JE, 595). The post-Easter conversion of the disciples could, therefore, be investigated with a purely historical approach and at the same time be dis- closed by the believer as an act of God and interpreted as well as expressed in religious language. Mind you: by believers . Seeing the conversion of the disci- ples not as something purely human and subjective, Schillebeeckx also asked for a conversion from secular contemporaries, a conversion in the common denotation of leaving one's former life-style and entering a new one. Does this mean that the whole enterprise of deducing from the New Testament texts on resurrection how a conversion might come about as a human reaction to Jesus's life and death has no real apologetic value? I would not say so. Schillebeeckx's (very well expounded) view on how God acts as an immanent force in the empirical world bridges the gap between an age in which faith in God was self-evident and our age of 'structural atheism'. 19 Finally the question ought to be raised: has Schillebeeckx's construction of a conversion as the original Easter experience been accepted? Reviewers who were sympathetic to his historical, genetic approach, such as Descamps and Kessler, have been unanimous in dismantling its exegetical basis. Descamps did so by leaving no room in the New Testament accounts for a separate phase of the experience of conversion and forgiveness and by systematically ques- tioning Schillebeeckx's distinction of four di fferent early creedal tendencies. Kessler showed that practically the only text in which the conversion terminol- ogy is used, Luke 22,31-32, belongs, according to many exegetes, to a tradition that did not know of Peter's denial of his master. From their traditional ortho- dox standpoint, Kasper and L\u00f6ser did not support Schillebeeckx's conversion theory. This theory has in fact not received much attention and hardly any fol- lowers. Even in Schillebeeckx's later work, the reference to the post-Easter 18 Cf. Taylor, A Secular Age , who calls them 'exclusivist humanists'. 19 JE, esp. 591-596. Cf. Taylor's e ffort to show that in our secular age too, a natural tendency towards transcendence can be demonstrated. 'Structural atheism' was used by Schille- beeckx's former colleague at the Theological Faculty of Nijmegen, Arend van Leeuwen.25 Schillebeeckx 's View of the Resurrection of Christ experience of the disciples as a conversion did not play a signi ficant role. In the last chapter of his Interim Report , where he had defended this reconstruction so eloquently, he already seemed to have forgotten his former plea for it as a working hypothesis: he did not even mention the word conversion when he confessed his belief in Jesus risen from the dead ( IE, 117-120). Perhaps he has recognized the exegetical weakness of his hypothesis. However, the fact that he kept describing resurrection belief as \"the recognition of the intrinsic and irre- vocable signi ficance of Jesus's proclamation of the Kingdom of God\" ( IE, 117) and thereby maintained one of the main arguments for putting forward his hypothesis of the post-Easter conversion of the disciples, shows that this hypothesis certainly has had its value in his re flection on the Christian resur- rection faith.

What is the complex relation between local diversity and universal unity? Being Roman Catholic himself, Witte is familiar with the answers his own church has formulated to these questions. Yet he also knows these answers were only accepted by that Church after profound re flec- tion, fierce debates and much hesitation, all of which have left their traces. To him, this means that the debates that produced the answers are at least as valu- able as the answers themselves. Answers, in his view, are not meant to end the debates. Rather, they appeal to an ongoing re flection that a Church will always need. They are mere signposts, meant to clarify the position of the Church on issues big and small. This idea of the answers as signs of an ongoing re flection implies that these are signs in the classical sense, signa referring to a res. The signum represents the res, but it cannot fully embody it. As a consequence, other signs may also represent the same res. This, I believe, has been essential to the way in which Witte conceived his theological and ecumenical responsibility. He loves his church and is willing to take her answers to the various di fferent theological questions extremely seri- ous. At the same time, he is ready to consider them as signa , which do not necessarily exclude the possibility that other signa might also potentially refer to a res, in the fullest sense of the word. This dynamic attitude between unity and diversity is a hallmark of Witte's theology. He is looking for the nuances: if no clear and de finitive truth can be formulated, we need nuance. This brings me to the subject of this article: the di fferences and nuances, as well as the * Parts of this article have been presented at the XVII th Int ernational Conference on Patristic Studies, Oxford, 2015. 1 H. Witte, \"Building Ecumenical Community At The Local Level. A Case Study\" , L.J. Ko ffeman, H. Witte (eds.), Of All Times and of All Places: Protestants and Catholics on The Church Local and Universal Meinema, implications of Western and Eastern Church traditions when they speak about dei fication. Deification is an important topic in modern theology, particularly with regard to Augustinian theology. It was long considered to be a typical subject of Eastern theology, a doctrine that could only be a misappropriation in Western theology. 2 This is certainly how the Protestant reformers saw it, for they con- sidered it to be a kind of anomaly. 3 To them, it did not seem to be a biblical notion at all, even though Paul clearly spoke about huiothesia . This huiothesia was an act of God however, depending entirely on His grace, whereas the doc- trine of dei fication seemed to suggest that man was capable of gaining a divine future by his own capacities. Today's outlook is di fferent, however, and dei fica- tion - certainly the way it appears in the works of Augustine - has become a serious matter of discussion. 4 What does it mean? Why does Augustine use the word - though he only mentions it eighteen times? And finally, why did he use the word in the first place? 5 Recent publications by Norman Russel 6 and Da vid Meconi 7 answ er some of these questions, as they highlight many aspects of the Augustinian concept 2 About this supposed di fference between the Eastern and Western theological tradition, see in particular the wonderful article by K. Hennessy, \"An Answer to De R\u00e9gnon's Accusers: Why we should not speak of his Paradigm\" , Harvard Theological Review 100(2007), 179-97. She ex- plains that this di fference seems to be due to De R\u00e9gnon's Etudes Th\u00e9ologiques , but that in real- ity this was not the case and that the di fference between Eastern emphasis on the Threeness of God and the Western insistence on the unity of the divine, is grossly overestimated. 3 See, M.J. Christensen, J. Wittung (eds.), Partakers of the Divine Nature: The History and Development of Dei fication in the Christian Traditions (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2008); P. Gavrilyuk, \" The Retrieval Modern Theology 25(2009), 647-59. 4 Recently, the Roman roots of the notion of dei fication have also been highlighted by S. Cole, Cicero and The Rise of Dei fication at Rome (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013). See also D. Zeller (ed.), Gottes und Verg\u00f6ttlichung Augustine's (London: Bloomsbury, fication in Contemporary Theology and Augustine' , 301-314, considers this growing interest as a phenomenon due to the modern wish to place God in the very heart of human existence.

Russel, The Doctrine of Dei fication in the Greek Patristic Tradition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004). 7 D. Meconi, The One Christ: St. Augustine's Theology of Dei fication (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, Augustinian Studies 39 (2008), 61-74.29 The Presence of the Absent : Augustine and Deification of dei fication. Yet, in spite of these recent publications, and the new insights they provide, research has mainly held fast to the approach developed by Gerald Bonner in his famous article from 1986, aptly entitled \"Augustine's Conception of Dei fication\". 8 His conclusion, which has since has been con- firmed by other authors, is that the Augustinian concept of dei fication is a manifold notion. It should certainly not be regarded as a notion or a word he has somehow borrowed from Eastern sources, for it has its own dynamics and is firmly rooted in Augustine's theology. It has both biblical and neo-platonic roots, focuses on participation and represents a gift that is bestowed by grace and adoption . We may become gods, but only by the grace of the one who dei- fies. No one is able to bring about his or her own dei fication. At least, that is what he appears to assert at first glance, and it would be coherent with the anti-Pelagian stance of Augustine's later theology. In his own words: \"for it is clear that when He calls us gods, He dei fied us by grace, we are not born of his substance\". 9 This implies that the process of dei fication also represents a jus- tification and, as such, dei fication is an integral part of Augustinian soteriology. However, this salvation is not accessible to all. It is strictly reserved for those who belong to the Church and even within that holy community, it is only granted to the electi . Finally, dei fication can only be achieved in the afterlife. In short, dei fication seems to be a term mainly used to highlight once more the omnipotence of God's grace. 10 Moreover, not only does it fit perfectly within the framework of the doctrine of grace, it also seamlessly adapts itself to the doctrine of predestination. Even Meconi, insisting on dei fication as the perfec- tion of creation, remains faithful to the idea that humanity is integrated into the totus Christus by the grace of the Holy Spirit, combining Christology, trini- tarianism and predestination. So in this view, Augustinian dei fication is not a notion showing a particular capacity of humanity for gaining divine existence, but a way of emphasizing human dependence upon God's grace. We can par- ticipate in God's life, but such participation remains a gift from God: it is His act of justi fication and salvation. At least, this is what Augustine seems to propose. 8 G. Bonner, \"Augustine's Conception of Dei fication\" , Journal of 37(1986), 369-386. 9 Enn. in Ps . 49,2. 10 The notion of grace can be seen as the continuing story in Augustine's theology. See C. Harrison, Augustine. Christian Truth and Fractured Humanity (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000); L. Ayres, Augustine and the Trinity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010).30 Smalbrugge This strong emphasis on soteriology does leave us with some questions, however: is it really correct to suppose that the metaphor of dei fication is noth- ing more than just another way of emphasizing the importance of grace? Are we justi fied in once again considering the notion of grace to be the decisive element in Augustinian thought? 2 Divinity and Number Augustine's choice of words might also show us some other directions than those leading to the notion of grace. Augustine mentions dei fication in his Enarationes in Psalmos 146, saying that man can participate in God, but it is unclear what this actually means. This question is not an easy one to answer. He starts his argument by introducing the theme of the incomprehensibility of God. God is, of course, someone who cannot be understood and whose exis- tence lies beyond all human categories. 11 This gap between God and man can only be bridged by an act of God. Yet, to Augustine, this is not an act of grace, but an act of creation. According to him, God has to pour Himself out in us: \"atque utinam infundat se nobis \". The choice of words is somewhat remark- able: a pouring-out is something quite di fferent from creation. Moreover, God has to illuminate us, so that we can understand that we cannot understand Him. Given our finite intelligence - the complete opposite of God's unlimited intelligence - the only remaining possibility is participation in God. 12 This 'participation' is not meant to suggest that we can actually lay hands on a part of God, however. Participation has nothing to do with owning a part of God, or sharing in his being. 13 That would be contrary to the idea of God's unity. In Him, no separate parts can be distinguished and there are no shares we can appropriate. His is a very peculiar type of unity that, although it is one, does not equal a number. This is essential to Augustine. God's unity has nothing 11 En. in Ps . 146, Dominus The Presence of the Absent : Augustine and Deification to do with a unity that might be considered as the beginning of all numbers. He is One, certainly, but even though He is One, He is not the beginning of Three. His unity should be regarded as the fount from which all numbers flow. In that sense, Augustine is quite clear: the Trinity cannot be seen as a unity in which the Father would be the source of the three persons. Instead, God's unity is undivided and cannot be associated with the number 'one'. But there is more. Not only is God's unity not the same as the number one, He cannot even be counted: \" numerari non potest \". This is yet another a ffirmation of God's incomprehensibility. Therefore, it is impossible to explain how everything that can be numbered, i.e. our manifold reality, participates in the One and Only, something Augustine calls the unius simplicis. 14 The problem has strong platonic and neo-platonic overtones: how can man- ifold reality be linked to a unity that has no multiplicity in it? It stands to reason Augustine links numbers (or the impossibility of a number) to the problem of the incomprehensibility of God. What is remarkable, however, is the fact that he uses such an ordinary topos about God's incomprehensibility to revive the neo-platonic approach of this complexity. He is, in fact, conducting a philo- sophical investigation into the relation between numbers and intelligence and continues his argument in the same philosophical vein. He takes it a step fur- ther when he writes that it is not only true that God cannot be numbered but that, equally important, God's intelligence is without number: \" intelligentiae eius non est numerus \". The doctor of grace frequently repeats this phrase in this sermon - in fact, it is a wordplay referring to psalm 146. 15 By this, he does not mean that we cannot understand God because understanding is always about numbers. Instead, he seems to refer to the second person of the Trinity when he speaks of 'intelligence'. He does not stop there, however. After this wordplay, Augustine proceeds to explain that everything in our reality can be counted, which is the very purpose of numbers, even though the number in itself is absolutely uncountable: \" numerari numerus nullo pacto potest \". So Augustine leaves us with three elements of God's existence that cannot be described in numerical terms. First, God's unity has nothing to do with a number. Therefore, God is someone who cannot be enumerated, i.e. he is not an individual like a person is. Individuals are of course unique, but they are countable. We can say that there are four people in the room and 132 in a church. God is a unity unto Himself and cannot be counted. Secondly, God's intelligence is not quanti fiable. This may seem odd at first, but in fact Augustine merely says that the second person of the Trinity cannot be counted either. Of 14 ., 39,4.32 Smalbrugge course, God is able to count and to quantify. Yet still, the Trinity as such has nothing to do with numbers and the second person of the Trinity, Christ, is not comparable to a second person side by side with the Father, as if they were individuals. This implies that we have to take a closer look at Augustine's con- cept of intelligentia . It remains within the divine unity and although it can be distinguished from the first person, it is not merely the second number in the Trinity. It is an intelligence of God that expresses the divine unity. Its role is solely to express this very speci fic unity that cannot be associated with a num- ber. Finally, even if we do speak in numerical terms, we have to realize that the number of the 'entity' within the Trinity itself cannot be quanti fied. In that sense, the number can be equated and compared to the mystery of the divinity itself. It exists and it can even be named, but it cannot be expressed in terms of its own being. 'God' is a notion and a reality that exists, but at the same time, God is a reality that literally cannot be accounted for. So the argument runs as follows. God is a unity and though unity normally speaking has to do with numbers, this unity is not a number and it cannot even be understood in terms of numbers. We cannot say that the three persons of the Trinity are like three individuals. In the end, the number we are talking about cannot be quanti fied. It implies that the world of the manifold ( i.e. the world of numbers) cannot be understood in the real sense of the word, it can- not be understood on its own terms. The reality of numbers is beyond number, the reality of the One who is uncountable is also beyond number and cannot be accounted for. However logical this argument may seem, it is remarkably neo-platonic. To be clear, this last remarkable phrase, \" numerari numerus nullo pacto potest \" , evidently recalls of the One in Enneads VI, 5,4: \"it is not counted at all\". Plotinus even added in Enn . VI, 7,15 that the One, being not a number whilst it would be predicable, is o ffering from itself what it does not possess itself: number. After also having posited that number itself cannot be numbered, Augustine continues in the same vein, stating that: \"What then is next to Him, where does he make what he has made, for it is said 'that in measure, number and weight thou hast disposed'?\" 16 It is an allusion to the divine Threeness, which is not a number, but bears the name of a number. It cannot be a number because it must remain equal to the One that is no num- The Presence of the Absent : Augustine and Deification ber. In that sense, the One God is o ffering from Himself what He himself does not possess: a language which cannot but express itself in numbers. So what we have here is a passage about dei fication in terms of participa- tion, in which Augustine is clearly inspired by the neo-platonic de finition of the One: The One is not a number (it can't be counted at all), it is the principle of simplicity. In his own words: unus simplex . Secondly, his phrase \" intelligen- tiae eius non est numerus \" recalls the Greek concept of nous , because it de fines the One who is not a number. Finally, the fact that Augustine does not speak of a creating God, but of the one God pouring Himself out into the multitude of mankind, at the very least seems to be the result of his neo-platonic vocabulary. What Augustine describes in this sermon, however, is not the type of partici- pation in which humanity and God share the same substance. There is no question of an ontology bridging the gap between God and man. Protestant theologians who suspect that dei fication is in fact about an ontology bridging this distance between God and man may rest assured. Apparently, there is no common ground between God and man. Even at the level of understanding, there is no common ground: Augustine insists on the fact that human lan- guage, as it expresses itself in quanti fiable terms, is unable to comprehend God's unity. So, ontologically speaking, a germane distance between God and humanity is upheld. Strikingly, the alternative we normally find in Augustine - grace as an acting force, being able to raise man to the height of the in finite presence of the divine - is not mentioned here either! Instead of introducing 'grace' , he speaks about a God 'pouring Himself out' in humankind. So what we see is a sophisticated play on numbers, reality, substance, individuality and understanding, which culminates in the conclusion that the number itself can- not be numbered. Hence, the ultimate reality 'outnumbers' our intelligence, but at the same time it remains intimately linked to the world of numbers that forms the realm of our understanding. Yet, this continuity cannot be presented in ontological terms, linking God to humanity in terms of being. Nevertheless, it would be a failure not to observe that this passage is at odds with the doc- trine of grace. What seems to become clear in this sermon is the fact that apparently there is no relation between the theology of grace and this theology of numbers. This leaves us with some preliminary observations about dei fication as participatio , but it provides no clues as to what kind of participation this might be. There is a relation between the divine simplicity and the world of numbers, but we cannot de fine it properly. The only word that comes across is the word infundat . God pours Himself out, shaping a world that is funda- mentally di fferent from his own being. So what we can observe is the fact that there is a complex relation between the world of numbers ( i.e. quanti fication, 34 Smalbrugge mathematics) and the world of the divine Trinity that expresses itself in terms of numbers but can in no way be numbered. 3 Image Where does Augustine's argument go from here? Further on in the same ser- mon, he observes that humanity should maintain a certain similitude with God and if necessary, reform itself to able to do so. The verb he applies is refor- mare .17 If asked how humanity can reform itself, the answer sounds: by confessing and by doing good works. 18 These good works have to be performed, because God also grants us the ability to realize them, as human beings have been created in God's image. This divine image, born within ourselves, must be a rational image. Otherwise we would not be able to call upon God: \" rationale animal te Deus fecit \".19 This entails that the image becomes a pivotal element in the process of approaching God in such a way that the resemblance remains intact. The more humankind remains an image of God, the more one stays within the similitude that he or she has to adopt in their life. So, does the notion of the image help us understand the continuity we observed between God and humanity, without calling it an ontological continuity? Would this help us to understand what dei fication might also entail, apart from mere participation? When he returns to the subject of dei fication in another sermon, Enn. in Ps . 49, Augustine explains that humanity can attain this similitude with God, but similitude is certainly not the same as equality. For the one who dei fies can only be God by himself and not through participation. So, even dei fied, we are not God's equals. We only resemble Him and our dei fication is realized by the grace of adoption, not by nature of birth ( naturae generantis ). Here we seem to return to the well-known scheme of dei fication functioning as an element in the doctrine of grace, insisting on the di fference between God and humanity. But again, things may be more complicated than they seem at first. Indeed, there is no equality between man and God but, as Augustine states in De Trinitate , X, 12.19, we have to ascend to that essence whose unequal image we 17 Ibid., \"Dissimiles S. 126, 2,3.35 The Presence of the Absent : Augustine and Deification are. Nevertheless, we may take pride in being its image: \" impar imago, sed tamen imago \". There is a kind of twofold nature in the image: it is not what it reflects - yet it is what it re flects. Augustine builds upon this with another met- aphor in De Trinitate , XIV, 15.21, namely the metaphor of the signet ring: the signet ring leaves an image in the wax, and yet the image remains in the ring. Again, the wax is not what it re flects, and then again, it is. The wax however, is vulnerable and can be damaged, implying that it has to be renewed. Surprisingly, in De Trinitate , grace is not the only way that God may rehabili- tate. In De Trinitate , XIV, 8.11, Augustine argues that by the very quality of being God's image, that image is capable of participating in God. Apparently, there already is always a strong relation, even without grace. This idea culminates in De Trinitate , XIV, 14.20, where he writes that \"the image of God is in itself so powerful that it is capable of cleaving to Him whose image it is\". 20 Again, the relation seems to be very strong, even without mentioning the element of grace. Grace does not seem to be necessary, because the image contains an internal force that enables it to stick to God. It is within humanity's own power to remain within the similitude that ties a creature to its Creator. This makes it all the more important to know how this relation can be described. If it cannot be described in ontological terms, then how can it be described as the relating force between humanity and God? Ultimately, the question as to what kind of participation this is, is left unanswered. Rather than formulating an answer, Augustine radically changes his tone. He suddenly insists that the image has to be reformed by its Creator and that it cannot reform itself in the same way as it was able to realize its own deforma- tion. 21 So, without having resolved the question about the very nature of the relation between God and man, we now see that the relation itself changes in that it can no longer subsist without an intervening God. The idea of an image that always carries in it the possibility of 'clinging' to God, seems to have disap- peared. If such is the case, we are faced with a double question: are we able to reform ourselves, or do we have to be reformed? And correspondingly, is grace no longer the pivotal notion in the relation between God and humanity? Is it instead thanks to God that humanity can be reformed and can remain within the similitude with his Creator? I would like to argue that, if one follows De Trinitate , XIV, 16.22, it is clear that the image according to which we have to be 'reformed' is none other than the 20 \"Qua in se imagine dei that has to be reformed. 22 The model and its re flection are identi fiable, but Augustine does not mean that the re flection participates in a higher reality, that there would be some kind of common ground. Ontologically, God and man do not share a common form of being. That is not what his use of 'image' implies. Instead, Augustine tries to show that it is the re flection that proves the existence, the presence and the truth of the model. The image is essential to the model. If the model becomes clearer, and if its power becomes more visi- ble, this is owed to the re flection. Admittedly, his use of the word 'image' becomes somewhat distorted. We are apparently dealing with an equivocal notion. From one perspective, 'image' is that which has to be reformed and, conversely, the other perspective states that it is none other than the model according to which the image has to be reformed. This seems to lock us into a hermeneutical circle that unfortunately does not allow us to move from point A to B in order to obtain some new information about this very image in ques- tion. What are its dynamics, allowing it to gain some other outlook than it had formerly? Do we speak of the power of grace? Or does the image, being the model according to which we have to be reformed, have an inner force, creat- ing its own reformation? Where can we find some solution to this equivocal use of the notion of 'image' in order to obtain a clear understanding of what is meant by dei fication? Are we able to come nearer to God once we remember what we are, i.e. His image? Or are we completely dependent on His interven- tion, and will there always be this unbridgeable di fference between God and man, implying that dei fication is nothing other than God's grace that allows us to be renewed? 4 Dei fication as the Image that Cannot Be Imagined By way of conclusion, I would like to return to the idea that the image is some- thing in itself, without being the model of that which it represents as an image. Or to put it more concisely: it is and it is not. It simultaneously is truth and the absence of truth. Augustine's first utterance about the dynamics of an image that represents something without adequately being what it represents, is in his earliest work, the Soliloquia . There he wrote that a picture can only be true if the thing that it represents is false. Take, for example, a picture of a horse. What you see is not a true horse, but a 'false' one. Nevertheless, the image itself is true. The same goes for a mirror: if a man re flected in a mirror was not a 22 Presence of the Absent : Augustine and Deification mirror image, i.e. a false representation, it could never be a true image. This culminates in some striking phrases about tragedy, in which Augustine pon- ders whether one can only be a true character if one is prepared to be a false one. 23 In such clauses, one discovers an inner dynamic in the notion of 'image' that has very little to do with the notion of grace. Instead it is comparable to the notion of a number that cannot itself be numbered. An 'image' cannot itself be imagined without being deprived of its own character: otherwise it would end up being an original rather than an image. The core of the image, however, is the presence of the absent: the re flection renders the existence of the model true, and the shadow makes the elusiveness of pure light visible. Paradoxically, this seems to be the true dynamic of the image: it cannot be imagined, for that would make it a model. But then again, it proves the exis- tence of the model, and although it is false itself, it does provide proof of the truth. Precisely this paradox constitutes the essential elements of Augustinian deification. It reveals the truth of the divine essence without being able to be identi fied with this truth. It can never become the model after which it has been created. One might say that the image participates in the model, while such participation in no way implies that it shares in its actual being. Augustine develops a very subtle way of discussing a reality that is not ours. Linguistic discourse reveals its utter incorrectness, yet precisely through its falsehood, it is able to reveal the truth. It is true in so far as it reveals the essence of dei fica- tion. Dei fication is not 'being like God'. On the contrary, it is being unlike God and thus disclosing His essence. Dei fication, therefore, is the return to the very essence of the image: being false in order to reveal the truth. Dei fication as a process is not primarily due to grace, to Christ, but essentially to its own inner dynamics. This, in turn, is comparable to the mechanism of a number, finally reflecting in a perfect way the One that is no number. Such an interpretation of Augustinian dei fication does indeed diminish the role of grace. To the least, it rules out grace as the only decisive element in Augustine's theology: there is also an element in human existence that remains present, regardless of what that concrete existence is like. All the while, it is not to our merit that this element remains present. It is simply something that can- not be removed from human existence. This is a fundamentally neo-platonic approach, in which the One remains present in all the emanations that can only re flect what they are not. Such an approach seems to be preserved by Augustine, even if he insists on the role of grace. In fact, this perspective hon- ors human existence and characterizes it - to a much greater extent than the 23 Sol. II,10,18: \" Smalbrugge traditional Protestant view - as an existence that has been called upon to reflect its Creator. Yet, this approach has nothing to do with the idea of human- kind becoming God and almost becoming equal to Him, since an image is never identi fiable with its model, at the risk of losing its own characteristics. In the end, this is perhaps how Henk Witte has always considered the nature of theology: a re flection that is called to be in line with the truth, but cannot be identi fied with it.

Being an acute phenomenologist, he describes the di fferent facets of this process. He discusses not only the struggle to expose the nature of evil and how to adequately approach it ( Inferno ), but also the confrontation with the virtues of Mary and the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount ( Purgatorio ), and finally the implications of the union with God ( Paradiso ). It becomes apparent that conversion is an extensive and lengthy a ffair. A notable topic in the heaven of Mars (Par., 14,84-18,63) is what he calls provedenza , providenza or provvidenza . See, for example, when he hears the summons, in the exact middle of Paradiso (17,109), to follow in the footsteps of the Cruci fied Jesus and poetically express his views on the way in which the tree of life can either blossom or grow crooked. 2 This takes place shortly after the last Crusade, while he is contemplating his family's past and the socioeco- nomic, political, and ecclesiastic developments in Florence and elsewhere in Italy. To live up to his calling, he needs to arm himself with provedenza , even though fortuna confronts him with serious problems. Exactly what this entails is the subject of this article. 1 In line with John Freccero, who places the Comedy in the tradition of Saint Augustine's Confessions, in his The Poetics of Conversion (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), Jennifer Petrie asserts that, \"Conversion is seen not merely as a topic forming part of the content of Dante's works but as structurally signi ficant and bound up with the literary forms Dante uses, especially those of autobiographical narrative and of figural allegory\" , in her The Dante Encyclopedia (London: Routledge, 2010), 222. 2 Henceforth I will mention only the number of the Canto and the verse in the references to Paradiso unless this results in confusion. First, I will explain the story line of the heaven of Mars. Next, against the background of Dante's comments on fortuna , and thirdly I will elaborate on his views on provedenza . Then follows a section on the relationship between ancestry and vocation, and finally I will discuss his criticism of life in thirteenth century Florence. 1 The Story Line After his arrival in the heaven of Mars (14,82 ff.), Dante claims that martyrs are more exalted than the confessors and theologians in the heaven of the Sun. This is because they have followed their hearts rather than their intellects (88- 90), and have shown great dedication. Dante describes a radiant Greek cross (99-101) in which martyrs move up and down (109-111) while singing hymns about arising and conquering (118-126). Three times the rhyme-word Cristo sounds (104,106, 108) as a battle cry for crusaders. The atmosphere of calm and harmony at the beginning of chant 15 contrasts with the turmoil that is caused when people allow the temporary to prevail over the eternal (10-12) - a prelude to the di fference between fortuna and pro- vedenza . One of the warriors/martyrs makes himself known as Cacciaguida, one of Dante's ancestors, born in 1091 and killed in 1149 during the second Crusade. 3 They meet shortly after the last Crusaders' stronghold in the Holy Land, Akko, has been lost. However, in Dante's view, Pope Boniface VIII shows no interest whatsoever in this tragic situation (125-141). He has forgotten all about Joshua's entry into the promised land (9,123-124), followed by the renewal of the covenant at Gilgal (Josh: 5,10). According to Inferno 27,87-90, he trades with Jews and Saracens but fights Christians. Dante hopes that the Vatican and Rome will soon be free from 'the adultery of Boniface' (9,139-142) and that people will remember Nazareth where Gabriel 'once opened wide his wings' (9,137-138). In the ful fillment of this expectation, he needs to be a spe- cial kind of Crusader. At the start of his encounter with Dante, Cacciaguida speaks of the Triune God (15,47) - a reference to the Christian experience of God and an indication that the Christian God, and not the Roman deity is at the centre of the heaven of Mars. Cacciaguida has read about the election of one of his descendants in the book of this God, and realizes that he now finds that person in front of him 3 Because Pope Eugene III had guaranteed that those who died along the way would be con- sidered martyrs, J. Philips, Holy Warriors: a Modern History of the Crusades (London: Random House, 2009), 104.41 Dante on Conversion and Belief in Providence (15,46-54). Their conversation reminds us of an episode in Hades when Anchises informs Aeneas about his mission regarding Rome (Virgil, Aeneid VI, 851-892). Dante's encounter with Cacciaguida has similar elements: the job description, the encouragement to be assertive, the circumstances in the land and the city. 4 Cacciaguida's words in 15,88-89, \"O branch of my tree, the mere expectancy of whose arrival here gave me delight\" , are also a reminder of the voice from heaven during Jesus's baptism: \"You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased\" (Mk. 1,11). These words imply an assignment that will only succeed thanks to \"a metamorphosis of the self\" and a \"thoroughgoing the cross\" (Schnapp, 213). Cacciaguida recounts that he was baptized in the chapel of John the Baptist back when the people of Florence were still of high moral standing (15,97-108), and now he shares in eternal peace. Dante will have similar experiences: leaving Florence, going into exile, speaking up for Heaven's sake, and finding peace in the ful fillment of his arduous task. In Canto 16, Cacciaguida talks of his family and the sociopolitical history of thirteenth century Florence. He points out that the homogeneity of the city has disappeared and complains that the sheepfold of St. John (25) has been led astray by fortuna (84). As a result, the spiritual centre of the city has been moved from St. John's baptistery to Mars's torso near the Ponte Vecchio. Discord reigns. Life is dominated by the bloody battle between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. Canto 17 refers to Vergil's earlier prediction that Dante's future would be far from easy (21). 'On the point at which all times are present' (17-18 = God), Cacciaguida predicts 'what fortune now draws near to him' (26). Driven from Florence, he will 'taste the saltiness of bread by another's hand - as, too, how 4 J. Schnapp underlines the di fference between Anchises in in heaven. Anchises is ombra , 'a figure enclosed within the blindness and flux of earthly perspectives: a limitation which extends to the entire worldview of Classical civilization, its god of poetry and prophecy included'. See J. Schnapp, The Trans figuration of History at the Center of Dante's Paradise (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986), 144-145. Cacciaguida on the other hand is stelle, flame, lume , because he sees life in the light of the Biblical God (cf. 17,37-39). Trinity, Incarnation, and Cross constitute 'the depths of his glory, his paradise' (15,35-56). Also note- worthy is the di fference between Cacciaguida and Brunetto Latini, Dante's former teacher, who predicts his exile in Inf. 15. They are on courteous terms. Twice Latini calls him his son (31 and 36) and Dante ascribes paternal traits to him (83). Latini mentions the fortuna that will fall to him (46). Dante is willing to use this term, 'so long as conscience does not chide' (92-93); if and when it does, he might have to reconsider. Unlike Cacciaguida, Latini as a thinker and writer had no thought for the foolishness of the Cross, according to Dante.42 Logister hard it is to climb a stranger's stair' (58-60). That prospect makes him con- clude, 'It's better, then, that I arm myself with foresight, so if that dearest place is snatched away, my verses do not lose me all the rest (heaven)' (109-111). He may not be 'a timid friend to truth' (118) and must 'put clean aside all lies and make plain what in his vision he has seen' (127-128). He must follow Christ, take up his cross, and make known what he has heard, seen, and learned in Inferno , Purgatorio , and Paradiso . It is his calling as a poet to put forward his new views frankly. In Canto 18, Beatrice encourages Dante, and Cacciaguida reminds him of the bravery of the Maccabees and others who abide in the heaven of Mars. Dante assumes responsibility. His conversion to provedenza is clearer than ever before. 2 Fortuna In the Comedy , the term fortuna is used repeatedly. In Inferno 2, Beatrice calls Dante 'my friend, who is no friend of Fortune's (61), because he had left the vulgar crowd (105) and followed her as the 'Lady of Grace, through whom alone mankind may go beyond all worldly things' (76-77). After her death, however, \"he wandered from the path that leads to truth, pursuing simulacra of the good, which promise more than they can ever give\" (Purg., 30,130-132). Remorsefully he admits, \"those things with their false joys, o ffered me by the World, led me astray when I no longer saw your countenance\" (Purg., 31,34-36). He allowed himself to be led by excitement and super ficiality, instead of those things in life that really deserve our attention. It is not true that all things in life are determined by God. According to Dante's political work Monarchia (II,9), many circumstances are determined by the Old Opponent: Satan. Elsewhere he complains about the simplistic views of those who substitute the adage \"history guides our lives\" for \"fortune- telling, and cast their spells with image-dolls and potions\" (Inf., 20,123) or prophesy by means of sparks from smoldering logs (Par., 18,102). We should not try to read divine meanings into all that happens. The fact that Dante places Democritus (4th century BC) \"who said the World was chance\" (Inf., 4,136) in Limbo among the sages, suggests that he agrees: not everything in life can be interpreted as meaningful. Even though many things that happen to us are for- gotten, their fame disappears, \"concealed by time\" (Par., 16,87), we often behave as if they have eternal value. Fortuna is also an agonizing mystery for those who are obsessed by wealth and possessions (Inf., 7). Such people are unable to relax because of their 43 Dante on Conversion and Belief in Providence fascination with the way in which fortuna \"holds all worldly wealth within her fists\" (69). The fact that it is outside their control weighs heavily upon them; it blinds them, makes them run into one another, and tightens their hands into fists (56). Fortuna beguiles them into \"squandering and hoarding (58), which makes it hard to distinguish [their] humanity\" (54). Virgil tells Dante, \"You see, my son, the short-lived mockery of all the wealth that is in Fortune's keep, over which the human race is bickering; for all the gold that is or ever was beneath the moon won't buy a moment's rest for even one among these weary souls\" (61-66). When things go well, they cling to their fortune; when they go wrong, they get distraught. Fortuna , thus, takes on quasi-divine airs in the eyes of the greedy; in 70-96 it is compared to the angels who rule the heavens and in 86 with providence ( provede ). Surrounded by smoke and ignorance, Dante contemplates the su ffering in the world and in Purgatorio 16 prays, \"What is the cause of this? Please make it clear that I may teach the truth to other men; some see it in the stars, some on the earth\" (61-63). Marco Lombardo, counselor to Frederik Barbarossa around 1150, responds, \"You men on earth attribute everything to the spheres' in flu- ence alone, as if with some predestined plan they move all things\" (67-69). The influence of the spheres may not be absolutized. Those who allow themselves to be dragged down by the inevitable worries about disease and poverty lose their freedom and become estranged from God. Even though we can rise above coincidence and chance, thanks to \"a light that shows you right from wrong\" and to free will (75-76), we are often led astray because popes and emperors act as if their happiness and joy depended on power and possessions (97-129). Whoever assumes he can thus conquer chance and fortune is sorely mistaken. As was Lombardo: during his earthly days he did not see things clearly and in purgatory he prays for the peace of the Lamb of God (16-21) and wishes it on Dante (141). According to Paradiso 5,98-99, \"the transmutability of our nature\" makes us go along with whatever is happening around us and stops us from prudently dealing with the many aspects of life. Paradiso 11 (1-3) talks of the \"insensate strivings of mortality, useless reasonings\" that make people \"beat their wings in downward flight\". The end of the canto asserts that we are fooled by vain aspi- rations. The situation is not hopeless, however, provided that we allow ourselves to be led by \"the Point at which all times are present times\" as Solomon puts it (17,16-18). \"If Love in its fervent warmth arrays and prints the clear regard of Primal power, entire perfection will be here acquired\" (13,79- 81). In the light of God's love for humanity we find peace in the middle of all that upsets us - not by praying for logical insight (13,93-99). Whoever goes along with the way in which God cares for people according to the Bible, finds 44 Logister new ways of living. The insight that God moves in ways that, at first sight, seem mysterious to our own spontaneous inclinations, only comes about after we have accepted God's extended hand. Since our soul has been created directly by God and partakes in God's freedom, we are not necessarily prisoners of our 'transmutable nature'. Besides, certe condizioni lead us in the right direction (32,43), such as: the faith of parents (42), the innocence of children (77), cir- cumcision (80), Christ (83.85.87) and Mary (85-86). Thanks to these, l'alto proveder divino (37) unfolds in us and enables us to conform to 'the miraculous disposition of divine Wisdom'. 5 Ultimately, this is how Dante experiences \"the wound of la fortuna \" , as he calls his exile in Convivio I 3,4. In these miserable circumstances he still manages, with the help and encouragement of many, to find his freedom. And with this, we have arrived at the next topic. 3 Provedenza Depending on the context, provedenza alludes to an activity of God and/or man. The relationship between the two is important. The nature, content, and meaning of the notion of faith in God are largely determined by it. At times the emphasis is on the will of God, as in Inferno 23,55 ff: \"High Providence that willed for them to be the ministers in charge of the fifth ditch\". In Paradiso 11,28 ff., Saint Francis and Saint Dominic are the product of \" la provedenza that governs all the World with wisdom so profound none of His creatures can ever hope to see into Its depths\". The (initial) impenetrability of the will of God even makes him sigh: \" Predestinazion , how deeply hid your roots are from the vision of all those who cannot see the Primal Cause entire\" (20,130vv). Here, Aristotle's concept of 'primal cause' should be viewed in light of the liveliness and the love of the Biblical God. This is the God Dante is looking for and in whose direction he is heading. Concerning the meaning and implications of provedenza , he feels like \"one who is in doubt and longs to have the guidance of a soul who sees the truth and knows of virtue and has love\" (17,103-105). In the course of the Comedy, his understanding grows thanks to his conversations with Vergil, Beatrice, Saint Bernard, and - last but not least - Cacciaguida. The latter has been allowed to take a look in \"the mighty book whose black and white will never altered be\" (5,50-51). In heaven he views \"the final Point where time is timeless ... Contingency, which in no way extends beyond the pages of your world of matter, is all depicted nel cospetto eterno . But this no more con- fers necessity than does the movement of a boat downstream depend upon the 5 A.M. Chiavacci Leonardi, Dante on and Belief in Providence eyes that mirror it\" (17,17-18.37-42). It is about a never-ending invitation with ever new impulses. Cospetto eterno does not mean that God is pulling all the strings like an almighty puppeteer, but it does underline his passionate com- mitment and commiseration with this earth. God pays close attention to life without controlling it. In the process he does not give up on his intentions, his loving care, and he longs for us to do the same. Thus, provedenza has two sides: God's intentions and how we follow suit. In heaven they merge. Even for the saints, its nature is a mystery, but they are in complete agreement because of the love that is bestowed on them: \"I clearly see how in this court a love entirely free gladly obeys Eternal Providence\" (21,73-75). That in the Empyreum, the highest heaven or God's own realm (1,121), everything is balanced by provedenza , according to the Letter to Cangrande (nr. 61) means that the glory or the light of God fills everything with goodness, wisdom, and power and is accepted by all that is \"with its own instinct as its guide\" (1,114), i.e. with the possibility to understand and love (118- 120). Folco, a troubadour from Marseille who becomes the bishop of Toulouse, puts it as follows: \"Here we smile ... at the Power that orders and provides. From here we gaze upon that art which works with such e ffective love; we see the Good by which the world below returns above\" (9,103-108). On earth, however, souls darken (9,72) and people are mostly blind to the love of God as a result of negative experiences and sentiments. Dante does not just state: \"put your trust in Providence\". To him this would just be a leap in the dark. Rather we must try to discern God's intentions for us, and do all we can to live accordingly, for example, by not seeking our personal or family honor but by serving others. Only at peak moments do we succeed, when the desire to be like God in terms of goodness, wisdom, and righteousness lift us above ourselves. The intensity with which God looks after everything inspires intelli- gent beings to amor sanctus sive caritas (Letter to Cangrande, nr.68), but the desire to be like God gets lost when other desires dominate. \"Just as form some- times may not re flect the artist's true intent, the matter being deaf to the appeal, just so, God's creature, even though impelled toward the true goal, hav- ing the power to swerve, may sometimes go astray along his course\" (1,127-131). If God had not bestowed \"the power of His own providence\" (8,98-99) upon us through the heavenly spheres, \"chaos would result, not works of art\" (8,108). In order to learn to understand divine providence or, put di fferently, God's engagement in the life and the future of the world, Dante should follow the Cruci fied Jesus, even if this entails a good bit of bitterness (17,117). He should remember his baptism and wear the crusaders's mantle like the Lamb of God took the cross upon its shoulders. He should approach life with the Cruci fied Jesus and Mary in mind. This will not reduce his intellect and his creativity to 46 Logister purely passive, merely registering instruments. What God's providence asks of him is consistent with Scripture: the letter should be read with a readiness to seek God and a willingness to take responsibility. As Scripture is the product of divine impulse and its human assimilation and articulation in a process of decades or even centuries, so living according to Providence is impossible without human trial and error. This holds true for the Comedy, \"this sacred poem to which both Heaven and Earth have set their hand, and made me learn from laboring so long\" (25,1-3; cf. 23,61-69), and for Providence as well. God is inviting us to be partners, not purely passive spectators, in his objectives and intentions. We ourselves must exploit our talents and abilities. Only thus can God's Providence accomplish anything. Dante is not without hope: peace and harmony are possible in this world. Not as a static and unchangeable state, but thanks to a positive focus on God, who asks us to partake in his love for humanity. For this, Dante has to use all his talents and opportunities without denying his vulnerability and mortality; Paradiso offers a view of the kind of life that may ensue. Not outside time and world: Dante keeps focusing on the world, discusses the way life evolves here, and wonders how we can break away from the clutches of Mars. To be able to speak of provedenza , he must allow himself to be touched by God like the patriarchs and prophets, Jesus and Mary. Faith in provedenza means sharing in the way they looked at history and lived their lives. This is a lifelong task that keeps requiring conversion. 4 Ancestry and Vocation With Aristotle (8,120), Dante maintains that society needs everyone to contrib- ute. For this we should look further than our ancestry (129) since the tendencies of our natura generata (the nature of the family) usually does not coincide with il proveder divino (133-135). We should look at our lives from the point of view of God's intentions for us and not of a chance belonging ( fortuna ) to a certain family (139). Frequently, however, family, city, and country push us in a direction that is at odds with God's plans. In Paradiso 8, Dante's friend Charles Martel from the house of Anjou, who died in 1295 at the age of 24, discusses the relationship between our ancestry and our vocation by means of a concrete situation. His brother Robert (1275-1343) had become king of Naples with the consent of Pope Boniface VIII (8,85) even though he was unsuited and lacked the political art of foresight ( antivedesse in 76, and proveder in 79). He turned into a blind and petty miser unable to find 'deep joy' (85) because he could not see \"where all good begins\" (87), and never really sought what God intended 47 Dante on Conversion and Belief in Providence for him. With regard to the question \"how can sweet seed produce such sour fruit\" (93), Charles answers that God's provedenza (99) orients all people towards their proper goal (100-102). However, the world is blind to this prove- der divino (135). In Paradiso 9, Dante uses two figures who really sought God's will to illus- trate his point: Cunizza 12,10) the same root\" (Par., 9,31), but not predestined to the same way of life. She says, \"I was overcome by this star's light\" (33). The word of God has raised her above her family's in fluence. Now she encourages others to seek God's intentions and live by them. Rahab, from Jericho, broke with her family's ways (making a pro fit from prostitution with strangers) and came to their rescue instead. Florence, on the other hand, adores her florins, \"breaks the fold, lets the lambs run wild, and turns the shepherds into ravening wolves\" (131-132), and moreover: \"the Pope and Cardinals heed nothing else; their thoughts do not go out to Nazareth, to the Gospel and the fathers of the Church\". They have no interest in the terra santa (125-126) and no longer remember St. Peter's martyrdom (133-141). Our descent is not all-determining. Our destiny should be seen in light of God's intentions for us, which generally do not coincide with family interests. In the depth of our souls God calls us to account. \"In that One Mind perfect in Itself (God) there is foreseen ( provedute) not only every type of nature, but the proper destiny for each ( lor salute , the realization of their personal destiny\" (8,101-102). The importance of Dante's calling is evident in the fact that Cacciaguida speaks in Latin (15,28-30) and refers to the Holy Trinity, the foundation of the Christian way of life (47). That he rejoices in 18,1 about his advice to Dante and refers to it with the Latin suo verbo implies, in Kirkpatrick's view, that it is con- sistent with God's word. 6 Dante needs to let his life be determined by Christ, who gave his blood for others in the name of God. Arming himself with Providence means that, in the depths of this confused and confusing world, he gives his unquali fied assent to Christ's way of life. Only then will his life be steered in the right direction. Otherwise it will be bogged down by wishful thinking about the future or fear of death - like the augur, the seer, or the soothsayer who walks around with his head backwards: \"because he wished to see too far ahead, he sees now behind and walks a backward track\" (Inf., 20,38- 39), because he refused to be the image of God who approaches life with compassion and creativity. The biblical perspective can unfold only if Dante allows himself to be led by God and Christ and adopts a critical attitude 6 Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy 3: Paradiso , translated and edited by Robin Kirkpatrick (London: Penguin, 2007), 406.48 Logister towards his own sentiments, desires, ancestry and talents, and courageously gives his all. Where he was still rather passive and overwhelmed by what he sees earlier in Paradiso , in the heaven of Mars he is challenged to personally and decisively express God's intentions. The challenge facing him resembles that of the apostles during the Trans figuration. Dante translates the Gospel text found in Matthew 1,17 (Surgite, et noli timere ) as resurgi e vinci (Par., 14,125), in other words, in the language of the crusaders, \"Arise and conquer\". He has to take up his cross. His calling as a poet is not merely about literary talent but also about working hard and not dodging criticism and opposition. He needs to transcend his deepest nature (cf. 1,70: trasumanar or transhumanize ). \"To take on the historical (liter- ary) task and follow Christ is to accept not only its trans figuring reward, but also the pre-eminent need for martyrdom and self-sacri fice in human history\". 7 He should not allow himself to be guided by Mars, but by Christ, whose cross forms the key to understanding history. Since Vergil and Aeneas were blind to \"the genuine perspective of eternity planted into history through the cross\" , 8 they belonged to \"the foolish folk\" (17,31 gente folle ). This folly will not disap- pear until we imitate the Lamb of God who took the sins of the world upon himself. Christ's cross in the heaven of Mars is a sign that he has prepared the way towards a real art of living, whereas the way of the old Mars is character- ized by violence, intrigue, and deceit. Even when many consider the latter to be real life, only the way of the Lamb o ffers a hopeful perspective. This is Dante's conviction. He will testify to this when he professes his faith, hope, and love before the apostles of the Trans figuration in the Heaven of the Fixed Stars (Par., 25-27). 5 Social Criticism in the Light of Providence In Cacciaguida's opinion, the history of Florence has oscillated between Mars and Christ. Between the fifth and seventh centuries, the chapel of Saint John the Baptist arose where the temple of Mars once stood. The mutilated statue of Mars was moved to the vicinity of Ponte Vecchio where the moral deteriora- tion of the medieval town commenced with the murder of Buondelmonte dei Buondelmonti (Inf., 28,106-108; Par., 16,140) on of 1216. The Guelfs and the Ghibellines have been battling ever since. The imitation of Christ is no longer the central theme of life: the interests of one's own family 7 Schnapp, The Trans figuration of History , 13. 8 Schnapp, The Trans figuration of History , 29.49 Dante on Conversion and Belief in Providence are. Kinship becomes more important than solidarity in Christ. Thus the \"vain world, the love of which corrupts so many souls\" (Par., 15,146-147) comes into being. Omberto Aldobrandesco testi fies to the fact that this love is a fraud that victimizes many: \"My ancient lineage, the gallant deeds of my forebears had made me arrogant: forgetful of our common Mother Earth, I held all men in such superb disdain ...; the sin of Pride has ruined not only me but all my house, dragging them with it to calamity\" (Purg., 11,61-72). Aldobrandesco is in Purgatory, burdened by a load of rocks. It is an illustration of how di fficult it is to combine the interest of the family with imitation of Christ: \"the procreated being would always walk the procreator's path, if it were not for Holy Providence that overrules\" (Par., 8,133 ff). In contrast, the essence of the relationship between Cacciaguida and Dante is in their concern for Florence, Italy, and the Holy Land based on the Gospel, at the expense of their own lives, if need be. Dante must renounce injustice as Joshua, Judah Maccabee, and others dwell- ing in the heaven of Mars have done. Opposed to the bellicose sentiment of Mars are Nazareth (Annunciation and Mary) and the Cruci fied Jesus. When Cacciaguida asserts that right from birth, Mary has always given him a 'dwelling-place' (15,133-135), he alludes to her lifelong solicitude for him and for Dante as well. She is the first to notice his predicament (Inf., 1), and through the intercession of St. Bernard, she directs his eyes towards the mystery of God's love of which the Cruci fied Jesus is the personi fication par excellence (Par., 33). Dante's criticism of Boniface mainly has to do with the fact that the pope ignores the prophetic-critical voices of the Bible. After ancient Rome's praises have been sung in the heaven of Mercury (Par., 7) and Roman history has been described as the work of God, then the evil aspects of this city come up. These are mainly concerned with the desire to hold dominion over others. The contributions of Christ and Mary are needed to steer the commendable impulses of ancient Rome in the right direction. This critical and cautious attitude also remains necessary with regard to the history of Christianity. For that reason, Dante distances himself from all kinds of political movements and parties; he becomes a political party in himself in light of the poor and cruci fied Christ, a prophet who cries out against Church and society. That he may not just passively undergo life and history becomes clear when Cacciaguida sings the praises of Florence in those days when the city was still small and inspired by the best of the Roman soul and the gospel. The way in which Cacciaguida speaks of its degeneration (in line with Ciacco's story in Inf., 6,49-75) connects Dante's sociopolitical philosophy spiri- tuality of Nazareth and the cruci fied Jesus. In the golden era, the various 50 Logister families constituted a tight community, lived in peace, and formed a pure and temperate town (Par., 15,99; cf. 130-132). But without frugality and chastity, life degenerates. Life should be unpretentious, people should not lose themselves in outward show, luxurious homes, they should dress frugally and not make too much of their ancestry (16,1 ff. and 45). Cacciaguida complains of child mar- riages and the related greed, and about men who conduct their trade far from home. The ideal is a republican, small-scaled, autochthonous town (16,51) in which loyalty, love of family, and home industry rule, where the dead are bur- ied close to their loved ones and a culture of storytelling provides identity, a country with autonomous towns and rural areas run by nobility - under the leadership of an emperor who is not driven by the lust for power and pro fit and by a pope who protects the spiritual heritage and acts as a critical prophet without striving for political power. In a similar way, Dante comments on the crusades. He believes the Holy Land is important as the area where the memory of the lives of Jesus and Mary is preserved. That is why it should be open to pilgrims. But how can this goal be achieved? Dante sides with St. Francis who did not attempt to gain entry to the Holy Land by raising an army, but by testifying to the poor Jesus. In his thirst for martyrdom he preached Christ and the apostles in the proud presence of the Sultan of Egypt (11,100-102). Allusions to St. Francis's call to unconditionally follow the Cruci fied Jesus illustrate Dante's view of the crusades. Its partici- pants should take their orders from Christ and follow in his footsteps. Does this exclude the clash and din of battle? Dante does not state so apodictically, but the suggestion is there. 6 Conclusion The fact that Dante must arm himself with provedenza , reminds us of Saint Paul's letter to the Ephesians: 6,11: \"Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes\". A bit further, in verses 14 to 17, the apostle explains this as follows: Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.51 Dante on Conversion and Belief in Providence Dante should not allow himself to be led by fortuna with its quirks and whims, but by the way in which God has disclosed himself in Scripture and the saints. Belief in provedenza focuses our attention on the way of life that Christ choses for him. Arming himself with provedenza means following in his footsteps, even if this leads to con flicts with various people. By frankly expressing his opinion, not glossing over the fact that life is often none too bright, and testify- ing to his experiences in the hereafter, the Comedy assumes the air of a Bible commentary. It can teach the reader about his own path of conversion. Unlike the celestials, earthly beings do not fully share in the equilibrium of God. Imitating the Cruci fied Jesus often does not sit well with us, with our spontaneous ideas, feelings, and ambitions. In every stage of life we encounter new obstacles and wonder whether we are still on the right track. With a dis- cerning mind and inspired by the Bible, Dante needs to discover what imitation of the Lamb means for him. Thanks to Christ and Mary, he can approach \"the depth of God's proveder \" (Par., 17,37). With respect to the saints, Bernard of Clairvaux said that \"it is fitting that God's lofty light crown them with grace, as much as each one merits, according to the color of their hair\" (32,70-72). Through no merit of their own good works (73), but thanks to the perfect bap- tism in Christ (83) - perfect because his baptism, resulting in his death on the cross, better complies with divine law than circumcision does. This makes Dante realize that access to the Holy Land, to the gospel, and to God must be brought about without military force. As a poet he must use the power of words. He must speak out and be unrelenting in his exposure of evil states of affairs and ideologies. That signs of God are to be found in the world is obvious for Dante. In the Bible, he reads about places and moments in which life in freedom, equality, and peace light up and stir the desire to realize this, in spite of the vicissitudes of fortune. Without specifying things down to the last detail, God is nearby in the Scriptures and the saints. Without answering all our questions, Christ brings to light what real creativity is like. Dante had better arm himself with the provedenza that thus comes to light. This discernment is a decisive moment in the process of his conversion. 9 9 This article is written in cooperation with Dr. Cia van Woezik, who also translated the original Dutch version.52 Logister transl. and ed. by R.

Marcel Sarot 1 Introduction In a recent book, the British Roman Catholic theologian Gavin D'Costa sug- gests that the doctrine of the descent into hell has repercussions for the question of whether believers from other religions can attain salvation. 1 In his own words, \"the descent explains ... how the fruits of the cross are applied to those before Christ and can continue to explain how the fruits of the cross can be applied analogically to those living before Christ, even if they are chrono- logically living after Christ\" (179-180). The analogy that D'Costa is drawing here is that between Jews who, living and dying before Jesus, had not been reached by His message and thus had not been capable of reacting to it, and followers of other religions who have not been reached by Jesus's message and thus not been capable of reacting to it. In order to enable us to understand the analogy as D'Costa intends it, let me first explain his view of the descent into hell. I shall do so in four propositions: First of all, between His death and His Resurrection, Christ visited the limbo of the Fathers (166-174); There He preached the Gospel to those who had died before the Incarnation and guided them into heaven (168, 173); Thus, thirdly, Christ liberated the just and proclaimed His power by drawing the Fathers into heaven (166); Finally, \"His descent was glorious, and Christ did not su ffer the pain proper to any of the abodes of hell\" (166). 2 In the first proposition it is made clear that D'Costa interprets 'hell' in the doctrine of the descent into hell not in its strict sense (the place where the 1 G. D'Costa, Christianity and World Religions: Disputed Questions in the Theology of Religions (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), 161-211. In the following, the numbers between brackets in the main text refer to this book. I would like to thank my colleague Dr. Harm Goris for first drawing my attention to this text. D'Costa was born in Nairobi, Kenya, and is of Catholic Goan (Goans are an ethno-linguistic group in India) descent. 2 This phrase is quoted with approval by D'Costa from A.L. Pitstick, Light in Darkness: Hans Urs von Balthasar and the Catholic Doctrine of Christ's Descent into Hell (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2007), 342. D'Costa gives a longer quote from Pitstick, from which I took the idea to structure his view of the descent of Christ into four propositions. I changed the wording of the first three propositions, however, in light of D'Costa's subsequent exposition. condemned are eternally punished), nor in the sense of purgatory (\"a place of puri fication, where those who die in a state of grace and without mortal sin, but with venial sin, undergo puri fication and expiate their sins\" [166]), nor the limbo of the unbaptised children. Instead, Christ visited the limbo \"where the just who lived before Christ await their redemption. The limbo of the just is thought of as empty after Christ's descent to the just\" (166). It is empty, since only the just were there, and these were certain to let themselves be guided into heaven when confronted with Jesus's preaching, as is clear in the second proposition. Thus, though their final state changes (they are leaving the limbo of the Fathers and entering heaven), this is no post-mortem conversion; the orientation towards the good that guided their earthly lives as it were implies their decision to let themselves be guided into heaven once Christ has descended. Be this as it may, D'Costa builds on his interpretation of the descent to make a point about believers from other religions. If it is part of the meaning of Jesus's descent into hell that Jesus made His redemption available to the Jews, who, because of the time of their birth (and death), might be considered to be beyond its reach, this must have a wider signi ficance. It seems to imply that the limits of God's grace are not determined by the contingencies of His creatures' births. Now D'Costa is a specialist in the theology of religions and interreli- gious dialogue. One of the questions in that field of expertise that continues to bother people is this: the adherence of people to a speci fic religion is largely determined by the contingencies of the time and place of their births. Now if that is the case, can it really be true that a just God would favour the believers of one religion above those of another? To phrase this problem more sharply: can it be true that only the believers in one religion, i.e., Christianity, will be awarded salvation? D'Costa argues that if the doctrine of the descent shows that God's salvi fic will is not limited by the contingencies of the time of birth - before or after Christ - it may well be the case that God's salvi fic will is not limited by the contingencies of the place of birth either. The analogy that D'Costa draws, then, is an analogy of being born at the wrong time to being born in at the wrong place. For D'Costa, those being born in at the wrong place are \"analogically living before Christ\" , and the doctrine of the descent suggests, he argues, that their final state will be \"resolved post mortem\" (161). He is aware of the fact that we enter a mine field of sensitive issues here and tries to steer clear of these. He explains that the \"notion of a second chance, a conversion after death, was to become unacceptable in the Latin Western tra- dition after Augustine's emphatic denial of such a possibility, and it disappears from the commentary tradition after the fourth century\" (169). For Augustine, \"someone who is destined for damnation at death cannot be saved by an event 55 Post -Mortem Conversion ? that takes place after death\" (172). The tradition met this concern by claiming that Christ did not visit hell, but the limbo of the just (the limbo patrorum ). In that case, \"no conversion is required but a completion of the person's life and their destiny\" (173). Furthermore, \"it would be right to say that the person is destined for salvation, and the descent employs Christological resources to throw light upon how that might be envisaged\" (172). There would be 'adequate continuity' (173) between the just life of the person and the post-mortem choice for Christ. D'Costa squarely sides with the tradition here, and accepts Alyssa Lyra Pitstick's claim that \"Christ descended ... only to the limbo of the Fathers\" (166). He explores new ground, however, when he claims that the situ- ation of just people from other religions who were born after Christ is analogous to the situation of the Old Testament Fathers. In both cases, he sees in their justice and their focus on the good an ontological orientation towards Christ that only waits for its epistemic complement to become fully fledged faith. As the doctrine of the descent shows, Christ's proclamation might enable the just to make explicit their ontological orientation epistemically even after-death (164). In this way, \"the limbo of the just conceptually explains the entry of non- Christians into a relationship with Christ and his church\" (177) and their salvation is indeed resolved post-mortem. Altogether, D'Costa puts forward a new and creative proposal that neverthe- less builds squarely on the Catholic tradition. It will form the starting point of my re flections here that will focus on two issues. My first question will be to what extent D'Costa succeeds in avoiding the assertion of the possibility of post-mortem conversions. He obviously tries to avoid this assertion, but it is not clear that he can succeed in doing so while simultaneously claiming that believers in Judaism and other religions can, after their death, be drawn towards Christ and saved by him. Is this not tantamount to claiming the pos- sibility of post-mortem conversion to Christianity? After having discussed this question, I will discuss the question of whether, once one starts to reckon with a class of people living analogously before Christ, this class should not be wid- ened beyond the group of believers from other religions. 2 Post-mortem Conversion? Post-mortem conversion has not always been a problem for Christians. The author of 1 Peter wrote the following extraordinary text:56 Sarot (18)Christ himself died once and for all for sins, the upright for the sake of the guilty, to lead us to God. In the body he was put to death, in the spirit he was raised to life, (19)and, in the spirit, he went to preach to the spirits in prison. (20) They refused to believe long ago, while God patiently waited to receive them, in Noah's time when the ark was being built. In it only a few, that is eight souls, were saved through water (1 Peter 3:18-20). The principal Church Fathers of the first three centuries were inclined to read this text as referring to the descent of Christ. According to them, in the descent Christ preached to the dead with a view to converting them. 3 For Clement of Alexandria (ca. 150-ca. 215), the question was not whether such post-mortem preaching and conversion was possible, but whether it also applied to gentiles. His answer was: Yes, at least in this sense that if Christ Himself did not preach to them, His apostles would. 4 Apparently, for him, the gentiles were in this respect on a par with the Jews: If they turned to Christ, this counted as a con- version. Now that we have seen that Clement argued that the descent of Christ aimed at the conversion of both Jews and gentiles, it does not come as a sur- prise that Origen (184/5-253/4), well known for his universalist inclinations, saw in the descent into hell one of the means that Christ uses to obtain this universal salvation. 5 The first to e ffectively oppose this idea of post-mortem conversion was Augustine. As D'Costa has it, \"Clement's notion of a second chance, a conver- sion after death, was to become unacceptable in the Latin Western tradition after Augustine's emphatic denial of such a possibility, and it disappears from the commentary tradition after the fourth century\" (169). 6 According to Augustine, Christ's preaching to the spirits in prison took place at the time of Noah, before the incarnation , 'in the Spirit' (1 Peter 3:19). 7 In the time of Noah, Christ went to preach to those who refused to believe. As we have seen, D'Costa accepts Augustine's denial. He does not explain, however, let alone evaluate, Augustine's arguments. Since Augustine has in this respect been so in fluential, and since his rejection lies at the root of the idea that the 'hell' to which Christ 3 P. Callon, \"Descente 659. 4 Clement of Alexandria, Stromata , VI 6. On the post-mortem preaching of the apostles, see also The Shepherd of Hermas Parables 93 [= IX 16], 5-7. 5 Contra Celsum II 43. 6 Thus also Callon, \"Descente\" , 660. 7 Augustine, Letter 164, V 16.57 Post -Mortem Conversion ? descended can only have been the limbo of the Fathers, it seems useful to have a look at Augustine's objections against post-mortem conversion. Once we try to retrieve Augustine's arguments, however, we soon under- stand why D'Costa is so silent on his arguments. The texts that we find references to in the literature 8 are conspicuous for their lack of arguments. In his City of God (XXI.17)9 Augustine argues against \"those who fancy that no man shall be punished eternally\". This amounts to the certainty of post-mortem conversion for those who did not complete their earthly lives as convinced Christians, a rather stronger position than the mere possibility of post-mortem conversion. Some arguments against the certainty of post-mortem conversion, however, would also be e ffective against the mere possibility. That would be the case, for example, when Augustine argued for its impossibility. I am afraid that this is not what he does. Augustine's argument is a not too strong version of the slippery slope argument: If God in His mercy would save all humanity, why wouldn't God save all angels and even the devil? But it does not follow, of course, that if God saves one type of creature, God would need to save all crea- tures. And in Letter 164 , which is entirely devoted to Christ's descent into hell and the interpretation of 1 Peter 3, he speaks about \"the di fficulties which pre- vent me from pronouncing any de finite opinion on the subject\" ( IV 10), 10 i.e. who were the spirits in prison to whom Christ went to preach? While he is obviously uneasy with the idea of post-mortem conversion, he certainly does not there de finitively exclude preaching to the dead or conversion in reaction to that. While I cannot be certain that Augustine does not provide more con- clusive arguments elsewhere that I have not yet found, it may be the case that he discouraged those who came after him in the Christian tradition from accepting post-mortem conversions without good arguments . When we look at the Catholic tradition after Augustine, we find that it is perhaps slightly more ambiguous than D'Costa suggests. On the one hand, life before death is taken to have de finitive signi ficance, and it is asserted that \"each man receives his eternal retribution in his immortal soul at the very moment of his death, in a particular judgment that refers his life to Christ: either entrance into the blessedness of heaven - through a puri fication or immediately - or immediate and everlasting damnation\" ( CCC 1021; cf. D'Costa 162). A fundamental rejection of God cannot be undone after death ( CCC 1035; cf. Lk. 16:19-31). On the other hand, praying for the dead is taken to be 8 Neither D'Costa nor Callon give speci fic references to Augustine in this connection. 9 This text is mentioned in this connection by J. Goetz, Conditional Futurism: New Perspec- tive of End-Time Prophecy (Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock, 2012), 135. 10 <http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102164.htm> (Accessed 14 December 2014).58 Sarot meaningful and, at least in some cases, it is assumed to make a di fference. The same applies to purgatory, which is often seen in terms of puri fication ( CCC 1031): that also may make a di fference. Now it seems strange and unsatisfactory to assume that these make a di fference to God's attitude only, so that God admits people to heaven who would not otherwise have arrived there, without some measure of change in the humans involved. Is it not implied in the very concept of puri fication that the people puri fied grow purer, in other words that they grow in their openness to God even after death? Now if that happened, would not that amount to a second chance, to some form of conversion? If we want to know whether the descent into hell - either in its original form (Christ visiting the Fathers) or in its analogous form (Christ inviting believers from other traditions post-mortem) - involves some form of conversion, we should first clarify the term 'conversion'. Lewis Rambo, one of the world's fore- most experts on conversion, notes that the basic meaning of the biblical terms for conversion ( shub , , and that one should always ask: from what to what? In the Old Testament, people con- vert from idols to the true God, or from some form of in fidelity to the covenant. In the New Testament, people turn from all sorts of conditions to Christ. More generally, Rambo distinguishes between four types of conversion: 1.Tradition transition: From one religious tradition to another; 2. Institutional transition: From one subgroup within a major tradition to another; 3. A ffiliation: From outside a religious group to inside it; 4. Intensi fication: From being a lukewarm believer to being an enthusiastic believer. In many cases, an encounter with a person or group plays a pivotal role. 11 To conclude our de finitions, we should also de fine definitive signi ficance. I pro- pose that we say that life on earth has de finitive signi ficance if and only if our speci fic condition after death would not be possible without the particular life we led before death. On this de finition, life before death does not have de fini- tive signi ficance if there is no life after death or if the real decisions are made only after death, and life before death has a function analogous to training for a match. Once these de finitions are in place, we can try to decide whether Christ's descent to hell involved post-mortem conversions. In the case of the turning to Christ of the Fathers of the old covenant, the answer depends on the question whether one sees the old covenant and the new one as one tradition, as two independent traditions, or as two subgroups within one tradition. Each of these positions can be and has been defended. Personally, I am inclined to see 11 L. Rambo, \"Conversion\" , Rodney Hunter (ed.), Dictionary of Pastoral Care and Counseling (Nashville: Abingdon, 1990), 228-230, esp. 228-229.59 Post -Mortem Conversion ? Judaism and Christianity as we today encounter them as two separate but par- allel developments on the basis of one root tradition. 12 In Jesus's time, however, the parting of the ways had not yet taken place, so that one might argue that if Jesus preached to them and thus drew them into heaven this neither involved a transition from one tradition to another, nor from one subgroup within a tradition to another subgroup. Nor do the other forms of conversion apply. Thus, the redemption of the Fathers does not involve a conversion. In the case of those living analogically before Christ, the situation is di ffer- ent, however. They do change from one religious tradition to another. And even if they implicitly knew Christ through an unconscious desire, or if - as Rahner claimed - \"the inner telos of every genuinely good and charitable act is oriented toward and presupposes God\" , 13 it seems di fficult to avoid the conclu- sion that believers from other religious traditions, who, after their deaths accept Christ, undergo some form of conversion. They turn from their own religious worldview to another, in which Christ holds centre stage. Though I am aware of the fact that further argument is possible, I am inclined to grant that we should speak of 'conversions' here. However, I am also inclined to believe that this need not be fatal for D'Costa's position, since as we have seen above, while the Catholic tradition has not been very outspoken about post- mortem conversion, it has been so on the question of the de finitive signi ficance of our earthly lives. This may not be given up, and much of the uneasiness with post-mortem conversion may well be caused by the intuition that accepting some form of post-mortem conversion implies giving up the de finitive signi fi- cance of our earthly life. This, however, may not be the case here. D'Costa, for one, seems to suggest that this de finitive signi ficance is not undermined here. What happens is not a break with life before death but \"a completion of the person's life and their destiny. There must be adequate continuity in the per- son's life for them to 'qualify' for being present in the limbo of the just\" (173). Aristotle and C.S. Lewis might help to explain how this might be the case. Aristotle claims that our acts help to form our characters: \"We learn a craft by producing the same product that we must produce when we have learned it - becoming builders by building, and harpists by playing the harp. So also, then, we become just by doing just actions, temperate by doing temperate actions, 12 See my Religie in de spiegel van het kwaad (Almere: Parthenon, 2012), 20-21. 13 D'Costa, Christianity and World Religions , 163, summarising a point made by Karl Rahner, \"Reflections on the Unity of the Love of Neighbour and the Love of God\" , Rahner, Theo- logical Investigations vol. 6 (London: Darton, Longman & Todd, 1969), 231-53.60 Sarot brave by doing brave actions\". 14 Following Aristotle's trail, in his Mere Christianity , C.S. Lewis discusses the importance of making the correct choices: Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little di fferent from what it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing either into a heavenly creature or into a hellish creature: either into a creature that is in harmony with God, and with other creatures, and with itself, or else into one that is in a state of war and hatred with God, and with its fellow- creatures, and with itself. 15 By our acts we form our characters, and once we have moulded our character in a speci fic form, acts that are incompatible with it become very hard for us, if not impossible, whereas acts that fit into this character come naturally to us. In this sense, the character that we achieve by the way we act has something definitive about it. If we apply this to those living analogically before Christ, we may understand how, on the one hand, the state in which they died has deci- sive signi ficance, while, on the other hand, the preaching of Christ could still make a di fference to them. Seen from a Christian perspective, believers from other religious traditions erred in a very public way. But it is not always those who openly err that are the most evil people. Immediately after the above quo- tation, Lewis discusses a similar point when he enters into an issue that always used to puzzle him in Christian authors: They talk about mere sins of thought as if they were immensely impor- tant: and then they talk about the most frightful murders and treacheries as if you had only got to repent and all would be forgiven. But I have come to see that they are right. What they are always thinking of is the mark which the action leaves on that tiny central self which no one sees in this life but which each of us will have to endure - or enjoy - for ever. One man may be so placed that his anger sheds the blood of thousands, and another so placed that however angry he gets he will only be laughed at. But the little mark on the soul may be much the same in both. Each has done something to himself which, unless he repents, will make it harder for him to keep out of the rage next time he is tempted, and will make the rage worse when he does fall into it. Each of them, if he seriously turns to 14 Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics , 1103a-b (tr. Terence Fontana, 19585), 82-83.61 Post -Mortem Conversion ? God, can have that twist in the central man straightened out again: each is, in the long run, doomed if he will not. Applied to believers from other religious traditions, the mark on the soul that their faith has left need not have made them into malevolent people. In most cases, that is even unlikely, because the precepts and teachings of other reli- gions \"often re flect a ray of enlightens all men\" ( Nostra Aetate , 2). If other religions indeed re flect rays of the Truth given to humanity in Christ, it may be argued that they can function as praeparationes evangelicae that prepared their believers for the message of Christ. As a result, they will be open to it when it reaches them after their deaths, so that it can make a real difference to them. I conclude that what Aristotle and C.S. Lewis have to say about character formation may help us to understand how we can assert that those who lived analogically before Christ, when visited by Christ after their deaths, like once the Patriarchs during the descent, may convert to Christ and be saved by Him. They do so not in spite of their earthly life, but as a result of it. Their religious traditions have, by the rays of Truth they contain, prepared them for the encounter with Christ. Thus, their earthly lives do have de finitive signi ficance - but in another, more positive way than Christians used to think in the past. 3 People Living Analogously Before Christ In an obvious and laudable attempt to remain within the bounds of the Catholic tradition - an attempt that in my view is successful - D'Costa is rela- tively restrictive with respect to the class of people who receive a post-mortem visit by Christ. As I pointed out above, according to D'Costa, only the just Jews who were born before Christ received a visit during the descent, and when he delineates the class of people living analogously before Christ, he restricts it to people from other religions who have lived good lives (162). In both cases, how- ever, there are reasons to throw the net somewhat wider. In the case of the descent into hell, much depends on the question which biblical texts one interprets as dealing with it. With the early Church Fathers, I take 1 Peter 3:19- 20 to be about the descent: \"In the spirit, he went to preach to the spirits in prison. They refused to believe long ago, while God patiently waited to receive them, in Noah's time when the ark was being built\". If this text is about the descent, however, it certainly does not state that Christ went to the place where only those within the old covenant who were righteous without further quali- fication were waiting for their redemption. Here again, Jesus came for the 62 Sarot sinners rather than for the just. 16 This does not imply, of course, that all those whom Jesus visited were taken by Him into heaven. As we have seen, the reac- tion of those visited by Jesus must have depended on the ways in which they had moulded their characters during their earthly lives; only the just were pre- pared to accept Jesus as their Saviour. Also in the case of the class of people living analogously before Christ, I see reason to throw the net somewhat wider. My arguments in this case are inde- pendent of my arguments in the previous paragraph. The analogy between the just Patriarchs and the believers from other religions who lived a good life is based on the fact that in both cases Christ was not available to people who had lived good lives. I would like to suggest here, that once one starts to draw this analogy, one must broaden it further. The class of people who live good lives but to whom Christ is not available is broader than that of those who have been brought up within other religions and who have never even heard the name of Christ or seen the sign of the Cross. It is broader in at least the follow- ing two respects. Those who have been raised within another religion and who have heard of Christ but to whom the choice for Christ and His Church has never been presented as a live option, one might argue, are also included here. 17 The same may even apply to some who live in the Western world but who are brought up and continue to live in circles in which Christianity is so misrepre- sented that it seems an option from a past era only, and no longer a live option that sensible people of our time may choose. While I do not think that it is pos- sible to give clear criteria that help to distinguish unwaveringly between those to whom Christianity has been presented as a live option and those to whom it has not - in the end, I think, it is up to God and not to us to decide who has had a fair chance to choose for Christ and who has not - I consider it important to state explicitly that even in the Western world, Christianity no longer is a live option for all of us. Looking around me in the Netherlands, I am afraid that this applies to a larger percentage of young people than previous generations would have considered possible. Finally, I would like to suggest that the anal- ogy may even apply to some who have been baptised and brought up as Christians. I am thinking here of those cases in which representatives of the 16 I have argued this point in more detail in my \"The Scope of Redemption\". For an excellent summary of the discussion of various interpretations of 1 Peter 3:18-22, see C.E. Laufer, Hell's Destruction: An Exploration to the Dead (Farnham: Ashgate, 2013), 11-15. 17 I should state here that it is not entirely clear to me whether D'Costa would disagree with me here. The way in which he discusses the analogy with the descent seems to suggest that he does, but I do not think that he explicitly says so.63 Post -Mortem Conversion ? Church by sexual or other misbehaviour made Christianity psychologically unavailable to their victims, because these associated Christianity with misbe- haviour rather than with Christ. Here again, it is not up to us to judge; God will know. To all of these cases, I think, article 16 of the conciliar decree Lumen gentium applies: \"nor does Divine Providence deny the helps necessary for sal- vation to those who, without blame on their part, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God and with His grace strive to live a good life. Whatever good or truth is found amongst them is looked upon by the Church as a prepa- ration for the Gospel\". In all of these cases, however, even if an explicit choice for Christ before death does not seem strictly necessary for salvation, one's earthly life contin- ues to have de finitive signi ficance. What we have said above about the logic of character formation explains, I think, that each life is a preparation either for acceptance or for rejection of Christ. The character of those to whom Christianity has been so misrepresented that it is not culturally available to them may nevertheless be genuinely good and thus implicitly directed towards God, a direction that can only become explicit in an encounter with Christ. And also those who have been raised as Christians but put o ff by unchristian behaviour, may again be genuinely directed towards the good even while explicitly rejecting Christianity. They may need a direct confrontation with Christ to become aware that while seemingly rejecting Christ, they had not been rejecting Christ Himself but misrepresentations of Christ by unworthy Christians. In all of these cases the earthly lives of those involved have decisive signi ficance: if they had not been directed towards the good, they would not have engendered post-mortem openness towards Christ. Moreover, in all of these cases the redemption is only achieved through Christ, even if the con- frontation with Christ takes place only post-mortem. 4 Conclusions Gavin D'Costa argues that if Christ did not reject the just Patriarchs because they were born at the wrong time, he will not reject believers from other reli- gions because they were born at the wrong place. Thus, their salvation will be resolved post-mortem. While supporting this position, I have argued that D'Costa fails in his attempt to avoid the implication of a post-mortem conver- sion. If believers from other religions who lived good lives will in a post-mortem encounter with Christ recognise Him as their Saviour, this would in fact amount to some form of post-mortem conversion. I have also argued, however, that this may be less problematic than D'Costa assumes, since the Catholic 64 Sarot tradition asserts the de finitive signi ficance of each earthly life rather than the impossibility of post-mortem conversions. On the basis of what Aristotle and C.S. Lewis have said about the consequences of individual acts for character formation, I have argued that it is possible to show that the post-mortem acceptance of Christ, of which D'Costa assumes that it is possible for believers from other religions who lived good lives, is a consequence of these lives rather than a turning away from them. Thus, their earthly lives retain de finitive sig- nificance. Finally, I have suggested that once one begins to identify a group of people who live analogically before Christ, this group cannot be restricted to believers from other religions who lived a good life. The group of \"those who, without blame on their part, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God and with His grace strive to live a good life\" ( LG 16) is larger and may include believers from other religions and even, in extreme cases, people who have been raised as Christians. 18 Bibliography Callon, P.

David Jones , In Parenthesis 1 1 Introduction The twentieth century has seen a rich tradition of writers and artists who con- verted to Catholicism. Some of them are now part of the canon of modern world literature, like G.K. Chesterton, Julien Green, Graham Greene, Ernst J\u00fcnger, Muriel Spark and Evelyn Waugh. Some of these authors wrote explic- itly about their conversion and their Catholic beliefs, and they considered their authorship to be an important expression of their faith. This small wave of converted Catholic artists is all the more remarkable because they lived in an age in which Catholicism seemed destined to become a mere footnote to the history of twentieth-century art. That in itself was a rather remarkable devel opment, considering the dominant role the Catholic Church had played in the history of western art for centuries. Despite this cultural shift, which increasingly seemed to position the Catholic Church and the art world against each other, a Catholic elite came about that chose to testify to its beliefs and emphatically express them, for everyone to see. 2 Nowadays, the intimate connection between art and Catholicism would be considered by many as something from the past. Secularization and the con- comitant suspicion towards religious traditions have obviously contributed to the marginalization of Catholic culture. Apart from sociological views on the 1 D.

Schloesser, Jazz Age Catholicism: Mystic Modernism and Postwar Paris - 1919-1933 (Toronto: University Toronto , 2016 |doi 10.1163/9789004319165 _00766 Van Erp changing role of religions in the modern era, art history itself also o ffers expla- nations for this development. In the nineteenth century, many artists had already freed themselves from various religious attachments and engagements. With the famous dictum l'Art pour l'Art , the arts declared their autonomy. Any form of partisanship was dismissed as an unwanted addition or a distraction from what art should really be about: not about content, but about the form of the work of art itself, or at most the exposure of reality in as far as it was a dis- tortion of the pure form that could only be realized in a work of art. This had quite dramatic e ffects on the relation between art and the Church, which had been rather close up to that point. Instead of as works of art, the Church and its liturgy were increasingly regarded as romantic forms from a nostalgic past, not least while the Church had cultivated them as such, be it for emancipatory reasons. There are many examples of sentimental neo-styles that tried to copy the old glory of Catholicism, like the Gothic Revival or Victorian Romanticism. In retrospect, rather than restoring the relation between the Catholic Church and the arts, these schools have widened the chasm. The Catholic Church has had a hard time keeping up with the visual idiom of modern art, even when some artists expressly started to re-engage with poli- tics and religion. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church had become quite a strong influence in Europe and in several countries. It now formed its own socio- political group with its own culture. Occasionally, this led to a certain complacency that could easily be a fforded. If ever a need for renewal was expressed, these were certainly no prominent voices. Architecture was the one remarkable exception to this trend. Throughout the twentieth century there are important examples of modern Church architecture, which have gained their rightful place in the modern history of art. Incidentally, the designs were mostly by non-Catholic architects like Le Corbusier or more recently Renzo Piano. There are very few comparable examples in painting and sculpture. As mentioned before, literature did however see a whole generation of famous Catholic writers, often converts. They were not so much appreciated for their Catholicism, however - with the notable exception of G.K. Chesterton - and their works were usually not considered to be 'Catholic art'. Regardless, there were quite a few authors who expressly paraded their Catholic faith. 3 The question that now presents itself is what motivated those converts. What made them decide to engage with Catholicism? The answer to that question is di fferent in each individual case, and it is usually of a political, bio- graphical or psychological nature. But were there any theological reasons? The story of Catholicism in the rapidly changing culture of the twentieth century 3 D. Gioia, \"The Catholic Writer Today\" Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion will be more exhaustive if closer attention is paid to the way in which these converts experienced and expressed their relationship with God. The modern historiography of Catholicism has hardly paid any attention to it, as it is gen- erally believed that the experience of God can only be expressed in complex metaphysical or dogmatic terms that almost nobody understands anymore. The implication is that the historian should study the practical or material aspects of faith in order to show that this faith has not been imposed by some authority and is in fact something entirely di fferent from what theology wants us to believe. Although this might have been the case in some instances, the opposite has also been true. In the following, I hope to show that some conver- sions in the twentieth century illustrate that doctrine and lived faith go hand in hand. 4 2 David Jones: Soldier and Painter The developments in Catholicism in the past century can be characterized by a growing awareness of the coherence of faith, on the one hand, and history and the context in which that faith is lived and testi fied to on the other. In this chapter I will illustrate this by presenting a portrait of David Jones, a British soldier in the First World War who painted and wrote poetry about his experi- ences during that war. He is virtually unknown outside of Britain where he is considered to be one of the main modernist writers, alongside T.S. Eliot and James Joyce. Shortly after the Great War, he converted to Catholicism. He did not convert because the faith would help him cope with the horrors of the war. Rather, he engaged with the Catholic tradition through his encounters with friends. Only after his conversion, the Catholic vision o ffered him a di fferent perspective on the brutal reality of war. This newly obtained vision did not contradict the horror, but instead showed him the inescapable meaning of it, and challenged him to respond with a creative answer. Early Life Walter David Jones was born on 1 November 1895 in Brockley, Kent, which is today one of the suburbs of south London. 5 His father belonged to the lower middle class, originally came from North Wales and worked as a foreman at the printers' o ffice of a Christian publisher. His mother was a teacher from London. 4 Cf. S. van Erp, De onvoltooide eeuw: Voorlopers van een katholieke Maker Unmade (Bridgend: Seren, 2003).68 Van Erp David's parents attended an Anglican Church. His mother preferred the rather intellectually oriented High Church, which had a lavishly decorated liturgy not unlike that of Roman Catholic churches. Nevertheless, the family attended an evangelical community, because David's father was a lay preacher there. David had an elder brother and sister. His brother Harold died of tuberculosis when he was twenty-one, just as David, who was fourteen at the time, was about to attend the arts academy in Camberwell. His parents would remain in Brockley for the rest of their lives and David, who would never marry, regularly returned to his parental home. After his death on 28 October 1974, he was buried with his parents in the Brockley and Ladywell Cemetery, where the tomb he designed himself, can still be visited. 6 David grew up in a family that attached great importance to the written word. His father worked for the Christian Herald Company and often brought home books and magazines. The Church they attended had a liturgy that reserved a prominent role for preaching and exegesis. Like his mother however, young David was sensitive to religious imagery. When at an early age he asked what guardian angels were, his father answered that there was no proof of the existence of such angels in the Bible. That did not stop David from exploring his fascination with what he would later call the 'Catholic imagination'. As a boy, he developed a lasting love for the stories about King Arthur, the legendary and noble knight who defended Britain against the Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries. His father preferred the Arthurian stories from the Mabinogion , a Welsh manuscript of the fourteenth century that contains older stories about King Arthur than the more famous collection by Sir Thomas Mallory, compiled a century later. Apart from the stories about Arthur, the Mabinogion also contained myths and legends from the pre-Christian Welsh culture. The Gaelic and Welsh culture his father introduced him to at an early age by teaching him the language and buying books about Welsh history for him, caused Jones to feel ambivalent about his roots, which were, after all, both English and Welsh. Later in his life, he would spend longer periods in Wales and get to know his Welsh heritage much more closely. Besides his love of reading and his religious and mythological imagination, David turned out to be an exceptional draughtsman at a very young age. His parents encouraged this. His father had him copy cartoons from the newspa- pers and they entered his drawings for competitions and exhibitions, where they would occasionally find a real audience. Nevertheless, his parents were 6 Director Derek Shiel and producer Adam Alive have filmed three biographical portraits of David Jones: 1. In Search of David Jones: Artist, Soldier, Poet (2008); 2. David Jones Between the Wars: The Years of Achievement (2012); and 3. David Jones: Innovation and Consolidation (2014).69 Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion not immediately convinced that he should go to an art school when David expressed this wish. He insisted, however, and at the age of fourteen he went to the nearby Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts . Sketches of the War At eleven p.m. on the fourth of August 1914, Great Britain declared war upon Germany. Jones tried to enlist as a soldier, but was sent away due to his short stature and his slim chest size. The war would escalate rapidly during the first few months, however. The number of casualties grew fast, and the British gov- ernment had to recruit more and more young men. On 19 December 1915, Jones found himself in the trenches of Neuve Chapelle, where the previous year had seen a massive battle that had not succeeded in shifting the front-line. 7 Jones was a reasonably apt soldier, but he showed no ambition. He would be awarded some decorations later on, but on the whole he was often spared by the others on account of his weak physique. During an interview later in life, his sister told the reporter that other soldiers used to carry his ri fle, because it was too heavy for him. Given the opportunity, Jones would rather work on his draw- ings. His first sketches from Belgium and Northern France show 'everyday life' in the trenches. In Normandy, he would draw the villages his regiment passed through. Again, he seems to have a keen eye for the atmosphere and displayed a concrete sensibility that he would later show in his poetic magnum opus on the war, In Parenthesis , where he describes the e ffects of a heavy explosion dur- ing that same period: He stood alone on the stones, his mess-tin spilled at his feet. Out of the vortex, ri fling the air it came - bright, brass-shod, Pandoran; with hall- filling screaming the howling crescendo's up-piling snapt. The universal world, breath held, one half second, a bludgeoned stillness. Then the pent violence released a consummation of all burstings out; all sudden up-rendings and rivings-through - all taking-out of vents - all barrier- breaking - all unmaking. Pernitric begetting - the dissolving and splitting of solid things. 8 Jones's regiment moved south from Neuve Chapelle to take part in the battle of the Somme. During that battle, his division was ordered to perform a frontal attack on the German troops entrenched in the woods. The Germans had laid booby traps and Jones got injured in his left leg. He managed to crawl back to 7 Th. Dilworth, David Jones in the Great War (London: Enitharmon Press, 2012). 8 Jones, In Parenthesis , 24.70 Van Erp the field hospital and was shipped back to England shortly after. After several months of convalescence, he returned to France. Jones, by now considerably weakened, concentrated mainly on drawing his fellow soldiers while they were preparing for battle, cleaning their kit, or doz- ing o ff from hunger and exhaustion. His drawing was sketchy and impressionist, which seems to make sense, considering how little time there was to draw the soldiers. Apart from that, Jones would draw anything he saw around him: from landscapes and village streets to the equipment that was used and the rats they shot in the trenches. His drawings are remarkable for their calm, their balance, their accuracy, and their depiction of the banal. They are best compared to the works of an early Vincent van Gogh or Piet Mondriaan. He does, however, dif- fer from these forerunners in one respect. The landscape the young David Jones learned to draw was that of the war, and remarkably, he would show its triviality and humanity, rather than its horrors. Eucharist at the Front In April 1915, his battalion was issued with steel helmets, which reminded David of the kettle hat, the headgear of the medieval foot soldiers in the King Arthur stories he loved so much. During the war, propaganda posters would often depict soldiers as knights. The soldiers themselves were told that in their sacri fice, they were closely connected to their predecessors in great historical battles, like those of Blenheim, Badajoz, Waterloo, Sebastopol and Ladysmith. That bloody past was often, and to some e ffect, romanticized and heroically depicted. Jones would later write that in the trenches he experienced a strange metamorphosis of feeling that made him conscious of the reality, the gravity, and the urgency of the situation in which they found themselves. He would feel connected to the whole of history. In his poetry on the war, he would regu- larly refer to historical and legendary battles, not because he wanted to remind the reader of those heroic theatres of war, but because he saw the men around him behave like those past heroes. On a rainy Sunday morning during his posting in France - in 1917 - David was looking for firewood in the woods. Near a barn he saw some old wooden wheels, and he expected to find more and drier wood inside that barn. When he looked into the barn through a crack between the boards, he saw the rest- less flames of two candles. After his eyes had become used to the darkness, he could see a man in an alb standing behind an ammunition crate, over which a white cloth had been draped. On it were the two candles that shone their warm glow onto the golden-coloured chasuble. The muddied khaki of the uniforms of a couple of soldiers was also lit by the flames of the candles. He recognized two of the infantry soldiers: an Italian from London who had a heavy cockney 71 Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion accent, and a truculent Irishman who was usually drunk. He was struck by the sight of these two men kneeling. A little bell rang out and for a moment and David was engrossed by this scene, until he realized that this was a Catholic mass being celebrated. Because he was not familiar with the ritual, Jones felt like an intruder who had stumbled upon a mysterious cult. He did not stay to watch, but turned to go. 9 This brief moment in the woods made quite an impression on him. The sur- roundings and the barn reminded him of the birth of Christ, and the dedication of the soldiers and the intimate atmosphere prompted him to think of the Last Supper. He would later claim that never during an Anglican Eucharist had he experienced the unity he had felt between those men in that barn during the Great War, so close to the front line. Later, he would describe the Eucharist as a form in which the unity of the whole can be experienced, exactly what the art- ist, he believed, is always looking for. In February 1918 he was struck down by trench fever and again transported to England. On 11 September 1918, after more than four years, the war ended. But Jones's war was not over yet. He had meanwhile been shipped to Limerick in Ireland to recover, and he would not return home until February 1919. Although by then he had been back from France for about a year, he was still tired from the war. The loud explosions seemed to have shaken him to the core. Apart from the penetratingly loud bangs that seemed to have lodged them- selves in his body, he never discussed his experiences with anyone. He would only do so much later. In a letter home, he does mention, however, that he can no longer enjoy poetry. Jones had continued to read poetry during the war, despite the mockery of his fellow soldiers, who considered reading poetry to be a very e ffeminate thing. During his time in the trenches he would read on imperturbably, but at the end of the war, he could no longer muster the con- centration needed for attentive reading, and as a consequence, he could no longer enjoy poetry. For Christmas 1919, he designed a nostalgic Christmas card showing a sol- dier returning home to his wife. This drawing is very much out of tune with the rest of his work. This image is a clich\u00e9 and lacks any connection to the daily life that had been so typical of his drawings from the war years. The soldier in the Christmas card looks like one of the crusaders on the wartime propaganda posters. The vitality of Jones's earlier work has vanished and he seems to su ffer from depression. Here, one can see how he now draws soldiers as if they are ghosts in a dream-world that bears no resemblance to the everyday life that 9 Dilworth, David Jones in the Great War , 151-152.72 Van Erp had been manifest in his drawings from the trenches. Calm and accuracy have given way to drama, fear and confusion. 3 A Conversion to Style? Becoming a Catholic Artist After the war, Jones enrolled at a new arts academy, the Westminster School of Art, which at that time was much better than the one in Camberwell. Westminster is in the borough of Victoria, which is also home to the Roman Catholic cathedral of London where Jones used to spend his lunchtime. This cathedral had just been fitted with Eric Gill's Stations of the Cross, to which Jones was very much drawn. Gill (1882-1940), now a controversial artist because of his morally reprehensible life-style, was by then a famous graphic artist and sculptor who had converted to Catholicism in 1913. 10 Arts and Crafts: Encountering Eric Gill Initially, Gill trained in architecture and typography, but he would become famous for his sculpture and reliefs that were characterized by sharp yet flow- ing lines that showed some a ffinity with art deco . Gill also wrote pamphlets and lectured on art and labour. After a socialist and politically active period, he became a lay Dominican with the support and the guidance of Vincent McNabb, a famous Dominican theologian of that period. The socially engaged McNabb was known for his addresses at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park every Sunday morning. Every week he would preach about the tenets of Catholic social doctrine as they had been laid down by Leo xiii in his encyclical Rerum Novarum (1891), a document McNabb liked to quote: (...) some opportune remedy must be found quickly for the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class: For the ancient workingmen's guilds were abolished in the last century, and no other protective organization took their place. Public institutions and the laws set aside the ancient religion. Hence, by degrees it has come to pass that working men have been surrendered, isolated and helpless, to the hardheartedness of employers and the greed of unchecked compe- tition. The mischief has been increased by rapacious usury, which, although more than once condemned by the Church, is nevertheless, under a di fferent guise, but with like injustice, still practiced by covetous and grasping men. To this must be added that the hiring of labour and the 10 F. MacCarthy, Eric Gill (London: Faber and Faber, 1989).73 Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion conduct of trade are concentrated in the hands of comparatively few; so that a small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the teeming masses of the labouring poor a yoke little better than that of slav- ery itself. 11 Inspired by this highly critical, Catholic vision of society, labour and money, Gill decided to withdraw from society with a group of fellow artists to live in a community that had some contemplative and religious characteristics and lived o ff the land. Unlike an actual religious community, however, this group was meant for lay people who did not commit to the community by means of religious vows. For Gill, it was not so much the new Catholic engagement with the proletariat that appealed to him, although as a socialist he obviously shared that engagement. He was mainly interested in the religious vision of labour and craft. It had many aspects in common with that of the Arts and Crafts Movement , to which Gill belonged. This was a protest movement that started in the nineteenth century, which objected to the degrading consequences of industrialization. Gill believed Leo XIII had added an important religious dimension to the Catholic faith, particularly with the idea that whatever is made with human hands may never lead to usury or slavery, and that the pro- duction process, including the worker and the product, should be seen in the light of its sacred origins, the Creator of the world, who will sanctify it all. 12 In Gill, Jones recognized his own dedication to art, and Gill's vision of labour, strongly founded on his Catholic beliefs, also appealed to him. During his time at the Westminster art academy, Jones returned daily to the cathedral to study Gill's reliefs. In his own work, he strived for a similarly mod- est and elegant way of drawing soldiers, preferably in a religious setting. Just as Gill's Stations of the Cross show the su ffering and the holiness of the story of Christ and a very restrained, highly stylized form, Jones wanted to express the seriousness of the Great War in a serene style on paper. But neither the apt vividness of his drawings from the trenches, nor the nostalgic sentimentality of the returned hero su fficed anymore. The propaganda, which continued until long after the war, kept connecting the soldier with the Christ figure, but Jones increasingly began to oppose this. He felt he could no longer dovetail the sacral setting of the Jesus story with a military setting after the war. He believed the 11 Leo xiii, Rerum novarum: On Capital and Labor , sect. 3. 12 E. Gill, Beauty Looks After Herself , [Intr. by Catherine Pickstock] (New York: Sheed & Ward, 1933), 50-64. Cf. E. Gill, A Holy Tradition of Working. Passages from the Writings of Eric Gill (Ipswich: Golgonooza Press, 1983). Cf. J. Hughes, The End of Work: Theological Critiques of Capitalism (Oxford: Wiley Blackwell, 2007).74 Van Erp romantic image of heroic medieval knights no longer fitted the broken soldiers returning from the trenches. Instead of glorifying their su ffering and comparing it to Christ's, in some of Jones's drawings from after the war, the soldiers themselves turn into those who do the crucifying, rather than being the cruci fied. He shows the Christ figure being mocked and chased by soldiers in the uniform of the Great War. There is a small painted panel on which Jones places the mocked Christ among shouting soldiers, while one of them kneels down and asks for forgiveness, just as Jones had seen in the barn near the front in France. The style is quite similar to that of Gill, whom he had started to imitate. Drama would no longer deter- mine the form, but instead, the form should distil the drama down to its essence. In retrospect, being attracted to Gill's Catholic style would later become part of Jones's own conversion to Catholicism. A friend advised him to pay a visit to Eric Gill, whose works fascinated him. He left for the little town of Ditchling in Sussex, where Gill lived in his quasi- religious community of Catholic artists. Right from the start, Jones and Gill got along really well and they developed a kind of master-apprentice relationship. They started to cooperate on the Trumpington War Memorial that Gill had already begun. Later on, Jones would even become engaged to Gill's daughter, but this never actually led to marriage. Jones copied Gill's two-dimensional work rather skilfully and convincingly, but Gill's in fluence on his work during that period could also be considered too strong. To Jones, however, it was a breath of fresh air to be able to work with Gill in the safe environment of his community after the war. It enabled him to find his footing again as an artist. The isolation and the shared Catholic beliefs formed a much needed counter- culture to the disruptions caused by the war. Conversion: The Catholic Artist Early on in 1913, Gill had converted to Catholicism, and after their introduction, Jones would soon follow his example. Gill's in fluence is not the only reason for this move, however. At the end of the street in Brockley where his parents lived, Howson Road, there was a Catholic church he would sometimes visit. Although Jones had been brought up in the Anglican Church, he sometimes considered converting, and he felt particularly attracted to the Catholic imagi- nation. The desire to become Catholic became stronger when he saw Gill's Stations of the Cross at Westminster Cathedral before he had met Gill in per- son. Jones himself had never been very explicit about the moment of his conversion to Catholicism or his motives. One thing seems to be certain though: there is no direct connection with his wartime experiences. Years later, he did write that he worried about what he called 'dehumanizing modern 75 Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion technocracy' and that faith was its only antidote. He also believed that only Roman Catholicism had the doctrines and the type of authority that would be of any use against this. However, this idea seems to have been inspired more by the political situation and the ideology around the time when he made these statements in the thirties than by the actual reasons for his conversion in the early twenties. Jones's conversion was not motivated by explicitly theological or expressly formulated religious motives, although he did later contemplate and write about it. As an artist, the primary attraction he felt was to Catholic sacramental practice. It was not so much the way in which certain sacraments were admin- istered, because some elements of the Anglican Church had a comparable Eucharistic liturgy and a comparable attitude towards the ministry, which even though it was not considered to be 'sacramental' , very much looked like that of the Roman Catholic priest. Jones was particularly interested in the cre- ation and reverence of meaningful objects, and the Catholic Church seemed to have this sacramental practice at its core. Gill's highly stylized reliefs and his vision of the life of the artist as a sacramental practice of prayer brought him closer to Catholic faith. In September 1921, shortly after the start of his coopera- tion with Gill and his move to Ditchling, he converted to Catholicism. The work at Gill's workshop and in the community was a new experience for Jones, and it o ffered a completely di fferent environment from his own studio. Apart from the crafts, people at Ditchling were also studying the philosophy of Neo-Thomism, which at that time was the o fficial philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church. Together, they read the works of Thomas Aquinas and Jacques Maritain, an in fluential Catholic philosopher of the day. Aquinas's philosophy offered them a vision of the whole of reality. It considered the world from the assumption of a coherent created order that was inherent in all things. At Ditchling, they worked on an illustrated translation of Maritain's Art et scolas- tique , incidentally in cooperation with Joseph O'Connor, the famous priest who would later form the inspiration for G.K. Chesterton's stories about Father Brown. Maritain's book on art and the divine would be a major in fluence on Jones, and, together with Gill, he was responsible for the illustrations in the English edition of 1923. In Art et scolastique , Maritain tried to find a balance between the gratuitous and the useful. 13 Art should be disinterested, and yet be at the service of a good society, considered to be a combination of the gratuitous and the useful. According to Maritain, art was not just there to be enjoyed, it formed an ele- mentary part of the general purpose of human life. Gill would write several 13 J. Maritain, Art et Scolastique (Paris: Librairie de l'Art Catholique, 1920).76 Van Erp essays on the subject during the time that Jones stayed with him. He believed the artist should not try to imitate life to give it a certain meaning, but that, instead, the thing created had its own value and its beauty could not be mea- sured by something else in reality; it could only be judged by the character of the work of art itself, which manifests a natural orientation towards the good. This Catholic vision of reality saw that the benevolence of the divine order was not just in nature, but also in created objects and human ways of living. This paradigm became very prominent in Jones's work. In fluenced by Gill's socialism and the ascendency of Catholic social thought, he regarded creating art as holy labour, aimed toward the common good, which resulted in an enor- mous capacity for work. Drawings and engravings were produced on a massive scale at Ditchling, including those by Jones. The sacramental concept of the work of art as a human form of work that can complete the divine order in nature led to a style strongly reminiscent of that of Gill. The subject of his drawings and engravings became explicitly reli- gious. Jones made wood engravings of the Ten Commandments for the magazine The Game . The characters in these engravings are pressed up against the sides, as if they are imprisoned within the frame, just like in Gill's Stations of the Cross at Westminster Cathedral. Jones tried to use the space that the material o ffered as e ffectively as possible to emphasize the unity of the indi- vidual figures and the surroundings in which he depicted them. Around that same time, he made the wall paintings of his studio, depicting moments from the life of Jesus: the annunciation, the birth, the cruci fixion, the resurrection and the ascension. He designed wooden statuettes from small, compact blocks of wood, meant to hold on to whilst praying. He considered them to be objects that brought him closer to the sanctity of life by their nearness, by the way in which they helped him pray and became part of prayer themselves. 4 A Barbed Wire Redemption: Christ on the Battle field For a time, Gill considered moving away from Ditchling. The artistic commu- nity attracted more and more visitors and there was no more peace and quiet. Moreover, he had financial and personal problems. In 1924, Gill visited an old Benedictine monastery on Caldey Island on the Welsh coast. He found the iso- lation and the contemplative character particularly attractive. He also considered moving the entire community to distant Galway in the west of Ireland. The Benedictines drew his attention to a group of abandoned monas- tic buildings at Capel-y- ffin in Wales, close to Hay-on-Wye. Despite the protests from of some of the artists, but also from the Dominican McNabb, who had 77 Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion meanwhile become closely involved with the community at Ditchling and con- sidered the proximity of London to be essential for the artists, Gill decided to move to this rural area in Wales. For Jones, this was an excellent opportunity to examine his Welsh roots, and he was one of a small group of artists who decided to join Gill and his family. The World Imposes Itself in Isolation Jones started painting the area around the village at Capel-y- ffin. To his mind, the Welsh landscape had mythical qualities, especially as he believed this was where his cultural roots lay. During the war he had drawn the villages of the North of France, but these drawings had always been pastoral and impres- sionist. In his paintings of Capel-y- finn, the landscape forces itself upon the observer and gains an almost sti fling quality. The rhythm of the landscape and the small hills do not o ffer any vistas, and instead close in on us, as if they surround the foreground. In the end, Jones painted the cruci fixion of Christ in that landscape, and called it 'Sanctus Christus de Capel-y- ffin'. When he started using Christian iconography in the twenties, he had still been strongly influenced by Gill, who isolated elements of the Christian story from their sur- roundings and presented them in a highly distilled form. Jones's cruci fixion is something completely di fferent: here Christian iconography is placed in the concrete context of his own environment, as if Christ comes closer and enters Jones's life. 14 In those days he often returned to his parents in Brockley. There he would paint the garden and each sketch would contain more and more fences, until eventually, they filled the entire garden. It appeared as if Jones was seeing the outside world as an ever more claustrophobic and threatening environment, fencing him in. He painted the interior of his parental home and practised painting the world as seen through the curtains, occasionally blurred and occasionally in focus. Jones became adept at showing how the curtain in flu- enced the way in which objects outside are seen. He used watercolours to achieve the e ffect. Despite the use of watercolours and the fact that he painted objects as seen through the net curtain, the details of the painted objects are more clearly visible. The veil of the curtain and the distance it creates seem to intensify the observation. 15 14 Cf. R. Williams, Grace and Necessity: Re flections on Art and Love (London: Continuum, 2005). 15 For and extensive overview of David Jones's work, see Miles, Shiel, David Jones: The Maker Unmade .78 Van Erp The paintings from this period clearly show that interior and garden, inside and outside, belong together. Jones finds a certain comfort in this. Not by con- trasting inside and outside, or by fleeing the menacing garden with its fences to the safety of the parental home, but because it shows what it is that keeps the inside and outside worlds together: the light from outside that is let in by the curtain and, at the same time, makes all the objects outside very di fferent. In his painting 'Flora and calix-light' , for example, Jones places a chalice in front of the curtain, and it seems to capture the world outside. It is his way of painting the Holy Ghost: the God who unites everything and keeps the entirety of creation together. Life in Parenthesis: Christ in the War The year of 1937 saw the publication of In Parenthesis , an almost two hundred page long epic poem, in a style reminiscent of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land , the apogee of modernist poetry. Just as Eliot uses images, symbols and fragments of text from the history of literature - Homer, Ovid, Vergil, Chaucer, Dante, Shakespeare, etc. - and from various di fferent religious traditions - the Bible, the Upanishads, Augustine, the Book of Common Prayer, etc. - so Jones refers not just to Shakespeare, but also to S.T. Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner , Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland , and to the Welsh poetry and stories he had known since his childhood: the Gododdin and the Mabinogion . All these frag- ments have been woven into the story of the battalion getting ready for battle. In an introduction to a later edition of In Parenthesis , Eliot compared Jones's work not just with his own, but also with that of Ezra Pound and James Joyce, and he adds that \"the lives of all of us were altered by that war, but David Jones is the only one to have fought in it\". 16 Later in his life, Jones wrote that he considered In Parenthesis a good example of the e ffect a work of art can produce. He believed a work of art is a meaningful form that manifests more than was originally perceived. To be able to experience that, In Parenthesis asks its readers to imagine themselves in the trenches and hear what is going on and what the text is putting into words. As so often with poetry, it is best read out loud. Only that will do justice to its play of images, sounds and surroundings. In his preface to the first edition, Jones describes his approach: Each person and every event are free re flections of people and things remembered, or projected from intimately known possibilities. I have 16 T.S. Eliot, \"Introduction\" , Jones, In Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion only tried to make a shape in words, using as data the complex of sights, sounds, fears, hopes, apprehensions, smells, things exterior and interior, the landscape and paraphernalia of that singular time and of those par- ticular men. I have attempted to appreciate some things, which, at the time of su ffering, the flesh was too weak to appraise. There are passages which I would exclude, as not having the form I desire - but they seem necessary to the understanding of the whole. 17 The frontispiece of the first edition of In Parenthesis shows a soldier revealing his nakedness by taking o ff his greatcoat. In the background we see the daily images of the First World War: the barbed wire, the fear, the ri fles and the sol- diers moving through the woods, on to the next battle. The drawing is chaotic and confusing, like so many of Jones's works from the thirties. It appears to be the imagination of someone who wants to say it all at once, and has lost all sense of order and style. Jones had researched classic and medieval texts while he was writing his epic poem. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that the various elements of the frontispiece of In Parenthesis have an explicit sym- bolic meaning. The rider-less horse on the left in the background is sometimes used as a symbol for a funeral ritual. The barbed wire in the foreground sym- bolizes human captivity and oppression. The enlarged figure of the soldier in the middle of the drawing is clearly central. But who is it that we see symbolically depicted here, apart from the injured soldier of the First World War who seems to be undergoing a change? The half-nakedness appearing from the greatcoat seems to show us a kind of Adam figure. The one naked foot could be a symbol of solidarity with prison- ers, in reference to the prophet Isaiah from the Old Testament, whose unshod state was an expression of his concern for the abominable living conditions of prisoners. The soldier's one naked foot in Jones's drawing could also indicate an initiation: the transition to a di fferent, holy identity, which coincides with a sense of standing on hallowed ground. That would fit with the uniform being thrown o ff, revealing the vulnerable, naked figure, whose nakedness strongly contrasts with the war in the background and thereby seems to pass judge- ment on it. The central figure is cruciform. His limbs seem to be displaced and some wounds are visible. This could be a depiction of Christ showing the vulnerabil- ity of human nature. A soldier, who is and is not Christ, who is and is not an Arthur-like or Homeric hero. As mentioned before, during the war state propa- ganda used to depict the men as soldiers of Christ. Shortly after the war, Jones 17 Jones, In Parenthesis , ix-x.80 Van Erp instead painted them as the ones mocking and crucifying Christ. And now it is the soldier himself who is Christ-like, without any trace of heroism. On the contrary, the protection o ffered by the soldier's greatcoat is removed and the vulnerability thus exposed gives us an even grimmer picture of the surround- ing tableau. Contrary to the Christ of Capel-y- ffyn, in which the landscape seems to close in around the cruci fied Christ, focusing our full attention on the cruci fixion itself, in this picture, war is still raging in the background. Thus it becomes an image of what it meant to be a soldier of the Great War, to be the divine sacri fice in the middle of a risky and violent world. The frontispiece of In Parenthesis shows that the history of the war is also a religious history. Christ became present at the Somme, at Passchendaele and at Verdun. That in itself is an idea that was already current during the war itself, as can be seen in the famous poem 'Christ in Flanders' by Lucy Foster Whitmell: Now we remember; over here in Flanders - (It isn't strange to think of You in Flanders) - This hideous warfare seems to make things clear. We never thought about You much in England - But now that we are far away from England, We have no doubts, we know that You are here. 18 Jones strips Christ's role of every romantic and nostalgic element. He is neither a propaganda symbol of the soldiers' martyrdom, nor a symbol of the victory that had been promised. Here, the cruci fixion is not employed as a dramatic or therapeutic instrument to enlarge or, instead, cancel out the horrors of war. The soldier appears as both victim and wounded Christ, and shows the reality of war: the su ffering has changed the world to such an extent that right in the middle of it, a silent, vulnerable, and naked Christ has appeared who has shed an entirely new light on the whole of reality, enabling the soldier to get rid of his uniform, even though he is still behind barbed wire. 5 Sign of God: The Sacramental Work of Art What is the importance of the life of David Jones, the British soldier and draughtsman, who converted to Catholicism and turned poet after the war, in 18 L.Foster Whitmell, \"Christ in Flanders\" , G.H. Clarke, A Treasury of War Poetry: British and American Poems of the World War, 1914-1917 Hodder and Stoughton, 1917), 163.81 Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion the light of the great historical developments at the beginning of the twentieth century? The short and simple answer to that question is: the fact that he painted and put into words a changing reality and, in doing so, has imparted history to us. He understood that history had changed forever, because it had changed in and with him. He did not merely want to report or describe the war, he wanted to show the sacralised reality that paradoxically manifested itself on the battle field, even though it took him twenty years to realize this. In doing so, he became one of the forerunners of a new Catholic culture, at the core of which is a sacramental world vision. Twenty years after In Parenthesis , when the First World War was almost forty years in the past, he described this sacra- mental world vision in a long essay, Art and Sacrament .19 As a young man at the Westminster School of Art, Jones had been intro- duced to post-impressionism. It holds that a work of art is not an impression of something else, but an object in its own right, with its own cohesion and its own relation to the good or the beautiful. Jones believes art is not a pure expression of human will. In its essence, a work of art is not a representation or an expression, but a form of communication. In his essay Art and Sacrament from 1955, he writes about the relationship between art and prudence, one of the cardinal virtues. Prudence - the wise, providential outlook - has to do with making judgements and weighing pros and cons, and with the way people look at life. Art does not coincide with prudence, but Jones believes it does form an important supplement to prudential judgements, because it gives form to a moment in our considerations, which cannot be reduced to something else, not even our freedom to judge. In the work of art, we see the gratuitous aspect of life itself. It shows us that not everything can be reduced to functionality, usefulness, or prudence. By visualizing the gratuitous in an indirect way, a work of art is an embodi- ment of the sacral, Jones believes. Art shows the real as the good and presents the good as the ultimate reality. In doing so, the artist expresses a certain attachment to the depicted reality and answers to what could be considered a call of duty. The artist endorses that the real is good, and the good is real. Prudence is the realization that follows from it, and it tells us that we are not at the mercy of our own judgements, but that judgement itself is bound to the reality endorsed by the work of art. This view of art and prudence is important for understanding the nature of religious conversion because it shows that religion is not the result of prudence, but rather the opposite, which is of 19 D. Jones, \"Art and Sacrament\" , David Jones, Epoch and Artist (London: Faber and Faber, 2008, orig. 1959), 143-179.82 Van Erp consequence to what conversion is: not necessarily the result of a particular meaningful insight, let alone a choice that builds on such an insight. Nowadays, the common conception is that religion is a form of prudence: a wisdom and an anticipation of reality as it really should be. Jones presents us with the opposite view, however: religion is not a point of view or a vision that we formulate ourselves, it is what has brought us here and, from our point of view, appears as that which cannot be reduced to the common notion of reli- gion-as-prudence, although it does enable us to take on a di fferent perspective on the world. From a sacramental point of view, religion is an endorsement of reality, rather than something which gives meaning. Like artists, religious peo- ple know that reality cannot be made to mean something. They know that religious symbolism is a way of 'placing oneself among the signs'. The sacra- ment does not refer to something else; it is itself a visible sign of the reality that is endorsed with that sacrament. Jones refers to the Jesuit Maurice de la Taille, who once wrote that Christ had \"placed himself in the order of signs\" , a quota- tion Jones uses as the dedication of his collection of essays, Epoch and Artist .20 Answering the call to place oneself in a certain order is at the heart of the sacramental, Jones believes. The sacramental is, he writes, the inescapability of a symbolic way of dealing with reality. The aim is not to give meaning to the world, but to communicate with a world which is in itself meaningful. Meaning is a form of communication, but it is not a communication that imposes mean- ing upon an otherwise dead and meaningless nature, nor is it the creative communication of the artist who looks for forms of self-expression in sur- roundings that would miss something essential without this self-expression, so that the self would not be able to relate to it. The sacramental work of art instead visualizes the unity of image and reality: it is the symbolic expression of the realization that every form of com- munication has natural - physical, real - consequences, and therefore requires a truthful way of dealing with this nature, which we already and always are ourselves. Jones draws no sharp distinction between words and images on the one hand, and the things that are articulated and represented on the other, between meaning and reality, or between sign and signi fied. He believes that the relation between symbol and reality is what makes humanity human. It is exactly this humanity that the artist portrays in his or her art. The artist does not necessarily do this by depicting or describing a particular human person, but by painting and putting into words what is most fundamentally human. 20 See M. Matthiesen, Sacri fice as Gift: Eucharist, Grace, and Contemplative Prayer in Maurice de la Taille (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 2012).83 Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion Jones was inspired to connect art and sacrament by Jacques Maritain, who taught him that a work of art is a sacramental act that is about the work cre- ated and not about the maker's intentions, or about something else that is merely represented or interpreted in what is made. Just as the Eucharist does not refer to a reality behind the acts reproductively represented in the liturgi- cal context or by the pastor, but is a reality in itself, so the work of art is real and 'objective' , according to Jones. In the preface to his other epic poem, The Anathema , he describes the challenges that the poet is faced with as an objec- tive problem: The problems that confront the poet, as poet, in any given cultural or civi- lizational phase, no matter what his subjective attitude toward those problems, and though they concern only such elusive matters as the validity of a word, are themselves as is the development of the aero- engine, the fact that my great-uncle William served in the ranks in the Crimea, that the tree outside the window happens to be an acacia, that field-archaeology has changed some of the accents of, e.g. Biblical criti- cism, that an extension of state control characterizes the period of Valens and Valentinian, and that like e ffects may possibly have like causes. The poet is born into a given historic situation and it follows that his prob- lems - i.e. his problems as a poet - will be what might be called 'situational problems'. (...) the situational problem which concerns us here is of an equally objective nature. 21 Jones sees the work of art as an extension of nature, but at the same time it is an image of that nature and, as an image, it visualizes the meaning of nature. By being an image of nature at the same time, it changes that nature. So, on the one hand, art is bound to nature but, on the other, nature does not fully exhaust the possibilities of the imaginative form. On the contrary, the work of art is a constantly new expression of the abundance of forms that lies enclosed in nature. Thus, the body of Christ is real like nature, but it is also the sacrament that is the visible expression of that which is already present in nature. The danger of such a comparison between works of art and the sacrament could be that the sacrament is understood symbolically in the following way: as an act by which believers creatively give meaning to an objective nature, e.g. that of human existence, but this is not what Jones had in mind. Art is not added value, just as faith is not the added value to an otherwise meaningless 21 D. Jones, The Anathemata. Fragments of an Attempted Writing (London: Faber and Faber, 2010, orig. 1952), 23.84 Van Erp nature. The work of art becomes the entire object of which it is, at the same time, the representation, made by the artist, rather than being merely a repro- duction of some typical aspects of that object, so that it shows some coincidences with it and signi fies it as it is signi fied by it. What can be an ambiguous experience to our normal consciousness, viz. the fact that the world and imagination need to be separate to be able to maintain a creative tension is one single event to the artist: on the one hand in the attention to the things that surround us, and on the other by putting the nature of this given in perspective to such an extent that the given can emerge from it in a new, gratu- itous form. 6 Conclusion In Grace and Necessity , Rowan Williams writes that Jones was aware of what he calls the 'archaeological' aspects of human experience. 22 He believes creating meaning is only possible through signs that have a history, a history that will continue in every new modelling of these signs. The artist who uses symbols as metaphors to express meaning should be aware of the scope of human archae- ology. Williams thinks this is closely connected to Jones's conversion to Roman Catholicism: he recognised 'a trail left in history' , which then became unavoid- able and without which everything became meaningless. If you do not know where you are and where you are from, you cannot make a sign. After all, the question about sign-making is: A sign of what? And what for? Without an awareness of the archaeology of signs, any answer to these questions can only be arbitrary. Without the human history of imagination, there could not have been a priest at the altar, who in some way represented the redeeming power of God. It is precisely this human history, both the concrete and the represented, that was 'put into parenthesis' on the battle field. On that same battle field, Jones's soldier changes into the naked figure of Christ. The horrors of war pro- duced a work of art that reveals the truly human as a wound and as victimhood. Thus it becomes clear - and maybe it is particularly because of these circum- stances - that human life is eminently meaningful and can become a sign. Here, sacramental imagination shows the true religio : not in the connections we create through dialogue, the giving of meaning or the forming of communi- ties, but in the constitution of an inner communality that reveals itself in us being signs and our sign-making to become signs: the symbolic creation of art 22 Williams, Grace and Necessity , 43-90.85 Sign -Making , Sacrament and Conversion in the light of God's love. In that way, a work of art follows the basic sacramen- tal structure of every human conversion: I am not looking, I find, and I turn myself into a sign: a sign of what makes this sacrament, the being-found and the searching, possible.

Grace Re flections on Art and -Making , Part 2 Ignatian Voices 88 Van Erp89 The Philosophical Meaning of the Ignatian Exercises Chapter 6 A Theatre of Desire: The Philosophical Meaning of the Ignatian Exercises Inigo Bocken The Ignatian Spiritual Exercises form the core of Ignatian spiritual practice, from the beginning of the religious order up until the present. They are well known as one of the most important guides for the practice of meditation in the Christian tradition. Since their primary purpose is to be used as a guide for spiritual practice, they are not the most likely candidate for a model of philosophical reasoning. \"What seems to me white, I will believe black if the hierarchical Church so de fines\". This sentence, which can be found in the text of the Spiritual Exercises ,1 seems to suggest that the opposite is true, that the meditation, as it is developed here, is more about authority and obedience than any re flective use of reason. Moreover, in contemporary culture there seems to be a tension between the experiential practice of meditation and the rather more cognitive act of re flection. Any attempt at understanding the philosophical meaning of the Spiritual Exercises will evokes the more general question on the relation between spirituality and rationality. In spite of Ignatius's emphasis on obedience and authority, the innovative meditative practice as it is presented in the Spiritual Exercises is often charac- terized as the starting point of a new way of theorizing one's personal relation with the divine. In his marvellous collection of articles on Ignatius \"as a human being and as theologian\" , Hugo Rahner - himself a Jesuit - described the enter- prise of the Spiritual Exercises as the foundation of an innovative way of dealing with the relation between theory and practice, and as a genuinely modern understanding of the concrete and the abstract. 2 Even if Rahner does not develop this idea to its full consequences, I think he may have a point here. The reception history of the Spiritual Exercises shows that these are not minor thinkers who revert to the original intuitions of the Exercises, or to its innova- tive method - as it is, e.g., the case in Ren\u00e9 Descartes's Meditationes de prima 1 Spiritual Exercises , Translated by E. Mullan, S.J., par. 365, Thirteenth Rule. 2 H. Rahner, Ignatius als Mensch und extent Descartes's methodological phi- losophy can be read in an Ignatian way, is still unanswered, but there can be no discussion that Descartes himself, trained by the Jesuits in La Fl\u00e8che, was indeed inspired by the method of the Spiritual Exercises . Later on in history - especially in the twentieth Century - several creative attempts at re flective interpretations were made. In our age, Maurice Blondel's philosophy of action is a clear and in fluential example of a philosophical elab- oration of Ignatius's spiritual intuitions. 4 Even more famous is undoubtedly Roland Barthes's semiotic interpretation of the Spiritual Exercises , in which he regards them as a practice of decoding human desire. 5 Moreover, as important scholars such as Karen Kilby and Philip Endean have noticed, Karl Rahner's transcendental method is actually a systematic elaboration of the discretion of the spirits and the search for God's will. 6 Finally, the Spiritual Exercises play an important role in the analysis of modern desire as it can found in the work of the French historian and philosopher Michel de Certeau. 7 In spite of a large number of studies on Jesuit spirituality, so far there has not been a systematic analysis of the philosophical reception of the Spiritual Exercises . This is beyond the scope the present contribution, however. Before any such project could be undertaken, we need to ask how Ignatius conceives his spiritual project - how his imagination and textual staging are structured and how these can be understood against the background of the spiritual and speculative challenges of his time. That is why I have chosen to focus on the means of Ignatian re flection in my contribution. Understanding the Spiritual Exercises as a way of thinking inevitably means discussing the modes of expres- sion of philosophical thought. For Ignatius, this involves studying not only his use of language, but also his use of images. In the end, the whole of life, in all its concrete personal aspects, seems to be a re flexive performance. It is this private and concrete practice, however, which has to become a living image, which brings into appearance the will of God. In this present text, I will use the work of the Jesuit scholar 3 The in fluence of Ignatius on Descartes's work, including the Meditations, has been recognized and discussed by many historians. An evaluative overview can be found in: Z. Vendler, \"Descartes' Canadian (Oxford: Oxford University Press, K. Kilby, Karl Rahner: Philosophy and Theology (London: Routledge, 2004). 7 M. de 118-128.91 Meaning of the Ignatian Exercises Michel de Certeau to guide me in my exploration of Ignatius's life and thought. De Certeau has understood very well that the way Ignatius dealt with imagina- tion can be seen as an answer to the speculative crisis of metaphysics and theology at the end of the Middle Ages - the so called 'nominalist' crisis, which marked the end of the classical ideal of knowledge and action - the idea of theor\u00eda or contemplation. Certeau's interpretation is characterized by a high degree of sensitivity to the performative aspects of spiritual and philosophical discourses. The di fferent ways thoughts, observations, actions and feelings are expressed, help us to discover a proper way of thinking. Theoretical re flection will no longer be limited to just one form and find its expression in for example painting, politics, poetry, mysticism or architecture. In order to explore this further, we need to return to Ignatius and his Spiritual Exercises . They appear as the guideline for a practice in which the whole of life - with all its shadows, ruptures, empty spaces, colours, odours, thoughts, and desires - can be seen as a space for ideas and visions. In the text of the Spiritual Exercises , Ignatius refers again and again towards the importance of the senses in the search for God's will. 8 1 Theory and Practice in Christian Spirituality In order to understand the Spiritual Exercises, it is important to realize that the text, as it was written by Ignatius after his mystical experience in Manresa, is not meant to be read like a treatise. Rather, it is a spiritual guide for the one who is seeking God. Jesuits typically speak of the Spiritual Exercises as a book which should be performed rather than read . But what does it mean to say that one has to do something in order to understand what is at stake? And what kind of understanding are we talking about? Is this something which can only be said after one has completed the Spiritual Exercises ? Or is the act the same as the understanding? These are of the kinds of questions that need to be asked with respect to any spiritual manuals in the history of Christian spirituality. The Spiritual Exercises are part of a long tradition of meditation literature and guidelines ( manuduc- tiones ) which o ffer guiding, categories and criteria for discernment in order to 8 J. Sudbrack, Herder, 1964), 344-369.92 Bocken see God. With the help of these criteria and categories, the reader can find out for himself or herself how to proceed along the spiritual path. Even in the tra- dition of the Desert Fathers, who in their solitude were permanently exposed to false impulses, we can find the need for a criterion by which to discern the truth from illusion, i.e. discerning God from the devil. 9 There is no doubt that Ignatius refers to this tradition when he writes his spiritual guidelines. He is well aware of this tradition. 10 For centuries after the Desert Fathers, medieval spiritual authors were inspired by Aristotle's doctrine of virtues. Virtues were, in their view, a medi- ation between concrete life and the ultimate goal towards which our life is oriented and which is always in danger of being forgotten. 11 Of course, Ignatius of Loyola was not a philosopher. In a way he was the complete opposite of the philosopher. He was a soldier, a man of practice, often infuriated, sometimes sentimental. He left no philosophical texts and he was well into his thirties by the time he started his philosophical training, probably having completed most of the Spiritual Exercises by then. This book is about the practice of meditation - it is meant to be a guide for all those who search for God. Nevertheless, we can safely assume that he was very well aware of the crisis of classical spiritual paradigms. It is plausible that he understood very well that the (intellectual and social) developments of his time were no longer compatible with the clas- sical doctrines of virtue and spiritual manuals. He seems to have seen the need for a new relation between theory and practice. The Spiritual Exercises repeatedly insist - by way of the spiritual guide - that one should not re flect in a theoretical manner about a certain problem, e.g. about the Holy Spirit or about death. Philosophical deliberations can endanger the vivid experience of the event and risk distracting us from the vision of God. Nevertheless, I think that the Spiritual Exercises not only presuppose a philo- sophical problem, they also give a clear de finition of that problem and o ffer strategies for its solution. Ignatius identi fies the problem as the increasing uncertainty of all human knowledge at the end of the Middle Ages. 12 This uncertainty is caused by the idea that there is an unbridgeable chasm between human and divine intellect. As a consequence, human reason does not have 9 K. Waaijman, Handbuch der Spiritualit\u00e4t. H. Rahner, Ignatius als Mensch und Theologe 594-616, 602.93 The Philosophical Meaning of the Ignatian Exercises access to the divine intellect and its criteria. This means that all spiritual mod- els and manuals for the search for God up to that point, from the Desert Fathers to Hugh of St. Victor or Bonaventura, are now somehow superseded. This chasm between human and divine intellect has of course always been a central theme in the history of Christian spirituality. Ignatius's approach is di fferent, however. He is a product of the sixteenth century, a modern man, fascinated by the will of God, which is at the centre of all his considerations. Like late medi- eval voluntarism, he considers this will to be so strong that the mediating virtues are unmasked as weak attempts to control or to manipulate the divine will itself. In this regard, Ignatius is confronted with the same challenge as Luther in his critique of scholastic philosophy. 13 It is no longer possible to trust the traditional spiritual pathways, which describe the stages on the way towards the vision of God, which just have to be done or merely performed. In the Spiritual Exercises , one has to start anew. The aim of the Spiritual Exercises is nothing less than a completely new staging of one's entire life. This is what Michel de Certeau understood very well when he described the Spiritual Exercises as a \"space of desire\". 14 The text of the exer- cises does not present any theological or philosophical visions. Instead, it offers mostly formal descriptions of procedures, as one of the first companions of Ignatius, Pierre Favre, already remarked. 15 The reader is confronted with a purely methodological book, an empty procedure, which has to be filled by whoever is doing the exercises. We need to realize that Ignatius wrote the book after his original experience in Manresa, where he felt he had been touched by God. Wounded as a soldier at the battle of Pamplona, Ignatius read some spiritual books, and became con- vinced that he wanted to live like Jesus Christ. He intended to walk to the Holy Land in order to radically change his life. 2 An Experimental Theatre of Desire Political circumstances made it impossible to travel from Venice to the Holy Land turned, however. Ignatius took this as a sign that his enterprise was still too much fashioned after his own ideas and desires. He realized that he was still trying to perform God's will on his own terms. In other words, his life was still as much marked by sin as it was before his conversion. What he said he 13 See Ph. Endean, \"Ignatius in Lutheran Light\" , The Month , 24 (1991), 271-278. 14 M. de Certeau, Le lieu de l'autre: Histoire religieuse et mystique (Paris: Seuil, 2005), Le lieu de l'autre , 245.94 Bocken desired - and that what he really desired - turned out to be unbearably di ffer- ent, and this would lead to a kind of mental explosion like in his experience in La Storta. 16 This made him aware that he was permanently avoiding following this deeper desire (as it is called by Certeau), even when he travelled barefoot and intended to imitate Christ by living like an ascetic. This ascetic lifestyle also bore the mark of a hidden, deeper desire that cannot be determined by explicit images of the will. Ignatius halted his pilgrimage and came to the conclusion that there is only one goal in life: to discover the real desire that motivates the many things we pursue, but which also can be hampered by this pursuit. 17 For no matter how conscientiously we follow any spiritual program, there is always a risk we will stray. It is this genuinely early modern theme of uncertainty, which can also be found in Ignatius's considerations. This insight explains the procedural form of the exercises. For human beings, it is impossible to find a way to know God's will once and for all. It is impossible to take an external position - as scholastic philosophy did - in order to determine the right order of reality. We are always driven by desire, even when we are able to discern what corresponds to this desire and what does not. The discernment may be realized on di fferent levels of reality - it always requires a formal procedure. Real desire only can be found in concrete discernments. There has been a lot of discussion about the austere form of the Spiritual Exercises . Totally di fferent authors, such as Hugo Rahner and Roland Barthes, have pointed out that the success of the book of was a miracle in itself: the language Ignatius uses is rather coarse and it lacks any form of poetry, so the mere success of the book could already be seen as proof of its truthfulness and authenticity. This language, which o ffers no enjoyment whatsoever, shows us that it is not the well-formulated sentences or impressive constructions of thought that count. Instead, language functions to make space for something else - for a form of action oriented towards the desire for God. As Certeau pointed out, this action is oriented towards the other and, as such, it opens up a space for the desiring soul. The Spiritual Exercises are nothing less than a form of staging, a mise en scene , complete with instructions for the director, in order to open up a space for the soul. Ignatius intends to communicate his new insight to others: we are 16 H. Rahner, \"Die Vision des heiligen Ignatius in 17 'Desire' is one of the central topics of Christian mysticism, of which Ignatius was very well aware. This is shown in a clear way by Michel de Certeau in his books on the history of mysticism of 16th and 17th Century - La fable mystique (1984 and 2013).95 The Philosophical Meaning of the Ignatian Exercises involved in the process of desire, even before we become aware of it. At the same time, every individual person has to experience this awareness from his or her own position. The instructions, in this way, are quite pliable. Sometimes Ignatius mentions that we have to find out for ourselves whether and how we want to sit down or stand, maybe get down on our knees, or perhaps stay in a small room or go for a walk. These acts in and of themselves are not very impor- tant. What is important is whether any of these positions can be helpful for achieving an insight into this deeper desire, in order not to be guided by 'unor- dered' desires. A lack of food, for example, would have us thinking about eating the whole time. The Spiritual Exercises are about the stories from the life of Jesus. Never- theless, these stories are not - as Roland Barthes shows - the libretto of some kind of theatrical performance that is part of the exercises. The di fferent scenes from the life of Jesus are in fact the setting, the background giving more relief to the performance. The libretto has - in the words of Certeau - not been writ- ten.18 It is written through acting , like in any form of experimental theatre in which the actors are not performing some fixed text by heart, but are just expressing what comes to mind while they are on stage. The stories from the life of Jesus are a setting and a mirror, explaining the desires of the actor. Here, the spiritual guide is not a spectator - he is actually more like a director's assis- tant, correcting the actor from his experience and his knowledge of the text and rules of the exercises. Sometimes he corrects the actor's imagination and discusses how to better express it. 3 The Devotio Moderna and the Logic of Performance The staging of the Spiritual Exercises has a long tradition. Ignatius found the sources for his performative approach in the texts of the Devotio Moderna , the influential religious reform movement in fifteenth century Northern Europe. The most famous expression of this tradition is without any doubt Thomas \u00e0 Kempis's Imitatio Christi . There has been a lot of discussion about the recep- tion of the Devotio Moderna in the work of Ignatius. 19 In a way, the Spiritual Exercises can be seen as a methodologically well-founded elaboration of the 18 Certeau, Le lieu de l'autre , 246. 19 E.g. G. 2009), 82.96 Bocken insights that can also be found in Thomas \u00e0 Kempis's spiritual manual, itself an expression of the spiritual practices of the Devotio Moderna . The Devotio Modera was a reform movement in the Netherlands, which also had some in fluence in Germany. Founded by Geert Groote, it was successful in the emancipated cities in both the Southern and Northern part of the Netherlands. In a way, the Devotio Moderna was an emancipation movement in which craftsmen, tradesmen, or politicians claimed that the spiritual path of imitating Christ was not exclusively for learned people or for the monks in their monasteries who were able to read in Latin. 20 The vision of God was not reserved for those who knew the scholastic theo- retical de finitions, written in Latin. 21 \"Our practice at the spinning wheel is the highest form of theory\" , as one of the sister books from Emmerich, one of the many community houses of that time, puts it. 22 The imitation of Christ has nothing to do with doctrinal or theological knowledge, which come from an outside perspective. The imitation of Christ is realized through the work in the garden or in the kitchen or even in the practice of reading. In the end, nobody can claim to have exact knowledge about this spiritual path. It is a way of act- ing, a performative practice. As a book of exercises and practices, the De imitatione Christi is a book with admonitions and smaller re flections, mirrors for the life of the soul, and it is the result of extensive experience in spiritual guidance. 'Imitatio Christi' in fact means to become an image of Christ yourself. Sometimes Thomas is very critical towards philosophical reasoning with regard to this ideal: 'it is better to practice compunction as to know its de finition,' he says, almost ironically, in Book I.3 of De imitatione Christi . This should be read for what it is, however: a critique of some forms of Aristotelian and Scholastic philosophy, which often claim that reason is able to understand everything, and that we can come to know exactly who God is and what His qualities are. 23 Thomas's comments are 20 C. van Ginhoven Rey, \"The Jesuit Instrument: On Saint Ignatius of Loyola's Modernity,\" R.A. Maryks (eds), A Companion to Ignatius of Life, Writings, Spirituality and In flu- ence (Leiden: Brill, 2014), 204; J. Essays on 12. 22 A. Statuten des St.-Agneskonvent in 20. 23 I. Bocken, \"The Language of the Layman: The Meaning of imitation Christi for a Theory of Spirituality\" , Studies in Spirituality 15(2005), 217-249.97 The Philosophical Meaning of the Ignatian Exercises in fact a way of staging, enabling the seeker to find his or her own way of imi- tating in practice. Our practical life is the stage on which the Gospel can be re-enacted. This also means that the imitation of Christ has to be started over and over again. We are always in danger of thinking we know how to live in an authentic manner. This knowledge is often an obstacle, or a mask, enabling us to hide who we really are. The exercitant has to discern for himself or herself, and should not listen too much to what other people are saying - which is one of the favourite senti- ments of Thomas a Kempis. 24 \"Whatever people are saying, the ordinary as well as the learned ones, let them become silent within you\" , Thomas writes. 25 Nor is this all about our own judgements - these can be as alienating as other people's judgements, perhaps even more so. 26 In the end, only God's judgment matters, but we are unable to know this judgment. We do, however, see the shadows of our own life, obscuring God's judgment. If we look closely, how- ever, we may be able to distinguish between light and dark. 27 A similar approach is found in the Spiritual Exercises . Ignatius emphasizes that we need to find our own individual paths. Nothing in this world, no theol- ogy or scholastic philosophy, can discover what God wants. Of course, there are always people claiming to have knowledge about the will of God, but one should avoid this kind of na\u00efve self-deception. Nevertheless, Ignatius really believes that it is possible to gradually discover the real desire which can be identi fied with God's desire. 28 This is the final goal of the Spiritual Exercises : to be filled with the content of concrete life. Personal experiences are extremely important - at least for those who surrender themselves to this mise en scene . Emotions should be taken very seriously as they are movements of the soul. 29 They tell us about our desires. The movements of the soul are, as Roland Barthes shows in his analysis of the Spiritual Exercises , a code which should be deciphered to be 24 E.g. De imitatione Christi I,10, und I, 20, ed. R. van 2008), Christi I, 3, 12 (van Dijk 26 Ibid. I, 14. 27 I.

This is to be found in concrete life, in images and experiences, or even in the memories of a taste. 30 The actor of the Spiritual Exercises is performing an exercise by telling his or her own stories on the stage before the only spectator of this experimental theatre, God, for whom nothing remains hidden, and who is able to see everything at the same time and understand the deeper connec- tions and contexts. It leaves the person performing the exercises with an ever greater awareness of his or her deep involvement in the process of desire, and frees him or her from the duty of having comprehensive theoretical knowledge of his or her own stories. It is in telling these stories, and in the production of images and scenes, that he is able to see better how shadows and light become manifest in one's life. 4 Consolatio and Desolatio The exercitant is an active participant. He or she is as creative as an artist. This, however, does not mean that the exercitant has to start from scratch recon- struct the whole story. It is the other way around - we begin by telling the story, only to discover the possibilities and impossibilities we were unable to see before. The creativity is in telling about new and unique things, in finding new images and ways of speaking about something - all these are present already in the material of his own actual life, however. The exercitant creates images and at the same time surrenders himself or herself to them, thereby also becoming a passive observer of these images. Later on, the exercitant is sometimes required to resist concrete longings - not always, but mainly to have the experience that it is possible to misunderstand one's own desire. For example: Ignatius requires us to pray a little longer when we do not feel like praying, or to forgo dinner when we are hungry. Through all this, Ignatius warns us again and again never to exaggerate. Resisting one's longings is not an ultimate goal. These exercises should be done only in order to learn what the ultimate desire is in order to reach the point where God's desire and human desire converge. The categories of thinking, introduced by Ignatius, are as simple as they are clear. It is all about the discernment between consolation and desolation - consolatio and desolatio .31 Through acting out the exercises, we learn to 30 P.-A. Favre, Ignace de Loyola: Le de l' EHESS , 1992), 10 and passim. 31 Spiritual Exercises Third Rule, Fourth Rule, Fifth Rule.99 The Philosophical Meaning of the Ignatian Exercises discern which emotions bring consolation and which lead to desolation, inas- much as we show our self to God's gaze and ask what it is to see like God. Both categories are deduced from that which can be found about God in the Tradition, for God cannot want that we live in desolation. Consolation, there- fore, is more original, though our life is a constantly shifting balance between consolation and desolation. This primacy of consolation is in fact the only nec- essary condition for the participation in this performance. It still remains possible for us to err and take a decision which will lead to desolation. Learning to see this is the goal of the exercises. Consolation and desolation are di fferent for every human being. God does not desire the same thing for every individ- ual. In the contrast of our emotions and experiences, we are able to discern the direction of our lives without ever being completely certain. In his comment on the German translation of the Spiritual Exercises, Hans Urs von Balthasar constantly refers to the comparative character of Ignatius's use of language. The act of comparing does indeed form the basic structure of the Exercises. Human experience and knowledge are marked by this unavoidable compara- tive character, since man is never able to withdraw from this comparative dimension. Nonetheless, it is possible to find a higher, superlative dimension in this endless comparison - the ultimate desire, the goal of the Spiritual Exercises. It is at that point that this becomes manifest in the intriguing chap- ter, 'Principle and Fundament' , that: Man is created in order to praise God, man is created to praise, reverence, and serve God our Lord, and by this means to save his soul. And the other things on the face of the earth are created for man and that they may help him in prosecuting the end for which he is created. From this it follows that man is to use them as much as they help him on to his end, and ought to rid himself of them so far as they hinder him as to it. For this it is necessary to make ourselves indi fferent to all created things in all that is allowed to the choice of our free will and is not prohibited to it; so that, on our part, we want not health rather than sickness, riches rather than poverty, honor rather than dishonor, long rather than short life, and so in all the rest; desiring and choosing only what is most conducive for us to the end for which we are created. 32 32 Spiritual Exercises , 23, Principle and Foundation, Translation Father E. Mullan, S.J. (New York: Kennedy & Sons, 1914).100 Bocken This only becomes manifest at the moment that the exercitant becomes aware of the permanent process of comparison, and in this awareness discovers the foundations of this process. Through comparing these dimensions, we learn that desolation is a modus of consolation. The fact that we can know this modus presupposes that we desire consolation. These are the kind of experiences of contrast to which Ignatius constantly refers: the shadows in our own life we will never be rid of, but which can be understood as the framework for the visibility within the light. As human beings we live between light and shadow. We are unable to reject the shadow, but we are able to move between light and shadow, so that the latter serves as a contrast to the light, as this is the case in Caravaggio, an artist who himself was fascinated by the Spiritual Exercises. 33 This line of reasoning should help us to understand the somewhat mystical formula introduced by Ignatius when he discusses the task of learning to see, taste, smell and so on. This task of discerning experience is important, since it mirrors how one might discern between experiences coming from God and those coming from the devil - from a 'weak angel'. 34 While the devil is a weak and fallen angel, the desolation he represents is not as original as consolation. Discernment ( discretio ) also means that one is able to experience the absence of consolation in the state of desolation. This is the case because desolation is the unmediated tension between God's desire and one's own concrete desire. The main, fundamental insight is that there is nothing within this world that is mere consolation. In reality, everything is moving between darkness and light, since we are never without sin, but no state is too sinful not to contain at least a trace of light. The only certainty is that of the decision. This can be any decision, depend- ing from one's personal imagination. Every decision entails a certain risk of losing control, but a decision also opens up space for that which comes toward us. As such, it may help us to understand Ignatius's di fficult remarks on obedi- ence and on the role of the church to which I referred to at the beginning of this contribution. This space allows us to understand that every decision is embedded in a practical and social context. Such a decision is not made by a purely autonomous subject. The discernment of the spirits can help us to see that the decision was already made before we started thinking about the deci- sion. The real decision we have to make is the decision to say yes to the deepest desire - God's desire within ourselves. 33 J.F. Chorpenning, Spiritual Exercises , Second Exercise, third point.101 The Philosophical Meaning of the Ignatian Exercises 'Sin' , in this case, does not refer to actual moral discourses or decisions, since we are never completely sure what is morally desirable and what is not. It is no mere coincidence that the Spiritual Exercises would later inspire moral proba- bilism. 35 This ethical position revolves around the basic lack of certainty pertaining to moral judgments. This ethical school, promoted by the Jesuit order, again and again explored the possibility of the immoral character of moral principles. It su ffices to discern acceptable principles of conscience, to take a decision, in the knowledge that there is no ultimate certainty. In some contexts, moral principles can have totally immoral consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to understand these in a broader context and with pragmatic sensitivity. Again, we find the mechanism of comparison that can also be found in the Spiritual Exercises . Certainty is a matter of decision, and it comes about only after the process of comparison. The opposition between consolation and desolation remains decisive. When Ignatius discusses sin, it has to do with the rejection of consolation. We live in sin when we connect our whole life to one set reality and, therefore, we have a false understanding of the order of that reality. This will lead to a restlessness which hampers our actions, as we are able to develop an awareness that whatever we desire, it is not our real desire. It is generally known that the Spiritual Exercises prescribe a program that spans four weeks. In these weeks, the exercitant attempts to meditate upon the life of Jesus, which is similar to Thomas a Kempis's De imitatione Christi . It is remarkable that Ignatius dedicates the whole first week to the problem of sin. During this week, the exercitant becomes aware that his or her desire is always connected with worldly goals. Although this is unavoidable, it is possible to see the di fference between what our deepest desire is - which is at the same time God's desire - and that which we believe to be our desire. We can learn to dis- tinguish this unavoidable di fference, when we focus on the ruptures and unexpected movements within our life. Ignatius constantly stresses moments like these, especially when he refers to the life of Jesus: the perplexity of Mary, for example, when she hears from the angel Gabriel that she is pregnant, or the moment when Lazarus returns to the world of the living. Again, we see con- trasts Ignatius emphasizes and which also help us to see our sinfulness: discernment of the spirits ( discretio spirituum ), living without certainty, the concrete image of our life as a space for the discovery of the unexpected desire and the ability to make these images new - all these aspects form the basic structure of the Spiritual Exercises as a practice of thinking. These aspects 35 P. Schmitz, (2014), 46-58.102 Bocken form the basic logic of these spiritual practices. The Spiritual Exercises use these to come to a comparison without a fixed point within, or based upon, daily reason. This comparative character, however, is fundamental to human existence. During the Spiritual Exercises, we learn to play with the contrasts of life before the only true spectator - God - so that we learn to discern the essen- tial decision, which was made already before we were even born. To able to see this however, we first need to take another decision, we need to have the desire really see it. This where the categories of consolation and desolation come into play. 36 In a way, this spiritual program can be seen as a condensed form of the eternal desire present within one's life. It is a form of thinking that helps us discern without becoming dependent on any earthly reality - for this would mean the loss of space. Although the Spiritual Exercises are an exclusively spiritual program, it is remarkable how its dynamic logical structure has been received in various fields and by authors and artists who are not directly part of any spiritual canon. This essay has attempted to show how the spiritual exercises also pre- suppose a model for reasoning which focuses on how to deal with human desire, while also attempting to not become hemmed in by the limits of reason itself. Perhaps this is the reason why Ignatius's way of thinking can be seen as distinctly modern. The relation between will and reason, between the heart and reason, between experiencing and thinking, is one of the main challenges of Modernity. Ignatius, through the Spiritual Exercises , seems to o ffer a basis for dealing with these relations. I already mentioned to Caravaggio and his play with darkness and light, and I noticed that Maurice Blondel, with his 'philoso- phy of action' , sees his own project as an answer to the dramatic chasm between both dimensions of human existence, and I believe he found his inspiration in the Ignatian exercises. As I said at the beginning of this contribution, this phil- osophical reception history is a project which still has to be developed further. For now, I want to close with a short reference to the philosophy of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Descartes is not well known as an Ignatian philosopher, and he is often, too often perhaps, characterized as the first modern philosopher who instigated the modern separation of body and mind, of will and reason, et cetera. He is often seen as the original philosopher of technocratic reason, of the ideology of control, and so on. Understanding Descartes against the back- 36 Consolation is a central theme of late medieval and early modern religion, as Ronald Ritt- gers showed recently: R.K. Lutheran Devotion\" , Church History 81 (2012), 601-630. Consolation is also a central topic in De imitatione Christi .103 The Philosophical Meaning of the Ignatian Exercises ground of Ignatius could open up new perspectives on the real nature of the Cartesian project. 4 Descartes's Meditations and Ignatius's Exercises philosophia (1641), Descartes (1596- 1660), himself a Jesuit, uses a technique very similar to the Spiritual Exercises when he simply sits down in his chair and starts asking which knowledge is deceptive and which is not. It is just like Ignatius's discretio spirituum . Also, for Descartes, the will of God is constitutive and, just as Ignatius did, he attempts to reach a point in which we can trust that our relation towards the world is well ordered. There is, however, a clear and symptomatic di fference between Descartes and Ignatius. As soon as the relation between the interior and exterior world is guaranteed by the real idea of God, Descartes seems to forget God, or at least does not need Him anymore. In Ignatius's meditations, the limit between inte- rior and exterior remains present. According to Ignatius, we always have to be aware of our use of the discernment of the spirits, permanently questioning our desire, permanently making more space in order to make our will conform more closely to God. It may be true that Descartes focuses on the process of knowledge. In his analysis of Descartes's Meditations , against the background of the Spiritual Exercises , the American philosopher of language, Zeno Vendler, stresses the need to avoid exaggerating the di fferences between the two authors. From the perspective of the Spiritual Exercises , we see the necessity of a focus on an inner reform of the will. 37 From this perspective, the Cartesian meditations do not deliver anything new to the fundamental and obsessive search for cer- tainty. Instead, they focus on the necessity of philosophical thought on the dependencies and inner relation between thinking and the real world. According to Vendler, Descartes is searching for an original desire as well, a desire that precedes existence. Vendler shows quite convincingly that the problem of an exaggerated di fference between both authors is mainly due to readers who are part of the philosophical tradition and who tend to think that the meditative form of Descartes's text is only an external form. Instead, Descartes's philosophy seems to focus around a choice for consolation. 38 37 Z. Vendler, \"Descartes' Exercises\" , Canadian Journal of Philosophy 19(1989), 193-224, 219. 38 Later on it was Maurice Blondel who discussed the unity of meditative practice and epis- temology again. His philosophy of action is nothing else as an attempt to explain the 104 Bocken 5 Conclusion Ignatius's Spiritual Exercises show how there are always re flective moments in day-to-day human life with its constant comparing, and they show how think- ing is involved in this process of comparing. This re flection presupposes the ability of taking accurate decisions. According to Ignatius, one's spiritual life can no longer exist outside of society, such as in an isolated monastery. The Spiritual Exercises pertain to the whole of life, even if they take only thirty days to complete. They can be seen as condensed 'performances of thinking'. In this experimental theatre, God is the only spectator. It is the goal of the Spiritual Exercises , to become aware of the possibility of consolation and to see the dan- gers of desolation, and to find the possibility to develop a creative form of life within the connection between both.

Conversion: The Architecture of the Sant'Andrea al Quirinale and the Ductus of Conversion Arnold Smeets 1 Introduction Temptation seems to be irreconcilable with conversion. If conversion is often portrayed as a turn for the better, temptation is perceived as its opposite: a turn for the worse. Temptations are everywhere and they are always dangerous. That is why the faithful pray, reciting the Lord's Prayer: \"and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\". The Devil even tried to tempt Christ. Christ was not in need of deliverance because he was able to ignore the pride of life, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eye - the latter tempting the soul to the sin of acquisitiveness, pleasure and delight. 1 After Adam, humanity was bound to be easy prey for temptation (almost) willingly falling into sin. In that sense, temptation is vertiginous. 2 In this contribution I would like to re flect beyond the alleged dichotomy of temptation and conversion, and to explore the possibility of temptation as a (euphoric) incentive for conversion, however. I will frequently refer to a book by the semiotician Massimo Leone on conversion as a (religious) crisis of iden- tity.3 Leone identi fies the destabilization of a person as the first step of conversion. The religious identity of a person is destabilized by an encounter 1 M. O'Rourke Boyle, Loyola's Acts. The Rhetoric of the Self (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), 82. 2 I borrow the idea of vertigo from Eelco Runia. He introduced vertigo in the context of the (dis-)continuity in history. 'Vertigo may feel like a fear of falling, but really it is a wish to jump, covered by a fear of falling. Vertigo predisposes, as psychoanalysts say, to 'counterphobic' behavior. Giving in to vertigo is a strategy for escaping from an unbearable tension by doing something\u2014by breaking apart from what one used to cherish, by eating the apple, by com- mitting an 'original sin'.

In what \u00a9 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden , 2016 |doi 10.1163/9789004319165 _009107 Temptation as Conversion with a spiritual message that speaks a di fferent language, or in the very least takes a di fferent tone. What is important is that the spiritual message is critical with regard to choices made and convictions held. The moment of destabiliza- tion causes a crisis: a disintegration of the coherent structure of beliefs. The crisis provokes a process of re-stabilization of the self, when the person searches for means to reorganize and build a new identity under the aegis of the spiritual message. However unique and overwhelming the personal experi- ence of conversion may be, as a process, conversion has its own logic and persuasiveness, comparable with the function of the rhetorical concept of duc- tus (see below). These structural elements of logic and persuasiveness are, as it were, inherent to conversion, and as such inherited by representations of con- version, be it a personal memory of the experience, the vita recording the life of the saint or, as we shall see, the architecture of the Sant'Andrea al Quirinale . My point is that, as a structure, the temptation of the soul is similar to the destabilization of the soul caused by the spiritual message during conversion. I will take the spiritual autobiography of Gregory the Great as my lead. Lacking any personal experience, his conversion is the one I am most familiar with. 4 It is a conversion under the patronage of Saint Andrew, older brother of the Prince of the Apostles and missionary (and patron saint of Constantinople). 5 The Gregorian conversion seemed to o ffer the best framework during a visit to the Sant'Andrea . This beautiful baroque church of Gian Lorenzo Bernini is the purpose-built church for the novitiate of the Jesuit Order. 6 Its architecture and iconography (and the adjacent novitiate buildings) are intended to support the purpose of the novitiate: teaching and guiding the novices and preparing them for their active apostolate in the world. The church was built as a place not only follows, I will add to this basis model, the model of conversion as narrative structure ( verleden [Conversio . Conversion and Mission in Gregory the Great.

I will begin the next section with a sketch of Gregory's authentic experience of conversion: he was transformed by his conversion, and his struggle between an intense longing for contemplation ( intus ) and his deeply felt responsibili- ties for the world ( foris ) resolved itself in a new religious posture of being in the world: not as being 'of' the world, chained to its riches and bound by vainglory, but as being 'in' the world and 'with' God. In describing Gregory's experience, I will use the structure of destabilization, crisis and re-stabilization (Leone). The second half of the next section deals with the way in which conversion as expe- rience evolved into a (narrative) structure to live by and to follow. The shift from personal experience to a basic structure for the Christian life (the model intus , visio , foris ) bestowed the unique gift of conversion with the permanence of divine calling and the faithful's imitatio Christi . In this sense, conversion became something absolute: both a voluntary gift of grace and an imperative divine calling. Gregory's spirituality of conversion was de facto about some- thing inevitable: a mission and ministry of conversion. In section three, I will explore this in greater detail: once evolved into a ministry or mission of conver- sion, the experienced event transcended into an autonomous process, a divine event. Conversion generated a temptation which could not be ignored. In sec- tion four, I will report on my visit to the church of St. Andrew, where I tested the hypothesis . 2 A Gregorian Conversion Most of what we know about the conversion of Gregory the Great is derived from a letter containing a unique fragment telling us about Gregory's spiritual autobiography. 7 It is a letter of dedication, addressed to Leander of Seville, accompanying a copy of Gregory's famous commentary on the Book of Job, the Moralia in Iob , which he had promised to Leander. 8 The project started out as 7 On Gregory's biography, J.R.C. Martyn, The Letters of Gregory the Great (Toronto: PIMS , 2004), 1-18 and for instance R.A. Markus, Gregory the Great and His World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 3-14. 8 is K. Greschat, Die Siebeck, 2005). Leander of Seville, stern defender of the Catholic faith, was in Constantinople to seek support for his case against the Arianism of the Visigothic kings in his native Spain. In the same period, Gregory the Great was stationed there as apocrisiarius (papal legate or ambassador). They 109 Temptation as Conversion a series of lectures for an audience consisting of monks who had travelled with Gregory from Rome, Leander, and a group of interested court o fficials and pious ladies. In the letter dated July 595, Gregory recalled how his friend Leander was involved from the very start in the e ffort to explain the deeper meaning and signi ficance of this 'dark' book ( obscuro hoc opere ) of Job. 9 In the first two sec- tions of the letter, Gregory reminded Leander of all he had told his friend in confidence about his longing for and struggle with conversion. 10 I exposed to your ears everything that I disliked about myself, since I had put o ff the grace of conversion for a long time, and to a great extent, and even after I was in flamed by a love of Heaven, I thought it better to wear secular clothing. For what I was seeking concerning the love of eternity was already being revealed to me, but an ingrained habit had prevented me from changing my external attire. And when my mind was still forcing me to serve the present world, as it were super ficially, then many things began to build up against me from the same worldly concern, so that I was held back in the now, not by its outward show now but, which is more serious, by my thoughts. But finally I fled anxiously from all of this, and looked for the haven of the monastery, leaving behind what belonged to the world, as I then mistakenly thought. From the shipwreck of this life, I came out naked. For as a wave, once a storm has built up, often shakes a carelessly tethered boat even from o ff a bay on the safest of shores, so I suddenly found myself in an ocean of secular a ffairs, under the pretext of ecclesiastical rank. As for the peace of the monastery, it was only when I lost it that I realized how tightly it should have been held. 11 were to become good and trusted friends. On Leander, see Markus, Gregory the Great , 164-167. 9 Mor. The Letters , 379-385 (quote on p. 380). 10 I analyzed the letter Ad Leandrum as source for Gregory's conversion in my dissertation. Here I follow the argument made in that study. Smeets, To come to grips with Gregory's spiritual quest, we will follow the chronology of the story as he tells it. When exactly his historia conversionis started remains unclear. But in the years of his political career, the period he told Leander about, it had already begun. He struggled with an inner con flict between the active life in the world and the contemplative life of prayer. Eventually, after a crisis during which the world not only had a firm physical grip on him but also on his mind, he decided to flee into a monastery. He chose not just any monas- tery, but the monastery under the patronage of Saint Andrew, which the saint himself had founded in his ancestral home on the Caelian Hill (the place now marked by the San Gregorio Magno ). This crisis and his decision to change his way of life and to become a monk, can be dated to 576. Reading Gregory's words, one can easily imagine what was at stake: his yearning for a contemplative life was increasingly hard to reconcile with his daily life in and his (heartfelt) responsibilities for the world. On a more per- sonal level, the tension manifested itself as a con flict between Gregory's persona (the public figure, the individual) and his soul (his most private self, the inner core of his individuality). While the former held him back, chaining him to the worldly and the mundane, the latter pined for the silent contempla- tion of God. At first he attempted to rationalize the inner con flict: initially he thought he preferred a political career, later he thought he only served the world super ficially. But eventually, Gregory felt forced to turn away from the world. He sought refuge in the safe haven of the monastery and left the world for a life free of responsibilities, where he would be free to pray and contem- plate God's Word. But, this almost idyllic situation of a life dedicated to lectio divina did not last. 12 The \"pretext of ecclesiastical rank\" refers to his ordination as a deacon. This, and his subsequent appointment as papal legate (between 579-585) ran counter to his earlier conversion. In Constantinople he felt like being in the middle of a storm. He found himself preoccupied by diplomatic a ffairs and the wheeling and dealing of politics. His only comfort was that he shared in the communal life of prayer of the monks who travelled with him from Saint tempestas excrescit, The 'almost' is not insigni ficant. Barbara M\u00fcller considers the spirituality practiced in Saint Andrew's as a think tank for church-political reform. M\u00fcller, F\u00fchrung im Denken und Handeln , 39. Right from the start, Gregory's contemplation is linked with a speci fic active apostolate.111 Temptation as Conversion Andrew's. He saw God's hand in that arrangement. 13 Against this backdrop, Gregory quite candidly shared his hopes, fears and failures with Leander. In response to this confession, Leander urged the group of monks to ask Gregory for a commentary on the book of Job (an example of spiritual guidance, one might say). To balance his duties, Gregory would not only share the communal life of prayer but also involve himself actively in the monastic lectio divina he missed so dearly. Yet, it all started to feel an almost unbearable burden, leading to the following words: 14 Soon, facing this obscure work, never yet discussed before me, I realized that I was dealing with really great matters of an extraordinary nature, but I was overcome just by the heaviness of the discourse, I admit, and being tired out, I gave in. But suddenly, caught between fear and devo- tion, when I raised my mind's eye to the bestower of gifts, I put aside hesitation and at once paid attention with certainty. For what my breth- ren had lovingly asked me to do, could not be impossible. Indeed, I despair of being suitable for it, but in my desperation I gained my strength and cast my hope on Him, through whom 'the tongues of the dumb are opened, and who makes the tongues of infants eloquent' (Wisd. 10:21), and who distinguished the irrational and brute braying of an ass from the rational modes of human speech. Why is it surprising, then, if He should offer intellect to a stupid human being. For He narrates his Truth, when He wants to, even through the mouth of dumb beasts. And so, provided with strength by this thought, I aroused my dryness to track down a really deep fountain. And although the life of those for whom I was being forced to give the exposition would long outlast my own, I still did not believe it wrongful if a fluent pipe of lead should serve the uses of mankind. 15 that this was done according to divine dispensation, so that by their example, I might always be tethered to a placid shore of prayer, as with the rope of an anchor, when I was tossed to and fro under the incessant pressure of secular cases'. Mor. epistola CCSL 143, 1; ET Martyn, The Letters , 380. 14 Gregory complains about the 'persistent request' for a commentary and open the myster- ies of the book, the 'tiresome request' to add to the allegorical meaning the moral mean- ing of the text, and the 'even more burdensome' task to give evidence for his interpretations. Mor. epistola CCSL 143, 1; ET Martyn, munerum 112 Smeets For me, the moment of the inward gaze upwards signi fies a second act of Gregory's conversion, following and completing the first act of becoming a monk. The de finite and resolute decision to don the habit of a monk was the result of the tension between the polarity of the world ( foris , the outside realm of action; a life controlled by troubles and responsibilities) versus that of the monastery ( intus , the inner realm of contemplation; a life dedicated to God). The foris/intus antithesis is central to an understanding of how Gregory experienced this second moment of conversion: the 'outward' worries and hes- itations are tamed by what he saw in the 'inward' gaze upwards. \" Oculos mentis attollerem \": the gaze of the mind's eye changed the horizontal movements that are apparent in the text. The movement of pertrare (being dragged to, trans- lated by Martyn as 'facing') led to the dead end of Gregory 'giving in'. 16 Caught in the middle between fear (of the task) and devotion (to the monastic com- munity) he turned inwards to gaze upwards at God with the eye of his mind. This broke the deadlock of horizontality, it made Gregory put his hesitation aside and strike a deep and hidden well of inspiration ( fontem tantae pro- funditatis ), introducing a sense of verticality that ended his standstill. Water streaming through a pipe of lead was a metaphor for the commentary he starts in the next sentence: \"And so, gathering the same brethren before me, I soon read them the first sections of the book Martyn, The Letters , 381. A little later, Gregory uses the metaphor of a meandering river as image for the exegete explaining God's words. On this Grover A. Zinn, Jr., 'Exegesis and Spirituality in the Writings of Gregory the Great' in J.C. Cavadini (ed.), Gregory the Great: A Symposium ( N o t r e D a m e : U n i v e r s i t y o f N o t r e D a m e P r e s s , 1 9 9 5 ) , 171-72.113 Temptation as Conversion 3 The Structure of Gregory's Conversion Gregory's first act of conversion, i.e. the choice for monastic life, turned out to be insu fficient. One might say that he failed to secure his (spiritual) autonomy. His worldly commitments could not be overcome by the rationalization he had projected for himself, nor could the walls of the monastery protect him against it. In a double bind, autonomy revealed itself as utter heteronomy: first the world took hold of his mind, and later on his ordination obliged him into an obedience that forced him to accept the burden of becoming a papal ambassador. The second act of his conversion circled around Gregory's escape from this capture. The inner gaze upwards introduced a verticality, which loosened the restraints of the burdens and duties of the world, and it put them in a (freeing) mental or spiritual perspective. Expressing his faith in God (as one of the faith- ful) gave him new energy, for now he saw (with the eyes of the mind) that \"what my brethren had lovingly asked me to do could not be impossible\". 18 Gregory came to understand that God's grace was the de fining factor of a life in faith, rather than his longing and his e fforts. His expertise in the monastic tra- dition of lectio divina taught him that God's grace could be read in Scripture, seen in the world and experienced in life - if one allowed the mind's eye to see it.19 For Gregory, seeing divine grace was equal to longing for it. The experience destabilized his personal identity and ignited Gregory's historia conversionis . The confrontation of this 'ingrained habit' ( inolita me consuetudo ) made him ponder his choices, 20 and eventually caused a crisis which he tried to overcome by rationalizing his commitment to the world. Instead of taking it as a guide and accepting the work of God's grace, he had tried to rescue himself by fleeing into the monastic haven. In the end, his attempts at a re-stabilization of the self faltered and another crisis emerged when inner peace was increasingly perturbed by the impertinent requests of the monks. This time, Gregory chose to re flect rather than act on the situation and through his inward re flection experienced the re-stabilization of the self: new certainty, based on a spiritual seeing and a deeper understanding of God and the world, was reached. 18 Mor. epistola , CCSL 143, 3; ET Martyn, The 19 On Gregory's expertise on lectio diuina Letters , 379.114 Smeets The stability of the soul was never secure, the crisis never completely tamed. The problem lay not just in man's carnal weakness but also, and possibly even more so, in God's constant call to conversion, ceaselessly appealing to the soul of the faithful to lovingly participate in the history of Salvation. The inward and outward impulses, the tension between body and soul, the struggle between the needs of and responsibility for the world and the longing for prayer and contemplation, in short, the struggle for conversion turned out to be a permanent one and became central to his calling - as an imitatio Christi . This basic scheme of Gregory's experience including destabilization, cri- sis and re-stabilization evolved into a more abstract notion of conversion. Conversion was to become the core element of Gregorian spirituality and filtered through in his spiritual teaching and guidance. Gradually, it became the basic model for Christian life, transcending mere personal experience and introducing a continuing struggle to free oneself from the world. The convert was expected to focus on the inner realm of divine Truth and Light, rather than the outer darkness of human reality. This contemplative turn inward ( intus ) was in fact a turn towards the realm of the spiritual and thus towards God: there one sees with the 'eyes of the mind' ( visio ) and is led, as it were, beyond the mere appearance of the things seen in the world. Such 'seeing' of God's word, understanding its deeper meaning and intention, reveals to the eye that the human world and history as a realm are enveloped by the unfolding his- tory of Salvation. In contemplation, Gregory learned to trust God's words and be moved by them. Scripture was \"the light of our journey in the darkness of this present life\". 21 The disclosure of truth and light prompted the impulse out- ward ( foris ), as for Gregory it was clear that Scripture urges the soul back into the world: \"God speaks to us through the whole of Scripture solely in order to attract us to the love of Him and our neighbour\". 22 21 (I)n quoted in Dagens, Saint Gr\u00e9goire le Grand , Vandevelde, \"Diuina eloquia cum legente crescent: Does Gregory the Great Mean a Subjective or an Objective Growth?\" , Rivista di storia della filoso fia (2003), 615-616.115 Temptation as Conversion 4 Conversion by Temptation Gregory felt compelled to give his wholehearted attention to God's calling. After all: who could resist God? 23 One might say that both in his spiritual life and spiritual guidance, Gregory was oriented towards theonomy. He could not desist from preaching, nor could he desist from meditating on God's words and contemplating their signi ficance and intentionality. 24 Conversion became a mission in itself. 25 Such a mission holds certain risks, and Gregory considered the whole of Christian life to be a sacri fice.26 Whereas traditionally, sacri fice was seen in terms of withdrawal from the world, warding o ff all carnal plea- sures, Gregorian spirituality revealed that a more profound sacri fice implied leaving the realm of contemplation and returning to the world with its temp- tations. 27 In the Gregorian approach the soul was to take an active risk of destabilization by opening one's eyes to the divine reality behind reality (at once embracing, carrying, and guiding the reality of human life and history) while stepping back into the world of temptations. In this movement of self- temptation, it ventured to reverse the fall towards sin by a salutary vertigo. This vertiginous longing is key to the Gregorian model of conversion and is experienced as a gift of grace which overwhelms humanity. It is not an autonomous choice. It is also a metaphor, referring both to Gregory's personal experience of conversion, and to the monastic lectio divina : although the monk 23 Quoting Job 9:4 'He is wise in heart and mighty in strength\u2014who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?' (English Standard Edition). The verse was part of Gregory's commentary on Job. desuper in auctore contradicunt. ' Who hath resisted Him, and had peace? (...)

It was Scripture that took the initiative, as if God spoke to the reading and contemplating monk. 28 Reading Scripture involved the soul in the tran- scendental reality of the history of Salvation. It unfolded itself before the soul's very eyes, as a sacramental construction. 29 Dwelling within the realm of this construction and 'seeing' the signi ficance and intention of God's words helped frame the soul's conversion, when these very words guided and changed its ethical framework. 30 God's promise of Redemption acted as the ultimate euphoric temptation. The soul eventually longs to leap into the temptation of conversion. Of course, Gregory would consider this to be yet another act of divine grace. Seen from another perspective, his preaching and spiritual leadership is an outstanding example of the rhetorical concept of ductus. Ductus (derived from the Latin verb ducere : to leading or to guide) is an autonomous movement (conductus ) within and through a discourse's various parts (be it a sermon, a church, or any other manifestation) that evokes an attitude of good will and trust, through which the recipient is tuned into the work's message or inten- tionality ( intentio ).31 It is worthwhile to apply this category to the analysis of conversion. When conversion is preached, what is put into play is a representation of conversion. Conversion, regarded as a narrative structure (based on the model of conversion intus , visio , foris ), constitutes a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. It holds the dynamics of convincing its audience through persua- siveness. The very structure is oriented toward seduction and guides the 28 In a letter written in June 595 to Theodore (the emperor's physician), Gregory poses the rhetorical is Holy Scripture other than a letter of almighty God to his creation?' , 172. 30 Vandevelde, \"Does Gregory the Great Mean a Subjective or an Objective Growth?\" , 628 especially note 56. 31 M.

I introduced the concept of 'intentionality' as the orientation of a certain utter- ance, inviting, guiding, educating the participants of the utterance by its very manifesta- tion towards a realization of what the utterance meant to signify (projection); in the given example: the ful filment of the history of Salvation.

This overlaps well with the Gregorian approach of conversion. Gregory the Great was convinced that it was God who provided the miracle and that God was guiding his spiri- tual journey - for a preacher may \"deliver words to the ears, but he cannot open hearts\". 32 Not he, but the communicated representation of conversion itself, was leading the soul into the temptation of conversion. 5 The Ductus of Imagery At this juncture, it is time to take the test, based on the findings portrayed above. So I turn to the sixteenth century, where since 1565, the Sant'Andrea al Quirinale has been a location for the novitiate of the Jesuit Order. 33 A lot of time, thought, means and care were invested in embellishing the church and buildings of the Novitiate. It is known that the buildings of the Novitiate were decorated for a speci fic reason. In 1608 Claudio Aquaviva arrows of God pass through, when the words of His preaching descend from the ears to the hearts. And (...) this is e ffected sole by divine grace (...)'.

Riche\u00f4me stood in a longer tradi- tion, which appreciated images as devotional tools for contemplation and spiritual growth. The Council of Trent took a firm stand, and Ignatius's Exercitia spiritualia proved to be an important stimulus. The sensuality of for instance the art of Gian Lorenzo Ber- nini, the architect of the Sant'Andrea , seems to at least share the ideas and argumentation developed in the Exercitia. For this Baily, Between Renaissance and Baroque , 7-9. Tradi- tionally words were preferred above images. Images were adulterous and adored. Reading was another matter. The act of lectio was not a sensual or corporal but a mental act. Words were read as signs, bearing transcendental signi ficance. Gregory the Great is an authority who considered both images and words signs of the world signs 'enveloping the faithful in a counter- mundus '. See Peter Brown, \"Images as a substitute for writing\" , Evangelos Chrysos, Ian Wood (eds.), East and West: Modes of Communication (Leiden: Brill, 1999), 15-34, the quote is from page 32.

Smeets, \"De noodzaak Pers, 2010), 35-37.118 Smeets General of the Jesuit Society), invited the French Jesuit Louis Riche\u00f4me to Rome to compile a new handbook for the novices, helping them on their spiri- tual journey, based on the paintings in the buildings of the Novitiate at Sant'Andrea . Riche\u00f4me was well equipped for the job. He was convinced of the didactic power of art: \"Painting is more suitable to an ordinary person (...) because he is moved by the senses rather than the spirit, and would not see the profiles and colours of a well-woven argument as well as the lines and features of an image\". 34 His work, entitled La peinture spirituelle , remains the only source on the paintings. 35 The grand Bernini church for the Novitiate is still there, however, and it is open to visitors. While visiting Rome, in May 2015, I walked up the Quirinal Hill from the Via XXIV Maggio. Opposite the presidential palace, to the right, a few steps lead from the street to the entrance of the Novitiate, or rather: the church, which linked the outside world with the buildings of the Novitiate. I entered the church from the right. Closing the door, a cruci fix, positioned in a niche just left of the high altar caught my attention. It turned out to be a perfect parallel to the entrance to the Novitiate proper, to the right of the high altar. The church is oval in shape and runs parallel to the street. On the right-hand side, we find a niche with a confessional, the chapel of Saint Francis Xavier and the chapel of the Passion. To the left: a second confessional, followed by chapels devoted to Ignatius of Loyola and Saint Stanislaus Kostka. Directly opposite the entrance of the church is the high altar. On either side, completing the circle, one detects the aforementioned cruci fix and the niche functioning as corridor to the Novitiate buildings. In the nave, the chapel of the founder of the order is facing that of Francis Xavier, the saintly initiator of the Jesuit mis- sions (envisioning an important aspect of the active apostolate of the order). A step further away from the entrance, closer to the high altar, Stanislaus Kostka is facing the Chapel of the Passion, fittingly. Generations of (the intended) inhabitants, identi fied themselves with him. Age 17, Kostka became a novice at Sant'Andrea in 1567, but he died within a year. Witnesses later testi fied that he had foreseen his own death on the feast of Saint Lawrence. Familiarity with this story does help to appreciate the painting. His fellow novices would soon consider him a saint. All were young, and all worked and prayed their way 34 Bailey, Between Renaissance and Baroque , 49. See also F. Haskell, \"The Baroque Style Jesuit Contri- bution (New York: Fordham University Press, 1972), 55. 35 Bailey, Between Renaissance and Baroque , 48-52 passim; Terhalle, S. Andrea al Quirinale , 182-185.119 Temptation as Conversion to ordination and mission. His cult would spread fast and far, leading to his official canonization in 1726. 36 Apart from the rows of chairs, there is nothing to stop the visitor from roam- ing around and taking it all in. As one walks around the nave, it is fascinating to choose di fferent positions to view the space or study the paintings. The cir- cle of chapels feels like a kind of embrace: warm colours, fine marble; the niches of the chapels marked by screens, bathing in a gentle light. There are but two restrictions to the contemporary visitor: the first is the limes between nave and high altar, the latter being reserved for ordained priests. The second is the entrance fee, required to visit the Novitiate buildings. 37 In the past, novices would enter their church from that direction: this meant that the chapel of the Passion (a sign of fate and testing) was on their left, and more or less in front of them they would observe Saint Ignatius's chapel (a sign of inspiration and perseverance), and on their right the novices would see the main altar (a sign of purpose and support). In the corridor to the Novitiate, I noticed a small passage to the altar, between the outer wall and the pillar. Also, on the left of the main altar, one could walk behind a pillar into the niche with the cruci fix. The niche, the corridor to the Novitiate, and the main altar were all connected, yet only ordained priests were granted access, making clear that this privileged space marked the end of the novitiate. The decorations throughout the Noviciate were there to guide the life of the novices, both in the rooms of the buildings where they studied, worked and slept, and in this sacred space, where the novices prayed and attended Mass. Once in the church, the novices were safely sheltered in the nave. Around them (almost as if embracing them) were the chapels of the Passion, the two most important figure-heads of their order and the saint-protector of the novitiate. All were meant to inspire and strengthen the novices' calling. This calling became visible in the sacred space of the high altar, where priests celebrated the mystery of the Eucharist under the saintly protection of the apostle Andrew, whose martyrdom was the subject of the altarpiece. Just to the left of it, the cruci fix invited one to personal prayer. On the right is the entrance to the buildings where the novices studied to become priests themselves. 36 Terhalle, S. Andrea al Quirinale , 93-119. 37 After paying a small fee, one can visit the sacristy and the room were Stanislaus Kostka died. I mentioned the statue of him on his deathbed made by Pierre Le Gros. There is a closed door behind glass, displayed as if it is relic. It might be an addition to the motive of the gate (novitiate as gateway to the priesthood). Perhaps it is a motive in its own right: I also came across doors behind glass, marking the passage of illustrious Jesuits, in the Collegio Romano .120 Smeets As if it was a manifestation of the trajectory of the novitiate, all the curving perspectives from the nave of the church, seem to merge in the high altar. The centre of this (more or less oval) recess of the high altar is formed by the scene of Saint Andrew in agony on his cross by Il Borgonogne. The novices are reminded that the patron saint of their church died on the cross. That is not a happy ending, but then again, it is not really the end. The saint's gaze is directed upwards, and the gilt stucco angels from above frame the altarpiece, shining in the light from the altar's own oculus. Just before one can envision the death of Saint Andrew (the statue captures him in the moments before his death; sig- nificantly, the statue is positioned in the recess of the high altar, accessible only to priests), the gaze of the beholder in the nave follows Saint Andrew's to the hidden source of light, and from there upwards to the dome of the church. There, just above the boundary between high altar and nave, is a colossal figure of the patron saint. Sitting on clouds, his arms spread, he is ascending to heaven - angels seem to welcome him from the cupola, bathing in the light coming from above, shining on both saint and onlooker. This is where the narrative ends. It is remarkable how our attention is guided towards the vertically ori- ented second half of the Church's iconography: from the mystery of Saint Andrew's martyrdom to the transcendental reward of grace and light from heaven, a light which gives Saint Andrew's face the impression of ecstasy. Seeing this ecstasy, really seeing it, and envisioning it with the eyes of one's mind, the light from above could cause the very same ecstasy in one's soul and heart. Who would be willing to resist that perspective? 38 Of course, modern visitors are not the intended audience of the paintings, stucco and marble. Nevertheless these works of art still tell their stories about beauty, colour, harmony, passion, strength, convictions, mission and grace. There are several aspects to dazzle the visitor: the sharp contrast between the bright sun outside and the filtered light inside the church, the beauty of its architecture, the focused walk around the nave, watching the art, trying to dis- cern the details of the paintings, and the gaze upwards, craning your neck, slowly following the curve of the dome, right up to the centre of the copula. The altarpieces and the cruci fix tell a story supporting the education of the novices. The centre of attention, the high altar, marks the place where this horizontality curves into the verticality of a programme of inspiration and pas- sion, enforcing the vocation and calling of the novices. The Sant'Andrea is about conversion, preparing and inspiring its intended audience to a dedi- cated life committed to an active apostolate. 38 C.

It could be in the air, but it is much more likely that the Eternal City's art and history have its e ffect on my experience. There is a logic and persuasiveness inherent in the world of sacred imagery, be they written, built, carved or painted. Precisely here my re flections on the bond between temptation and conversion help me to see, and really see ( visio ), all the while being aware of the fact that one never sees all there is to be envisioned. Against the backdrop of Gregorian spirituality one may be triggered, inspired, tempted by works of art. In this light, the Sant'Andrea al Quirinale discloses clear intentions to tempt one into the narrative structure of conversion and feel embraced by it. At least as long as the gaze is held, it frames, moves, and colours my impressions and emotions. I visited this Jesuit church twice. The second time around, there were a few tourists walking around the church, silently looking at the paintings and the architecture. I remember observing them. A family of four, the children listen- ing attentively to their mother's whispered explanations and looking at everything she pointed out to them, and some students - of art perhaps? The youngsters would have been more or less the same age as the novices of earlier ages. Although we all saw the same building and I could see in some of the student's drawings that they were actually quite focused, I could not imagine that they experienced the same as those seventeenth century novices. Unless of course, the impact of the discourse of conversion, as told by the iconogra- phy and architecture of the Sant'Andrea , operates like the mustard seed of the Gospels. In that case, the beauty of the Sant'Andrea , even for accidental visitors today, remains a patient and polite temptation into conversion. Bibliography Adriaen, M. (ed.). Baroque .

The Threefold Spiritual Development of Hopkins S.J. Chapter 8 \"I Have Wounded My Soul with the Instrument of Salvation\": The Threefold Spiritual Development of Gerard Manley Hopkins S.J. Joep van Gennip 1 Introduction In this chapter I will focus on the threefold spiritual development of Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844-1889). 1 These three 'stages' were his conversion as a member of the Church of England to Rome in 1866, his decision to enter the Society of Jesus two years later, and the transformation of his poems (nature sonnets) under the in fluence of Scotus's philosophy and the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, roughly from 1868 onwards. As we will see, at all these stages the highly sensitive Hopkins was struggling with con flicting ideas which he held so high: his opinion on the inseparability of art and religion, his asceticism and disciplining of the senses versus his admiration of nature's beauty as a means to praise God, and his poetry as a way of expressing his deepest religious feelings. One should not make the mistake of interpreting these 'stages' of conversion, or shifting religious mindsets, as isolated events in his life in a strict chronology. Hopkins's religious and artistic ideas never stopped developing, as one can see in his diaries, notes and correspondence. Almost every aspect of Hopkins's life has been studied and re flected on by scholars all over the world. 2 Although his poetic talent was only recognized years after his death with the publication in 1918 of his Poems by his friend Robert Bridges, the debate about his status as a modernist and his poetical heritage (sprung rhythm or metrical experiments, inscapes, metaphysical lan- 1 The quote in the title of this chapter is derived from Hopkins's letter to rev.

It will also take some of his poems and diary-notes into account insofar as they provide an insight into these processes. 2 \"When It Came It Was All in a Minute\": Hopkins's First Conversion Gerard Manley Hopkins was born in Stratford in the county of Essex on 28 July 1844. He was brought up in a typical middle-class Anglican family. His parents, Manley Hopkins and Kate Smith, were artistically gifted. His father, by profes- sion an insurance agent, was an autodidact, teaching himself French, Latin, Greek and church history in his spare time. As a consequence of the industri- alization and overpopulation of Stratford, which had become an outskirt of London, the family decided to move to Hampstead, where the eight year old Hopkins was placed in a day school. A couple of years later he became a boarder at Highgate Grammar School. In these years, 1854-1862, we find a first glimpse of his sympathy for Catholicism. On his thirteenth birthday he received a book of John Henry Parker, called An Introduction to the Study of Gothic Architecture (1849). In this study the author reveals an aesthetic vision on the Gothic Revival, relating it to the time of the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church: the Middle Ages. 4 In the nineteenth century, this vision became highly popular among the Catholic elite as it constructed a political, social and aesthetic system in which Rome could once more prevail. According to Hopkins's biographer Norman White, Parker's publication had a profound impact on the young man. 5 His Highgate school-prize poem The Escorial (1860) combined this view on Catholic archi- tecture with Hopkins's rather strange interest in austerity and martyrdom. Some stories survive from his days at Highgate in which he is characterized as someone who was preoccupied with vocation, abstinence and ascesis. This 3 Cf. F.

Milward, Landscape and Inscape: Vision and Inspiration in Hopkins's Poetry (London: Elek Books Ltd., 1975). 4 By the end of the nineteenth century this neo-Gothic style was firmly established as the predominant 'Catholic style' in the Netherlands, whereas in England the gothic style was also related to the Anglican (High) Church. 5 N. White, Hopkins: A Literary Biography (Oxford: Clarendon Press,1992), 21-22.125 The Threefold Spiritual Development of Hopkins S.J. dualism between the body and the soul and his quest to master his senses for a higher 'purpose' directed him for the first time to the Catholic Church. A cou- ple of years later, in 1866, just before his conversion, he sublimated this ascetic tendency in a poem called The Habit of Perfection. In his youth however his contacts with Catholics and their customs were non-existent, so he had to imagine his own romantic and ideal Catholic world. His boarding school and its headmaster John Bradley Dyne were indi fferent to Catholicism as well as to the growing popularity of Tractarianism. The latter group, also called the Oxford Movement, derived its name from the 'Tracts for The Times' , written from 1833 onwards. The Tractarians symbolized the neo-Catholic High Church party of the Anglican establishment. Just like the Roman Catholic Church they had a penchant for religious rituals, and were therefore often sarcastically called 'ritualists' by their opponents. Religious penance and self- flagellation was also not uncommon among their members. This movement, which had a dramatic in fluence on Hopkins's Oxford years, had a medieval vision on Victorian society and found its aesthetic counterpart in John Ruskin, the lead- ing English art critic, and the Pre-Raphaelites established in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In April 1863 the then nineteen year old Hopkins went up to Oxford to read Classics. He had won an exhibition at Balliol College, at the time a stronghold of liberalism and rationalism and so the very opposite of the Tractarian move- ment. 6 Benjamin Jowett, Regius Professor of Greek and the great translator of Plato's Dialogues , became Hopkins's tutor. In this period, Jowett was widely known as the head of the liberal and scienti fic-utilitarian camp, commonly called the Broad Church Party. In Hopkins' Oxford years the 'Tractarian Wars' once more intensi fied and entered their third and final stage, leaving the Tractarians defeated in the 1860s. 7 The two camps were well-organized, with Jowett and the members of Balliol in the one, and Doctor Edward Bouverie Pusey and Canon Harry Parry Liddon with their Tractarian headquarters at Christ Church forming the other. The debate focused, among many other things, on the Essays and Reviews , published in 1860, \"a collection of seven 6 \"Rationalism is the very logical development of the principles of Protestantism whereby 'hu- man reason' is set up as the sole source and test of all truth. Cardinal Newman de fined it in terms of 'liberalism'\". See John Pick, Gerard Manley Hopkins: Priest and Poet (London: Oxford University Press, 19662), 10. 7 The preceding phases in the Tractarian Wars were 1833-1841, ending with the exile of Newman from Oxford, and 1842-1859, ending with the arrival of Henry Parry Liddon in Oxford.

Although Jowett was Hopkins's tutor, the latter nonetheless showed sympa- thy for the Tractarian-side. Within months of his arrival in Oxford, the young Hopkins started to go to the weekly series of Tractarian lectures given by Liddon and Pusey. In November 1864 Hopkins made his first confession to Liddon, a year later Pusey became his confessor. Prior to their election, Hopkins, for obvious reasons, started to ful fil his religious duties in Christ Church Cathedral rather than worshipping at Balliol. But it must have been hard for the young Victorian to be loyal to both. \"Hopkins's strains were per- sonal as well as theological, for he must have felt as though he was being crushed to death between two killers, Pusey and Jowett, each of whom eyed him as fiercely for signs of disloyalty as they eyed one another for signs of fatal weakness\". 10 Probably the disastrous results for the Tractarian Movement in these years and Hopkins's continuing longing for a steadfast faith that was indi fferent to Modernism and firmly rooted in dogmas and doctrines made him look again at the Church of Rome, which at the time was dominated by Ultramontanism. The Syllabus Errorum , issued in 1864 by Pope Pius IX, could hardly have come at a better time. So it was in his early Oxford years that Hopkins became aware of his Catholic interest. His crisis of faith diminished as a result of his preoc- cupation with rituals, ascesis and religious fasting on the one hand, and his artistic and poetic view on earthly beauty on the other. There was also his presumed homosexuality to cope with. Young Victorians like Hopkins hardly saw any women. They were brought up by male teachers and surrounded by other boys in public school. College life in Oxford, as in other universities, was largely dominated by men, and the passionate and intellectual friendship with fellow students, and even the dons of the college, 8 Sulloway, Gerard Manley Hopkins and the Victorian Temper , 13. 9 Ibid., 12. 10 Ibid., 19.127 The Threefold Spiritual Development of Hopkins S.J. was part of the Oxford culture. One could even speak of a 'homosexual sensi- bility' among Anglo-Catholic Victorians. Against this background, Hopkins's ability to cope with his homoerotic feelings and with the conviction that his sexual nature was irredeemably sinful, manifested itself in his ascetic prac- tices, religious ritualism and radical choices. Or as Julia Saville remarkably noted, \"ascetic practices that appear to mortify the flesh in the interests of spir- itual invigoration may paradoxically prove sensually and erotically satisfying too\". 11 What he probably hoped for was that his radical choice for the Church of Rome a couple of years later, burning his poetry and mastering his senses, would rid him of his homosexual feelings or at least channel them. There are some hints that Hopkins had intimate feelings for the handsome and artisti- cally gifted Digby Mackworth Dolben, a distant cousin of his Oxford friend Robert Bridges, who, although still a Tractarian, was totally obsessed with Catholic rituals. Dolben's handsomeness as well as his fascination with Catholicism and rigorous fasting must have in fluenced Hopkins's decision to become a member of the Church of Rome. 12 Hopkins and Dolben shared a con flict between secular and divine love. In Hopkins's opinion it was impossible to separate art and religion, a conviction shared by the Pre-Raphaelites and Ruskin. Therefore Hopkins's early Catholic awareness found its way into some religious poems he composed in Oxford, such as Barn floor and Winepress , New Readings , He hath abolished the Old Drouth , and his unpublished notebook poem Rest .13 In the latter, his religious quest reached a climax as he was desperately longing for inner peace and reli- gious certainty: I have desired to go Where springs not fail; To fields where flies not the unbridled hail, And a few lilies bow. I have desired to be Where havens are dumb; Where the green water-heads may never come, As in the unloved sea. 14 11 J.

Cf. also his poem 'Heaven-Haven'. 128 Van Gennip In 1864, John Henry Newman, the old figure-head of Tractarianism, published his Apologia pro Vita Sua . This account of his conversion to Rome in 1845 had a profound impact on those Anglo-Catholics who were willing to take the same step. \"Newman's Apologia is the central text in the mythology of Victorian Catholic conversion. It is the narrative by which many later converts, including Gerard Manley Hopkins, interpreted their experience\". 15 Newman, fully aware of this, constructed his Apologia and his earlier satirical novel Loss and Gain: The Story of a Convert (1848) in such a way that it would appeal directly to potential converts, especially those Tractarian students living in Oxford. In both publications Newman described his own conversion as a long spiritual struggle. He stressed that one should not become Catholic on basis of idealistic or romantic feelings, but instead should proceed to Rome by rational argu- ments and common sense: \"Go by reason, not by feeling\". Hopkins followed pretty much the same path, as we can see in his letters and notebooks, although he was keen to play down the in fluence of the spiritual and emotional crisis he experienced at the beginning of 1865. 16 Muller formulates the situation as follows: By the time Hopkins read the Apologia , he was already strongly attracted to Roman Catholicism. It was an attraction formed in adolescence from a compound of aesthetic medievalism, spiritual hunger, and rebellion against paternal authority. Newman's autobiographical writings o ffered Hopkins a carefully reasoned theological argument for conversion, while subtly a ffirming the prompting of his heart. 17 Another indication that Hopkins was in the middle of a spiritual and religious search, was a remark in his notebook in the winter of 1865. There he argued that he wanted to read the biography of the French ecclesiastic, journalist and Dominican Henri-Dominique Lacordaire (1802-1861) who, after lapsing from the Catholic faith in his youth, found his way back to Rome and became a fig- urehead of liberal Catholicism in France. 18 W.H.

Instead of what is often claimed, Hopkins had a long period of inner spiri- tual preparation before he finally converted to Rome. 19 His knowledge of Roman Catholicism was mostly gained from books rather than through per- sonal contacts. He knew few Catholics, nor did he have a proper understanding of their social and political position as a minority in the mid-Victorian era. The English Catholic hierarchy was restored in 1850, a momentous event, since Catholic worship had been forbidden since Queen Elizabeth's reign. Nonetheless it took until 1908 before the Sacred College of Propaganda in Rome really handed over the administration of the English Church to the national bishops. So, in 1866, the year in which Hopkins converted to Rome, the structure of the English Catholic Church was still in its initial phase and anti-Catholic prejudices were still quite common, although Newman's positive influence on English Victorian society ended some of these prejudices among the more liberal Anglicans. Nonetheless, the integration of Catholics in English society still had a long way to go. What may be rather more surprising, is that the di fferent movements within the English Catholic Church were living in discord with each other. One of the larger Catholic factions was that of the Ultramontanes. 20 This 'party' , focused on papal supremacy, gained international success among Catholics who sought to integrate Roman Catholicism into national government policy and under- line papal infallibility. 21 The Ultramontanes advocated a strong devotional and pious, ritual-based spirituality. Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, the Passionist father Ignatius Spencer, the Oratorian Frederick William Faber and the wealthy Catholic layman William George Ward were among its leaders. Ward had been one of the leading figures of the Oxford Movement before he left the Church of England in 1845. In fact, most of these Ultramontanes were Oxford converts. On the other side of the English Catholic spectrum, we find Newman with his 'dialogue faction'. Although Newman could hardly be posi- tioned in just one Catholic camp - he upheld a social conservatism and was dogmatically inspired - he did stand for a sort of 'liberal' Catholicism as far as the participation of the laity in the Church and non-clerical higher education was concerned. 22 In that sense Newman was probably closest to the old 19 Cf.

Finally there were some Catholic adherents with a more romantic and medieval vision of society, who neither favoured the spirituality of the Ultramontanists nor that of the Newmanians. Around the middle of the nineteenth century there were around 700,000 Catholics living in England, forming 3.5 per cent of all worshippers in the country. 23 The Catholic population consisted roughly of three di fferent groups: the so-called 'Old Catholics' or recusants, families who had endured prosecutions over time. Secondly, there were the working-class Irish immi- grants, flooding the country from the 1840s onward, due to economic malaise in their own country and to a great need for labour in the growing industry in English cities. And lastly the intellectual, newly converted Catholics, who had often matriculated at Oxford and Cambridge and had a past in the Oxford Movement or the High Church Party. The mutual understanding between these Catholic groups was often troublesome and laborious, and the Old Catholics especially were suspicious of the new intellectual converts, whom Hopkins would soon join. In the fall of 1865 Hopkins, still at Oxford, composed his poem The Halfway House , in which he described the Church of England as a halfway house to Rome. 24 The young Victorian became convinced that the doctrine of transub- stantiation, the cornerstone of his conviction, was best guaranteed in the Church of Rome, since the Anglican Church could claim no infallible authority for their sacramental beliefs. 25 Just like Newman, Hopkins would convert to Catholicism from a rational and intellectual point of view, not on a whim or guided by emotions or a romantic ideal, as could have been expected, consid- ering Hopkins's artistic background. In January 1866, Hopkins wrote his most ascetic poem: The Habit of Perfection . In it, his preoccupation with ascesis is so completely tied up with the doctrine of Christ's incarnation that it left him no opportunity but to abandon his old faith. 23 Norman, The English Catholic Church in the Nineteenth Century , 205-206. In the religious census held in 1851 in England the number of Catholics were estimated around 252,783. Far less than the above mentioned 700,000, but the smaller figure probably compromised only those who regularly attended Mass or communicated. 24 The title of the poem is derived from Newman's statement that \"there are but two alterna- tives, the way to Rome and the way to Atheism: Anglicanism is the halfway house on the one side, and Liberalism is the halfway house on the other\".

In 1866 Hopkins and his Balliol friend and future fellow convert William Addis spent their summer at Belmont, a Benedictine Monastery in Hereford, where they had a long conversation with Canon Paul Raynal about the 'doubt- ful validity' of Anglican orders. Addis noted in his diary, \"I think he [Raynal] made a great impression on both of us and I believe that from that time our faith in Anglicanism was really gone\". 26 Later, Addis remarked on Raynal that he was \"probably the first Catholic priest Hopkins ever spoke to\". 27 Soon after, Hopkins spent some time with his friends Willem Alexander Comyn Macfarlane and Alfred William Garrett in Horseham. There, in Horseham, his ongoing reli- gious quest suddenly came to an end: he left the Anglican Church for Rome. Once he had taken his decision, he felt an inner spiritual rest and ful filment. In a letter to his close friend and mentor Edward William Urquhart, who himself was an Anglican priest, Hopkins re flected on his transition of mid-July 1866: \"In fact as I told you my conversion when it came was all in a minute\". 28 Back in Oxford, Hopkins chose to say little about his 'great turn' , although already within a week he 'confesses' his choice to Macfarlane, during a walk with him in the Sussex countryside. 29 When in July 1866 Hopkins decided to become a Roman Catholic it was not a 'Pauline conversion on the road to Horseham'. Hopkins had been struggling with his religious feelings for several years and the defeat of the Tractarians in the mid-1860s must have made him even more aware of the fallibility of the Anglican Church. His discussion with Canon Raynal probably did the rest. In September 1866, at the start of his finals in Oxford, he travelled to the Birmingham Oratory where he would meet John Henry Newman to arrange for his reception. Without question Hopkins's familiarity with Newman's Apologia and his conversion-novel Loss and Gain directed him to Newman, although the Oratorian had not been directly involved in Hopkins's conversion until that time. That Hopkins was resolute about his conviction, is obvious from his first letter to Newman. He wrote \"I do not want to be helped to any conclusions of belief, for I am thankful to say my mind is made up\". 30 One could get the impression that to Hopkins, Newman was simply a church o fficial who received him into the Roman Church. But Newman, having gone the same path earlier, 26 Quoted in: G.F. Lahey, Gerard Manley Hopkins (London: Octagon Books, 1930), 21. How- ever, Addis reverted to Anglicanism later on. 27 Quoted in: Mariani, Hopkins , 14. 28 GMH to Edward William Urquhart, 4 October 1866.

Vol. I, 93-94, at 93.132 Van Gennip was acutely aware of the pain and the distress which the young Hopkins's radi- cal choice would cause among his friends and relatives, as he wrote, \"It is not wonderful that you should not be able to take so great a step without trou- ble and pain\". 31 Contemporary readers have to realize that those in Victorian England who converted to Roman Catholicism opted for a second-class sta- tus in society, and that ecumenism was almost non-existent between the two churches and that there was still the sincere, fearful conviction that those not living in true faith were in peril of eternal damnation. In short: it felt a mat- ter of life and death. In a long and emotional letter, dated 16-17 October 1866, Hopkins informed his father about his forthcoming reception into the Catholic Church. His father had begged him to delay his decision until after his gradua- tion, but Hopkins refused, stating that: I cannot fight against God Who calls me to His Church: if I were to delay and die in the meantime I sh[oul]d have no plea why my soul was not forfeit. I have no power in fact to stir a finger: it is God Who makes the decision and not I. 32 In a separate letter to his mother, around the same time, the emotional pain becomes even more tangible: Your letters, wh[ich] shew the utmost fondness, suppose none on my part and the more you think me hard and cold and that I repel and throw you off the more I am helpless not to write as if it were true. In this way I have no relief. You might believe that I su ffer too. I am your very loving son, Gerard M. Hopkins. 33 On the next day, 21 October 1866, Gerard Manley Hopkins was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the Birmingham Oratory by John Henry Newman, 34 31 John Henry Newman to GMH , 18 October 1866.

For now, however, he was completely satis fied with the clear sign God had given him. Speak! whisper to my watching heart One word - as when a mother speaks Soft, when she sees her infant start, Till dimpled joy steals o'er its cheeks. Then, to behold Thee as Thou art, I'll wait till morn eternal breaks. 36 2 'Don't Call the Jesuit Discipline Hard': Hopkins's Religious Vocation Hopkins's call to become a priest must have been far less dramatic than his first conversion from the Established Church to Rome. His obsession with ascesis, rituals, the Eucharist and penitence had already steered him in the direction of Rome. It seemed that once he had taken this step, it also made him consider becoming a Catholic clergyman. Moreover, Newman and Manning both chose to become priests soon after their conversion, although they had already held orders in the Church of England. 37 Hopkins did not. In classical conversion literature, the choice for an inwardly spiritual life or the decision to enter a religious community has also been labelled conversion. 38 It is in this respect that we look upon Hopkins's religious vocation as his second conversion. Almost immediately upon his o fficial turn to Rome, in October 1866, the young Victorian began to re flect on his future and considered whether he had a vocation for the priesthood. Newman advised him not to hurry his decision and finish his studies first. In Lent 1867, still before his graduation, Hopkins left for the Benedictine monastery in Hereford which he had visited a couple of 35 Mariani, Hopkins , 36. 36 This is the ninth and last stanza of Hopkins's unpublished poem 'Nondum' , with its epi- graph 'Verily art a God that hidest Thyself' (cf. Is. 45: 15), written in 1866. Gardner (ed.), The Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins , 32-34. 37 Newman became Catholic in 1845 and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1847. Manning converted in 1851, noteworthy by a Jesuit, and became a clergyman in the Church of Rome in the same year. 38 H.P. de la Boullaye, \"Conversion\" , Dictionnaire (Paris: Beauchesne, 1953), 2224-2265.134 Van Gennip years earlier. His first impressions and the discussion he had with Father Raynal probably gave him the idea to decide to make his retreat with the Benedictines. He hoped that his self-chosen isolation would help him determine whether he had a religious vocation and, if he had, whether a monastic way of life, like the Benedictines, would be best suited for him. 39 He returned to Oxford without the result he had hoped for, and obtained a first in Classical Greats, the highest degree. In September 1867, several months after his graduation, Hopkins was o ffered a post as a teacher at Newman's Birmingham Oratory boys' school, still trying to figure out his plans for the future. His religious quest dragged on for about two more years and it almost caused him to su ffer a nervous breakdown. 40 For Hopkins, a potential religious vocation meant far more than just a call to the priesthood. It also touched upon his struggle with his emotional and homo- erotic feelings, the strong disapproval of his parents, his own opinion on divine and secular love and his re flection on penitence, contrition and sin. Or as Muller formulated it: \"believing his sexual nature to be irredeemably sinful, he sought a religious vocation that would demand the ego's absolute surrender\". 41 In January 1868, Hopkins wrote to his best friend Robert Bridges, who was about to set sail for the continent, about his impending decision: This note accordingly is to say goodbye. The year you will be away I have no doubt will make a great di fference in my position though I cannot know exactly what. But the uncertainty I am in about the future is so very unpleasant and so breaks my power of applying to anything that I am resolved to end it, which I shall do by going into a retreat at Easter at the latest and deciding whether I have a vocation to the priesthood. 42 The teaching at the Birmingham Oratory took its toll and Hopkins had little time to consider his future. In a letter to his Oxford friend Alexander Baillie, dated February 12, 1868, Hopkins again complained about his time-consuming obligations at the school, although 'the boys are very nice indeed'. In the same letter, the young teacher re flects for the first time on his availability for the priesthood: 39 Mariani, Gerard Manley Hopkins , 58. 40 Pick, Gerard Manley Hopkins , 22. 41 Muller, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Victorian Catholicism , 26. 42 GMH to R obert Bridges, 9 January 1868.

I am expecting to take orders and soon, but I wish it to be secret still it comes about. Besides that it is the happiest and best way if practically is the only one. You know I once wanted to be a painter. But even if I could I w[oul]d not, I think, now, for the fact is that the higher and more attrac- tive parts of the art put a strain upon the passions which I sh[oul]d think it unsafe to encounter. I want to write still and as a priest I very likely can do that too, not so freely as I sh[oul]d have liked, e.g. nothing or little in the verse way, but no doubt what w[oul]d best serve the cause of my religion. 43 It seemed that Hopkins had already made up his mind, since he told Baillie in confidence that he would soon take orders. But what is more interesting, is his reflection on the moral impossibility of becoming a painter or an artist, because it would unleash his uncontrolled passions that he was so trying hard to suppress. \"He [Hopkins] knows as deeply as he knows anything that once he makes up his mind to follow God's will for him and become a priest, he will have the only 'real sense of freedom' he has ever had\". 44 A special meeting at the Redemptorist school only served to strengthen his vocation. In 1868, the annual Easter retreat for Hopkins's pupils was organised by the Jesuit father Henry James Coleridge. 45 He was a product of Eton and, like Newman, of Oxford's Trinity College. As a Tractarian, Coleridge became a priest in the Established Church, but with the condemnation of Pusey and Newman, he changed sides. After a retreat with the Redemptorist Fathers, Coleridge went over to Rome in 1852. Four years later he was ordained in the Catholic Church and in 1857 he entered the Society of Jesus. In December 1867, Newman had already urged Hopkins to discuss 'matters' , probably his voca- tion, with Coleridge during his stay for the retreat. 46 At the Jesuit's request, Hopkins later made a ten-day private retreat at Manresa House, the novitiate 43 GMH to Ale xander William Mowbray Baillie, 12 February 1868.

Hopkins's friends Alex- ander Wood, Henry Oxenham and notably Digby Dolben had had contacts with Jesuits, tough if Hopkins was aware of this we do not know. Mariani, Gerard Manley Hopkins , 27; A.

On the last day of his retreat he wrote in his journal, \"I have resolved to be a religious\" , but he does not seem to have decided on a speci fic religious order yet.49 The answer came only a couple of days later, followed by an 'intellectual massacre'. Sadly, Hopkins's decision to enter the Society of Jesus was followed by his act of destroying all the finished copies of his poems. \"Slaughter of the innocents\" , he ironically called it in his diary. 50 Some of Hopkins's earlier biog- raphers, such as C. Day Lewis and I.A. Richards, have interpreted this act of destruction as a fundamental break in his life, a formal farewell to his artistic and poetic activities ad maiorem Dei gloriam . They distinguish between Hopkins the poet and Hopkins the Jesuit. Biographer John Pick, however, has successfully argued that there was no such division and that Hopkins destroyed his earlier work so that it might not interfere, as he feared, with his fullest dedi- cation to the religious life. 51 He simply \"wanted to enter the novitiate with nothing standing between him and God\". At that moment it was questionable whether Hopkins understood that his choice for the priesthood, and his decision to become a Jesuit did not nec- essarily mean that he had to suppress his emotions, senses and creativity. Ignatian spirituality in the second half of the nineteenth century, with its rigid, Ultramontane doctrinal model, did not leave much space for intellectual cre- ativity, nor did the emphasis on obedience and self-denial for which the Jesuits were renowned. Later, after he had performed the Spiritual Exercises and had got to know Ignatius's motto \"to search and find God in all things\" , Hopkins 47 Unfortunately it was also this man, Henry James Coleridge, who as editor rejected in 1876 Hopkins's most famous poem The Wreck of the Deutschland for the Jesuit periodical The Month. 48 In the nineteenth century the following larger clerical religious orders (re)-established Salesians (1887).

Jesuit and biographer Alfred Thomas added to these considerations the typical 'Englishness' of the English Province, seduc- tive to Hopkins as a patriot. 54 But maybe also his self-dissatisfaction - in his journal he calls them 'sins' - about his waste of time and ine ffectiveness, may have paved his path to the Jesuits, since the order was widely known for its detailed and rigid daily regimen. 55 In that sense his decision was a self-in flicted system of contrition, penitence, and puri fication. Newman, one of the first to hear the news, remarked about Hopkins's choice: \"I am both surprised and glad at your news. [...] I think it is the very thing for you. [...] Don't call 'the Jesuit discipline hard' , it will bring you to heaven\". 56 3 'The World is Charged with the Grandeur of God': Hopkins's Third Conversion \"When Hopkins became a Jesuit he 'moved out of the mainstream of English society' and into a 'subculture' that seemed 'exotic and even sinister to most Englishmen'\" , remarked one of Hopkins's biographers about his radical step. 57 In the second half of the nineteenth century, the social position of Roman Catholics in English society had steadily improved, though eruptions of anti- Catholic sentiments could always suddenly surface. The Jesuits, re-established worldwide in 1814, had met with the severest opposition from Protestants as well as Catholics during the preceding century. The Jesuit foundations of sev- eral new (boarding) schools and parish churches in the Victorian age still 52 Some have argued that Hopkins was already familiar with the Spiritual Exercises before he entered the Jesuit's noviciate.

Although he had abandoned his poetic aspirations, the diary of his Swiss holiday is full of lively and colourful observations of small villages, people and nature. The journal offers us a first glimpse of a new vocabulary, including words like inscape, instress, scape and outscape . Such language would become the cornerstone of his later nature sonnets. 60 On 7 September 1868 Hopkins started his new life at Manresa House, the novitiate of the Jesuits in Roehampton. 61 During the following two years Hopkins was subjected to a tight schedule and strict discipline. Bearing in mind his own ascetic practices from years earlier, he was well 'prepared' , although it was his novice master Fr. Peter Gallwey who decided if and when such extra practices of penance were allowed. 62 The Victorian Jesuit studied hard, meditated often, listened daily to exhortations and in what little free time he had, made some entries in his diary and wrote a few letters to his mother and his friend Robert Bridges. 63 Like any novice's, Hopkins's time was mainly spent on a thorough introduction into the Society's Constitutions , into Ignatian spirituality, the Long Retreat and the Spiritual Exercises. The latter changed Hopkins's mindset and poetic re flections in such a dramatic way, that we might well speak of a third conversion. Hopkins's biographer Pick used the following words to describe the profound impact of the Spiritual Exercises on the Victorian poet. To underline their e ffect on Hopkins I give the quotation almost in full length: 58 F. Edwards, The Jesuits in England. From 1580 to the present day (Kent: Burns & Oates, 1985), 188-200. 59 Thomas, Hopkins the Jesuit , 15. 60 White, Hopkins , 162-167. 61 Already before his tour to Switzerland, Hopkins's application for admission was accepted by the Jesuit Provincial Fr. Weld on May 19th. 1868. For a detailed account of Hopkins's two-years novitiate, see Thomas, Hopkins the Jesuit , 23-86. 62 Thomas, Hopkins the Jesuit , 39-40. Noteworthy his earlier poem The Habit of Perfection (1866) had as subtitle 'The novice'. 63 The novices were encouraged to keep a spiritual diary to measure their spiritual progres- sion. Unfortunately Hopkins's spiritual diaries are lost or destroyed. In his 'secular' diary the entries on his spiritual experience during the novitiate are scarce.139 The Threefold Spiritual Development of Hopkins S.J. They [the Spiritual Exercises ] became a part of his life and attitude. They gave direction to all he experienced, thought, and wrote. They in fluenced his most exuberant and joyous poems; they were part of his su fferings and desolation. [...] They fashioned his reaction to nature and beauty. Their echo is found in his humility, his asceticism, in his scrupulousness, his consciousness of imperfection, in his abnegation and in the integrity with which he faced hardship and disappointment. His attitude toward poetry and fame was shaped by them. They moulded his native tempera- ment and sensibility to an ideal of perfection. Without knowing something of them we can hardly know the priest-poet. 64 Probably the compulsory long 'recreational' walks of the novices through the countryside and their work on the land during the hay making season inspired Hopkins more than once to describe trees and sunsets in all their beauty in his diary. 65 These entries could be regarded as a general exercise for his later nature sonnets and they already give us a glimpse of Hopkins's developing sacramen- tal view of nature: \"One day when the bluebells were in bloom I wrote the following. I do not think I have seen anything more beautiful than the bluebell I have been looking at. I know the beauty of our Lord by it\". 66 On 8 September 1870 Hopkins took his first solemn vows. A couple of days later Gerard was sent to Stonyhurst in hilly Lancashire, where the Jesuits ran a public school and the adjoining seminary of St. Mary's Hall, to study philoso- phy as part of the Jesuit training. During the following three years the teachings of St. Thomas, or rather his philosophical works as interpreted by the sixteenth- century Spanish Jesuit Francisco Su\u00e1rez, became second nature to the group of thirty- five students, of which Hopkins was part. Regarding the religious life as well as the in fluence of the Spiritual Exercises on Hopkins during these years there is little to say. At the end of his second year at St. Mary's Hall, the young Jesuit discovered the philosophical works of the medieval Oxford Franciscan scholar Duns Scotus. 67 Scotus's metaphysical worldview and his interpretation of Aristotle had a profound impact on Hopkins. Not only his future poems but also his current detailed descriptions of nature could be seen as cultural and artistic echoes of Scotus's metaphysical worldview. 64 Pick, Gerard Manley Hopkins , 25-26. 65 Cf. House (ed.), The Journals and Papers , 189-193, 195-196, 199. 66 House (ed.), The Journals and Papers , 199. 67 According to Devlin 'it was almost certainly through Suarez that he [Hopkins] came to know Scotus'. Devlin (ed.), The sermons and devotional writings , 292.140 Van Gennip Yet another development during his philosophate is important for under- standing the essence of his third conversion. Already during his arrival year at Stonyhurst, Hopkins had installed some important changes in his vocabulary and intellectual language, using neologisms such as 'inscape' and 'instress' ever more frequently and thoroughly. At this juncture, they no longer functioned as mere descriptions of nature, but were widened: \"All the world is full of inscape\" , Hopkins wrote in his diary. 68 The concept 'inscape' could best be de fined as \"the outward re flection of the inner nature of a thing, or a sensible copy or representation of its individual essence\". 69 Ellsberg adds to this de finition that the absolute sel fhood of this something is in harmony with other things. 70 Hopkins himself de fined 'inscape' as 'the very soul of art'. 71 'Inscape' is for him thus far more than just 'shape' as the following description shows: But what I note it all for is this: before I had always taken the sunset and the sun as quite out of gauge with each other, as indeed physically they are, for the eye after looking at the sun is blunted to everything else and if you look at the rest of the sunset you must cover the sun, but today I inscaped them together and made the sun the true eye and ace of the whole, as it is. It was all active and tossing out light and started as strongly forward from the field as a long stone or a boss in the knob of the chalice- stem: it is indeed by stalling it so that it falls into scape with the sky. 72 The parallel between 'inscape' and a Scotist concept such as haecceitas is strik- ing. Both notions merge in the philosophical re flections that Hopkins jotted down during his holiday in August 1872 in Douglas on the Isle of Man. His jour- nal of this period is packed with novelties, rich descriptions of the sea and sky. It is plausible that Hopkins's detailed entries in his diary as well as his frequent use of the word 'inscape' during these years were not only his way to fill in the intellectual and artistic void that resulted from his renunciation of poetic aspi- rations, but they also disclose his very 'Ignatian' approach to admiring God's beauty in all things. 68 House (ed.), The Journals and Papers , 230. 69 W.A.M.

Thornton (ed.), The Collected Works of Gerard Manley Hopkins. Vol. I, 791-797, at 793. 72 House (ed.), The Journals and Papers , 196.141 The Threefold Spiritual Development of Hopkins S.J. In his later commentaries on the Spiritual Exercises, Hopkins frequently used the word 'scape' as a particular translation of the species in the scholastic theory of knowledge. The same was true for that other word, 'instress' , which he used in his commentary. 'Instress' functions as a translation of the scholas- tic concept of actus - i.e. the principle of an object's actuality and continuity. \"Placing 'instress' by the side of 'inscape\" , we note that the first term will strike the poet as the force that holds the latter together; 'instress' is the power that continually actualises the inscape'. 73 In June 1873 Hopkins passed his philosophical De Universa examinations and two months later he was transferred to Roehampton for the so-called regency, before enrolling as a theology student. At Roehampton's noviciate he taught rhetoric to the Jesuit juniors for one year. In comparison to the long days of study at the philosophate, Hopkins's workload at Roehampton was quite limited, giving him ample time to jot down observations in his notebook. On one particular evening passages were written about a: \" fine sunset Nov. 3 - balks of grey cloud searched with long crimsonings running along their hanging folds - this from the lecture room window\" .74 Such ponderings were characteristic of Hopkins's personal notes and on 20 April 1874 we find him writing the following tribute to nature: Young elm leaves lash and lip the sprays. This has been a very beautiful day - fields about us deep green lighted underneath with white daisies, yellower fresh green of leaves above which bathes the skirts of the elms, and their tops are touched and worded with leaf too. [...] my eye was struck by such a sense of green in the tufts and pashes of grass, with pur- ple shadow thrown back on the dry black mould behind them, as I do not remember ever to have been exceeded in looking at green grass. 75 His year of regency passed smoothly, and Hopkins was then sent to St. Beuno College for his theology curriculum. St. Beuno's, located in St. Asaph in the beautiful surroundings of North Wales, would become the location where he ended, upon special request of his superior, his long self-in flicted poetic silence. He often depicted his Welsh surroundings in his poetry and letters, tell- ing his mother that: \"the Welsh landscape has a great charm and when I see Snowdon and the mountains in its neighbourhood, as I can now, with the 73 Peters, Gerard Manley Hopkins , 14. 74 House (ed.), The Journals and Papers , 240. 75 House (ed.), The Journals and Papers , 242-243.142 Van Gennip clouds lifting, it gives me a rise of the heart\". 76 He con fides to his diary: \"Looking all round but most in looking far up the valley I felt an instress and charm of Wales\". 77 In St. Beuno's Hopkins not only continued his praises to nature, but also started to take a serious interest in the Welsh language and folklore. Nonetheless, most of his time was spent reading and attending lectures on moral and dogmatic theology, canon law, church history, Hebrew, the scrip- tures and in Hopkins's third year there were practical exercises in 'cases of conscience'. The whole course was very intense and Hopkins more than once showed \"signs of strain resulting from a combination of deteriorating health and the mental fatigue of studies of a sort (including study methods) not wholly congenial to him\". 78 His frequently reported indigestion and the cold weather, worsened by the insu fficient heating of the building, made it hard for Hopkins to concentrate on his studies and frequently led to periods of depression. His superiors soon noticed his poor health and his deteriorating mental condition. As a conse- quence he was 'summoned' to relax more and was given the advice to take up his poetry again. Hence, by the end of 1875, after seven silent years, he wrote his first poem: 'The Wreck of the Deutschland'. The poem referred to the ship- wreck in the mouth of the Thames, 79 an accident in which five Franciscan nuns, exiles from the German Kulturkampf, had drowned while exclaiming, \"O Christ, come quickly\". In this first poetic utterance, the in fluence of the Spiritual Exercises and Hopkins's readings of the stories of Christ's passion and resurrection are abun- dantly clear. The first stanzas portray not only the actual storm, but bring into account the poet's own mental struggle during his conversion. The total sur- render of both the nuns and Hopkins to God's will was central. Aside this passion-based line, one cannot neglect the in fluence of the 'Two Standards' of the Spiritual Exercises in the closing stanzas. Hopkins's inner certainty, once he had decided to become a religious, is re flected in the triumphalist style of the Wreck , which closely resembles the style of the Two Standards .80 76 GMH to his mother, 20-21 September 1874.

Vol. I, 236-238, at 237. 77 House (ed.), The Journals and Papers , 258. 78 Thomas, Hopkins the Jesuit , 181. 79 There is far more to be said about this poem, its development, and impact on other poetry. E.g. chapter 2 ('\"One 'fetch' in him\". Hopkins's Ultramontane Vision in The Wreck of the Deutschland') in Muller, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Victorian Catholicism ; Leo Martin van Noppen, Gerard Manley Hopkins. The wreck of the Deutschland (s.l. 1980). 80 Cf. also Hopkins's own comment on the Two Standards. Devlin (ed.), The sermons and devotional writings , 178-185.143 The Threefold Spiritual Development of Hopkins S.J. At last his self-in flicted ban on poetry was broken, since Hopkins had to 'obey' the will of his superior, according to the rules of the Society of Jesus, he could now freely merge his philosophical worldview taken from Scotus, his concept of 'inscape' and 'instress' , and his admiration for nature into his poetry. His poems became a means of praising God's beauty. This was done in the light of St. Ignatius's Spiritual Exercises , and Hopkins used the rules for 'election' from the Exercises in his poetry. All his senses were directed to God, according to the 'principle of Foundation' , the starting point of the Exercises , in which one is exhorted to use all created things to attain to God. The parallel between Hopkins's highly sensual sonnets about nature and the applicatio sensuum as a form of meditation in the Spiritual Exercises is also striking. Hopkins's poems were not only a means to praise God, they were also an act of praying in the Ignatian style ('contemplative in action'). Or as Ignatius once wrote: 'if everything is directed towards God, everything is prayer'. 81 Especially in Hopkins's nature sonnets there is another element that reveals the in fluence of Ignatian spirituality, namely the tendency 'to seek and find God in all things'. For Hopkins, the fact that nature exists with all its beauty was in itself an argu- ment for the existence of God. \"The world is charged with the grandeur of God\" , as the first line of his 1877 poem God's Grandeur begins. This also resem- bles a certain parallel with one of the major proofs given by Augustine for the existence of God. Not only in Hopkins's The Wreck of the Deutschland , but also in some other poems he wrote during his theological curriculum ( Spring , Pied Beauty , The Hurrahing in Harvest ), his utter sacramental vision of nature is manifest. 82 Notwithstanding the quality of his earlier poems, only after Hopkins had joined the Jesuits and interiorised Ignatian spirituality and the works of Duns Scotus, did he find a way to express his sensitivity and his religious experience in its best form by praising, through inscapes, the beauty of God's nature with his poems. 83 This third conversion became perhaps most apparent in Hopkins's last nature sonnet As King fishers Catch Fire , which binds the natural activities of each living being to its own inner existence. When a creature lives up to its own existence (its inner strife), it automatically praises the God who has created all living species. Man can choose not to live up to his own inner strife, animals 81 Letter 4012, 'Epistolae et Instructiones S. Ignatii , 52-72. 83 Peters, Gerard Manley Hopkins , 6; Pick, Gerard Manley Hopkins , 32.144 Van Gennip and plants cannot. In their existence and in \"doing what they do\" , they auto- matically glorify their Creator: As king fishers catch fire, dragon flies draw flame; As tumbled over rim in roundy wells Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name; Each mortal thing does one thing and the same: Deals out that being indoors each one dwells; Selves - goes itself; myself it speaks and spells, Crying What I do is me: for that I came. 84 \u00cd say more: the just man justices; Keeps gr\u00e1ce: th\u00e1t keeps all his goings graces; Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is - Chr\u00edst - for Christ plays in ten thousand places, Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his To the Father through the features of men's faces. 4 Closing Remarks Most likely as a consequence of his poor health, Hopkins was not allowed by his superior to complete the full theological training. In September 1877, after passing his theological exams (minor course), he was ordained a priest, and would work as a curate in various cities in the years to come. He never ceased to write poetry. In October 1881 Hopkins started his tertianship in Roehampton. Still, during this special spiritual year, which was the last stage of the Jesuit formation, Hopkins jotted down some notes on the Spiritual Exercises. The year of 1884 installed a final turnabout: what ought to have been the crowning achievement of an academic and religious career, namely the appointment to a chair at the Royal University of Ireland in Dublin, for Hopkins became dreadful last years. The workload was too much for him, his health deteriorated further, and as an English nationalist he became bitter regarding the Irish national cause. And perhaps most of all, he sunk into a mental crisis as a result of his growing awareness that he could not cope with the incompat- ibility of his religious and artistic feelings. In those years, 1884-1889, often referred to as his \"winter world\" , he wrote his so-called Terrible sonnets . These 84 Cf. Jn 18:37.145 The Threefold Spiritual Development of Hopkins S.J. can be read as a personal lamentation, expressing his feelings of abandonment by God. On 8 June 1889, at the age of only forty- five, he died from the e ffects of typhoid fever. Hopkins's threefold conversion as I have discussed it above was quite unique. The emotional and spiritual pain found a wonderful expression in his poetry and personal notes. Hopkins's conversion to Rome was probably the hardest experience, certainly for his family and friends, although the relation- ship with his parents was later restored. They were present at his deathbed. His second conversion, the decision to become a religious, was preceded by a new spiritual struggle. His decision to enter the Society of Jesus in 1868 marked a new point in his life and it determined his poetical opinions. Hopkins's last conversion closely followed his second. The in fluence of the Spiritual Exercises as well as Scotist works on his (later) poetry could not, however, have borne such fruit without the two preceding conversions. Precisely this longstanding process of growth rendered his final conversion into the most splendid and thorough one. It was the genius Hopkins who was able not only to give direc- tion to his feelings, but also to articulate these in an Ignatian way in order to praise God. At last his soul was not only wounded with the 'instrument of sal- vation' but he himself also became the living example of 'God's grandeur'. Bibliography Bonvin, B., Easson, A. (2011).

Cli fford The ponti ficate of Pope Francis has brought new energy to the Catholic Church. Recently, this renewed energy has produced a fresh debate, especially in the first of two synodal gatherings dedicated to the re flection on the pastoral care of the family - a debate which some consider worrisome, but which he himself considers a sign of health in the ecclesial body and part of a necessary process of ecclesial discernment. When asked in a recent interview why some in the Church appear to be confused or disoriented by this discussion, to the point of claiming that the Church has become like a \"ship without a rudder\" , Pope Francis directed the attention of his interlocutor to the programme laid out in his Apostolic Exhortation of November 2013: \"Check it out, it's very clear. Evangelii gaudium is very clear\". 1 To understand the agenda of this ponti ficate then, let us take Pope Francis at his word and revisit this document which, he writes, has \"a programmatic signi ficance and important consequences\" for the life of the Catholic Church today ( EG 25). 2 Evangelii gaudium is a thick document. Not only is it lengthy (its 288 para- graphs and 217 footnotes fill over 200 pages in a paperback edition), in French parlance, one might call it dense and substantive; each pithy paragraph gives reason to pause and re flect. Evangelii gaudium is not an easy read, and covers a lot of ground. It would be impossible to draw out all of the rich insights of this comprehensive document in a single essay. In this space I propose to focus on a number of key insights relating to what Pope Francis calls the \"pastoral and missionary conversion\" of the Church, the project at the heart of his exhorta- tion. This re flection will be organized in three parts, each re flecting on a different aspect of this ecclesial conversion: first, a return to the kerygmatic 1 E.

All subsequent references will be abbreviated simply as EG, followed by paragraph proclamation of faith and witness; second, the spiritual conversion required to ground such a project; and third, the conversion of ecclesial structures required to renew the Church in our day in view of a more e ffective proclamation of the good news. But before proceeding, a few preliminary remarks are in order regarding the unique character of this document and the vision of 'mission' that informs it. 1 Some Distinctive Features of Evangelii gaudium A Centripetal Dynamic: The Local Churches for a New Catholicity This document, which takes as its theme the joy of the gospel, is a post-synodal apostolic exhortation. As such, it is intended to convey the concerns and the many recommendations surfaced by the bishops gathered for the interna- tional synod and to re flect on the ways and means to set the Church on course for a new evangelization in such a way as to call the faithful to action. The synod of bishops was established by Pope Paul VI during the Second Vatican Council as a collegial body to advise the pope on matters of concern to the universal church. 3 Few would dispute the fact that in the past fifty years these gatherings have remained more an instrument of the papacy than the e ffective expression of collegiality hoped for by many council fathers. 4 The bishops' freedom of speech and ability to engage in open debate has been greatly cur- tailed by synodal procedures. Agendas are set and procedures determined by the popes who appoint many of the synod participants and prepare the final document. In some cases these texts have had so little resemblance to the \"propositions\" emerging from the bishops' discussions, that a common witti- cism went around to the e ffect that the post-synodal documents were drafted before the bishops even arrived for the meeting. Under Pope Benedict's leader- ship synodal procedures began to permit a freer exchange of ideas. At the most 3 Paul VI, \"Motu Proprio Apostolos Sollicitudo\" (September 15, December 2014).

In all, it draws explicitly from the propositiones of the synod no less than thirty times. 6 Remarkably, as if to underline the contributions of the bishops from each region to the univer- sal church, Pope Francis cites messages and pastoral documents issued by nine different regional bodies of bishops from a wide diversity of contexts including those of Latin America ( CELAM ), Br azil, the Philippines, India, Italy, France, the Congo, the United States and Europe. 7 While many have noted the fre- quent reference to the Aparecida document of the Latin American Conference of Bishops, a text in which Jorge Bergoglio had an important hand, it is impor- tant not to lose sight of this wider focus. Francis refers a dozen times to post-synodal apostolic exhortations issued by his predecessors following regional synods of bishops and draws from other papal addresses and homilies 5 Pope Francis, \"Greeting of Pope Francis to the Synod Fathers During the First General Congregation of the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod Of Bishops (October 6, 2014)\": <http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2014/october/documents/ papa-francesco_20141006_padri-sinodali.html> (Accessed 20 December 2014). 6 Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI's Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortations contain abun- dant references to the propositiones of the bishops, though at times this has the feel of 'proof-texting'. 7 Fifth General Conference of the Latin American and Caribbean Bishops [ CELAM ], Aparecida Document (29 June 2007): this document - in which Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio had a direct hand - is cited 7 times.

We have con- ceived of reception as a unidirectional reality, forgetting that, from the earliest times, the insights of local and regional churches and councils were often received by, and served to enrich, the wider church. As yet another expression of this trend, consider the extent to which our notion of the exercise of the papal magisterium has become highly personal- ized. By this I mean that we have become accustomed to looking in papal documents for the personal theological perspectives of the popes in whose name the teaching is given. (This, even when we know that some of these doc- uments - including papal encyclicals - are drafted with the help of competent committees and teams of theological consultants.) Pope Francis has left his unmistakable mark on this document, as is clear from the direct and unvar- nished style of discourse. When he writes of discernment and the perils of contemporary spirituality, the rich knowledge and experience of his Jesuit for- mation are clearly on display. Nonetheless, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that Pope Francis has made every e ffort to integrate into these re flections the teaching of his brother bishops in such a manner that the catholicity of the whole church might be enriched by the experience and wisdom from the many diverse contexts of the local churches where Christians strive to witness to the gospel today. I am not aware of any precedent for this centripetal movement in the recent history of the papal magisterium. Such an approach re flects more than a simple change of style. It might reasonably be argued that this entire document serves as a concrete example of a substantive shift toward a more collegial expression of 8 It would be impossible to list them all here.

Evangelii gaudium is itself a con- crete sign of the \"pastoral conversion\" of the papacy that Pope Francis is committed to initiating, as we shall see below. Collegial Responsibility for Discernment and Conversion It is important to keep this perspective in mind when considering the compre- hensive project for the conversion and reform of the Church proposed in Evangelii gaudium. Pope Francis has indicated on numerous occasions that this is not a 'personal' project or vision of the Church and its mission, but an expression of a collegial recognition of the necessity for such a conversion expressed through the international synod of bishops 9 and by the College of Cardinals during the general congregations that preceded the conclave of elec- tion. 10 These conversations within the college of bishops have given shape to the mandate for his ponti ficate. As a close reading of Evangelii gaudium reveals, this reform project is far more extensive than a simple adjustment of struc- tures for the management of Vatican finances or of the bureaucracy of the Roman Curia. That said, Evangelii gaudium is not a detailed programme for the conversion of the Church in view of the new evangelization. Pope Francis himself describes it as a set of 'guidelines' ( EG 17, 33) intended to assist the local bishops as they enter into a process of 'pastoral discernment' to determine what is needed to return to the heart of the gospel today at every level of ecclesial life and wit- ness. With a substantial dose of realism, he recognizes that it would not be possible, from his vantage point in Rome, to determine the appropriate means for carrying out this 'new phase of evangelism' in every context: \"Nor do I believe that the papal magisterium should be expected to o ffer a de finitive or complete word on every question which a ffects the Church and the world. It is not advisable for the Pope to take the place of local Bishops in the discernment of every issue which arises in their territory. In this sense, I am conscious of the need to promote a sound 'decentralisation'\" ( EG 16). Seen in this light, Pope Francis's exhortation might be seen as a 'charge'; as a set of principles to guide the substantial task of discernment and reform to be undertaken by the 9 In writing this Exhortation, Pope Francis writes, \"I am reaping the rich fruits of the Synod's labours\" ( EG 16). 10 In his Pope Francis commented, \"in pre-conclave meet- ings, as cardinals we demanded lots of things which we should certainly not forsake\". Cf. \"Pope Francis: God Has Bestowed on Me\".152 Clifford bishops with the full collaboration of all the faithful. The predominant note is one of collegiality and co-responsibility. 2 Return to the Kerygma: Conversion to Christ Encounter with Christ and Renewal in the Spirit of the Beatitudes: Joy and Mercy \"The joy of the gospel fills the hearts and lives of all who encounter Jesus. Those who accept his o ffer of salvation are set free from sin, sorrow, inner emptiness and loneliness. With Christ joy is constantly born anew\" ( EG 1). These opening words sum up Pope Francis's invitation to return to the heart of the gospel through a renewed experience of personal encounter with Christ in daily prayer, in the renewed study of the scriptures, in the liturgical life of the Church, and in service to the poor. From this personal encounter alone flows our deepest identity as persons and the communion we share with one another in Christ's ecclesial body, the Church. This relationship of lov- ing communion over flows in loving concern for others, so that they too might come to know the merciful love of God. Encounter with the transformative love of Christ is the source of all conversion, revealing at the deepest level who we are as persons and as a community. It is the wellspring of genuine mission. Thanks solely to this encounter - or renewed encounter - with God's love, which blossoms into an enriching friendship, we are liberated from our narrowness and self-absorption. We become fully human when we become more than human, when we let God bring us beyond ourselves in order to attain the fullest truth of our being. Here we find the source and inspiration of all our e fforts at evangelization. For if we have received the love which restores meaning to our lives, how can we fail to share that love with others? ( EG 8). Joy is among the first signs of conversion to Christ: the joy at hearing the good news of God's steadfast love and mercy that has entered into history through his incarnation, life, death, and resurrection. The Risen Christ continues to meet us today in our personal and collective history. Joy is among the most unmistakable gifts of the Spirit, second only to love (Gal 5:22-23). The joy of the gospel is the joy of the beatitudes - not the shallow and passing pleasure of 153 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church worldly enjoyment 11 - but the deep inner happiness that comes from the quiet yet unshakable conviction that we are loved unconditionally, with all of our faults and limitations. It is the joy of those who are poor in spirit, humble, mourning, hungering and thirsting for justice, merciful, pure of heart, making peace, and ready to accept persecutions because of Christ and the gospel. It is the happiness of the just who, says the psalmist, walks in God's way (Ps 1). The joy of the gospel dwells in those who witness to Christ's victory over sin and death (Jn 20:20). 12 They walk in the con fidence that love has triumphed and will have the last word. The joy that is a fruit of God's Spirit is intimately linked to the beatitude of mercy, the \"greatest of all virtues\". 13 Those who have received God's free gift of forgiveness are moved to show mercy to others. As a consequence, \"The Church must be a place of mercy freely given, where everyone can feel welcomed, loved, forgiven and encouraged to live the good life of the Gospel\" ( EG 114). Mercy is not a reward for the deserving, but a free expression of God's compas- sion toward those who are lost and powerless to change by their own e ffort. God never tires of forgiving us; we are the ones who tire of seeking his mercy. Christ, who told us to forgive one another 'seventy times seven' (Mt 18:22) has given us his example: he has forgiven us seventy times seven. Time and time again he bears us on his shoulders. No one can strip us of the dignity bestowed upon us by this boundless and unfailing love. With a tenderness which never disappoints, but is always capable of restoring our joy, he makes it possible for us to lift up our heads and to start anew ( EG 3). 11 \"Sometimes we are tempted to find excuses and complain, acting as if we could only be happy if a thousand conditions were met. To some extent this is because our 'technologi- cal society has succeeded in multiplying occasions of pleasure, yet has found it very dif- ficult to engender joy'\". ( EG 7). 12 Edward Schillebeeckx notes that in the presence of the liberating love of the historical Jesus, being sad was an \"existential impossibility\". Jesus: An Experiment in Christology. Nelissen, 1974)]. 13 Here Pope Francis cites the very traditional teaching of St. Thomas Aquinas on the vir- tues: \"Thomas thus explains that, as far as external works are concerned, mercy is the greatest of all the virtues: 'In itself mercy is the greatest of the virtues, since all the others revolve around it and, more than this, it makes up for their de ficiencies. This is particular to the superior virtue, and as such it is proper to God to have mercy, through which his omnipotence is manifested to the greatest degree'\" ( EG 37). Cf. S. Th ., II-II, q. 30, a. 4. The external works of mercy are rooted in charity, the form of all virtues.154 Clifford The joy of the gospel is neither a personal possession nor secret treasure meant for a chosen few or privileged elite. As Pope Francis reminds us repeatedly, God's love excludes no one. It is Good News that cannot be contained. The mis- sionary engagement of the Christian is thus a free response to the unmerited gift of God's reconciling love revealed in Jesus Christ. The love of Christ raises us up to our full dignity as human persons and at the same time impels us to transcend ourselves and to reproduce in our own lives the pattern of God's self-giving love. \"When the Church summons Christians to take up the task of evangelization, she is simply pointing to the source of authentic personal fulfilment. For 'here we discover a profound law of reality: that life is attained and matures in the measure that it is o ffered up in order to give life to others. This is certainly what mission means'\" ( EG 10). 14 Christian joy carries us forth to share the love of Christ by our whole way of life, as leaven in the dough and salt for the earth. \"Before all else, the gospel invites us to respond to the God of love who saves us, to see God in others and to go forth from ourselves to seek the good of others. Under no circumstance can this invitation be obscured\" (EG 39). The Kerygmatic Character of the Church's Proclamation Encounter with the person of Christ and the experience of God's merciful love are to be at the centre of all evangelizing activity. By inviting all Christians to return to the heart of the gospel message, Pope Francis echoes the personalist understanding of divine disclosure embraced by the Second Vatican Council's Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation . The message revealed in Jesus Christ is not a set of propositional truth-claims, doctrines, or moral principles to be adhered to, but is essentially a disclosure of God's very self, poured out in love and inviting us into a life-giving and divinizing friendship: \"It pleased God, in his goodness and wisdom, to reveal himself and to make known the mystery of his will, which was that people can draw near to the Father, through Christ, the Word made flesh, in the Holy Spirit, and thus become sharers in the divine nature\" ( Dei Verbum , 2). All of the Church's evangelizing activity is to be directed toward this central message, and to accompany others as they seek to encounter the love and mercy of Christ. It is the message capable of responding to the desire for the in finite which abides in every human heart. The centrality of the kerygma calls for stressing those elements which are most needed today: it has to express God's saving love which precedes any moral and religious obligation on 14 This de finition of mission is drawn from the Aparecida Document. See EG, note 4.155 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church our part; it should not impose the truth but appeal to freedom; it should be marked by joy, encouragement, liveliness and a harmonious balance which will not reduce preaching to a few doctrines which are at times more philosophical than evangelical ( EG 165). In this vein, Evangelii gaudium invites those entrusted with the tasks of preach- ing and catechesis to take great care in the preparation of homilies and lessons, to study the scriptures and attend carefully to the 'central message' of the gos- pel ( EG 148-149). Those engaged in pastoral ministry are invited to a renewed study of the scriptures (145-150) and practice of lectio divina (153-153), and to renew their attentiveness to the lives of those they serve (154-155) so as to com- municate the central message of the gospel with greater e ffect. Indeed, Pope Francis insists that \"The study of the sacred scriptures must be a door opened to every believer\" ( EG 175), since the Word is the basis of all evangelization. One might consider this as one of the yet-unrealized aspects of Vatican II's project for ecclesial renewal, which sought to restore the central place of the scriptures in the life and teaching of the Church. While the liturgical renewal brought a more ample selection of biblical texts to the hearing of the faithful, many ordinary Catholics remain unfamiliar with the scriptures today and are poorly schooled in the practices of meditation or lectio with the Word. \"All Christian formation\" , writes Pope Francis, \"consists in entering more deeply into the kerygma\". This is especially true of catechesis where it \"con- stantly illumines\" every other subject to be treated. Christian initiation and catechesis is a \"progressive experience,\" a process of growth which cannot be reduced to the purely cognitive or moral dimensions of learning, but requires \"the integration of every aspect of the human person within a communal jour- ney of hearing and response\" ( EG 165). The catechist must therefore be attuned to the divine pedagogy, 15 which comes to meet each disciple as they are, adopting methods that adequately re flect the experience of encounter with Christ and progressive conversion. \"All this demands on the part of the evange- lizer certain attitudes which foster openness to the message: approachability, readiness for dialogue, patience, a warmth and welcome which is non-judg- mental\" ( EG 165). The Hierarchy of Truths and 'a Fitting Sense of Proportion' Pope Francis identi fies one of the most fundamental challenges to commu- nicating the attractive message of the gospel today as the need for \"a fitting 15 See, for example, C. Theobald, \"Vatican II: Une vision d'avenir - une p\u00e9dagogie de 44/1 (2013), 9-25.156 Clifford sense of proportion\" in preaching and in all pastoral activity ( EG 38). \"The big- gest problem is when the message we preach then seems identi fied with those secondary aspects which, important as they are, do not in and of themselves convey the heart of Christ's message\" ( EG 33). He is the first Bishop of Rome since the Second Vatican Council to call for an intentional application of the \"hierarchy of truths\" , as described by the Decree on Ecumenism ( UR 11), to the preaching, catechesis and pastoral practice of the Catholic Church ( EG 36, 246). 16 According to this principle, the truths of faith vary in their relationship to the foundation of the Christian faith, or to those truths pertaining to salva- tion in Christ and the Trinitarian communion of the divine Godhead. Only when a kerygmatic focus on the foundation of faith is maintained, he insists, can the meaning of the rich doctrinal teaching of the Church - including her moral and social teachings - be rightly understood. Pastoral ministry in a missionary style is not obsessed with the disjointed transmission of a multitude of doctrines to be insistently imposed. (...) The message is simpli fied, while losing none of its depth and truth, and thus becomes all the more forceful and convincing. All revealed truths derive from the same divine source and are to be believed with the same faith, yet some of them are more important for giving direct expression to the heart of the Gospel. In this basic core, what shines forth is the beauty of the saving love of God made manifest in Jesus Christ who died and rose from the dead ( EG 35-36). Without wanting to set aside any of the rich heritage of the Church's teaching and tradition, Pope Francis nonetheless calls upon those charged with preach- ing and faith formation, and indeed all the baptized who are called to be \"Spirit- filled evangelizers\" , to ensure that \"the integrity of the Gospel message 16 Second Vatican Council, (Accessed 20 December 2014). This principle has until now been invoked mainly in reference to the practice of ecumenical dialogue and to the understanding of hermeneutics required in ecumenical formation. See my examination of the reception of this teaching \"L'herm\u00e9neutique d'un principe th\u00e9ologique de Vatican II. (Paris: Cerf, 2010), 69-91. This study is indebted to the work of H. Witte, \"Vatikanum II Revisited: Journal in Philosophy and Theology 68(2007), 445-477.157 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church ... not be deformed\". \"Each truth\" , he observes, \"is better understood when related to the harmonious totality of the Christian message\" ( EG 39). Christ Summons the Church to Continual Reformation At the same time, Francis recognizes, as did Pope John XXIII in his opening speech to the bishops gathered at Vatican II, that in a context of rapid social and cultural change, the language and form of church teaching need to be adapted in order that the message, the perennial deposit of faith, might be more adequately expressed to contemporary people. He warns that even the well-meaning faithful can be led astray when they confuse form and substance, or when the form no longer succeeds in conveying the intended message. There are times when the faithful, in listening to completely orthodox language, take away something alien to the authentic Gospel of Jesus Christ, because that language is alien to their own way of speaking to and understanding one another. With the holy intent of communicating the truth about God and humanity, we sometimes give them a false god or a human ideal which is not really Christian. In this way, we hold fast to a formulation while failing to convey its substance. This is the greatest dan- ger ( EG 41). Thus, \"a fitting sense of proportion\" extends to the language of the Church's teaching, preaching, and catechesis. The expression of doctrine itself must be renewed in order to communicate the truth of faith with greater e ffect. 17 This discussion is somewhat reminiscent of the Decree on Ecumenism's recogni- tion of the need for \"continual reformation\" in the life of the Catholic Church: \"Thus if, in various times and circumstances, there have been de ficiencies in moral conduct or in church discipline, or even in the way that church teaching has been formulated to be carefully distinguished from the deposit of faith itself - these can and should be set right at the opportune moment\" ( Unitatis 17 \"the expression of truth can take di fferent forms. The renewal of these forms of expression becomes necessary for the sake of transmitting to the people of today the Gospel message in its unchanging meaning\". The entire discussion is an unfolding of the principle laid out in the Decree on Ecumenism, Unitatis redintegratio , article 6: \"Christ summons the Church to continual reformation as she sojourns here on earth. The Church is always in need of this, in so far as she is an institution of men here on earth. Thus if, in various times and circumstances, there have been de ficiencies in moral conduct or in church discipline, or even in the way that church teaching has been formulated to be carefully distinguished from the deposit of faith itself these can and should be set right at the opportune moment\".158 Clifford redintegratio 6; emphasis mine). Evangelii gaudium invites consideration of where the expression of church teaching stands in need of such a reformation or reformulation today. Similarly, we are invited to re-examine the many customs, rules, and disci- plinary precepts of the Church to ask whether they continue to communicate the gospel e ffectively. Some may simply have outlived their original purpose. As a criterion for discernment Pope Francis proposes a principle of modera- tion: \"Saint Thomas Aquinas pointed out that the precepts which Christ and the apostles gave to the people of God 'are very few'\". Citing Saint Augustine, he noted that the precepts subsequently enjoined by the Church should be insisted upon with moderation \"so as not to burden the lives of the faithful\" and make our religion a form of servitude, whereas \"God's mercy has willed that we should be free\" ( EG 43). The way of Christian discipleship is not a heavy burden (1 Jn 5:3). The most e ffective teaching, customs, and precepts of the Church are not those imposed by an external authority, but rather those that speak to the inner dynamism toward truth and goodness within human per- sons, who elect freely to set out on this path knowing that it will lead to a fuller and more authentic life. In these few lines we might discover a clue to the orientation that Pope Francis has given to the discernment of the Church's pastoral care of Christian families in the context of the synodal process presently underway. Without questioning the substance of the Church's conviction regarding the indissolu- bility of Christian marriage, he has opened a space for re flecting together on whether the present expression of the Church's teaching, canonical proce- dures, and pastoral practice adequately respond to the needs of those entering into the covenantal commitment of marriage and family life today, or to those many sincere Catholics whose marriages are irreparably broken. We may rightly ask whether the Church's teaching and pastoral practice convey an ade- quate appreciation of the complexity of marriage and human sexuality to the world of contemporary culture. Do they adequately succeed in bringing men and women into contact with the merciful love of God, of which Christian marriage and family life are to be a sign? 3 Discerning the Movement of God's Spirit for a Spiritual Conversion of the Church Shortly after his election, Pope Francis was asked what it meant for him as a Jesuit to be called to serve the Church as the Bishop of Rome and what aspect of Ignatian spirituality might help him to live this ministry. He replied 159 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church immediately, \"Discernment. (...) Discernment in the Lord guides me in my way of governing\". 18 It is against the horizon of the spiritual gifts that we have explored above, in particular those of love, joy, mercy, and in light of the cen- trality of personal encounter with Christ in the Holy Spirit, that Evangelii gaudium turns to re flect upon the need for spiritual conversion within the life of the Church. Again, the tone is set and the necessity for discernment is iden- tified from the very outset. Pope Francis observes: Whenever our interior life becomes caught up in its own interests and concerns, there is no longer room for others, no place for the poor. God's voice is no longer heard, the quiet joy of his love is no longer felt, and the desire to do good fades. This is a very real danger for believers too. Many fall prey to it, and end up resentful, angry and listless. That is no way to live a digni fied and ful filled life; it is not God's will for us, nor is it the life in the Spirit which has its source in the heart of the risen Christ ( EG 2). In a chapter dedicated to the \"crises of communal commitment\" Pope Francis describes a number of challenges in contemporary culture and, within this context, the temptations faced by pastoral workers in the Church. In a world where the role of civil government in service of the common good is severely challenged, where the values of the market dominate and a dehumanizing sys- tem serves the interest of a few and breeds outrageous poverty and social inequity, those called to service in the Church are tempted to place their own comfort and self-interest above that of others. In e ffect, their comportment spawns unjust structures within the Church that neglect genuine pastoral needs, in particular, the spiritual needs of the poor. Pope Francis deplores the fact that \"the worst discrimination which the poor su ffer is the lack of spiritual care\" and calls every Catholic to translate the Church's preferential option of the poor into concrete action ( EG 200). He recognizes that when faced by the challenges of secularization and undi fferentiated religious pluralism, pastoral workers - be they religious, lay, or ordained - often prefer to retreat into themselves. Tempted to despair, they fall prey to what Pope Francis aptly calls \"pastoral acedia\" ( EG 81-82). Despondent, their evangelical fervour is sti fled by \"defeatism which turns us into querulous and disillusioned pessimists\". Instead of radiating gospel joy their faces are those of \"sourpusses\" ( EG 85). They tragically lose touch with the lives of those 18 A. Spadaro, \"A Big Heart Open to God\" , America (30 September 2014): <http://www.ameri camagazine.org.print.156341> (Accessed 20 December 2014).160 Clifford whom they are called to serve, having become blind or indi fferent to the needs of others, especially the poor. Pope Francis reserves his fiercest critique for the condition that he has dubbed \"spiritual worldliness\" - a theme he returns to with some frequency - most recently in his Christmas Address to the members of the Roman Curia. 19 Spiritual worldliness is a subtle malady of the self-absorbed parading behind \"the appearance of piety and even love for the Church\" ( EG 93). A self-referen- tial church, Francis is fond of repeating, is sick; it has developed a false notion of mission and identity. He observes that among those who remain entrenched in a \"Catholic style from the past ... a supposed soundness of doctrine or disci- pline leads instead to a narcissistic and authoritarian elitism, whereby instead of evangelizing, one analyses and classi fies others, and instead of opening the door to grace, one exhausts his or her energies in inspecting and verifying\" ( EG 94). Their concern is neither for Jesus nor those whom they serve. This same malady manifests itself in \"an ostentatious preoccupation for the liturgy, for doctrine and for the Church's prestige\". It is equally re flected through a certain \"pride in [the] ability to manage practical a ffairs, or an obsession with pro- grams of self-help and self-realization\" ( EG 95). A careful reading of these few paragraphs should give us to understand that Francis is not simply targeting groups on the right or left: none are immune from the temptation of self-righ- teousness and complacency. The worst manifestations of spiritual worldliness are found in the air of superiority or elitism that lead one to dismiss the views of those who di ffer, or to abandon and neglect those in need of healing and mercy. Such persons have ceased to recognize the face of Christ in others. Those who have fallen into this worldliness look on from above and afar, they reject the prophecy of their brothers and sisters, they discredit those who raise questions, they constantly point out the mistakes of others and they are obsessed by appearances. Their hearts are open only to the lim- ited horizon of their own immanence and interests, and as a consequence they neither learn from their sins nor are they genuinely open to forgive- ness. This is a tremendous corruption disguised as a good ( EG 97). 19 Pope Francis, \"Presentation of Christmas Greetings to the Roman Curia\" (December 22, 2014): <http: //w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2014/december/docu- ments/papa-francesco_20141222_curia-romana.html> (Accessed 30 December 2014). Francis has spoken often of this challenge, beginning with a letter addressed to the Ple- nary Assembly of the Argentinian Conference of Bishops, 25 March, 2013. See: <http:// w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/es/letters/2013/documents/papa-francesco_20130325_ lettera-vescovi-argentina.html> (Accessed 18 December 2014).161 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church Spiritual Blindness, Unauthentic Traditions, and Conversion Pope Francis considers these variously self-absorbed comportments, in their social and structural consequences, \"adulterated forms of Christianity\" ( EG 94). They have become structural or habitual obstacles to the proclamation of the kerygmatic heart of the gospel and prevent the Church from leading others to the joy of encountering the merciful love of Christ. In his incisive com- mentary on the Second Vatican Council's Dogmatic Constitution of Divine Reve lation, Dei Verbum , Joseph Ratzinger once observed that while the council succeeded in placing the person of Christ at the heart of its proclamation, it missed an opportunity to acknowledge the possibility of real distortions enter- ing into tradition itself. 20 In a similar vein, Bernard Lonergan, when discussing the dialectical processes that contribute to the ongoing self-constitution of the Church, identi fies one of the important tasks for theology as the discern- ment of \"unauthentic traditions\" - self-perpetuating expressions of faith that have become detached from their origins in the love of Christ (Rom 5:5). 21 He contends that the e ffects of unauthentic traditions can only be overcome by engaging in the intentional operations required to bring about genuine con- version. A return to Christ and to the central message of the scriptures is key to discerning the inevitable dissonance between the call of the gospel and the reality of the Church's life and witness. Evangelii gaudium might be seen as a re flection that is engaged in, and pro- viding the impetus for, just such a discernment. It calls for the conversion of these inauthentic attitudes and traditions through a return to a focus on Jesus Christ and on the poor - to the heart of the Gospel: \"God save us from a worldly Church with super ficial spiritual and pastoral trappings! This sti fling worldli- ness can only be healed by breathing in the pure air of the Holy Spirit who frees us from self-centredness cloaked in an outward religiosity bereft of God\" ( EG 97). The reader may be taken aback by the intensity of Pope Francis's critique, particularly when he repeats the ominous words of John XXIII 's historic speech inaugurating the Second Vatican Council: 20 \"We shall have to acknowledge the truth of the criticism that there is, in fact, no explicit mention of the possibility of a distorting tradition and of the place of Scripture as an element within the Church that is also critical of tradition ...\" J. Ratzinger, \"Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation, chapter II\" , H. Vorgrimler (ed.), Commentary on the Documents of Vatican II. (New York: Herder and Herder, 1969), III, 192-193. 21 \"[T]radition may be unauthentic. It may consist in a watering-down of the original mes- sage, in recasting it into terms and convictions of those who have dodged the issue of radical conversion\". B. Lonergan, Method in Theology (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1990), 162; see also 80 and 299. [Original version, Herder and Herder, 1972].162 Clifford At times we have to listen, much to our regret, to the voices of people who, though burning with zeal, lack a sense of discretion and measure. In this modern age they can see nothing but prevarication and ruin ... We feel that we must disagree with those prophets of doom who are always forecasting disaster, as though the end of the world were at hand. In our times, divine Providence is leading us to a new order of human relations which, by human e ffort and even beyond all expectations, are directed to the ful filment of God's superior and inscrutable designs, in which every- thing, even human setbacks, leads to the greater good of the Church ( EG 84).22 One might recognize in Pope Francis's teaching an echo of John XXIII 's invita- tion to read the signs of the times. When the Pharisees came to Jesus asking for a dramatic indication of God's work in the world, he rebuked them for failing to recognize in his daily teaching and healing ministry the many signs that God was well and truly present and active in history (Matt 16: 1-4). In our own day, some have come to interpret the notion of the \"signs of the times\" in overly negative and apocalyptic terms. Contemporary prophets of doom see the sky falling all around and are blind to the healing presence of Christ in moments of quiet authenticity in the movements of human history and in human interac- tions, where simple acts of loving presence, forgiveness, and mercy are at work to heal and reverse the wounds of sin and alienation. The great tragedy, as Pope Francis seems to indicate, is that many who hold important responsibilities around the Bishop of Rome are deaf to the still small voice of God in history. The very seeds of the kingdom are found in the fragile lives of the poor and the ordinary as they seek the face of God. The drama of our predicament is that many of those to whom Pope Francis must now entrust the work of discernment and reform su ffer from spiritual blind- ness and may not yet have the capacity to recognize the unfailing signs of hope around them. Viewed in this light, spiritual conversion might be considered a greater priority than institutional reform. 23 Yet spiritual conversion cannot be dissociated from the reform of ecclesial structures. Although the former pre- cedes the latter, the movement of God's Spirit shapes and reshapes the concrete 22 Citing John XXIII , \"Addr ess for the Opening of the Second Vatican Council (11 October 1962)\" , AAS 54 (1962), 789. 23 In his interview with Elisabetta Piqu\u00e9, Pope Francis indicated that \"spiritual reform, the reform of the heart\" was a principal concern, with reference to his upcoming Christmas message to the members of the Roman Curia on December 22, 2014. \"God has Bestowed on Me a Healthy Dose\".163 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church lives of the faithful both as individual persons and as a community. Indeed, without clarity of spiritual vision any attempt to renew the structures of the Church will fall flat. Without liberation from the spiritual blindness that Pope Francis has described, one risks perpetuating unauthentic traditions, substi- tuting empty observance and doctrinaire solutions for slow and steady progress along the fragile path of authentic human existence - the only path to holiness open to us. The 'pastoral' character of the Second Vatican Council outlined by Pope John XXIII consisted in the e ffort to reformulate the expression of church doc- trine, to reform the liturgy and church structures so that they might faithfully proclaim the message of the gospel to men and women of the late twentieth century. The principal mode for the Church's proclamation was to be dialogue with contemporary culture and society. As Lonergan describes the conciliar vision, the Church's communication of the gospel must employ the language and culture of the receivers \"so that the Christian message becomes, not dis- ruptive of the culture, not an alien patch superimposed upon it, but a line of development within the culture\". 24 His re flection on the pastoral nature of the Council enables us to understand the priority of the kerygma in that dialogical engagement and the relative role of doctrine in communicating the good news. But if one first clari fies the meaning of 'doctrine' and then sets about explaining the meaning of 'pastoral' , one tends to reduce 'pastoral' to the application of 'doctrine' and to reduce the application of 'doctrine' to the devices and dodges, the simpli fications and elaborations of classical ora- tory. But what comes first is the word of God. The task of the Church is the kerygma, announcing the good news, preaching the gospel. That preaching is pastoral. It is the concrete reality. From it one may extract doctrines, and theologians may work the doctrines into conceptual sys- tems. But the doctrines and systems, however valuable and true, are but the skeleton of the original message. A word is the word of a person, but doctrine objecti fies and depersonalizes. The word of God comes to us through the God-man. The Church has to mediate to the world not just a doctrine but the living Christ. 25 24 Lonergan, Method , 362. 25 B. Lonergan, \"Pope John's Intention\" , F. Lonergan. (Mahwah, NJ: temps (Paris: Cerf, 1964), 655-672. On the pastoral character 164 Clifford Pope Francis's call for the pastoral and missionary conversion of the Church is very much in line with the pastoral intention that informed the Second Vatican Council. It must be seen as an invitation to carry forward the central orienta- tions of the council's vision and teaching in our time. 4 The Pastoral and Missionary Conversion of Ecclesial Structures Against the horizon of spiritual conversion and the priority of the kerygma in the communication of the Christian message, we now turn our attention to the pastoral and missionary conversion of church structures and practices required in view of the over-arching aim of Pope Francis's exhortation: a new evangeli- zation. The missionary nature of the Church is to be the guiding principle for this renewal, which, he insists, cannot be deferred: I dream of a 'missionary option' , that is, a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything, so that the Church's customs, ways of doing things, times and schedules, language and structures can be suitably channelled for the evangelization of today's world rather than for her self-preservation. The renewal of structures demanded by pastoral con- version can only be understood in this light: as part of an e ffort to make them more mission-oriented, to make ordinary pastoral activity on every level more inclusive and open, to inspire in pastoral workers a constant desire to go forth and in this way to elicit a positive response from all those whom Jesus summons to friendship with him ( EG 27). Profoundly conscious that the Church is a human community moving - with the help of God's Spirit - toward an eschatological horizon, Pope Francis pre- fers the image of the Church as the pilgrim people of God over that of a hierarchical institution. \"She is certainly a mystery rooted in the Trinity, yet she exists concretely in history as a people of pilgrims and evangelizers, transcend- ing any institutional expression, however necessary\" ( EG 111). The image of the Church as people of God inspires an eschatological humil- ity that enables us to consider institutional structures, customs, and practices in their proper perspective. 26 Structures, customs, pastoral and canonical of the council, see also C. Th\u00e9obald, \"Enjeux I am indebted to Richard R. Gaillardetz for this expression, which he often uses to charac- terize the pilgrim nature of the Church in history. E.g.: The Church in the Making (New York: Paulist, 2006), 56.165 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church norms exist to lead us to an encounter with the living Christ. A kerygmatic focus helps us to understand that increasing church demographics is not the immediate goal of evangelization. 27 The Christian community undertakes a mission of proclamation and service without concern for its own survival. The way of the gospel is a way of self-forgetfulness and self-giving love, not of self- interest. The Church is not a closed community of the elite, but is willing to risk all, to live in a culture of encounter with others, ready to learn and deepen its comprehension of the very message it wishes to proclaim. \"It never closes itself off, never retreats into its own security, never opts for rigidity and defensive- ness. It realizes that it has to grow in its own understanding of the Gospel and in discerning the paths of the Spirit, and so it always does what good it can, even if in the process, its shoes get soiled by the mud of the street\" ( EG 45). The Church is not a human project, but a response to the work of God in us. \"The life of the Church should always reveal clearly that God takes the initiative, that 'he has loved us first' (1 Jn 4:19) and that alone 'gives the growth' (1 Cor 3:7)\" ( EG 12). With this con fidence, Pope Francis invites us to re-examine the extent to which ecclesial structures at every level serve or inhibit missionary outreach, which is paradigmatic of all the Church's activity \" (EG 15; italics in the original). Conversion of the Local Church Evangelii gaudium envisions every parish community as a centre of \"constant missionary outreach\" where all activities are aimed at forming true 'evangeliz- ers' , men and women whose lives speak to others of the love of God. Parishes ought not to become a haven for the self-absorbed, but are to be in close con- tact with the genuine lives and concerns of their members, discerning where and how the gifts of the community might be placed at the service of others. Living in a world dominated by the economic metaphors of production and growth, we may be tempted to measure the 'success' of parish pastoral ministry by the number of people in the pews, by the number of baptisms, con firma- tions, and marriages, or by weekly revenues. According to the principles that Pope Francis has laid out, these are 'worldly' measures of success and not the true measure of divine grace. He invites us to ask instead, have the poor and the wounded found a home here? Are the members of this community being formed to be the \"spirit- filled evangelizers\" that the world needs? Is this com- munity fully engaged in serving the needs of the poor and broken in the wider 27 In this regard, Pope Francis has often repeated that \"it is not by proselytizing that the Church grows, but \"by attraction\". See Evangelii gaudium , 14, where he cites Pope Benedict XVI, \"Homily at Mass for the Opening of the Fifth General Conference of the Latin Amer- ican and Caribbean Bishops (13 May 2007), Aparecida, Brazil\" , AAS 99 (2007), 437.166 Clifford neighbourhood? Is this parish a place that radiates the joy and mercy of the gospel? Francis has sometimes used the image of the Church as a field hospital to speak about its outward engagement. 28 The Church is not the front line, the ultimate object of parish ministry. It is a centre of healing and support, equip- ping the faithful for the daily struggle of life and witness. Pope Francis frankly acknowledges that e fforts of renewal have not yet suc- ceeded in creating parishes that are \"environments of living communion and participation\" ( EG 28) where the gifts and insights of the lay faithful are nour- ished and welcomed as a valuable contribution to the Church's missional activity. One might also ask whether parish and diocesan structures provide sufficient formation in the habits of dialogue and discernment needed to live as mature adult Christians within the complex context of contemporary cul- ture. Within each diocese bishops are exhorted to develop the necessary processes and structures for ongoing communal discernment. Where diocesan and parish pastoral councils have been poorly implemented, the laity have lit- tle experience of co-responsibility for the mission of the Church, and their pastors cannot reliably discern the true pastoral needs and priorities of those entrusted to their care. Pope Francis calls upon all members of each local church \"to be bold and creative in this task of rethinking the goals, structures, style and methods of evangelization in their respective communities\". He warns that any \"proposal of goals without an adequate communal search for the means of achieving them will inevitably prove illusory\" ( EG 33). The pastoral discernment envi- sioned here is not to be undertaken in isolation, but in a mutually supportive community and in the set of synergetic relations that characterize genuine ecclesial communion. The bishop, whose task is \"to foster this missionary com- munion\" , must know when to lead and when to walk in the midst of his people. He has a particular responsibility to develop the structures of dialogue and participation in the Church, not merely for the sake of organizational e ffi- ciency or expediency, but with \"the missionary aspiration of reaching everyone\" (EG 31). In his own ministry of service and pastoral discernment, the bishop must be one who listens - not only to those who share his views and tell him what he wants to hear - excluding no one from his concern. If this call for conversion is to truly take e ffect, a wide ranging e ffort of spiri- tual and pastoral formation will be needed to uproot the deep seated attitudes of clericalism and passivity that are so much a part of the contemporary Catholic ethos. Pope Francis's diagnosis of 'pastoral acedia' is most apt in this regard. Acedia is an infectious malady. Its remedy, in the tradition of the 28 A. Spadaro, \"A Big Heart Open to God\" , America (September 30, 2013), 7.167 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church Church fathers, is a return to the word of God and compunction in the aware- ness of how far we have strayed from God's desire. True compunction is a sign that God's word has pierced and softened our hearts. With genuine humility our sorrow turns to compassion and the joy of knowing God's forgiveness and healing love. In some contexts, true pastoral conversion will require public and communal exercises of discernment and repentance. Some communities have been chastened by the scandal of sexual abuse which has revealed, at times painfully, the lack of authenticity not only on the part of individual o ffenders, but more pointedly in a culture of silence and false deference toward the clergy, in a practice of ministry that neglects the most vulnerable, and in a misguided exercise of church governance and canonical discipline. This is but one example of where customs, practices and an overall ecclesial culture have failed to serve the gospel. Only a humble and authentic communal examina- tion and repentance can lead a community to recognize where it stands in need of the grace of collective conversion. Conversion of Regional Structures: Toward Genuine Collegiality Evangelii gaudium admits the necessity of re-examining the status of the regional and national conferences of bishops as part of a broader project for the pastoral conversion of the papacy. Recalling the invitation issued by Pope John Paul II, in his 1995 encyclical letter on Commitment to Ecumenism, Ut unum sint , to seek together \"a way of exercising the primacy which, while in no way renouncing what is essential to its mission, is nonetheless open to a new situation\" , 29 Pope Francis concedes, \"we have made little progress in this regard\" ( EG 32). As part of advancing along the path of a truly pastoral renewal of the papal o ffice, he invites a reconsideration of the status of the episco- pal conferences. The role of the latter was greatly circumscribed by the 1998 Apostolic Letter of John Paul II, Apostolos suos , which was widely experienced as an e ffort to centralize the governance of the local churches, reversing a pro- cess of devolution begun by the Second Vatican Council with its a ffirmation of the collegial exercise of the episcopal o ffice.30 In theological circles, some questioned the contention of Apostolos suos that a genuine exercise of collegi- 29 John Paul II, Encyclical Letter on Commitment to Ecumenism, Ut unum sint 1995), no. 95: <http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_ jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint.html>. Cited in EG 32 (Accessed 18 December 2014). 30 John Paul II, \"Apostolic Letter issued 'Motu Proprio' on the Juridical and Theological Nature of Conferences [ Apostolos suos December 2014).168 Clifford ality could not be ascribed to the regional gatherings of bishops. It posited that an 'e ffective' collegiality properly belongs only to the entire college of bishops, with and under the Bishop of Rome. 31 In contrast, Pope Francis now notes that the attribution of a genuine doctri- nal authority belonging to the bishops when they exercise their pastoral teaching o ffice through the means of an episcopal conference \"has not yet been su fficiently elaborated\". Further, he a ffirms, \"Excessive centralization, rather than proving helpful, complicates the Church's life and her missionary outreach\" ( EG 32). An overly centralized system of governance can diminish the responsiveness of the bishops' conferences and of the bishops in their par- ticular churches, who, because of their proximity to the people in their care, are best equipped to discern what is needed. In hindsight, Pope John Paul II's attempt to 'rein in' episcopal conferences in the hope of attaining a more uni- fied witness may have been comprehensible in the turbulent period of the late twentieth century that witnessed an unprecedented expansion of the global Catholic Church. The Catholic Church of the twenty- first century is the most populous and diverse global Christian community the world has ever known. The election of a Latin American pope is itself a sign of the coming of age of a world church whose centre of gravity has now moved to the southern hemi- sphere. Francis has recognized instinctively, and no doubt from his concrete experience as an archbishop from the global south, that the centre will not hold if there is not adequate freedom for the local churches in all of their diver- sity to discern the forms and structures of life best suited for the enculturation of the Christian message in their context. The bishops' conferences in the various regions were among of the principal structures established by the Second Vatican Council to give shape to the col- legial exercise of the episcopal o ffice.32 Pope Francis a ffirms the need for further development in this area. When he speaks of how much the Catholic Church can stand to learn from and receive from the insights and practices of other Christian churches, he pointedly cites the example of collegiality and synodality modelled by the Eastern Orthodox Churches ( EG 246). North American Catholics have witnessed a continuous downsizing of the structures and budgets of the episcopal conferences in recent years. While this re flects a genuine decline in available resources, it has sometimes been justi fied in the name of the ecclesiology contained in Apostolos Suos . If today a serious devo- 31 John Paul II, Apostolos suos , especially nos. 10-14. 32 Second Vatican Council, \"Decree on the Pastoral O ffice of the Bishop, Christus Dominus \" , nos. 5 and 36.169 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church lution of discernment and decision-making is really in the cards, then bishops may need to reconsider the importance of strong national structures and the pooling of material and personnel resources to carry out new tasks and equip the Church for mission in a changing context. Perhaps the most neglected of the synodal structures envisioned by the renewal of the Second Vatican Council was the restoration of provincial coun- cils.33 To my knowledge, only two of these have been held in the past fifty years (in India and the Philippines). This omission is most regrettable, especially in areas where many individual dioceses are challenged by limited resources. Provincial councils might provide an important opportunity for a pooling of resources and for the particular churches of a given region to support one another in the process of discerning the pastoral mission of the Church in our time. The American ecclesiologist Francis A. Sullivan has recently suggested that a restoration of provincial councils might come to play an important role in the nomination of bishops, a function that many desire to see devolve to more regionally or locally based instances of authority and discernment. 34 The final structure envisioned by Vatican II as an expression of the co- responsibility of the episcopal college in the governance of the universal church is the ordinary Synod of Bishops. 35 In his leadership of the two syn- ods that have focussed on the call of the Christian family in the contemporary world, Pope Francis has shown a desire to see the synod function as a space for genuine dialogue and discernment. He made it clear from the outset of the 2014 synod that he considers \"speaking honestly ... with parrhesia \" - candidly and without holding back - and listening with humility, the two fundamental pre-conditions for the practice of synodality. 36 In planning for two successive synodal gatherings to re flect on the same pastoral concern, Pope Francis is also demonstrating that discernment is a process. It takes time. Genuine pastoral conversion cannot be satis fied with the perfunctory application of pre-cooked responses to the complex realities of peoples' lives. Through the experience of 33 Second Vatican Council, \" Christus Dominus \" , no. 36. 34 For a solid re flection on the history of provincial councils and their potential role in the present context, see F.A.

The international synod of bishops was in fact established by Pope Paul VI, prior to the promulgation of this conciliar text. Paul <http://w2.vatican.va/con 2014). 36 Pope Francis, \"Greeting to the Synod Fathers\".170 Clifford honest and transparent dialogue, the bishops can come to understand more deeply that the pastoral challenges of Christians in one cultural context may differ greatly from those experienced by the people of God in another. They are more likely to come to an appreciation of the need, in the diversity of today's church, for a more di fferentiated pastoral response and of the inadequacy of uniform solutions. Such understanding and respect will be vital to grounding the genuine bonds of communion among the local churches, and to envision- ing a pastoral response appropriate to the complexities of family life in today's cultural context. One hopes that the synod will continue to evolve from an instrument of occasional consultation to a more permanent body that can o ffer advice in an ongoing manner on how best to respond to a wide range of questions as they arise. A genuine synod would also be much more of a deliberative body than we have known since Vatican II. Pope Francis took pains to ensure that the vot- ing of the October 2013 synod on the family be published. 37 Will he consider himself bound by the voting patterns of the bishops as the synodal process moves forward? This would be consistent with his experience as a superior in the context of a religious order where the counsel emerging from consultative processes is understood to have a binding e ffect. It would also mark a move toward a synod with a more deliberative character. The Pastoral Conversion of the Papacy In his personal style and in the many reforming initiatives that he has under- taken Pope Francis has demonstrated an unambiguous desire to give shape to a substantially di fferent exercise of the pastoral teaching o ffice by the Bishop of Rome. He has sought to simplify the ceremonial, to live in greater simplicity and proximity to those with whom he serves. By being more accessible to the press corps, giving extended interviews to some, he has shown a preference for direct and personal conversation over the formality of prepared texts and theological discourse. His actions belie a consistent commitment to go out to the poor, from the refugees of Lampedusa to the homeless victims of typhoon Haiyan and the homeless on the gates of the Vatican City. Much of Francis's attention over the first two years of his ponti ficate has been consumed by the reform of structures of the Roman Curia, including those for the oversight and administration of Vatican finances and the various 37 See the o fficial press release, a Latin version: <http://press.vatican.va/content/salastam pa/it/bollettino/pubblico/2014/10/18/0770/03044.html> (Accessed 18 December 2014). The English translation of the final relatio at the Vatican web site does not list the votes.171 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church dicasteries that exist to assist the Pope and the bishops in the governance of the universal church. In Evangelii gaudium , he admits without hesitation that \"the papacy and the central structures of the universal Church also need to hear the call to pastoral conversion\" ( EG 32). While it is widely expected that a substantial revision of the Roman dicasteries will be announced in the near future, Pope Francis and his advisors have already given important indications of what can be expected: fewer prelates, more members of the laity and women in key o ffices; improved international representation, clearer limits on terms of office; the amalgamation and streamlining of o ffices with overlapping concern (e.g. the Ponti fical Councils for Justice and Peace and for the Pastoral Care of Migrants; Social Communications, Vatican Radio and L'Osservatore Romano ). New o ffices may be established to re flect the pastoral priorities of the present day. This reform is aimed not simply at streamlining the Vatican bureaucracy. It also seeks to address a deep-seated papal-centric culture that has become more self-serving than mission oriented. As one of the Pope's advisors inti- mated, \"There is a longing for a curia that encourages the new evangelization and acts as a body to serve the Pope and the dioceses, not as a control centre\". 38 The C9: An Ad Hoc Committee with No Future? To help him in this reforming task, Francis has established a new structure, an advisory council composed of nine cardinals chosen to represent the conti- nental groups of bishops and the Eastern Catholic Churches. The members of the so-called 'C9' have carried out, in turn, a wide consultation of the bishops in each region. They have been meeting at a rate of about once every three months. While Pope Francis has also carried out a wide-ranging consultation of the members of the curia concerning this reform, by taking his cues princi- pally from the bishops, he is attempting to arrive at a set of structures that will best serve the missional needs of the local churches, the communion over which he presides. The agenda is not being set by the apparatus, but by the concrete pastoral needs and priorities of the particular churches. It is worth asking Pope Francis and the members of the C9 whether they envision this group as an ad hoc initiative or whether they see it becoming a permanent structure. Will it outlive this extraordinary moment of discernment and structural reform? Might it come to serve as a permanent body that links the Bishop of Rome to the continental groups of bishops in a more sustained 38 A.

Since 1978, the Archbishops of Canterbury have met regularly with the presiding bishops or Primates to reflect on matters of common concern and to strengthen of the bonds of com- munion among the various provinces of the Anglican Communion. Might the C9 evolve into a kind of Catholic 'Primates' Meeting'? Pope Francis seems to be drawn instinctively toward unmediated contact with the bishops, one unencumbered by a curial o ffice functioning, however unwittingly, as a tertium quid between himself and the leaders of the local churches. A number of studies in recent decades have called for the strength- ening of continental bodies, even envisioning the development of new continental 'patriarchates' adapted after the model of the early church. They suggest that new continental structures might embody the kind of devolution required by the reform of the papacy, and serve the inevitable diversi fication needed for a fuller enculturation of the gospel. 39 Further, they insist, such a reform must also be accompanied by a clari fication and di fferentiation of the various functions of the Bishop of Rome as bishop in the local Church of Rome, Patriarch of the Western Church, 40 and Primate of the universal church. A per- manent group of cardinals or primates might provide a forum for dialogue and consultation between the Pope and the continental groups of bishops. Should a permanent structure such as the group of eight cardinals be deemed desir- able, it would be important to delineate clearly its terms of reference and the criteria for the appointment of its members. At this juncture, the C9 remains a hand-picked body of cardinals, an instrument of the papacy. Were the criteria of selection or even election from among the leadership of the bishops' con- ferences to be made more transparent, such a group might also come to be 39 See, for example, Groupe des Dombes, Le minist\u00e8re de communion dans l'\u00c9glise universelle (Paris: Le Centurion, 1986), Gottes: in Communion: What Must Happen for a Centrist Papacy to become a Primacy in Communion?\" , America (June 22-10, 2000), 17. 40 In 2006, Pope Benedict XVI dropped this title from among those listed in the Annuario Ponti ficio as he considered it \"obselete \". It is regrettable that he preferred to abandon this title, missing an opportunity to clarify the role and the various functions of the papal office - a matter of great ecumenical signi ficance, as indicated by Orthodox reactions. Cardinal Walter Kasper provided an explication for Pope Benedict's decision in, \"Press Release Regarding the Suppression of the Title 'Patriarch of West' in Decem- ber 2014).173 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church recognized as having a truly representative character in relation to the conti- nental groups of bishops and their churches. Reform of the College of Cardinals Somewhat surprisingly, Evangelii gaudium makes no reference to the challenge posed to the College of Cardinals, a body whose medieval origins point to its principal function as a college of electors. In the history of the Church, no group is more notoriously emblematic of spiritual worldliness than these ecclesiastical princes. If Pope Francis is serious about combatting spiritual worldliness, then perhaps he will do us the favour of abolishing once and for all the obsolete and inappropriate title 'princes' , which can still be found in some of the o fficial documentation pertaining to this o ffice. He often a ffirms that ecclesiastical o ffice is to be understood primarily as a call to service, insisting that the episcopate is no place for those who have the \"mindset of princes\". 41 Francis has not refrained from appointing a number of men to the cardinal- ate as a dignity or honour in recognition of their accomplishments. The example of last year's appointment of the 99 year old Bishop Loris Capovilla, former personal secretary to Pope John XXIII comes to mind. During the pon- tificate of Pope John Paul II, three major theologians were named to the College of Cardinals late in life (Henri de Lubac, Avery Dulles and Yves Congar). With respect, and in view of a genuine and theologically consistent pastoral reform, it must be asked whether there is not a more appropriate manner of recogniz- ing the important contributions of members of the Church that would not entail the bestowal of ecclesiastical o ffice? Even though these nominations were made with the very best of intentions, they betray a most unfortunate theological ambivalence. The practice of honorary appointments belies a con- fusion of priorities and re flects an incongruity that is both theological and pastoral. These may seem like harmless and insigni ficant examples. Yet they 41 In June 2013, in an address to a gathering of papal nuncios, Pope Francis warned against appointing as bishops men who have \"the mindset of princes\". In this document, he attri- butes his notion of spiritual worldliness to Henri de Lubac. M\u00e9ditation sur l'\u00c9glise (1952). \"Address of Pope Francis to Participants in the Papal Representatives Days (June 21, 2013)\": <http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2013/june/documents/papa-fran cesco_20130621_rappresentanti-ponti fici.html> (Accessed 20 December 2014). Another problematic practice, from an ecclesiological perspective, is the continuing practice of appointing \"titular\" bishops. While Pope Francis's intention to reduce the number of curial o fficials that hold the o ffice of bishop is most welcome, he has not yet shown a comprehension of the serious contradiction between his theology of ministry as service, and the existence of \"pastors\" without a flesh and blood community over which to pre- side. A truly pastoral conversion of the episcopal o ffice would require an end to such appointments.174 Clifford are highly symbolic of the confusing set of roles and expectations that have accrued to the o ffice of cardinal through the centuries, virtually unchecked. In his thoughtful response to Pope John Paul II's invitation to dialogue on the reform of the papacy, Archbishop John Quinn devotes an entire chapter to a reflection on the necessity for a reform of the College of Cardinals. He is espe- cially concerned that its role expanded greatly under Pope John Paul II, who increased the frequency of consistories and thereby enhanced its role in church governance. According to Quinn, the fundamental problem posed by the College of Cardinals is that it functions as a college within a college \"in a sense making the rest of the college of bishops a body of second rank\". 42 He observes further that the expansion of the consultative role of the consistory of cardinals threatens to undermine the role of the international synod of bish- ops and impede its full flourishing. As if to con firm the concerns expressed by Quinn, Pope Benedict took to referring frequently to the cardinals as the 'sen- ate of the Church' , a juridical term adopted from the structures of the Roman Empire and deliberately abandoned by the 1983 Code of Canon Law ( CIC 230).43 The unintended e ffect of these developments has been the emergence of \"a kind of bicameral structure\". 44 These are serious concerns and most worthy of consideration in the present context. Of the three structures under consideration here, the relationship of the college of cardinals to the local churches is the least obvious. This derives from the lack of clear consideration of representativity in the criteria for the selec- tion of cardinals, and secondly, from the inordinate number of 'titular' bishops who belong to the college of cardinals, many of them heads of the various offices of the Roman curia. While many members of the College undoubtedly carry out important responsibilities on various advisory commissions, they often appear as a coterie of hand-picked 'party men'. According to the Code of Canon Law, the pope chooses men for this o ffice who are \"outstanding in doc- trine, morals, piety, and prudence in action\" ( CIC 351, \u00a71). Traditionally, the Archbishops of primatial, metropolitan, and historically signi ficant churches have been appointed to the cardinalate, but even this principle finds no echo in the canons. 42 J.R. Quinn. The Reform of the Papacy: The Call to Costly Unity (New York: Crossroad, 1999), 143. 43 See, for example, Benedict XVI, \"Homily, Ordinary Public Consistory for the Creation of New Cardinals, 25 November 2007\": <http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/ homilies/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20071125_anello-cardinalizio_en.html> (Accessed 20 December 2014). 44 Quinn, Reform of the Papacy , 150.175 Pope Francis 's Call for the Conversion of the Church In his recent appointment of new cardinals, Pope Francis does not appear bound by convention. He has made a number of innovative appointments of Archbishops from some of the poorest and most under-represented constitu- encies of the Church. His instincts here may suggest the need for more comprehensive and transparent terms of reference for such appointments, so that a greater balance might be achieved. Ideally, a college of electors should faithfully represent the diversity of the local churches. A comprehensive reform of the collegial structures that serve the universal church would see the College of Cardinals return to its principal mission as a college of electors, responsible for electing the bishops of Rome. It would have less of a governing role, avoiding the impression of a 'bicameral' struc- ture, or of the College of Cardinals usurping a role that belongs properly to the international synod. During the Second Vatican Council, Maximos IV Saigh pleaded for the establishment of a permanent synod to assist the pope in the daily governance of the Church. 45 The inadvertent expansion of the role of the consistory might be seen as filling a void left by the absence of such a structure. In any case, it would appear to con firm the need for a more e ffective perma- nent structure to collaborate with the Bishop of Rome in the governance of the universal church. Consideration might be given to a co-ordination between a small body of continental primates and a larger, international synod of bishops made up of representatives of the conferences of bishops. As these structures continue to evolve in response to the changing needs of the global Catholic Communion, it will be important to de fine the mission of each and to avoid the danger of the competitive dynamic against which Archbishop John Quinn has justly cautioned. 5 Conclusion Beginning from a consideration of the principle orientations of the Apostolic Exhortation, Evangelii gaudium , I have attempted to explore in broad strokes the implications of Pope Francis's call for a pastoral and missionary conversion of the Church in our day. The purpose of such a reform is to enable the Church to return to the kerygma, to the proclamation of salvation in Jesus Christ. Like all Christian conversion, it must begin through spiritual renewal and encoun- ter with Christ, and lead to the transformation of persons, communities, attitudes, customs, policies and institutions. The centrality of the kerygma, supported by a return to the study of the Word of God, and the recognition of 45 Maximos IV Saigh, \"The Supreme Senate of the Catholic Church\".176 Clifford the gifts of God's Spirit - joy, humility, mercy, peace-making - are to be the guiding principles in a concerted e ffort to discern how existing ecclesial struc- tures, customs, and practices might better proclaim the living God to men and women of our day, in particular to the poor. I have suggested that the exercise of collective discernment that must ensue, if we heed Pope Francis's call, might be seen as an e ffort to discern and uproot not only the personal attitudes that prevent us from knowing and proclaiming the joy of the gospel, but also the distortions that have crept in to our practice - the unauthentic traditions which make a sham of the Church's witness and obstruct its ability to re flect the joy of Christ. Pope Francis has invited a consid- eration of every level of ecclesial life from the parish, to the diocese, to conferences of bishops, and the papacy itself. In the hope of contributing to the indispensable dialogue that belongs to the process of collective discern- ment initiated through his exhortation, I have attempted to re flect on some of the questions to be faced at each of these levels. The vision that Pope Francis sets before us is a comprehensive one. It entails nothing less than a rediscovery and deepening of the missionary nature and identity of the Church. How pow- erful would be the presence and service of the Church in the world, if every Christian could say, \"My mission of being in the heart of the people is not just a part of my life or a badge I can take o ff; it is not an 'extra' or just another moment in life. Instead, it is something I cannot uproot from my being without destroying my very self. I am a mission on this earth; that is the reason why I am here in this world. We ... regard ourselves as sealed, even branded, by this mission of bringing light, blessing, enlivening, raising up, healing and freeing\" (EG 273). Bibliography Alver, M.

From the outset, he had identi fied the problem of the moment as an ecclesiological one: a Church that was self-centred, self-absorbed, and lacking in evangelical zeal. The kind of Church that he envisaged was one that would leave behind its worldliness, would opt for an energetic approach to evangelization, and one that would reform its structures to meet this challenge. His vision obviously struck a chord with the college of electors because they, like the rest of the world by then, were conscious of how dysfunctional the Vatican bureaucracy had become; a dysfunctionality that was made obvious by the resignation of Pope Benedict, who no longer had the strength to manage a situation that was getting out of control. 2 Apart from problems internal to the Vatican, the Church faced other major issues such as the fallout from the sexual abuse scandals, a growing secularism in Europe, the advance of the Pentecostal churches in Latin America, and a general fatigue in ecclesial leadership. Thus the stage was set for a pope who could recall the Church to a renewed vision of its mission and who could e ffect the internal renewal that would lead to its realization. 1 A. Ivereigh, The Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope (London: Allen & Unwin, 2014), 357. 2 See W. Kasper, Pope Francis' Revolution of Tenderness and Love (New Y ork/Mahwah: Paulist Press, 2015), Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis In what follows, I will attempt to outline and analyse the ecclesiological vision that Pope Francis has been shaping, especially in his o fficial statements and more important interviews, as well as in his structural reforms and pasto- ral activity. The main focus of the essay will be on his preference for the People of God image of the Church and the pneumatology which underpins his eccle- siological vision. The practical implications of these preferences will also be considered. In his introduction to Evangelii gaudium , Pope Francis states very clearly that he wants \"to discuss at length ... the Church understood as the entire People of God which evangelises\". 3 So, from the outset, he shows a preference for this descriptor of the Church and, interestingly, that other image of the Church as 'the Body of Christ' does not occur in the entire letter. This does not imply, however, that the Pope is using the People of God as a sociological or political term, as will be seen later, particularly in light of the appeal which he makes to the presence and action of the Holy Spirit in the Church. It is signi fi- cant that the Pope has chosen to express a preference for this image of the Church as it connects him more immediately with the enthusiasm for ecclesial renewal that took hold immediately after Vatican II.4 He does this even though, at the time of Vatican II, this phrase was occasionally used in a one-sided fash- ion, and placed in opposition to the Body of Christ image, which had been promoted by the encyclical Mystici corporis . However, in light of the pneuma- tology with which Pope Francis imbues this concept, he cannot be accused of neglecting the divine element which underpins and energizes the Church and which is central to the Body of Christ image. The People of God is still an image which can serve to elaborate and clarify the mission of the Church in a way that is probably more flexible and pastorally accessible than other images employed in formal theological discourse. Thus, the deliberate choice of this image for the Church is an invitation to probe its theological and pastoral importance for today and, in particular, to see its signi ficance in the context of the agenda which the Pope is setting for the entire Church. 3 Evangelii gaudium (henceforth EG, <http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhor- tations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html>), 17. 4 For an overview of this image of the Church and its signi ficance in the theology of Vatican II see, W. Kasper, The Catholic Church: Nature, Reality and Mission (London: Bloomsbury, 2015), 117-126; D.J.

The Pope draws attention to this when he says: We hold the Jewish people in special regard because their covenant with God has never been revoked, for \"the gifts and the call of God are irrevo- cable\" (Rom 11:29). The Church, which shares with Jews an important part of the sacred Scriptures, looks upon the people of the covenant and their faith as one of the sacred roots of her own Christian identity (cf. Rom 11:16-18). As Christians, we cannot consider Judaism as a foreign religion; nor do we include the Jews among those called to turn from idols and to serve the true God (cf. 1 Thes 1:9). With them, we believe in the one God who acts in history, and with them we accept his revealed word. 5 Pope Francis's statement, here, is consistent with his own practice while Archbishop of Buenos Aires, where he actively promoted dialogue with the Jews. The largest Jewish diaspora community in Latin America is in Argentina, with a population in the region of 200,000, most of whom live in Buenos Aires. He held regular commemorative services in the Cathedral to remember the victims of the Shoa; he made sure that the Shoa was taught in the schools and seminaries of the diocese; he built strong relationships with a number of rab- bis in the city, especially with Rabbi Abraham Skorka, with whom he conducted a year-long dialogue on the diocesan TV channel, extending over thirty hours. Bergoglio and Skorka also jointly published a series of conversations on con- temporary ethical issues, including the environment and the Shoa. 6 In his assessment of their collaborative e fforts, Austen Ivereigh comments: They wanted to develop a deeper understanding of what Jewishness means to Christianity and vice versa; if Jews were the Christians 'elder brothers' in the faith - the modern Catholic formula - what could or should that brotherhood look like. Bergoglio's focus on Jesus's identi fica- tion with the poor and the marginalised recalls the prophets of Israel and 5 EG 247 Published 2013).181 Pope Francis the Torah, says Skorka, and allowed the two Argentinians to meet con- stantly on shared ground. 7 While his preferential option for the poor is without question, and is obviously shaped by the concern for justice so often articulated by the Prophets, 8 it is obvious, too, that his profound regard for the importance of Christian-Jewish dialogue is grounded in his desire to show that the Church is in continuity with the faith of Israel. He made this clear during his visit with the two Chief Rabbis of Israel in Jerusalem on May 26, 2014 when he said in his address to them: Mutual understanding of our spiritual heritage, appreciation for what we have in common and respect in matters on which we disagree: all these can help to guide us to a closer relationship, an intention which we put in God's hands. Together, we can make a great contribution to the cause of peace; together, we can bear witness, in this rapidly changing world, to the perennial importance of the divine plan of creation; together, we can firmly oppose every form of anti-Semitism and all other forms of discrimination. 9 It is evident that Pope Francis is anxious to see the continuity in faith and wit- ness between Jews and Christians, with a view to creating a world more in harmony with God's plan for his people. 3 A More Lay-centred and Enculturated Church The People of God image takes undue emphasis o ff the hierarchical elements of the Church and accentuates the responsibility for the mission that belongs 7 The Great Reformer , 325-326. 8 John Allen has shown that it was during the economic crisis in Argentina in the 1990s that Bergoglio's friendship with Skorka developed as the religious institutions in the country were called upon to work more closely in order to assist people in need. It is this pragmatic focus, he suggests, that \"is at the heart of interfaith cooperation\" for the Pope and is re flected in his initiative launched in 2014 with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Grand Imam of Egypt's prestigious Al-Azhar University and Mosque to combat human tra fficking ( Francis Miracle: Inside the Transformation of the Pope and the Church (New York: Time Books, 2015), 74-76). 9 Address of Pope Francis, \"Courtesy Visit to the Two Chief Rabbis of Israel, at Heichal Shlomo Center next to the Jerusalem Great Synagogue (Jerusalem) Monday, 26 May 2014\" , <https:// w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2014/may/documents/papa-francesco_ 20140526_terra-santa-visita-rabbini-israele.pdf> (Accessed November 14, 2015).182 Duffy to all its members by virtue of their baptism. The pope is opposed to any form of clericalism which distorts the nature of the Church as a people united in their service of God's tender mercy. He says: \"Lay people are, put simply, the vast majority of the People of God. The minority - ordained minsters - are at their service\". 10 He sees their role in penetrating with Christian values the social, political, and economic sectors of life, and encourages their formation for that mission. Furthermore, room must be made for them in their local churches to carry out their mission appropriately. The mission is too broad- ranging and too important to be con fined to any one group. In this context, too, he insists that the place of women in the Church must be more clearly acknowl- edged and expanded so that they become active contributors \"where important decisions are made, both in the Church and in social structures\". 11 This line of thinking leads him, then, to signal the importance of enculturat- ing the Gospel among various peoples. Through enculturation, the Church \"introduces peoples, together with their cultures, into her own community\" , for \"every culture o ffers positive values and forms which can enrich the way the Gospel is preached, understood and lived\". 12 The concreteness of his preferred image enables the pope to give due prom- inence to the task of enculturation, in line with the conciliar decree Gaudium et spes . He notes that Christianity does not have one cultural expression 13 and he warns that \"we in the Church can sometimes fall into a needless hallow- ing of our own culture, and thus show more fanaticism than true evangelising zeal\". 14 That statement is signi ficant because of what it says to the Church itself about its own culture. John Paul II spoke regularly on enculturation and of the Church's responsibility for enculturating the faith, 15 but Pope Francis goes fur- ther in suggesting that the Church itself needs to be careful lest its own cultural accretions stand in the way of the Gospel reaching other peoples and their cultures. As Richard Gaillardetz has pointed out, in the past the rhetoric often stood at odds with Vatican policy which seemed to treat the business of encul- turating faith and theology with suspicion. 16 This can be seen in the di fficulties regarding the reception of the new translations of the Roman Missal, espe- 10 EG 102. 11 EG 103. 12 EG 116. 13 EG 116. 14 EG 117. 15 See especially Redemptoris missio , 54. 16 R. Gaillardetz, Ecclesiology for a Global Church: A People Called and Sent (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 2008), 60.183 The Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis cially the English translation, where Vatican dicasteries insisted on linguistic formulations that were not at all in harmony with the accepted standards of speech in English speaking countries. 17 In such situations it is hard to see a consistency between the rhetoric and the practice. Indeed, the emphasis of Evangelii gaudium is on decentralization and on local churches and regions assuming greater responsibility for their own pastoral practices and an encul- turation of the faith that does not rely on detailed directives from a centralized Roman authority. He states clearly that: [I]t is not advisable for the Pope to take the place of local Bishops in the discernment of every issue which arises in their territory. In this sense, I am conscious of the need to promote a sound 'decentralization'. 18 Pope Francis seems to be keenly aware of his responsibility for the unity of the faith but does not want to impose uniformity in its expression or celebration. Too often o ffices of the Roman Curia attempt to impose an unnecessary uni- formity on local Churches, a Roman expression of the faith that inhibits a proper enculturation of the Gospel. Pope Francis has now raised expectations that this weakness will be addressed. 19 4 Collegiality and Synodality In his emphasis on decentralization, one sees a new approach to the relation- ship between the local Church and the universal Church. He acknowledges that the papacy itself stands in need of reform and has to be supported in achieving this by the local Churches around the world. He also acknowledges that \"the structures of the universal Church also need to hear the call to pasto- ral conversion\". 20 He reiterates the invitation of John Paul II, issued in the 1995 encyclical Ut unum sint , for suggestions about how this might be best achieved. Since his appointment, he has begun to implement a reform of these struc- 17 For a discussion of the role played by Rome in the process of English translations of texts of the Missale Romanum see Thomas Whelan, \"Liturgy Reform Since Vatican II: The Role Played by the Bishops of the English-speaking World\" , Questions Liturgiques 95 (2014), 81-109; see also M. Taylor, It's the Eucharist Thank God (Brandon: Decani Books, 2009). 18 EG 16. 19 For a good discussion of a range of issues relating to the Curia see the articles in L.C. Susin, S. Scatena, The appointment of eight cardinals from dioceses around the world as his immediate advisors was a first step in decentralizing ecclesial administra- tion and rea ffirming the collegial nature of ecclesial governance. He was thus ensuring that he had immediate and personal contact with and advice from a wide variety of local Churches and was no longer dependent solely on what was filtered through the Roman dicasteries. In Evangelii gaudium he rea ffirmed the importance of episcopal confer- ences and acknowledged that the \"juridical status of episcopal conferences which would see them as subjects of speci fic attributions, including genuine doctrinal authority, has not yet been su fficiently elaborated\" , which implies that Apostolos suos is not the last word on this issue. 21 In the Exhortation, there is a practical demonstration of the regard he has for the teaching of the episcopal conferences as he cites numerous national and regional bishops' conferences, demonstrating, too, that the role of the pope includes a listening role, where he hears the concerns of local churches, learns from them, and in turn shares their concerns and insights with the universal Church. He follows the same pattern in Laudato si , quoting sixteen di fferent conferences and, interestingly, half of those references are to various Latin American confer- ences . The inclusion of pastoral agendas from other parts of the Church also demonstrates the Church's magisterium is more than the papal magisterium; that it includes the active magisterium of the entire college of bishops and that the ongoing interaction between the two is essential for a living Church. 22 In his interview with Antonio Spadaro, he made clear that local episcopal conferences should be dealing with many of the issues that are being referred to Rome for adjudication. In fact, he states that the Roman dicasteries are at the service of these conferences. He says thus: It is striking to see the number of reports of a lack of orthodoxy which are sent to Rome. I think each case should be investigated by the local bish- ops' conferences, which can rely on valuable assistance from Rome. These cases, in fact, are much better dealt with locally. The Roman dicast- eries are mediators; they are not middlemen or managers. 23 21 Ibid. 22 EG 52. 23 E.T.

Pope Francis with Antonio Spadaro (London; New York; New Delhi; Sydney: Bloomsbury, 2014), 60-61.185 The Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis If he can ensure that this counsel is followed many of the tensions that have arisen because of the censuring of the theologians by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith could be avoided and dealt with in a less fractious man- ner.24 Francis's stance on the role of episcopal conferences does not emerge from a re flection on Church structures in themselves but comes from the prior- ity he gives to the missionary nature of the Church. He notes that \"[ex]cessive centralization, rather than proving helpful, complicates the Church's life and her missionary outreach\". 25 Excessive centralization turns the Church inwards and creates that self-referential attitude that he identi fied as problematic dur- ing his pre-conclave address. The Church's magisterium and pastoral outreach, then, has to be outwardly focused and attentive to the needs of its people in the variety of cultures and circumstances in which it is rooted if it is to be suc- cessful in carrying out its mission. It is in this complex and varied social context that the episcopal conferences play such an important role in furthering the Church's mission. The priority of evangelization conditions how the Church shapes its structures and implies a readiness to adapt these to the needs of the mission. Indeed, the mission has priority over the Church, in so far as the ini- tiative lies with God, as the pope stresses on several occasions in Evangelii gaudium .26 The Church is at the service of mission: to reveal in word and in action God's merciful plan for all God's people. The Church as the pilgrim People of God is synodal by nature. Ecclesial syn- odality, as distinct from collegiality, emphasizes the mutual recognition of local churches, where there is mutual recognition and a ffirmation of each oth- er's catholicity. It is also an implicit recognition that each local Church is an instantiation of the universal Church. Synodality has become an important theme in the practice and discourse of Pope Francis. In his interview with Spadaro he acknowledged that it might be time to change the method of the synods of bishops \"because it seems to me that the current method is not dynamic\". 27 He has already e ffected a change in how the Synod works, firstly by having a much more extensive consultative process involving all members of the Church being asked to share their views on the issues under discussion and secondly, by having the synodal process extend over two meetings of the bishops. 24 See R. Gaillardetz (ed.), When the Magisterium Intervenes: Press, 2012). 25 EG 32 26 Cf. EG 12, 24, 111, 112, 124. 27 My Door is Always Open , 61.186 Duffy The pope was also anxious that bishops spoke their minds openly and freely in the synodal discussions. During the first meeting of the Synod in 2014, he underlined that it is necessary to say \"all that, in the Lord, one feels the need to say: without polite deference, without hesitation. And, at the same time, one must listen with humility and welcome, with an open heart, what your broth- ers say. Synodality is exercised with these two approaches\". 28 In the course of his address, he also said, \"You will give voice in synodality . It is a great respon- sibility: to bring the realities and problems of the Churches, in order to help them to walk on that path that is the Gospel of the family\". This was a liberating message for the bishops and for the wider Church because, as he admitted him- self, previously many of the bishops participating in the Synod felt restrained in their contributions; lest some of their opinions might cause o ffence to the pope. Now conversations are to be more open and frank, acknowledging the genuine pastoral di fficulties that are encountered in proclaiming the Gospel in a di fferentiated and complex world. At the end of the Synod in 2014, he thanked the bishops for their openness and he assured them that he was not worried about the range of opinions and positions being aired. 29 On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the institution of the Synod of Bishops, the pope addressed the Synodal assembly and again outlined his vision for a synodal Church. He said that \"synodality is a constitutive element of the Church and o ffers the most appropriate framework for understanding the hierarchical ministry itself\". He then outlines three levels at which this synodality is operative, which is quoted here in full: The first level of the exercise of synodality is had in the particular Churches. After mentioning the noble institution of the Diocesan Synod, in which priests and laity are called to cooperate with the bishop for the good of the whole ecclesial community, the Code of Canon Law devotes ample space to what are usually called \"organs of communion\" in the local Church: the presbyteral council, the college of consultors, chapters of canons and the pastoral council. Only to the extent that these 28 Pope Francis, \"Greeting of Pope Francis to the Synod Fathers During the First General Congregation of the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops\". Monday, 6 October 2014, at <https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2014/ october/documents/papa-francesco_20141006_padri-sinodali.html> (Accessed Novem- ber 13, 2015). 29 Pope Francis, \"Address at the End of the Synod [2014]\" , at <http://en.radiovaticana. va/news/2014/10/18/pope_francis_speech_at_the_conclusion_of_the_synod/110894> (Accessed August 3, 2015).187 The Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis organizations keep connected to the 'base' and start from people and their daily problems, can a synodal Church begin to take shape: these means, even when they prove wearisome, must be valued as an opportu- nity for listening and sharing. The second level is that of Ecclesiastical Provinces and Ecclesiastical Regions, Particular Councils and, in a special way, Conferences of Bishops. We need to re flect on how better to bring about, through these bodies, intermediary instances of collegiality , perhaps by integrating and updat- ing certain aspects of the ancient ecclesiastical organization. The hope expressed by the Council that such bodies would help increase the spirit of episcopal collegiality has not yet been fully realized. We are still on the way, part-way there. In a synodal Church, as I have said, \"it is not advis- able for the Pope to take the place of local bishops in the discernment of every issue which arises in their territory. In this sense, I am conscious of the need to promote a sound 'decentralization'\". The last level is that of the universal Church. Here the Synod of Bishops, representing the Catholic episcopate, becomes an expression of episcopal collegiality within an entirely synodal Church. Two 'episcopal collegiality' the collegialitas a circum stances 'e ffective' , joining the bishops among themselves and with the Pope in solicitude for the People God. 5 The Bene fits of Synodality His approach to the Synodal process has generated a fresh con fidence in this institution and has modelled for other ecclesial bodies a way for decision-mak- ing on di fficult pastoral issues. A Synodal approach that takes into account the experiences and concerns of all the faithful is more likely to be credible to a wider public and ultimately to facilitate the reception of the final outcome of the Synod itself. One has only to remember how the documents of the United States Bishops' Conference were well received when the bishops there fol- lowed a similar consultative process, without compromising in the end on essentials of doctrine or principle. 30 30 See E. Du ffy, \"Episcopal Conferences in the Context of Communion: Some Notes on the American Experience\" , The Jurist 64 (2004), 137-167.188 Duffy The approach to ecclesial synodality being adopted by Pope Francis is beginning to facilitate an aspect of episcopal ministry that has been dormant for quite some time, namely, the responsibility to represent the distinctiveness of the local Church to the other Churches, including the Church of Rome. Bishops have been very faithful in representing the Church of Rome to their own Churches. They have been far less e ffective in the other direction. In bring- ing the gifts and di fficulties they encounter locally to the attention of other Churches, not least the Church of Rome, they enrich the vitality of the whole Church and will, in the process, o ffer and receive greater consolation and sup- port in promoting the vision and values of the Gospel universally. Synodality, as John R. Quinn has pointed out, brings a level of accountability to episcopal ministry. Quinn has shown how this was an e ffective instrument in ensuring that bishops could be held accountable when they convened local synodal meetings in the early centuries of the Church's existence. 31 The synodality of the Church is also a basis on which the Pope sees the pros- pect of building stronger ecumenical relations with the Eastern Orthodox Churches. 32 When he met with a delegation of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew I, in Rome on June 27, 2015, he said: \"The careful examination of how in the Church the principle of synodality and the service of the one who presides are articulated will make a signi ficant contribution to the progress of relations between our Churches\". 33 He indicated, in the Spadaro interviews, that he sees in the dialogues with the Orthodox an opportunity to learn more about the nature and operation of the synodal principle. It o ffers 31 Ever Ancient, Ever New: Structure of Communion in the Church (Mahwah NJ: Paulist Press, 2013), 8-12. Quinn in his text had already shown how these synodal structures being out- lined recently by Pope Francis enrich the e ffectiveness of the Church's own governance. 32 Norman Tanner has noted that the first seven ecumenical councils had a distinctively Eastern in fluence. They were summoned by the eastern emperor of the day, the partici- pants were mostly Asian and \"a pronounced eastern face appears in the creeds and other statements of the seven councils in question\" ( Is the Church too Asian? Re flections on the Ecumenical Councils [Rome: Chavara Institute Inter-religious Studies & Bangalore: Dharmaram Publications, 2002], 18-19. Tanner has also suggested that regular and e ffective regional councils, especially in the first millennium \"helped to keep the early Church up to date, indeed ahead of its time. We can see this in terms both of church order and government and of doctrine. In all sorts of ways the early Church was ahead of its time in the social and political orders\". ( Was the Church too Democratic: Councils, Col- legiality and the Church of the Future [Bangalore: Dharmaram Publications, 2003], 19). 33 \"Address of His Holiness Pope Francis to the Delegation of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, June 27, 2015\" , at <http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/06/27/pope_ (Accessed 3 August, 2015). Cf. EG 246.189 The Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis the possibility of balancing the approach to ecclesial governance that can be overly reliant on primatial authority, or indeed the personal authority of any local bishop. Similarly, in Laudato si , he expresses his hope for full ecclesial communion with Bartholomew I and cites him extensively in their shared con- cern for the environment. 34 6 Participative Bodies in Local Ecclesial Governance Just as the pope sees the need for a reform of structures at the universal level to ensure a dynamic missionary outreach, he sees the same need at the local level. He calls on bishops to ensure that all of the participative bodies in their dioceses are also working to ensure that this happens: In his mission of fostering a dynamic, open and missionary communion, [the bishop] will have to encourage and develop the means of participa- tion proposed in the Code of Canon Law, and other forms of pastoral dialogue, out of a desire to listen to everyone and not simply to those who would tell him what he would like to hear. 35 The diocesan bodies referenced by him are the diocesan synod, the finance council, the presbyteral council, the college of consultors, the pastoral council, as well as parish pastoral councils and finance councils. 36 This shows his con- cern for dialogue at the local level. The bishop who listens to the needs of his people will be better able to place the local Church on a genuinely missionary footing. Structures are at the service of mission, they recognize the variety of roles and responsibilities proper to all the baptized and those in ordained min- istries. Nevertheless, the work of evangelization is what unites and sustains all of them. 34 Cf. Laudato Si , Par. 7-9. 35 EG, 31. For a discussion of the role and value of the diocesan synod see J.G. Curmi, \"Presbyteral Collegiality: precedents and horizons\" , The Jurist 69 (2009), 116-154. 36 The roles of these bodies in the light of EV are discussed at some length by J.A Renken, \"Pope Francis and Common Ground with ARCIC The direction in which the pope is pointing the Church with regard to the exer- cise of authority and leadership is consistent with the lines of convergence which have been reached between the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church on the question of authority in the Church. These points of agreement were summarized in the 1998 agreed statement of ARCIC , Authority in the Church III: Acknowledgement that the Spirit of the Risen Lord maintains the people of God in obedience to the Father's will. By this action of the Holy Spirit, the authority of the Lord is active in the Church (cf. The Final Report, Authority in the Church I, 3); A recognition that because of their baptism and their participation in the sensus fidelium the laity play an integral part in decision making in the Church (cf. Authority in the Church: Elucidation , 4); The complementarity of primacy and conciliarity as elements of epis- cope within the Church (cf. Authority in the Church I, 22); The need for a universal primacy exercised by the Bishop of Rome as a sign and safeguard of unity within a re-united Church (cf. Authority in the Church II, 9); The need for the universal primate to exercise his ministry in collegial association with the other bishops (cf. Authority in the Church II, 19); an understanding of universal primacy and conciliarity which complements and does not supplant the exercise of episcope in local churches (cf. Authority in the Church I, 21-23; Authority in the Church II, 19). 37 While both Churches noted these positive developments, they also agreed that there is still need for further study of collegiality, conciliarity, and the role of laity in decision-making, as well as the universal primacy. Nevertheless, the direction and tone being set by Pope Francis can only be another positive con- tribution to a better understanding of how these elements of ecclesial life can be better understood and practised. 37 The Gift of Authority (Authority in the Church III), 2015, at <http://www.vatican.va/roman_ curia/ponti fical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_12051999_gift-of- autority_en.html> (Accessed 10 August 2015).191 The Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis 8 A Con fident Pneumatology Another major mark of this pope's ecclesiology is the prominence that he gives to the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is mentioned forty-nine times in Evangelii gaud- ium . This contrasts sharply with the Christological emphasis of Benedict XVI, who only mentioned the Spirit three times in the three encyclicals that he issued. Neglect of pneumatology has been a recurrent criticism of Western ecclesiology by Orthodox theologians and also by the Free Churches. 38 If the Church's point of reference is purely Christological, it can be open to the charge that it is a rigid, legal structure that is focused on its institutional elements and impervious to change or criticism. It may be tempted to a self-understanding that follows a deductive line of argumentation to the neglect of inductive approaches, which open it to the in fluence of contemporary culture and experiences. Despite the frequency of the references to the Spirit, one could not claim that he has systematically worked out a pneumatology to accompany his eccle- sial agenda. Nevertheless, it is so well integrated into his thought that it appears to come naturally for him to acknowledge constantly the presence and action of the Spirit in the world and in the Church. Reference has already been made to the fact that he does not appeal to the Body of Christ as an image for the Church but this is more than o ffset by the constant referencing of the Spirit. Although he doesn't quote him, he uses a phrase of St Augustine in describing the Holy Spirit as \"the soul of the Church\". 39 Walter Kasper has remarked: \"Calling the Holy Spirit the soul of the Church is to say that it is he who builds up the Church, maintains it, quickens it and animates it, lets it grow, orders and leads it\". 40 This accurately summarizes the understanding of Pope Francis. 38 Yves Congar notes the criticisms of Orthodox theologians during the discussion of the schema De ecclesia at the second period of Vatican II (\"The Church the People of God\" , Concilium 1/1 [1965], 13). Elsewhere Congar describes a kind of 'Christological For a helpful overview of the pneumatology of Vatican II see Christopher O'Donnell, Ecclesia: A Theological Encyclope- dia of Church extensively with the signi ficance of pneumatology in a wide variety of ecumenical contexts in his Comparative Ecclesiology , Vol 2: Christian in History ( New York and London: Continuum, 2005); for a good discussion on the ecclesiology see V.-M. K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen, An Introduction to and Perspectives (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2002). 39 EG 261. 40 The Catholic Church: Nature, Reality and Mission , 136.192 Duffy His profound awareness of the Holy Spirit is the basis for his positive out- look on both the world and the Church. He rejects any 'sterile pessimism' with regard to the world. \"With the eyes of faith\" , Pope Francis states, \"we can see the light which the Holy Spirit always radiates in the midst of darkness, never forgetting that 'where sin increased, grace has abounded all the more' (Rom 5:20)\". 41 He goes on to align himself with the sentiments of St Pope John XXIII , who similarly dismissed the prophets of doom in his opening speech at Vatican II. He believes that the Holy Spirit is at work in everyone, seeking \"to penetrate every human situation and all social bonds\". 42 The Spirit is also active in non- Christian religions when their adherents are faithful to their own consciences and brings to the surface among them various gifts that allow them \"to live in greater harmony and peace\". Furthermore, \"Christians ... can also bene fit from these treasures built up over many centuries, which can help us better to live our own beliefs\". 43 The work of evangelization in the Church is to cooperate with this liberating Spirit, bringing to completion the work of creation, wherein all were made in the image of the Triune God and ultimately to share in the life of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The whole of creation is longing for this ful filment since there is nothing beyond God's reach or in fluence. The Spirit is working in all situa- tions and in all peoples, drawing them towards that destiny. So, the task of evangelizers is to articulate more clearly the deep desires in the hearts of all men and women, to show where their hearts will find rest and to establish bonds of communion and charity among them that will o ffer concrete signs of God's merciful love and plan for the whole world. To engage in this work itself raises the sensitivity of the evangelizers to the workings of the Holy Spirit, and takes them beyond their own limited spiritual constructs. 44 This is a pro- foundly liberating vision of the Spirit, which provides a deep underpinning for the positive perspective from which the pope views the Church and its mission. 41 EG 84. 42 EG 178. 43 EG 254. 44 EG 272.193 The Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis 9 The Spirit Creates Unity, not Uniformity Pope Francis indicates that \"The Holy Spirit builds up the communion and harmony of the people of God\". 45 Such con fidence in this work of the Spirit allays any fears that there might be about diversity in the Church. The Spirit facilitates unity but does not impose uniformity. This allows for a rich cultural diversity in which the Gospel becomes incarnate in human history. Indeed, he warns, that the Church could easily make the mistake of attempting to impose one cultural expression of Christianity on others, which could amount to fanaticism rather than a true evangelizing zeal. Within the Church itself, there is a rich diversity of gifts and charisms, which are the fruit of the Spirit. He recognizes that at times these can be an uncom- fortable reality, but even that discomfort can be a sign of the Spirit at work. The test of the authenticity of the charisms, however, is their willingness and \"abil- ity to be integrated harmoniously into God's holy and faithful people for the good of all\". 46 It is hard to avoid the assumption here that he had in mind the various polarizations that have arisen in the Church since the Council. On the one hand, he is showing tolerance for this diversity, and, on the other, gently appealing for greater ecclesial communion on both sides. For example, he rec- ognizes the great contribution of new movements to the life of the Church, who are themselves a fruit of the Spirit. He says: Frequently they bring a new evangelizing fervour and a new capacity for dialogue with the world whereby the Church is renewed. But it will prove bene ficial for them not to lose contact with the rich reality of the local parish and to participate readily in the overall pastoral activity of the particular Church. This kind of integration will prevent them from concentrating only on part of the Gospel or the Church, or becoming nomads without roots. 47 Consistent with a comprehensive articulation of the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of the Church is the demand for all its members to engage in serious discernment. He encourages \"each particular Church to undertake a resolute process of discernment, puri fication and reform\". 48 The necessity for wise, evangelical and pastoral discernment is a recurring theme in his Apostolic 45 EG 117. 46 EG 130. 47 EG 29. 48 EG 30.194 Duffy Exhortation. It is a reminder of the freedom that the Church has to make the necessary changes or to adapt its strategies in light of new pastoral issues that arise as it makes its pilgrim journey through the world. His insistence on the importance of discernment is also an inevitable legacy of his Jesuit formation and pastoral practice. Indeed it is a hallmark of the Jesuit way of decision-making. 49 10 Importance of Popular Piety Another example of ecclesial diversity to which he refers is that of popular piety, revealing more obviously his own experience of the Church in Latin America and quoting directly from the Aparecida Document of 2007. Popular piety is, firstly, one of the riches which the Holy Spirit pours out on the Church. Secondly, it is an instance of the inculturation of the Gospel, where: [E]ach portion of the people of God, by translating the gift of God into its own life and in accordance with its own genius, bears witness to the faith it has received and enriches it with new and eloquent expressions. ... This is an ongoing and developing process, of which the Holy Spirit is the prin- cipal agent. 50 Thirdly, it is the lived faith-experience of many poor families, who may not be familiar with the formulations of the creed, but who have a profound con fi- dence in God's mercy and love. One senses in his articulation of this point, the intimate familiarity of a pastor who has witnessed first-hand this expression of faith in the homes of the poor in Buenos Aires: I think of the steadfast faith of those mothers tending their sick children who, though perhaps barely familiar with the articles of the creed, cling to a rosary; or of all the hope poured into a candle lighted in a humble home with a prayer for help from Mary, or in the gaze of tender love directed to Christ cruci fied. No one who loves God's holy people will view 49 See J.J. Toner, Discerning God's Will: Ignatius of Loyola's Teaching on Christian Decision Making (St Louis, MO: Institute of Jesuit Sources, 1991); also his A Commentary on St Igna- tius's Rules for the Discernment of Spirits (St Louis, MO: Institute of Jesuit Sources, 1982); E. Discernment: 50 EG 122.195 The Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis these actions as the expression of a purely human search for the divine. They are the manifestation of a theological life nourished by the working of the Holy Spirit who has been poured into our hearts (cf. Rom 5:5). 51 He sees in this popular piety a rich locus theologicus , demanding the attention of the Church and its theologians because here among the poor the Gospel is already being enculturated and it is important to consider this phenomenon in the context of the Church's work of evangelization. Apart from the task of evangelizing cultures, each member of the Church bears a responsibility for its mission. The Spirit gives the courage, the parrhe- sia, necessary to proclaim the Gospel in every time and place, even in the face of opposition. 52 The missionary engagement to which he invites all members of the Church is at once humble but also capable of robust engagement with the wider world. He is quite clear that a privatized spirituality is not accept- able, but that prayer must have an outward missionary focus and be accompanied by the o ffering of one's life in mission. 53 Love of God is re flected in love of one another and, unless we are in touch with the misery that so many people experience, it is hard for us to have any real sense of God's love at work in us. 11 The Aparecida Document: A Universal Application At the meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean bishops, CELAM , held at Aparecida in May 2007, the bishops elected Jorge Bergoglio to chair the com- mittee charged with drafting the final document. Two other key participants in the production of the Aparecida document were Cardinal Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz, co-president of CELAM , and Cardinal Oscar Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga. Both are on the eight-member committee of Cardinals advising the pope in the exercise of the Petrine ministry. Thus, with three of the most signi ficant mem- bers of the conference involved in the current reform of the Church, it is inevitable that Aparecida will in fluence its direction. The Aparecida document is a call to discipleship and mission. Christ is at the centre and the disciple is the one who has a personal encounter and rela- 51 EG 125. 52 EV 259. 53 EV 262.196 Duffy tionship with him. 54 This engagement leads to a missionary impulse which impels the disciple into a missionary mode, anxious to share the joy, love and hope that is to be found in this living relationship with Christ. 55 The encounter with Christ is the \"source of life for the Church and the soul of its evangelizing action\". 56 Pope Francis reiterates this principle again in Evangelii gaudium : \"The primary reason for evangelising is the love of Jesus which we have received, the experience of salvation which urges us to ever greater love of him\". 57 This provides a rationale for the Church and its members not being 'self-referential' or simply Church-centred. The focus is first on Christ and then outwards in a missionary attitude, extending his proclamation and embodi- ment of the Kingdom of God to the whole world, bringing the compassion and mercy of Christ to all whatever their condition. Another key theme of the Aparecida document is its endorsement of the preferential option for the poor: \"The preferential option for the poor is one of the distinguishing features of our Latin American and Caribbean church\". 58 The bishops go on to say: \"'the su ffering faces of the poor are the su ffering face of Christ'. They question the core of the Church's action, its ministry, and our Christian attitudes\". 59 This concern for the poor has already been demon- strated by the pope in so many of his public activities and articulated powerfully in Evangelii gaudium , where he says: I want a Church which is poor for the poor .... We need to let ourselves be evangelised by them .... We are called to find Christ in them, to lend our voices to their causes, but also to be their friends, to listen to them, to speak for them and to embrace the mysterious wisdom which God wishes to share with us through them. 60 The same priorities outlined by the Latin American bishops are now those of the Bishop of Rome. The Aparecida document shows the renewed determina- tion of the Church to be missionary, to reach into every area of life and to every corner of the earth: 54 V General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean: Disciples and mis- sionaries of Jesus Christ, so that our Peoples may have life in Him. Concluding Document, Aparecida, 13-31 May, 2007 . 55 Ibid., 244. 56 Ibid., 247. 57 EG 264. 58 Concluding Document, Aparecida, 13-31 May, 2007 , 391. 59 Ibid., 393 60 EG 198.197 The Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis From the cenacle of Aparecida we commit to begin a new stage in our pastoral journey, declaring ourselves in permanent mission (emphasis in the original). With the fire of the Spirit we will en flame our Continent with love ... To be a missionary is to announce the Kingdom with creativ- ity and boldness in every place where the Gospel has not been su fficiently announced or welcomed, especially in the di fficult or forgotten environ- ments, and beyond our borders. 61 It was obvious in Bergoglio's address to the pre-conclave meetings that this desire to reach out to the peripheries was of primary concern for him. The same sense of urgency is expressed early in Evangelii gaudium : \"it is vitally important for the Church today to go forth and preach the Gospel to all: to all places, on all occasions, without hesitation, reluctance or fear\". 62 When Bergoglio was asked what was so special about the emergence of the agenda sketched out in the Aparecida Document he listed three things: first, it emerged from the ground up; next, it had the support of the people accompa- nying the process in prayer; and finally it was open-ended, remaining open to change and development. 63 One can see that he is consistent with this approach in Evangelii gaudium concerning his respect for the fact that the whole Church, in all its members, is Spirit- filled and gifted. \"The presence of the Spirit gives Christians a certain connaturality with divine realities, and a wisdom which enables them to grasp those realities intuitively, even when they lack the wherewithal to give them precise expression\". 64 There is here a profound respect for God's action in all of the baptized faithful and an imperative for those in leadership to listen to their voices. 12 Anomalies While the overall assessment of his ponti ficate to date has to be positive, there are some actions which Pope Francis has taken that show anomalies in his 61 \"Message of the fifth general conference to the peoples of Latin America and the Carib- bean\" , V General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean: Disciples and missionaries of Jesus Christ, so that our Peoples may have life in Him. Concluding Docu- ment, Aparecida, 13-31 May, 2007 . 62 EG 23. 63 \"What I would have said at the Consistory: An interview with Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergo- glio, Archbishop of Buenos Aires,\" at <http://www.30giorni.it/articoli_id_16457_l3.htm>, Accessed 26 August 2014. 64 EG 119.198 Duffy overall teaching and practice. The first is that he seemed to usurp the tradition of the Italian bishops' conference by intervening directly in appointing its Secretary General. Normally the pope would appoint the person nominated by the conference. In this instance he acted motu proprio when he appointed Bishop Nunzio Galantino. However, some are inclined to see it as an overriding concern to ensure that a pastoral agenda is maintained by the conference. From comments made by Galantino, it would seem that his pastoral outlook is very similar to that of the pope. 65 A more serious anomaly, however, is his publication, again motu proprio, of Mitis judex ,66 on annulment procedures. Among the criticisms levelled at the document are that: The pope did not consult those commissions in the Vatican which would and should be responsible in counselling him in such an impor- tant matter as the annulment process; the normal procedures of the legislation in the Universal Church have been thus levered out; the Bishops' Conferences, the relevant Congregations and Councils and even the Apostolic Signatura (the highest court of the Church also dealing with the annulments) were not consulted; against the often proclaimed and invited principles of synodality and of 'openness' , the pope nonetheless decided, seemingly rashly, to go ahead with the motu proprio , even though at the last Synod of Bishops in 2014, there was not yet a 'unanimous consent' to carry forth this streamlining move; many theologically contested problems have been simply ignored by Pope Francis; several passages in the Motu Proprio contain very vague formulations which are purportedly to help someone decide whether the quick procedure itself ought to be started - such as someone's putatively \"lacking Faith\" or other reasons that are not unequivocally speci fied; \"it is a novelty in the legislation that a legal text ends with the expression 'etc.' and it thus thereby keeps open other options\"; Pope Francis did not himself follow the regular procedures of legislation. 67 65 See the comments of Hannah Roberts, \"Bishop calls for Church to listen to calls for Com- munion for divorcees\" at <http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/771/0/senior-bishop-calls- for-church-to-listen-to-calls-for-communion-for-divorcees-and-married-clergy> (Accessed November 15, 2015). 66 Pope Francis, Mitis judex Dominus Jesus (2015), at <http://w2.vatican.va/content/fran cesco/en/motu_proprio/documents/papa-francesco-motu-proprio_20150815_mitis- iudex-dominus-iesus.html> (Accessed November 15, 2015). 67 Curia dossier critiques quietly-circulate-dossier-raising-concern-over-popes-annul> (Accessed November 14, 2015).199 The Ecclesiological Vision of Pope Francis These are serious criticisms levelled against the pope's Apostolic Letter. It seems inevitable that some of the concerns that have been voiced will eventu- ally have to be ameliorated. On the other hand, the pope issued this letter just ahead of the Synod of Bishops meeting in October 2015, amidst much debate among various groupings of cardinals on how best to proceed with addressing problematic issues regarding marriage and the family. 68 He was once again sig- nalling a desire to see a pastoral solution and the application of mercy in difficult situations of marital breakdown. This seems to be the justifying prin- ciple even if there are canonical problems in need of further re finement in the letter. 13 Conclusion Pope Francis has retrieved the positive vision for ecclesial renewal outlined by Vatican II, especially with his emphasis on the Church as the People of God and an accompanying pneumatology. His personal style of ministry, his dis- pensing with many of the trappings of the papal o ffice, his prioritizing the poor and marginalized, his openness with regard to the Church's own failings, his admission of the need for reform of the Curia and his e fforts to e ffect that reform have all contributed to the positive reception that his presentation of Church teaching and ministry have received to date. His appointment has signalled the emergence of the global Church, one that is no longer Euro-centric but more conscious of the agendas that press on the Church and its people on the other continents. He has brought speci fically a Latin American perspective to bear on the ecclesial agenda but this, like the previous European perspective, is only one in the life of a global Church. In Asia and Africa, the Church is growing rapidly and these regions too have their own speci fic concerns, all of which need to be adequately represented by the Church's magisterium. Pope Francis has begun to lay the foundation for this to happen and he will have to continue the e ffort to ensure that it is solidly built upon over the coming years. He will have to put in place adequate structures to affect the reforms he proposes. One way in which this could happen is by the creation of patriarchates in various regions of the world, as Archbishop John 68 See W. Aymans, Eleven Cardinals Speak on Marriage and the Family (San Francisco: Igna- tius Press, 2015); Cardinal Robert Sarah, et al., New Homeland - Africa: Contribu- tions to the Synod on the Family by African Pastors (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2015).200 Duffy Quinn has already suggested, 69 that would ensure a proper enculturation of the Gospel about which he has spoken so often. He has given signi ficant encouragement to bishops and bishops' confer- ences to address issues locally and not expect Rome to solve all their speci fic problems. This is a very positive development because for far too long the role of the bishops has been paralyzed by excessive Roman directives and interven- tions. There is now a need to follow up his support for local episcopal governance by appointing bishops who are not only pastoral and spiritual but are people of imagination and courage, willing to take risks in advancing the mission of the Church in their areas of immediate responsibility. He will also have to ensure that he follows his own principles of listening and consultation in the formulation of teaching and legislation. A paradox of the appeal of Pope Francis is that, on the one hand, he is attempting to take much of the focus o ff the exercise of the papal primacy, while on the other hand, this very e ffort is drawing more attention to his every word in the popular media. Herein lies a danger, namely, that the papacy will be further in flated in the popular imagination, once again devaluing the importance of the local Church. His e fforts at reform will have to be accompa- nied by solid, informed and con fident episcopal leadership in the local Churches throughout the world. Pope Francis has set a challenging agenda for all in the Church, consistent with the vision of Vatican II. One must hope that the good work he has begun will e ffect a renewal of the Church, something of the new Spring to which John XXIII had looked forward on the eve of the Council.

A lot of exciting issues are on the theological agenda now, so let us get started right away! And this is exactly what he did. In a sense, Schillebeeckx has been proven more than right. The situation, not just in the Church, but in the world in general, has changed to an extent nobody could have imagined in the mid-1960s. Yet, he has also been proven blatantly wrong. The documents of the Council are by no means outdated. The theological and ecclesial revolution they imply has not taken place and much still needs to be done, although it is also necessary to move beyond the position of the documents themselves. At least that is what I will argue in this essay. What the Council documents require is what I consider to be a genuine conversion: not just of the hearts of individual Christians and as a consequence of their communities, but of faith and theology itself. Of course, we also need new spiritual and ecclesial practices, as has been argued by the 1 The title is a quote from the document Theology Today: Perspectives, Principles and Criteria (29 November 2011) by the International Theological Commission, no. 59, <http://www.vati- can.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_cti_doc_20111129_teologia-oggi_ en.html#CHAPTER_ 3> (Accessed 13 Witte, to whom this volume is dedicated, has followed him in this respect. 3 But as I will try to show in this essay - and in that sense, I will follow in the footsteps of Schillebeeckx as my theological mentor - spirituality should not replace theology proper. 4 On the contrary, spirituality should have a firm basis in theology. In that sense true conversion is always theological, because it is based on a new insight on who God is for us and where God can be found. 1 The Conversion to 'A Very Closely Knit Union' with the World Pope Francis has decided to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the clos- ing of the Council on 8 December 2015 by starting an Extraordinary Jubilee Year of Mercy. This is an apt choice in many ways. As the Pope indicates: With the Council, the Church entered a new phase of her history. The Council Fathers strongly perceived, as a true breath of the Holy Spirit, a need to talk about God to men and women of their time in a more acces- sible way. The walls which for too long had made the Church a kind of fortress were torn down and the time had come to proclaim the Gospel in a new way. [...] The Church sensed a responsibility to be a living sign of the Father's love in the world. 5 Pope Francis then recalls the message of Pope John XXIII at the opening of the Council, stating that in order to become such a sign, the Church \"wishes to use the medicine of mercy rather than taking up arms of severity\". 6 By stressing the importance of 'mercy' , just as by stressing the pastoral character of the Council, 3 Cf. H. Witte, AMDG : Een ignatiaans 2011). 4 Schillebeeckx has always argued, from his theological inauguration in 1943 until the end of his career, that theology should try to understand intellectually what is given to be known in living faith.

On the last day before its close, the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council adopted its most ground-breaking document: the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, Gaudium et spes . It was not so much ground- breaking in that it was the first example of a new type of text - there had never been a constitutio pastoralis before, and during the Council it was routinely called 'Schema 13' because what was envisioned did not have a name yet - nor was it ground-breaking because this document would go on to inspire important new movements in Church and theology in the decades after the Council. Ultimately Gaudium et spes was revolutionary because it presented a new vision of the position of the Church and theology in the contemporary world. Not that it was entirely new, of course - in that sense the insistence on a 'hermeneutics of reform' , rather than a 'hermeneutics of rupture' by Pope Benedict XVI in his interpretation of the Council, is stating the obvious: in the Catholic Church change is always grounded in an underlying continuity 7 - but this change was rather fundamental in comparison to the understanding of the position of the Church since the middle of the nineteenth century, codi- fied in the documents of the First Vatican Council (1869-1870). At the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church ultimately rediscovered the conversion that the Gospel had always implied, even to the Church that is called to repre- sent the summons: \"repent, the reign of God is at hand\". As I have said, there was no precedent for a 'pastoral' constitution on the Church in the modern world. Therefore, it was considered necessary to add an explanatory note for the term 'pastoral' in the title of Gaudium et spes. The first footnote of the document states that the constitution is 'pastoral' , because \"while dependent on principles of doctrine, its aim is to express the relation- ship between the church and the world and people of today\". 8 To this end, it is said, the first part of the document involved the development of a doctrine \"about humanity, the world in which human beings live, and its own relation- ship to both\". The second part deals with \"several aspects of modern living and 7 Cf. Address of his Holiness Benedict XVI to the Roman Curia O ffering Them His Christmas Greetings (22 December 2005). Original text in Acta Apostolicae Sedis 98 (2006), 40-53. For a nuanced debate on this statement and its signi ficance, attempting to go beyond the alterna- tive, see J.W. O'Malley (ed.), Vatican II: York/London: J.W. O'Malley, What happened at Vatican II? (Cambridge: Harvard University Press 2010). 8 The conciliar documents are quoted here from the translation: N. Tanner (ed.), Vatican II: The Essential Texts (New York: Image Books 2012).208 Borgman human society and speci fically on questions and problems which seem par- ticularly urgent today\" , notably marriage and family, culture, social-economic life, the political order, and the concern for peace. It is stated that the analysis of these matters does not just involve permanent but also transient features, and that, for this reason, when interpreting the second part one should bear in mind 'the naturally changing circumstances of the matters treated'. This footnote is somewhat misleading. It seems to suggest that the newness of Gaudium et spes is simply that it takes into account contingent historical situations. Ever since Leo XIII and his encyclical Rerum novarum started the tradition of catholic social teaching, however, the Roman Catholic Church has regularly judged historical and social circumstances in their particularity and contingency. As the Catholic Church understood its Social Teaching, these judgements were based on eternal principles that had been entrusted to the Church by God in Jesus Christ. However, if one wants to include Gaudium et spes in the tradition of Catholic Social Teaching, one has to allow for a revolu- tion as part of this tradition. This revolution, however, is exactly what makes it impossible to truly understand the document in terms of unchanging princi- ples, applied to changing situations, as is suggested in the first footnote. The revolution was implied in an ecclesiological shift and ultimately signals a pro- found change in fundamental theology and theological epistemology. Shortly after the Council, Edward Schillebeeckx wrote that the theological breakthrough that it represented was implied in what was commonly indi- cated as its pastoral orientation. Schillebeeckx foresaw that the term 'pastoral' , which Pope John XXIII had been using in connection with the Council right from start, would be interpreted as pertaining to the concrete application of a doctrine of faith which itself was seen as constant and fixed. 9 He believed, however, that it was exactly this distinction that the Council had made unat- tainable. The fact that the Council declared the Church to be the light of the world ( Lumen gentium ) in its Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, could still be reconciled with the view of the Church as keeper of an unchanging revela- tion that was God's gift to mankind. Gaudium et spes , however, left no doubt that the Church takes its shape in, and emerges from, the world. The Church does not start out as the keeper of God's revelation, standing outside the world and subsequently engaging with that world. It is formed by people in the world who, as it is phrased, \"united in Christ ... are led by the holy Spirit in their jour- ney to the Kingdom of their Father\". Christ's followers, who form the Church \"have welcomed the news of salvation which is meant for every human being\" 9 E. Vatican II as a Lasting Call to Theological Conversion and thus they are and remain \"truly linked with humanity and its history by the deepest of bonds\". 10 Or, in the language of Lumen gentium: The mystery of the holy Church is clearly visible in its foundation. For the lord Jesus inaugurated the church when he preached the happy news of the coming of the kingdom of God that has been promised in the scrip- tures [...] When therefore the church, equipped with the gifts of its founder and faithfully keeping his precepts of love, humility and pen- ance, receives the mission of announcing the kingdom of Christ and of God and of inaugurating it among all peoples, it has formed the seed and the beginning of the kingdom on earth. Meanwhile as it gradually grows, it aspires after the completion of the kingdom and hopes and desires with all its strength to be joined with its king in glory. 11 That is why it is the task of the Church as the people of God to give evidence to its \"feelings of oneness, concern and love towards the whole human family of which it is a part ... by entering in conversation with it on [the] various prob- lems\" it faces. 12 What is critical in this conception is that the world is ultimately the theo- logical place of the disciples whom Christ had gathered to form his Church. As a result of the tumultuous debates about it during the Council, much has been made of the fact that in Lumen gentium , the chapter about the Church as the People of God precedes the chapter about the Church as a hierarchy. Yet, it is merely one of the consequences of the statement that \"the church is in Christ as a sacrament\" , which is an \"instrumental sign of intimate union with God and of the unity of all humanity\". 13 In this statement God is presented primarily as the Creator and Redeemer of the world who can be known and found to be present by and through the Church. 14 In other words: the Church does not exist for its own sake, but as an instrumental sign of God's mission by which humanity and the world are accepted in God's own life. Writing a 'Pastoral Constitution on the Modern World' is among the consequences: This world is seen as the world of men and women, the whole human family in its total environment; the stage of human history notable for its 10 Gaudium et spes , no. 1. 11 Lumen gentium 2-4.210 Borgman toil, its tragedies and its triumphs; the world which Christians believe has been established and kept in being by its Creator's love, has fallen into the bondage of sin but has been liberated by Christ, who was cruci fied and has risen to shatter the power of the evil one, so that it could be transformed according to God's purpose and come to its ful filment. 15 Here, the world is unambiguously presented as a place of the highest theologi- cal signi ficance; the world is, in itself, theological because of God's \"very closely knit union\" with it. \"Presence in the world is presence with God\" was the motto of the movement of the French worker-priests in the 1950s, who in turn derived it from the nineteenth-century restorer of the Dominican Order in France, Henri-Dominique Lacordaire (1802-1861). Twelve years after the suspension of this movement in 1953 by order of the Roman authorities, because it allowed itself to be too radically inspired by 'modern conditions and requirements' , 16 Gaudium et spes meant the o fficial adoption of their guiding principle as a fun- damental principle for the entire Catholic Church. 2 A Call to Conversion Faded Away? The fundamental approach of Gaudium et spes is intimately connected to the work of the French Dominican Marie-Dominique Chenu. In the 1920s and 1930s, Chenu became convinced that theology is a re flection on the current situation of humankind and God's involvement with it. This was Chenu's inter- pretation of Thomas Aquinas's basic assumption that God is not the object of faith and theology in the same way things in the world are objects of human experience and the sciences. While God is the 'formal object' , faith lives its life and theology studies the world \"under the aspect of God\". 17 Chenu, both a his- torian and a theologian, considered the great theological syntheses of the past to be more than self-contained speculative systems of thought. He regarded them as forms of re flection on a concrete situation from the point of view of a speci fic spirituality, embedded in a well-de fined culture. Divine revelation is 15 Gaudium et spes , no. 2. 16 On the controversy surrounding the worker-priests, see F. Humani Generis (12 Cf. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I, Q. 1, art. 7. For Chenu's interpretation of Aqui- nas, see in particular Chr. M\u00fcnster: Lit, 2010), 635-665.211 Vatican II as a Lasting Call to Theological Conversion not simply to be found in Scripture and the tradition of the Church. Instead, it is a living presence in the faith of the faithful that keeps developing in its reac- tions to new situations. Chenu believed that the intellectual re flection on these developments and the attempt to account for them intellectually is theology. 18 This is why Chenu had hoped to be able to do more during his presence at the Council as an advisor than just informing the participating bishops about the latest developments in theological research. He was determined to open the Council to the new situation in which the world and the Church found themselves, and to have it account for its relationship with that world and its place in it. This is why he pressed for the Council to issue an opening statement for which he had even drafted a text. 19 Later, he would show his disappoint- ment in the statement as it was actually issued by saying it \"had been dipped in holy water\". 20 During the Council, Chenu constantly exerted pressure to have the Church de fine itself as a reader of the signs of the time. 21 Here, he was fol- lowing in the footsteps of Pope John XXIII - Chenu had christened him 'Doctor of the Signs of the Time' - who, in his encyclical Pacem in terris , published before the Council, had been calling for an aggiornamento , an updating of the 18 Cf.

To some extent, the acceptance of Gaudium et spes witnesses to the success of Chenu's perseverance. Immediately after the Council, Gaudium et spes did have considerable in flu- ence. Together with Pope John XXIII 's encyclical Pacem in terris in 1963, Pope Paul VI's peace address to the General Assembly of the United Nations on 4 October 1965, and the messages at the end of the Council (addressed to those in power, to intellectuals and scientists, to artists, to women, to workers, to the poor and sick and all those who su ffer, and to the young), the constitution demonstrated to the outside world the determination of the Roman Catholic Church to be a credible partner in finding solutions for the problems that were haunting the world during the second half of the 1960s. 23 However, there would be little re flection on the theological renewal that Gaudium et spes pre- sented. In 1968, the Latin-American Bishops Conference, held in Medell\u00edn, reflected on the question of what the theoretical and practical stance of the Church should be in their context of poverty, oppression, and violence. The document that resulted from this conference marked the beginning of Liberation Theology which, as Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez put it, considered solidarity with the poor to be a form of contemplation and listening to God. Thus, in the view of Guti\u00e9rrez, God's presence and message became connected with and could be found by connecting with one's context. 24 Here, Guti\u00e9rrez was clearly following the theological approach developed by Chenu and fleshed out in Gaudium et spes. Hardly anyone seems to have noticed it at the time, however. Both supporters and opponents tended to consider liberation theology to be an expression and a theological justi fication of a socio-political and ethical 22 The term 'signs of the time' is first used in the apostolic constitution Humanae Salutis (25 December 1961) by which Pope John XXIII officially convened the Second Vatican Coun- cil, that had been announce two years earlier. The term would be next be used not in the main text, but in the subheadings that were added in the translations of the encyclical Pacem in terris (11 April 1963), which for the first time o fficially gave human rights their foundation in the Catholic tradition. 23 The messages can be found in Acta Apostolicae Sedis 58 (1966) 10-17; , at <http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-xxiii/en/ency clicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_11041963_pacem.html> (Accessed 13 November 2015) Address of the Holy Father Paul VI to the United Nations Organisatiom (4 October 1965), at <http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/speeches/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_1965 1004_united-nations.html>. 24 This can already be seen in G. Guti\u00e9rrez, A Theology of Liberation (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1973 & 1971), but is developed further in G. Guti\u00e9rrez, The Power of the Poor in History ( Mary- knoll: Orbis, 1983 & 1979); and G. Guti\u00e9rrez, We Drink from Our Own Wells: The Spiritual Journey of a People ( Maryknoll: Orbis 1984 & 1983).213 Vatican II as a Lasting Call to Theological Conversion commitment in favour of the poor. It was not seen as the attempt to see and hear God as He is present in the contemporary world, in order to repent and turn to the places that show how God's reign is at hand. 25 German theologian Hans-Joachim Sander, currently at the University of Salzburg in Austria, has characterized the theological revolution presented by Gaudium et spes as a shift from the focus on who and what God is, to a focus on where God is and what His presence implies. 26 This entails a conversion from metaphysical speculations about God to meeting God in the way He reveals Himself concretely. It is partly due to the fact that this theological undercur- rent of the document was neither clearly stated, nor recognized as such, that it became so contentious. For many the Pastoral Constitution would become a symbol of the tendency in the 1960s and 1970s to modernise Church and theol- ogy by adapting them to current ways of thinking and acting. This ultimately led to a profound and paralysing polarisation within the Roman Catholic Church, particularly in the Western world. The modernising tendency, strongly endorsed by prominent Catholic intellectuals and the clergy trained during the period just before or during the Council, was heavily contested by the Roman authorities and the newly appointed bishops and cardinals of the long ponti ficate of Pope John Paul II that started in 1978 and ended only twenty- seven years later with his death in 2005. His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, who, when he was still known as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, had been the very in flu- ential head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith from 1981 until the end of the reign of John Paul II, continued the same policy until he stepped down from o ffice in 2013. The atmosphere in the Church has changed considerably since Pope Francis took o ffice. Hopefully, this will finally allow Roman Catholic theology to develop in the direction of the ongoing conversion to God's living presence, as indicated by Gaudium et spes . Pope Francis's stress on the necessity of risk- taking, on mercy and solidarity as core Gospel values, and on the poor as the ones that should evangelize the Church, among other things, indicates that the chances are it will. 25 For an attempt to counter this interpretation, see my Sporen van de Borgman However, we cannot ignore the developments that have taken place in the meantime. 27 The extent to which Gaudium et spes has been brushed aside becomes clear when we study the encyclical Fides et ratio, published in 1998. Fides et ratio is emphatically programmatic and it emphasises the nec- essary relation between faith and reason, between Christian theology and philosophy. The encyclical ultimately deals with the question whether a real conversation between the Catholic Church and its religious tradition on the one hand, and the world with its secular wisdom on the other, is at all possible. This is an important question because, as Fides et ratio rightly emphasises, in the Catholic understanding, faith is not a deeply held conviction based on an inner feeling. It can and should be rationally justi fied and it has a truth-claim that can be assessed intellectually. From the outset, it is remarkable how Fides et ratio distances itself from the solidarity with the world that characterised Gaudium et spes and documents of the Second Vatican Council in general . From the start, it uses the anti-modern rhetoric that had characterised many pre-conciliar texts issued by the Teaching Office of the Roman Catholic Church. 28 In a tradition that can be traced more or less from Pius IX's Quanta cura strongly the di fferent philosophical forms of \"gnosticism and relativism which have dominated contemporary thought and led philosophi- cal research to lose its way in the shifting sands of widespread scepticism\". Fides et ratio signals and strongly deplores the in fluence of this philosophy on theology. Instead, the document states that with its \"enduring appeal to the search for truth, philosophy has the great responsibility of forming thought and culture\" and urges it to \"strive resolutely to recover its original vocation\" (art. 6). This original vocation of philosophy is, according to the encyclical, to inquire for the certitude of truth and the certitude of its absolute value that it sees as an inalienable aspect of leading a good and responsible human life (art. 27). 29 27 See for the struggle about the meaning of the Council, M. Faggioli, Vatican II: The Battle for Meaning ( New York/Mahwah: Paulist Press 2012). 28 John Paul II, encyclical Fides et ratio (14 September 1998), at <http://w2.vatican.va/con- tent/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091998_ fides-et-ratio.html>. (Accessed 13 November 2015). References in parentheses in the main text. 29 For an assessment of the relation between Fides et ratio and anti-modernist tenden- cies after Vatican I, see A. Dulles, \"Faith and Reason: From Vatican I to John Paul II\" , D.R. Foster, J.W. Koterski (eds.), The Two Wings of Catholic Thought: Essays on Fides et Ratio , Washington: The Catholic University of America Press 2003, 3-21.215 Vatican II as a Lasting Call to Theological Conversion Without actually arguing the case, the encyclical states that it is incon- ceivable that the essential human longing for truth and certainty would be unattainable, however much it may sometimes seem that way (art. 29). From there, Christian faith is presented as the real ful filment of this longing, lead- ing human beings to the possession of an absolute truth that is trustworthy (art. 33). The encyclical uses a well-known clich\u00e9 from anti-modern polem- ics that links the modern bias toward autonomous knowledge to the sinful pride of Adam and Eve, who violated the prohibition and ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, resulting in their banishment from para- dise (art. 22). Fides et ratio concludes that incorrect use of reason can move people away from their connection to God, whereas a correct use, on the other hand, can point to the Christian and Catholic faith as the true location of the foundational truth. According to the encyclical, the optimal relation between philosophy and theology is represented in Mary giving her assent to Gabriel's announcement that she would be mother to the saviour: by trusting in what is presented to her as a message coming from God, she becomes the bearer of the divine Word which is Truth itself (art. 108). Ultimately, Fides et ratio is hardly interested in the intrinsic value of philo- sophical inquiry. The encyclical puts philosophy almost entirely at the service of what it sees as the task of faith and theology. According to the encyclical, to be able to present Christian faith as the ultimate truth, theology needs a \"natu- ral, consistent and true\" philosophy about \"the human being, the world and, more radically, of being\" (art. 66). Although the encyclical expressly denies that it wants to impose one single philosophy, modern and postmodern forms of philosophy appear as seriously flawed from this point of view. Fides et ratio explicitly endorses the criticism of the newer philosophical movements by the teaching o ffice of the Church, starting from the First Vatican Council (art. 52-56). Philosophical developments from the nineteenth century onward are characterised as mainly expressions failings are, in essence, all effected by a loss of focus on real metaphysical truth and certainty. As a rem- edy, the encyclical advises following the tradition of theological thought and the philosophy that is a product of it, from the Church Fathers up to scho- lasticism. Fides et ratio strongly contrasts the traditional idea of a universal and eternal truth to the idea that consent is a matter of personal preference (subjectivism) or that philosophical insight is determined by time and culture (historicism). According to the encyclical, from a Catholic point of view, truth can only be objective, timeless, and independent from context: \"Truth can never be con fined to time and culture; in history it is known, but it also reaches beyond history\" (art. 95).216 Borgman It is beyond the focus of this article to investigate the background and the value of all these statements in detail. 30 However, it is important to note that they ultimately lead up to a phrase that clearly shows how deeply the commit- ment of Fides et ratio differs from that of Gaudium et spes : \"It is not an array of human opinions but truth alone which can be of help to theology\" (art. 69). 31 This appears to be an unambiguous departure from what is fundamental to the conciliar approach: that people, because of their finitude, will forever live in this \"array of human opinions\" and that they need to be found there, and are in fact found by the Truth that sets them free. As the Pastoral Constitution states: Bishops, to whom is assigned the task of ruling the Church of God, should, together with their priests, so preach the news of Christ that all the earthly activities of the faithful will be bathed in the light of the Gospel. [...] By unremitting study they should fit themselves to do their part in establishing dialogue with the world and with men of all shades of opinion. 32 The idea in Fides et ratio that limitation and diversity of understanding can be overcome through abstract reasoning and surrender to the doctrine that the Church proclaims, fails to recognise that they are unavoidable aspects of being human. In contrast, Gaudium et spes underlines: The experience of past ages, the progress of the sciences, and the trea- sures hidden in the various forms of human culture, by all of which the nature of man himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened, these pro fit the Church, too. [...] With the help of the Holy Spirit, it is the task of the entire People of God, especially pastors and theolo- gians, to hear, distinguish and interpret the many voices of our age, and to judge them in the light of the divine word, so that revealed truth can always be more deeply penetrated, bet ter understood and set forth to greater advantage [Italics by the author]. 33 30 For a collection of essays that tries to do that in an intellectually rigorous manner, see L.P. Hemming, S.F. Parsons (eds.), Redeeming Truth: Considering Faith and Reason (Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press 2007). 31 In the o 33 Ibid., no. 44.217 Vatican II as a Lasting Call to Theological Conversion Thus, the Pastoral Constitution stresses the fact that the Church can actually learn from what is going on in the array of human opinions. Not just trivial or marginal things, but aspects of what is implied in the revealed truth of the Gospel. The changing opinions of the contemporary world are not in contra- diction with the eternal truth of faith, but are to be discovered as paradoxical presences of this truth by an ongoing theological engagement with them. 3 The Sacramentality of the Truth In denying that the diversity of human ideas is helpful for theology, Fides et ratio in fact tends to frustrate what the encyclical itself calls \"the prime com- mitment of theology\": the understanding of the kenosis , the self-emptying of God in the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth as Christ (art. 93). This self-emp- tying implies divine subjection and commitment to humanity in its concrete historicity and contingency. 34 A theology that takes this seriously, will convert to the truth that is revealed amidst and in open confrontation with the plurality of human views, and as such is part of the Church as sacrament in the way that the Council explains it. The encyclical Fides et ratio (art. 13) quotes mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), who wrote: Just as Jesus Christ went unrecognised among men, so does his truth appear without external di fference among common modes of thought. So too does the Eucharist remain among common bread. 35 This denotes the self-emptying of the divine sublimity in human vulnerability that Christian tradition holds to be essential for Jesus Christ's becoming human as the Word of God. The encyclical reasons that this emptied-out Truth refers us to the sacramental character that its revelation has taken, according to Catholic tradition. The truth does not show itself in its massive sublimity, but 34 To Chenu, this so-called 'law of incarnation' was the starting point of his theology of the signs of the time; cf. M.-D. Chenu, commun\". The encyclical is wrong in quoting it as his truth, as if Pascal wrote: \" sa verit\u00e9\". For Pascal, in modernity all truth is unavoidably guised as common opinion.218 Borgman instead it is hidden in earthly signs that are real and present among us. From this, Fides et ratio concludes that reason needs faith to be able to recognize the presence of the truth in the guise of an opinion like any other. However, in a closer re flection on its sacramental character, a fundamentally di fferent vision of truth from what Fides et ratio presents can be developed, a vision more in line with Gaudium et spes and, I would argue, more promising for the necessary development of theology. The corpus of Vatican II documents thoroughly re flects on the unique char- acter of the sacraments and of sacramental presence, in part summarizing earlier innovative research. 36 In accordance with tradition, the Constitution on the Liturgy, Sacrosanctum concilium , routinely traces the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church, as they have been understood since the medieval period, back to Jesus Christ himself. The emphasis in the document is, how- ever, on Christ's renewed presence that the sacraments witness to and bring about. 37 As we have seen, the Dogmatic Constitution, Lumen gentium , consid- ers the Church as a whole to be 'as a sacrament' and, according to Gaudium et spes , this means that the Church in the world \"is at once manifesting and actu- alising the mystery of God's love for man\". 38 So, according to the Council, the sacraments do not primarily point to Jesus as their historical origin, but to his actual presence as a living \"sacrament of the encounter with God\". 39 The quo- tation from Pascal in Fides et ratio seems to suggest a link between the self-emptying of the truth and the emptying-out that is characteristic of sacra- mental presence. The lack of resplendence of the truth corresponds to the lack of visibility of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the prototypical sacra- ment. Gaudium et spes , however, does not suggest the necessity of an additional 'splendour of truth' 40 in order to enforce its proper recognition and honouring. Rather, it accepts the hiddenness of the divine truth \"for the wise and the intel- ligent\" , that according to the Gospel, is \"revealed ... to infants\" (cf. Matthew 36 (Freiburg i. Br.: Herder, 244-294. 37 Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy Sacrosanctum concilium (4 December 1963), passim. 38 Gaudium et no. 45. de Godsontmoeting ( Bilthoven: Nelissen, 1959). 40 Cf. John Paul II, Veritatis Splendor (6 August 1993) at <http://w2.vatican.va/content/john- paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor.html> (Accessed 13 November 2015). This encyclical concentrates on the importance of an abso- lute moral truth, and Fides et ratio goes on in the same tone, concentrating on the impor- tance of absolute intellectual truth.219 Vatican II as a Lasting Call to Theological Conversion 11:25; Luke 10:21). In other words, the divine truth speaks to people who are themselves hidden from the gaze of those that \"have set [their] minds not on divine things, but on human things\" (cf. Matthew 16:23). It requires, therefore, a conversion to be able to see it. Interestingly enough, this conversion seems to be what Pope Francis is driv- ing at when he speaks about the preferential option for the poor. As he writes in his apostolic exhortation Evangelii gaudium: I want a Church which is poor and for the poor. They have much to teach us. Not only do they share in the sensus fidei, but in their di fficulties they know the su ffering Christ. We need to let ourselves be evangelized by them. 41 Christoph Theobald, recently performed a thorough investigation of the docu- ments of the Second Vatican Council, reading them as the pastoral interventions in the modern context they were intended to be. 42 He concluded that the Council, fifty years after it came to a close, can still help us to understand our situation as a place for living, both as a communion of followers of Jesus Christ and as people belonging to our contemporary world and situation. 43 He con- siders this to be, first and foremost, a spiritual journey of faith, a way of \"going forward\" , as it is called in the tradition of Ignatian spirituality, responding to what God is communicating to us through the situation and our responses to it.44 This seems very much in line with what Pope Francis expects from his fel- low Jesuits. He told them: We need to seek God in order to find him, and find him in order to seek him again and always. Only this restlessness gives peace to the heart of a Jesuit, a restlessness that is also apostolic, but which must not let us grow 41 Pope Francis, apostolic exhortation Evangelii Gaudium (24 November 2013), no. 198,, at <http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-fran cesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html> (Accessed 13 November 2015). 42 C.

Theobald, \"C'est aujourd'hui le moment favorable: Pour une diagnostic th\u00e9ologique du temps present\" , C. proclaiming the kerygma, of evangelizing with courage. It is the restlessness that prepares us to receive the gift of apostolic fruitfulness. Without restlessness we are sterile. 45 However, from my own Dominican point of view, it is also necessary to try to understand what ultimately happens here. How is it that we can meet God, not in the exalted and majestic, but in the lowly, without lowering and even trivial- ising God? How exactly do we meet God here and what does that mean? 46 These are questions that Gaudium et spes does not address, and, interestingly enough, Thomas Aquinas may help us here, as he explains how he understands Jesus Christ emptying himself of his equality with God, as it is stated in hymn Saint Paul quotes in his letter to the Philippians (2:6-7). Because there is an infinite gap between God and human beings, it is impossible for finite human- ity to become divine, Aquinas argues. However, for the same reason, it is fitting for the divine to become human. As Aquinas writes: what belongs to the essence of goodness be fits God. Now it belongs to the essence of goodness to communicate itself to others ... Hence it belongs to the essence of the highest good to communicate itself in the highest manner to the creature. 47 This \"communication in the highest manner\" is achieved by an act of union, i.e. by uniting divinity with humanity in Christ. Thus, what Christ Jesus de fines, is the distinctive character of divine goodness: goodness that, out of the essence of its being good, communicates itself completely. By going to the 45 Pope Francis, Homily during Holy Mass on the Liturgical Memorial of the Most Holy Name of Jesus in the Church of the Ges\u00f9 in Rome (3 Januari 2014), at <http://w2.vatican.va/con tent/francesco/en/homilies/2014/documents/papa-francesco_20140103_omelia-santis simo-nome-gesu.html> (Accessed 13 November 2015). The Italian text of the homily was printed the next day in L'Osservatore Romano under the title 'La compagnia degli inquieti' , the society of the restless. 46 There is an old tension behind this between Dominicans and Jesuits. The Dominican theologian Melchior Cano (1509-1560) was of the opinion that in his Spiritual Exercises Ignatius of Loyola presumed that through their interior lives human beings could be in direct contact with God through the Holy Spirit and experience God directly: the heresy of what were called the alumbrados ; cf. S. Pavone, \"A Saint under Rome\" , R.A. (ed.), A Companion to Writing, Spirituality Summa theologiae, III, q. 1, art. 1. Aquinas here quotes Augustine from his De Trinitate xiii.221 Vatican II as a Lasting Call to Theological Conversion extreme to communicate God's goodness, Christ profoundly shows how God is in Himself excessively good, according to Aquinas. In his commentary on Paul's letter to the Philippians, Aquinas calls it 'beau- tiful' - pulcher - to say that Jesus Christ 'emptied himself'. Christ 'emptied himself not by putting o ff his divine nature, but by assuming a human nature' , as Aquinas interprets the expression. Saying He 'emptied' himself really takes on a special meaning, because it shows that divine nature assumed the empti- ness that characterises humanity. Aquinas formulates it thus: \"the divine nature is su fficiently full, because every perfection of goodness is there; human nature and the soul are not full, but capable of fullness\". 48 In Christ, God shares in human poverty and frailty, according to Aquinas, in order to invest this pov- erty and frailty with divine dignity. Being poor and frail and vulnerable, therefore, can be an icon of the divine. 49 All of this is closely analogous with what, in Aquinas's view, it meant for Jesus Christ to accept death. As a sensual human being, it was natural for him to shun pain and death - and He did. However, He turns the natural aversion of pain and death into the submission to Gods will, which ultimately results in a life lived to the full and salvation from all pain and su ffering. The analogy Aquinas uses is that of medicine. In medicine, it is sometimes necessary to suf- fer pain in order to restore health. The inclination to avoid pain therefore has to be suppressed. 50 This does not mean however, that pain is good and aver- sion to pain bad. The point is that the illness temporarily renders the aversion to pain self-contradictory: avoiding the pain that medicine causes would lead to greater pain and ultimately to the death that is feared in pain. Thus, by will- ingly submitting to temporary pain, reason takes to a higher level the will to live life and to live it to the full that is manifested in the sensual desire to avoid pain. God is ultimately the very fullness of goodness, but in a broken world, His icon may be the su ffering servant, the one who has nothing left to share but his vulnerable love that protests against the su ffering as a lack of goodness. God is truth and wisdom, but in a false world, his presence may hide in preaching and performing what, under the circumstances, cannot but be perceived as foolish- ness: being faithful to what obviously has no place and is not wanted. Conversion to the marginal position that comes with this, is the ultimate image of the faith in its ultimate truth - which as truth, has to be obeyed. What Paul 48 Super Epistolam B. Pauli ad Philipenses lectura , Caput 49 See C.A. Franks, He Became Poor: The Poverty of Christ and Aquinas's Economic Teachings (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2009). 50 Ibid. q. 18, art. 5.222 Borgman calls \"the message of the cross\" , lacks what is commonly seen as wisdom and eloquence. Yet, in its own way, it does have this wisdom and eloquence, since it witnesses to God's faithful and loving presence in the world in Christ Jesus (cf. 1 Corinthians 1:17). When Aquinas states that in Jesus Christ, divine nature has assumed the emptiness of our current existence and the 'not yet' of what should be, and how it should be, this is what is ultimately at stake. In e ffect, this means that poverty and emptiness are the places where the presence of the divine fullness and richness is really to be found - in the form of their absence as assumed by the divine nature that is perfect goodness and love. 4 Hidden with Christ in God According to Saint Paul, it is this presence, in the form of absence, which Christians share. Through their conversion and in their baptism in Jesus's death, Christians die to the world as it is and their lives are, as Paul expresses it in his letter to the Colossians, hidden with Christ in God. The marginal exis- tence in the world as it is, reveals the fact that, ultimately, they will be proven its true heirs: \"When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you too will appear with him in glory\" (Colossians 3:3-4). The mutually hidden presence of God to the world, and the world in God, is what is expressed in Jesus's proclamation that the reign of God is 'at hand' and calls us to conversion. It enables us, I believe, to find our eschatological future of abundant goodness and life as present not just in the finitude and non-divinity of the world, as Gaudium et spes urges us to do, but in human vulnerability, poverty, and injury through what Pope Francis calls the preferential option for the poor. Truth is thus not just found in the 'array of human opinions' , but even in the heart of the illu- sions, fabrications, and lies by which human beings try to survive in what they often experience as a hostile world. This might even give us some indication of what it means when Saint Paul says of Jesus Christ that God made \"him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God\" (2 Corinthians 5:21). God is with us, even though we are not with God: this is, I would argue, the fundamental paradox of the Christian faith and the only thing that can save us in the situation our world is currently in. We are consis- tently called to conversion, and it is our main theological responsibility to make this call as explicit as possible. This is only possible by responding to it and interpreting our world through what we are given to hear and see. What is needed is not just for people to live spiritually in this world. What is needed is that this world is read theologically. From there, it could become clear again how the world, not just in its goodness and sometimes overwhelming 223 Vatican II as a Lasting Call to Theological Conversion beauty, but also in its repulsive ugliness and appalling evil, speaks of God as its Creator and Redeemer. It would make theology relevant again; not just for those who are committed to a religious and spiritual life, but also to those who are not even aware that they are missing such a life. And it may help us to understand a little better how it is that, as Gaudium et spes states: ... since Christ died for all men, and since the ultimate vocation of man is in fact one, and divine, we ought to believe that the Holy Spirit in a man- ner known only to God o ffers to every man the possibility of being associated with this paschal mystery. 51 Wherever we are, we are in the process of being resurrected and saved. To be able to see that, we need ongoing conversion. To explain what we see and what the signi ficance of it is, we need theology. A di fferent theology for the most part from what we have now, but de finitely theology. Bibliography Alberigo, G., Kamonchak, J.A. (eds.). (1997).

Summa Theologiae I, Q. 1, art. 7. Witte, H. AMDG : Een ignatiaans Some Canonical Re flections Thomas J. Green 1 Introduction Pope Francis notably addresses the theme of ecclesial conversion in his speeches and writings 1 but especially in his exercise of the papal ministry. Accordingly, most of the essays in this Festschrift rightly focus on broad con- version themes, and rightly so, given the thrust of much of Henk Witte's scholarly work. However, as a canonist, I think it would be helpful also to stress some practical structural implications of those generic theological themes, since the Church's credibility depends greatly on its practical living out of its official teachings. Interestingly enough the ecumenical implications of ecclesial conversion were addressed some years ago by members of the Peter and Paul Seminar 2 at an interdisciplinary conference on 'Conversion and Reform in View of the Unity of the Church' held in 2009 at Erfurt, Germany, under the leadership of Dr. Myriam Wijlens. 3 My previous paper on selected legislative structures 4 will serve as a key source for the current Festschrift text. Initially I will re flect very brie fly on institutional renewal in the Church. Such a motif is pertinent not simply to distinctly Catholic Church reform but also to a deepening of our varied ecumenical relationships, which have signi ficant canonical implica- tions. My primary focus, however, will be considering various institutional implications of such a call to conversion. I will brie fly discuss various participa- tive structures at di fferent ecclesial levels: universal (synod of bishops), intermediate or regional (episcopal conferences and particular councils), and 1 See especially Apostolic Exhortation of the Holy Father Francis . Evangelii Gaudium (Boston: Pauline Books & Media, 2013) (From now on: EG and paragraph number). 2 For an overview of the Seminar's origins and purpose, see M. Wijlens, \"Peter and Paul Seminar: A Follow-up by Theologians and Canonists to the Groupe des Dombes's Publication for the Conversion of the Churches\" , The Jurist 64 (2004), 6-20. 3 The conference papers and others written afterwards were later published in The Jurist , the journal of the School of Canon Law of the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC. See The Jurist 71 (2011), 1-90; 271-272; 360-449. 4 See Th. Green, \"Selected Legislative Structures in Service of Ecclesial Reform\" , The Jurist 71 (2011), 422-449 (From Some of these decisional structures are primarily episcopal in character, e.g., episcopal conferences, while others are more broadly ecclesial, e.g., diocesan synods. We will focus especially on their pur- pose, competency, and membership in fostering institutional renewal in the Church and genuine ecumenical progress. Such participative structures should help to engage more of the faithful in facilitating ecclesial reform. Not all of these structures have the same potential for achieving such objec- tives. Hence we will occasionally suggest possible modi fications of the law governing them to enhance their e ffectiveness. Limitations of space preclude our doing any more than o ffering some general observations on the canonical profile of such entities. 5 However, this should be somewhat informative, especially for non-canonical readers of the Festschrift. 2 Some General Thoughts on Institutional Reform in the Church For Yves Congar, certain attitudes are important in fostering genuine ecclesial reform. 6 First, the reformer should manifest fidelity to the Church in a spirit of charity and attentiveness to the concrete needs of believers. Second, the reformer's remaining in communion with other church members is crucial, focusing on what we hold in common and not what separates us. This spirit is important throughout the Church, especially in ongoing interactions involving the hierarchy and the faithful at large. 7 Third, reformers need to respect patiently the importance of delay at times in achieving their objectives; e.g., a necessary testing of ideas at Vatican II in view of reaching an ecclesial consen- sus. A key ecumenical task is to repair slowly and patiently what has been broken because of our impatience and narrowness in believing. Fourth, reform depends greatly on a return to the principle of tradition. Individually and cor- porately we need constantly to explore that tradition, tapping the riches of the past such as scripture, primitive Christianity, patristics, liturgy, popular piety, and evolving doctrinal development under the inspiration of the Spirit. 5 The article mentioned in the prior note explored the various structures more thoroughly than is possible here. 6 See C. Bellitto, \"True and False Reform\" , The London Tablet (January 1, 2015) 18-19. For more detailed re flections on Congar's ideas on ecclesial reform, see J. Famer\u00e9e, \"True or False Reform: What are the Key Criteria? The Re flections of Y. Congar\" , The Jurist 61 (2011), 7-19 esp. 9-19. 7 The second part of this article focuses exclusively on such interactions at di fferent levels.228 Green For Christopher Bellitto, too, renewal means striking a 'balance' , i.e., restor- ing to the Church on its pilgrim journey an image of perfection linking its original image with necessary, normal, legitimate growth amidst a somewhat polarized Church. At issue is sustaining a Church that embodies an attitude of 'both and' rather than an 'either-or' approach as a basic context for intra- church and ecumenical dialogue. The reformer is to live as part of a unique body carrying out a unique work with the other faithful. The reformer is to reflect a living, yet not servile, relationship with the hierarchy. The Church needs to re flect a certain dynamic relationship between the centre and the periphery; between the organs of continuity and unity, and the organs of movement and progress. The hierarchy is to ensure that movements of church life flourish and that these movements are integrated within church structures. The hierarchical centre is to ensure that prophetic initiatives are in harmony with the unity of the Church. Ongoing dialogue, especially but not exclusively in its corporate structures, ensures that church authority is in touch with the living currents of the whole body given possible tensions between the centre and grass roots initiatives. In viewing canon law as a signi ficant vehicle of institutional reform we need to highlight certain points. First we need legal security and stability for good order in the church, yet we also need canonical flexibility and diversity to respond to ongoing political, economic, socio-cultural, and religious changes in the Church and the world. 8 Such good order requires articulating funda- mental Christian rights and obligations 9 and making provisions to protect the exercise of such rights 10 and ensure the ful fillment of such obligations. 11 Such good order also calls for the de fining of institutions such as the corporate structures we consider shortly, especially clergy-laity relationships. The aforementioned values are greatly served by various historically-condi- tioned legislative processes in the Church at all levels. Such processes depend for their e ffectiveness on various factors; e.g., serious commitment of church authorities, available resources (personnel, financial, institutional etc.), and adequate formation of the Christian faithful. Such decisional processes call for the diversi fied involvement of various believers who articulate the theoretical and practical wisdom of the people 8 See Green, Legislative Structures, 424. 9 See, for example, cc. 208-223 specifying various rights and obligations of all the faithful. 10 See, for example, c. 221 on access to judicial and administrative fora to address various concerns and cc. 1732-1739 on recourse against administrative decisions such as consoli- dating parishes. 11 See, for example, c. 384 on the bishop's supervisory role relative to his presbyters.229 Ecclesial Conversion : Some Canonical Reflections of God (e.g., theologians, pastors, canonists, representative members of the faithful) embodying conciliar theological values in response to ongoing pas- toral needs. 12 The Church needs regularly to consider the signs of the times in human societies, cultures, other Christian churches, and non-Christian religions. A particularly signi ficant post-conciliar development has been a closer rela- tionship between canonists and ecumenists - at least in some settings. 13 The former are occasionally called to express structurally shifting ecumenical rela- tionships while fashioning new ecumenical structures. This is necessary for genuine ecclesial communion that is more than simply good will without prac- tical institutional rami fications. At issue here is the ecumenical dimension of conversion. A key conciliar development was its ecumenical orientation, artic- ulated brie fly as a key ecclesiological motif in the January 25, 1983 apostolic constitution Sacrae disciplinae leges promulgating the Latin code. 14 Yet, that text is less ecumenically oriented than the October 18, 1990 apostolic constitu- tion Sacri canones 15 promulgating the Eastern code, particularly given the special Eastern Catholic task of engaging in outreach to the Orthodox high- lighted in the third principle for the revision of the Eastern code. 16 The Church's irrevocable commitment to ecumenism is based on doctrine but also on cultivating appropriate internal attitudes ('change of heart'). But such a commitment remains purely theoretical unless it is concretely embod- 12 See J. Renken, \"Pope Francis and Participative Bodies). For re flections on the call of Francis to the faithful to be in a state of constant renewal, see ibid. 206-214. In this connection four possible themes relevant to decision-making in reli- gious institutes/societies seem pertinent to ecclesial reform. See the somewhat nuanced c. 631 on the diverse purposes of religious chapters, which might be adapted mutatis mutandis to the various decisional bodies we will consider: protection of the patrimony of the religious institution or society and promotion of ecclesial renewal, treatment of eccle- sially important issues, issuance of binding norms, and a stress on the representative character of the decisional body embodying the values of ecclesial unity and charity that should characterizing policy-setting processes.

The codes are to re flect the 'newness of Vatican II' , helping us receive the conciliar doctrine on our relationships to other churches/eccle- sial communities. We have moved from a somewhat negative view of such churches/communities with an emphasis on their institutional de ficiencies to a more positive appraisal of their salvi fic elements, such as a commitment to the Word of God, their spirituality, their sacramental celebrations, and their charitable undertakings. 17 3 Speci fic Legislative Structures After some generic comments on ecclesial renewal, we now focus on several church structures, particularly in terms of their potential for fostering church reform despite the general absence of 'renewal language' in the canons. We will brie fly consider a universal structure (synod of bishops), two intermediate or regional structures (particular councils and episcopal conferences), and a dioc- esan structure (diocesan synods). As noted above, space limitations preclude a detailed structural analysis. However, we will note especially such structures' purpose/competency, functioning, and membership; e.g., their representative, diversi fied character, whether they are primarily episcopal or broadly ecclesial. These characteristics of such entities may perhaps best help us judge their potential to foster church reform. Universal Level: Synod of Bishops 18 a)Preliminary notes Regrettably no provisions were made systematically to update universal law in the 1917 code despite the intent of Benedict XV (who 17 See M.

For example, one might note the evangelization potential of the synod of bishops in addressing mar- riage and family issues in a rapidly changing society. We will brie fly discuss this issue now within the broader context of some observations on the synod. b)Origins and nature Before Vatican II, some bishops expressed a desire for a kind of permanent episcopal council in the Vatican enabling the bishops, with the pope, to exercise their authority over the whole Church. Despite ini- tial e fforts to draft provisions for such a council, the bishops did not resolve the issue and on September 14, 1965 Paul VI promulgated the motu proprio Apostolica sollicitudo 23 constituting the synod of bishops. This text signi fi- cantly in fluenced the drafting of the Latin code, which treats the synod in canons 342-348. Press, 1964), i-iii. 20 This is true despite a proposal during the code drafting process by Archbishop Joseph Bernardin, the chairman of the American bishops' canonical a ffairs committee. He envi- sioned systematically updating the universal law every five years to ensure regular institu- tional reform. See Green, Legislative Structures, 424. 21 See Benedict XVI, motu proprio Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela. May 21, 2010: AAS 102 (2010) 419-430. 22 See EG 32. Francis speaks here generically of a conversion of the papacy in view of more effective evangelization. He also notes par. 95 of John Paul II's encyclical Ut unum sint of May 25, 1995 inviting re flection on the papal ministry, especially in view of more e ffective ecumenical witness. See AAS 87 (1995), 977-978. For some thoughtful recent papal re flec- tions on synodality or communion in decision-making at various levels, see Pope Francis, \"Speech on 50th Anniversary of Synod of Bishops\" , Origins 45/22 (October 29, 2015), 381- 384. 23 AAS 57 (1965), 775-780.232 Green The synod as currently structured is not primarily a response to the afore- mentioned expectations of some bishops for a representative 24 structure facilitating their exercise of supreme power in the Church. Rather it is a struc- ture enabling them to assist the pope in exercising his primatial ministry. It is basically a gathering of bishops from around the world to foster papal-episco- pal communion, assist the pope in discharging his universal responsibilities, and discuss pastoral questions arising around the world. 25 In short there is no ordinary means for the college's supreme authority to be exercised as distinct from the extraordinary means of an ecumenical council. 26 c)Competency Currently one can realistically speak only of the decisional potential of the synod and not of its decisional competency given its relatively circumscribed legislative options and its subordination to papal authority. 27 It is not a legislative body but rather a consultative entity, advising the pope and making suggestions which he is free to accept or reject. The synod can exercise deliberative (delegated papal) power only when the pope so endows it and ratifies its decisions. 28 d)Membership The synods are divided into three types: ordinary general sessions, extraordinary general sessions, and special sessions. The heavily cleri- cal membership is constituted largely by residential bishops approved by the pope with a focus on elected (ordinary) or ex o fficio (extraordinary) members. Yet the synod also includes selected papal appointees, the cardinal prefects of the Roman dicasteries, elected clerical religious superiors, and some Eastern hierarchs. Some other observers may be invited as well pursuant to special law, e.g., the synod Ordo . e)Possible Canonical Changes In keeping with papal openness to possible alterations of the synod pro file,29 one might suggest especially enabling the 24 Unlike CD 5 the opening canon 342 says nothing about the synod's representative role or its manifesting the sollicitudo of the whole college for the Church. 25 See c. 342. 26 See cc. 337-341. 27 See c. 344. 28 See c. 343.The one example of such a deliberative role might be the 1967 synod's approval of ten principles to guide the revision of the Latin code. However, ultimately Paul VI rati- fied such principles before the Code Commission seriously undertook its work. See Com- municationes 2 (1969), 77-85. 29 See Coriden, 131. For some helpful bibliographical sources on possible synod changes, see ibid.,136, fn. 43.233 Ecclesial Conversion : Some Canonical Reflections synod to function regularly in a deliberative fashion, be it in disciplinary or doctrinal matters 30 This development, envisioned at various times during and since the council, would mean that the synod with the pope could exercise the authority of the college to a certain extent. Such an action would be authorita- tive even if not re flecting the solemn and full authority of the college mentioned in canon 337 (ecumenical council or bishops dispersed throughout the world whom the pope calls to collegial action). Among other changes one might suggest are not requiring papal approval of Episcopal membership choices, limiting voting prerogatives to residential bishops with curial representatives serving in a consultative capacity, welcom- ing representative men and women religious and other members of the faithful, and systematically inviting observers from other Christian traditions and/or non-Christian religions depending on the issues on the synod agenda. This would somewhat re flect the experience of Vatican II, which should be paradigmatic for all ecclesial assemblies. The whole synodal process should be open, in keeping with the values of ecclesial consultation and deliberation, unless the demands of con fidentiality are especially pressing in a given case. 31 Finally, after serious discussion, the synodal assembly, along with the pope, should select the topic for the next synod. Infra-Universal Levels: Intermediate/Regional and Diocesan By contrast to the absence of systematic provisions for the regular updating of the universal law, the code provides for such possible expressions of ecclesial reform at the intermediate/regional (particular councils and episcopal confer- ences) and diocesan (diocesan synod) levels, even though such legislative initiatives may not contradict universal law. 32 Such provisions re flect our ecclesial diversity, which need not necessarily be unity-threatening but, rather, may enhance our internal church mission e fforts and our ecumenical under- takings. The more vital the options are for serious legal-pastoral activity 30 See c. 343. 31 Perhaps Francis's approach to the current synod foreshadows some future legal modi fica- tions enhancing its status. See, for example, Thomas Reese, \"How the synod process is different under Pope Francis\" , accessed April 6, 2015, at <http://ncronline.org/blogs/faith- and-justice/how-synod-process>), Reese highlights several points somewhat di fferentiat- ing the current process from its predecessors. Francis strongly encourages the synod participants to speak boldly about their concerns. He approaches the synod discussion inductively rather than deductively. He encourages the participants to build a collegial consensus in the Spirit. All this re flects his lengthy CELAM experience, e.g., his presidency of the 2007 Aparecida, Mexico session. 32 See c. 135 \u00a72 prohibiting lower level legislators from acting contrary to higher level laws.234 Green especially at the intermediate/regional level, the more likely we will be viewed favourably by our ecumenical partners, especially the Orthodox. 33 Intermediate/Regional Level: Particular Councils (cc. 439-446) 34 a)Preliminary notes Particular councils may be celebrated at either the national (plenary) or provincial levels; some canons apply solely to one or the other 35 while others apply to both. 36 Such councils have varied historically in such things as their frequency, geographic scope, membership and issues addressed, but they have consistently dealt with doctrinal and especially disci- plinary issues and embodied a spirit of ecclesial communion. Despite their potential for fostering ecclesial reform and their historic accomplishments in this regard, such 'particular' councils were relatively inac- tive during the pre-Vatican II period. This probably prompted the council fathers to seek their revitalization as expressions of ecclesial communion. 37 For such councils, despite their canonical limitations by contrast to ecumeni- cal councils, still have a great deal of autonomy in adapting legislation to local circumstances. Furthermore, they may well serve doctrinal/catechetical pur- poses quite e ffectively in engaging a broad cross section of the faithful in discussing such concerns under episcopal leadership. However, despite Vatican II's encouragement, particular councils have con- tinued to be relatively inactive. Besides logistical problems in holding them, this may be due largely to the enhanced disciplinary and doctrinal status of episcopal conferences since Vatican II. Despite their less signi ficant legislative competency than particular councils, conferences regularly address liturgical, ministerial, doctrinal, and public policy issues that the councils once consid- ered. In short, at the moment these latter entities contribute relatively little to 33 In this connection see the October 2007 Ravenna statement on ecclesial communion, conciliarity, and authority issued by the international Catholic-Orthodox dialogue. <http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/ponti fical_councils/chrstuni/ch_orthodox_docs/ rc_po_2/22/2008, 6-7> (Accessed 6 April 6 2015). See also Paul McPartlan, A Service of Love: Papal Primacy, The Eucharist & Christian Unity (Washington: The Catholic Univer- sity of America Press, 2013), 1-13. 34 For a brief treatment of such councils, see Green, Legislative Structures, 426-433; for bib- liographical references, see ibid., 436, fn. 19. 35 Canons 439 and 441 govern solely plenary councils while canons 440 and 442 govern solely provincial councils. 36 Canons 443-446 apply to both types of councils. 37 See CD 36.235 Ecclesial Conversion : Some Canonical Reflections ecclesial reform; and the Church is deprived of the possible bene fit arising from the insights and experience of such a broad ecclesial assembly. 38 b)Nature of Plenary Councils 39 Plenary councils enable the bishops of a conference to deal with issues of faith, morals, and discipline when an abso- lute majority of its membership with a deliberative vote determines that such a session is desirable for long-range planning or mission-discussion purposes. The council represents a gathering of all the churches of the conference. Unlike provincial councils with their more limited scope, however, the Holy See must approve holding such a plenary council and the bishops' choice of a council president. 40 Along with his brother bishops, he makes the key decisions on its celebration; e.g., electoral procedures, agenda, etc. However, provision should be made for serious consultation of the non-episcopal members in the assem- bly in shaping the agenda and in making decisions. c)Nature of Provincial Councils 41 As is true for the plenary council, there is no set time to hold a provincial council, 42 which depends on the decision of the metropolitan of the province and his su ffragans (other heads of dioceses) in light of their perception of provincial legal-pastoral needs. Like the plenary council (and as distinct from the conference), this assembly enables the bish- ops to address issues within a broad ecclesial context. Such bishops make certain key decisions regarding the celebration of the council; e.g., place, agenda, procedures, etc. with due regard for appropriate consultation. Given the lesser scope of provincial council decisions, however, there is no reference to Holy See determinations regarding its celebration. 38 Regrettably authoritative documents such as the 2003 apostolic constitution Pastores gre- gis, 62 (John Paul II) and the 2004 directory on bishops Apostolorum successores (Congre- gation for Bishops) 24-27 simply mention such councils but do not strongly endorse their value. 39 See cc. 439, 441. 40 Such a requirement re flects a concern to assure communion with the Holy See and a recognition of the national implications of such council decisions. However, a proper respect for a sound decentralization of governmental processes ( EG 16) suggests that the affected bishops should only have to notify the Holy See about such a council without needing its approval. If the Holy See had any concerns it could mention them at that point, but this should be the exception rather than the rule. 41 See cc. 440, 442. 42 This alters 17 CIC, c. 283 which called for such councils every twenty years. Perhaps the general non-reception of that law led to the current provision for Episcopal discretion regarding the holding of such councils.236 Green d)Membership Particular Council membership should be viewed from two standpoints: first of all, what members of the faithful must be invited to the council and what members may be invited, and, secondly, what type of vote do the respective members have: deliberative (participating in the shaping of decisions) or consultative (o ffering non-binding advice on such decisions). Generally, a signi ficant ecclesial leadership role seems to be the basis for mandatory membership , be it with a deliberative vote, e.g., bishops, or with a consultative vote, e.g., vicars, selected major superiors, university/seminary rectors, etc. Other presbyters and members of the Christian faithful may be invited with a consultative vote; yet their number may not exceed one half of the prior group. Furthermore, selected representatives of consultative bodies such as presbyteral councils are to be invited to the provincial (but not the plenary) council with a consultative vote. Finally if the bishops with a deci- sional vote agree, and it seems ecumenically and/or interreligiously reasonable or even indispensable, it seems to me that others may be invited as observers , yet no speci fic reference is made to non-Catholics, 43 Christians or non-Chris- tians. The aforementioned provisions re flect a much broader view of ecclesial communion than did the exclusively clerical pro file of the former code charac- terizing such council membership. 44 e)Purposes/Authority 45 Among the council's key purposes are: organizing common pastoral action and fostering the ministry of the word, sacramental celebration, and good order. Whenever it meets, it has a broad and relatively autonomous governance role, especially legislative in character, with due regard for universal law and the proper role of the diocesan bishop. The coun- cil embodies a particular respect for the principle of subsidiarity with its provisions for decentralized governance. Its role is somewhat more notewor- thy than the relatively restricted legislative competency of the episcopal conference. While the latter may legislate only if it is explicitly authorized to do so, 46 the council may legislate in any area of the law in keeping with the aforementioned purposes. Despite di fferences between particular councils and conferences, there is one area in which their legislative activity is subject to the same higher-level 43 See c. 445, 6. By contrast see c. 463 \u00a73 on diocesan synods, which explicitly mentions the possibility of inviting as observers ministers or members of non-Catholic churches or ecclesial communities. 44 See '17 CIC, cc. 282; 285-286. 45 cc. 445, 446. See cc. 455, 456.237 Ecclesial Conversion : Some Canonical Reflections constraints, which constraints raise questions in terms of concerns about decentralized governance. Before these corporate structures may promulgate legislation binding the faithful in the country or in the region, they must sub- mit it to the Holy See for its recognitio or review; and at times this may even entail the modi fication of such legislation. There may be various reasons for such a requirement, none of which is spelled out in the code. It may be to fos- ter communion with the Holy See, to ensure technical compliance of particular law with the universal law, to take cognizance of the supra-diocesan (national or provincial) implications of such legislation, or to protect the legitimate autonomy of the diocesan bishop. While there is much to be said for the legitimacy of the aforementioned observations, one might also raise the question Francis has posed about the possible excessive centralization of church governance in this context. 47 Perhaps the Latin code might imitate its Eastern counterpart and require only that the Holy See normally be simply informed of council decisions as is true for decrees of patriarchal synods and councils of hierarchs. 48 If the Holy See had some concerns in a given instance, it could address them with the perti- nent bishops. Episcopal Conferences 49 a)Preliminary notes Such conferences are the key focus of this part of the article given their preeminent public ecclesial position. Unlike particular councils, which go back to the earliest days of the Church, conferences are relatively recent phenomena arising in Western Europe in the nineteenth cen- tury when groups of bishops perceived the need to address pastoral-disciplinary issues nationally. 50 While not regulating such episcopal gatherings in any detail, the former code encouraged consultative sessions of provincial bishops to prepare for future provincial councils. 51 Not surprisingly, given productive experiences of such gatherings during the twentieth century, groups of bishops met together during Vatican II and in fluenced the drafting of Christus Dominus 37-38. These paragraphs expressed a basic juridical pro file of episcopal conferences and 47 See EG 16. 48 See CCEO 111 \u00a73; 167 \u00a72. 49 See EG 16. 50 For re flections on the varied Roman reactions to such gatherings, see J. Provost, \"Particu- lar Councils\" , The New Code of Canon Law , ed. Michel Theriault and Jean Thorn. 2 vols. (Ottawa: St. Paul University, 1986)1: 537-561. 51 CIC 17, 292.238 Green speci fied their legislative competency. 52 Furthermore, Lumen gentium 23 stated that, like the ancient patriarchal churches that facilitated joint episco- pal action, episcopal conferences today could pursue the same goals and enhance the concrete realization of collegiality. Conferences such as the United States conference have experienced certain problems, especially in relationships with the Holy See; e.g., in seeking approval of liturgical transla- tions and in the drafting of pastoral statements on peace, women, and the economy. 53 Despite such ongoing problems, such conferences have been espe- cially signi ficant post-conciliar structures, contributing to the shaping of particular law and thereby fostering ecclesial reform. 54 During the Latin code drafting process, canonists di ffered about the episco- pal conference's theological status, its doctrinal and disciplinary role, and its relationship to the Holy See and diocesan bishops among others. Its status (especially legislative) was gradually restricted; e.g., in areas of catechetics and finance. Apostolos Suos , the pertinent May 1998 motu proprio of John Paul II,55 reinforced the restrictions on the conference's governance role. He indicated that the conference expresses primarily the bishops' collegial spirit ( affectus collegialis ), but he did not speak in detail in terms of their acting collegially in shaping ecclesial decisions (effectus collegialis) . In motu proprio states that they re flect collegiality only improperly in contrast to ecumenical coun- cils or, to a certain extent, particular councils. We will now brie fly consider key canonical dimensions of the episcopal conference. b)Nature and Purpose 56 By contrast to particular councils, occasional eccle- sial events, conferences are permanent institutions which meet regularly, have an organizational structure, 57 and, hence, may foster ecclesial reform more effectively than such councils. The code views conferences as essentially pas- toral vehicles with limited governmental competencies. The conferences are to share episcopal insights and experiences, thereby deepening ecclesial commu- nion even while somewhat limiting the autonomy of diocesan bishops. 52 See Paul VI motu proprio Ecclesiae sanctae requiring infra-national, or supra-national (c. 448). 53 In this latter connection see E. Du ffy, \"Episcopal Conferences in the Context of Commu- nion: Some Notes on the American Experience\" , The Jurist 64 (2004), 137-167. 54 See 2009). See AAS 90 (1998), 641-658. 56 See c. 447. 57 See, for example, cc. 457-458.239 Ecclesial Conversion : Some Canonical Reflections Whatever the theological-juridical disputes about conferences, the intrinsi- cally collegial nature of the episcopal o ffice seems ultimately to ground the conference theologically; it practically fosters various apostolic initiatives facilitating ecclesial communion. 58 c)Membership 59 Two basic criteria ground membership in this exclusively episcopal body: episcopal consecration and diocesan leadership. The latter fac- tor a ffects voting rights. All bishops in a territory are conference members, yet only diocesan bishops and their equivalents 60 enjoy a deliberative compe- tency. Other bishops have a deliberative or consultative status depending on conference statutes, regarding for which they may not vote. The conference is basically a Latin church reality, but ordinaries of other rites may attend confer- ence sessions with their status determined by the statutes. d)Authority (Legislative) 61 The conference's legislative authority represents somewhat of a compromise respecting the superior governmental authority of the pope/ Holy See and the diocesan bishop. Two thirds of those bishops with a deliberative vote (not just those at the plenary session or a simple majority vote 62 (c. 119, 2 ) must approve a particular provision. Furthermore, unlike the broad competency of particular councils, the conference may legislate only if the code, 63 or a Holy See mandate, 64 explicitly empowers it to do so. The con- ference may not promulgate its laws without a Holy See recognitio or at times approbatio. Moreover, and somewhat questionably, at times proposed confer- ence legislation is altered during these processes. 65 e)Possible Canonical Changes Some canonists have expressed concerns about post-conciliar developments impairing the ability of conferences to evangelize various cultures and to exercise more e ffectively the threefold 58 For a thoughtful examination of the theological-juridical status of conferences and a critical appraisal of Apostolos suos , see L. Orsy, \"Episcopal Conferences and the Power of the Spirit\" , The Jurist 59 (1999), 409-431 (Orsy, Conferences). 59 See cc. 449-450, 454. 60 See c. 381 \u00a72. 61 See cc. 455-456. 62 See c. 119, 2*. 63 For example, see c. 1126 on mixed marriage guarantees articulated by the Catholic party. 64 For example, see USCCB Essential Norms on sexual abuse cases. 65 See discussion of problems in recognitio process during aforementioned particular coun- cil discussion.240 Green munera of Christ, especially governance. 66 Furthermore, the conciliar expecta- tion of a richer conference collegial experience ( LG 23) has not been fully realized in the absence of a juridical pro file of such conferences viewing them as subjects of speci fic disciplinary attributions. 67 Interestingly enough, for Francis recently 68 and for others, excessive centralization complicates the Church's life, its missionary outreach, and its reform e fforts. Therefore we need broader conference legislative options to respond to various pastoral chal- lenges. For example, by contrast, Eastern synods have much broader particular law options and a less restrictive recognitio system - a very legitimate imple- mentation of the of subsidiarity. 69 Diocesan level: Diocesan Synod 70 a)Introduction Particular churches are called to missionary conversion in diverse socio-cultural settings; the bishop has a key role in engaging various diocesan and parish participative structures in achieving such goals. 71 Historically, the diocesan synod has been an ancient diocesan institu- tion engaging in ecclesial discernment and policy-setting; usually involving the bishop and his clerics. Such synods have experienced periods of growth, especially after higher level reform councils, as well as periods of decline. Surprisingly Vatican II and Ecclesiae sanctae said relatively little about such synods even while encouraging structures of communion. However, there has been some post-conciliar activity in various dioceses. The 1983 code somewhat reworked the 1917 code, 72 particularly broadening synod membership beyond clerics, leaving its convocation to episcopal discretion, after consultation with the presbyteral council, and envisioning possible ecumenical observ- 66 In this connection see Th. Green, \"The Legislative Competency of the Episcopal Confer- ence: Present Situation and Future Possibilities\" Consola- 93-98. See also Orsy, Conferences. passim. 67 In this context 'attributions' means various areas where conference policy governs usually a whole nation, e.g., ministerial formation, clerical personnel policy, sacramental disci- pline, etc. 68 EG 32. 69 For example, 110 \u00a71; 150 \u00a72, \u00a73. 70 fn. 50) See EG 34. 72 See '17 CIC, 356-362.241 Ecclesial Conversion : Some Canonical Reflections ers. However, only a 1997 dual dicastery instruction addressed synod issues in detail. 73 b)Nature/purpose 74 The synod is primarily an act of episcopal legislative governance although it may undertake other activities such as diocesan pasto- ral planning. It is also an event of ecclesial communion bringing together clergy, religious, and laity to assist the bishop in articulating a diocesan pasto- ral vision in the Spirit. 75 Such a signi ficant vehicle of dialogue and reform would ideally meet occasionally in contrast to regularly functioning vehicles of participation such as the presbyteral council 76 Probably due to the non-observance of the former law requiring synods every decade, the code leaves its convocation up to the diocesan bishop. However, the synod would seem to be a more e ffective vehicle of ecclesial reform were it to meet more regularly, even given the notable investment of time, energy, and resources it requires. The bishop's relationship to the synod is paradigmatic for his rapport with other diocesan participative structures; e.g., their convocation, preparation, celebration, and finalizing of provisions, doctrinal or disciplinary. Accordingly, our synodal re flections here may be relevant to other less formal diocesan decisional processes; e.g., task forces, ad hoc committees, etc. c)Membership 77 A diversi fied synodal assembly re flecting various spiritual insights and experiences can well serve the diocese's pastoral good. The syn- od's tripartite structure includes obligatory (chie fly clerics such as bishops, vicars, and representative presbyters) and facultative (mixed group) members and possibly observers from other churches or ecclesial communities - which is indispensable in fostering mutual charity, understanding, and possible col- laboration. The code is silent about non-Christian observers, but an increasing sensitivity to interreligious issues, especially involving Jews and Muslims, sug- gests the wisdom of such participation especially in certain ecclesial settings. 73 See Congregation for Bishops and Evangelization of Peoples, instruction on diocesan syn- ods, July 8, 1987: Origins 27/19 (October 23, 1997), 324-331 (Instruction). 74 See c. 460; Instruction 1. 75 See Renken, Participative Bodies, 215; on the doxological, kerygmatic, and pneumatologi- cal dimensions of the synod, see Eugene Du ffy, \"Processes for Communal Discernment: Diocesan Synods and Assemblies\" 71 See cc. 495-501. 77 See c. 463; Instruction II.242 Green d)Competency 78 The bishop's exclusive legislative governance role is exer- cised within a broad ecclesial context. The synod's diversi fied membership should enable him to tap various levels of expertise, which is indispensable for serious ecclesial reform and a judicious addressing of complex pastoral issues. Yet such synod members need to be provided with appropriate resources to achieve the synod's purposes. The bishop alone exercises a deliberative role and the synod functions in a consultative fashion, which, however, should not be underestimated. For the synod is not just a legislative institution but a spiritual experience engaging the diocesan church in exploring pressing issues of identity and mission. Interestingly enough, unlike the prior corporate structures we considered, no Roman intervention is necessary in monitoring the synod's declarations (doctrinal statements) or decrees (legal determinations). Such documentation is to be forwarded to the metropolitan and the conference to foster ecclesial communion and share ecclesial reform ideas and experiences. Yet the bishop's divine law governance status gives him and his diocese a somewhat greater autonomy in this regard than ecclesiastical law entities such as particular councils and episcopal conferences. Hopefully the preceding re flections on ecclesial reform and various corporate decisional structures will prompt the readers of this Festschrift to consider the canonical possibilities in shaping ecclesial life in positive directions. Hopefully a deeper understanding of the dynamics of such institutional development will enable the Church more e ffectively to foster the ecclesial reform to which Henk Witte has devoted so much time and energy.

The Holy Spirit's Activities According to Lumen Gentium Jos Moons Modern and contemporary theologians with an interest in the Holy Spirit like Yves Congar and Walter Kasper have expressed their appreciation of the eccle- siology of Vatican II for its pneumatological renewal. 1 In 2002, Walter Kasper spoke of a \"new departure [for ecclesiology] through Vatican II\" , explaining that the conciliar attention to the Holy Spirit corrected a one-sided Christocentric ecclesiology. 2 Two decades earlier, in 1981, Yves Congar too had claimed that the Council 'has begun to restore to us ( rendre ) dimen- sion of the Church'. According to Congar, this restoration manifested itself in the acceptance of charismas, the theology of the local Church, re flection on ministry and sensus fidei, and the acknowledgement of the Spirit's activity in the world. 3 Since the Council, many of these topics have been delved into, both by exploring the Council and by re flecting upon its theological intuitions. Yet the conciliar pneumatology and its renewal has yet to be explored in a fundamental way. For how does the Council (re)imagine the Holy Spirit? What is, for example, the relationship of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son? Or, what activities are attributed to the Holy Spirit? And, how does the Vatican II imagine these aspects in a renewed perspective?

There are sixteen documents. Further, many aspects could be delved into, for example formal aspects such as the number of references, substantial aspects such as the activities of the Spirit and addressees, or Trinitarian aspects such as the relationship between the Spirit and the Father and the Son. In addition there are at least three possible hermeneutical approaches, focusing on context, content or reception of the text. 5 For practical reasons of time and space this article focuses on one docu- ment, Lumen gentium , and on one aspect of conciliar pneumatology, the activities linked to the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, the article only uses text- focused and theological-historical hermeneutics. First, I will explore what activities are linked to the Holy Spirit in the text of Lumen gentium . Secondly, as pneumatological renewal can only be explored by comparison, I will explore the pneumatology of the 1943 ecclesiological encyclical on the mystical body, Mystici corporis . Thirdly, I will compare the two documents. How does Lumen gentium differ from the 1943 encyclical and what does its pneumatological renewal consist of? In the conclusion, I will evaluate my findings with the help of the notion of (theological) conversion. 1 The Holy Spirit's Activities in Lumen Gentium Before exploring what activities Lumen gentium links to the Holy Spirit, three preliminary issues need to be addressed. A first and fundamental preliminary remark has to do with the primary objective of the constitution. Its aim was not to present a pneumatology, but to be a Dogmatic Constitution on the 4 Cf. P. Mullins, The Teaching of Lumen gentium on the Holy Spirit (Rome: PUG , 1990); this is still an important work. Cf. also S. Vance-Trembath's thesis, The Pneumatology of Vatican II: With Particular Reference to Lumen gentium Gaudium et spes (K\u00f6ln: Lambert Academic Publishing, 2009); Vance-Trembath promises more in her title than what she actually realises in her work, a minor part of which is consecrated to conciliar documents themselves. 5 Cf. O. Rush, Still Interpreting Vatican II: Some Hermeneutical Principles (New York: Paulist Press, 2004). Rush distinguishes three types of hermeneutics, focused on history and the author, on the text itself, and on the receiver. The first of these may be further divided into theological- historical and redaction-historical explorations.246 Moons Church. In my discussion of Lumen gentium 's pneumatology, I will assume a basic understanding of its ecclesiological context. 6 A second consideration is more practical. Explorations of Lumen gentium 's pneumatology commonly start from the observation that the constitution contains some ninety references to the Holy Spirit. 7 However, one reference may lead to various statements in which various activities are speci fied. For example, Lumen gentium 4 stated that \"the Spirit dwells in the Church and in the hearts of the faithful ... and prays in them on their behalf\". This single refer- ence contains in fact two statements, both of which I will investigate. 8 Finally, I will limit myself to a consideration of those pneumatological state- ments in which an active involvement of the Spirit is touched upon. This is not without importance, since Lumen gentium links the Holy Spirit to activi- ties in three di fferent ways: as actively involved, as passively involved and as involved in an unspeci fied manner. For example, when article 4 states that \"the Spirit guides [the Church] in the way of all truth\" , 9 the Spirit is described as actively involved. By contrast, the Spirit may also be described as passively involved, as the object of another subject. For instance, there is a double pas- 6 An in depth exploration is beyond the scope of this article. For some basics, see G. Philips, \"Die the third draft, see AS III/1, 334-335. According to Philips, LG's main architect, LG offers a synthetic ecclesiology with a coherent '4x2' structure. 7 Anne Marie Aagaard counts 91 references, because she includes the reference to the Spirit in the document's concluding formula (common to all documents) that 'Each and all these items which are set forth in this dogmatic Constitution have met with the approval of the Council fathers. And we by the apostolic power given us by Christ together with the venerable fathers in the Holy Spirit, approve, decree and establish it and command that what has thus been decided in the Council be promulgated for the glory of God'. Her article includes a list of these references, see A.M. Aagaard, With its 90 (or 91) references to the Spirit, LG is the document with the highest number of such references. According to Aagaard, the Council as a whole counts 263 (or 279) references, see the list on p.60. 8 Additional statements may also be contained in short relative clauses. For example, LG 21's statement that 'the apostles are gifted with a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit, coming e ffusione supervenientis Spiritus ) makes three statement on the Spirit, namely that the apostles are enriched with the Spirit, who is poured out ( effusione ), and who comes over the apostles ( superveniens ). 9 Quotations are from the o fficial translation on the website of the Vatican.247 The Holy Spirit 's Activities According to Lumen Gentium sive involvement in Lumen gentium 5, where it states that Christ \"poured out on His disciples the Spirit promised by the Father\". In other cases, Lumen gen- tium does not explicate in what manner the Spirit is involved, such as in the statement that \"these [local churches] are the new people called by God, in the Holy Spirit and in much fullness\" ( LG 26). An exploration of Lumen gentium within these limitations reveals that it relates the Spirit to a range of activities. Seven such activities are mentioned three times or more: to sanctify, to vivify, to bring truth, to unify, to give gifts and charismas, to move, and to work in Mary. I will enumerate them brie fly here: First, the Holy Spirit is proposed as the agent of sancti fication in Lumen gentium 4, 12 and 15, viz. in relation to the Church in general, to the hierarchy and to other catholic faithful as well as non-Catholic Christians. Article four states that \"the Holy Spirit was sent on the day of Pentecost in order that He might continually sanctify the Church\". 10 More implicitly, the Holy Spirit is also said to sanctify in Lumen gentium 39, 40, and 41, e.g. when it is claimed that \"one sanctity is cultivated by all who are moved by the Spirit of God\" ( LG 41). Next, the constitution attributes the quality of life-giving ( vivificare ) on numerous occasions ( LG 7, 8, 13 and 48). According to Lumen gentium 7, the Spirit \"gives life to, uni fies and moves the whole body [of the Church]\" , in view of the spiritual renewal in Christ. 11 Moreover, article four de fines the Holy Spirit as the 'Spirit of life' , specifying that it is the Father who gives life through the Spirit ( per quem ) \"[t]o men, dead in sin, the Father gives life through Him, until, in Christ, He brings to life their mortal bodies\". In a third instance, the Spirit is related to truth in Lumen gentium 4, 12, 25 and 53, e.g. in the statement that \"the Spirit guides [the Church] in the ( in omnem veritatem inducit , LG 4). His role is further speci fied e.g. as arousing the sense of faith in the faithful and assisting Peter to speak infallibly. For example, according to article twelve, \"the entire body of the faithful, anointed as they are by the Holy One [the Holy Spirit], cannot err in matters of belief. (...) Th[eir] discernment in matters of faith is aroused and sustained by the Spirit of truth\". 12 10 According to LG 12, the Holy Spirit 'sancti fies and leads and enriches with virtues' not only through the hierarchy, but also through charismas. According to LG 15, the Holy Spirit works 'with His sanctifying power' in non-Catholic Christians. 11 LG 8 succinctly states 'the visible social structure of the Church serve[s] the Spirit of Christ, who vivi fies it ( eam vivi ficanti ), in the building up of the body'. In LG 13, the creed's formula Dominum et Vivi ficantem is quoted, and in LG 48, Christ is said to have sent his 'life giving Spirit' ( vivificantem ), and constituted the mystical body through the Church. 12 According to LG 25, the Spirit - promised to Peter - assists him, so that he speaks infallibly (assistentia Spiritus ); moreover, the Spirit's actio ensures that the Church always agrees 248 Moons Fourth, the Spirit is said to bring unity in article 4 and twice in article 7. Lumen gentium 4 includes in its list of Spirit-related activities that the Spirit \"uni fies the Church in communion and works of ministry\" , and article 7 speci- fies that the Spirit fies, uni fies and moves the whole [mystical] body\". The latter article further speaks of the 'one' Spirit when stating that \"it is one Spirit who divides his gifts\" and Lumen gentium 13 refers to the Spirit as \"the principle of congregation and unity\". 13 Moreover, the Spirit is described as indirectly involved in realising unity in articles 15, 25, 32 and 41, e.g. in the statement that \"[i]n all of Christ's disciples the Spirit arouses the desire to be peacefully united\" ( LG 15).14 Fifth, the Spirit is said to give hierarchical and charismatic gifts and through them he leads and guides the Church ( LG 4, 7 and 12). In article 12 Lumen gen- tium famously states that \"it is not only through the sacraments and the ministries of the Church that the Holy Spirit sancti fies and leads the people of God and enriches it with virtues, but ... He distributes special graces among the faithful of every rank\"; these graces are called charismas later in the same section. 15 the hierarchy's de truth ( praelucente Spiritu veritatis ). Finally, the Church is said to 'be taught by the Holy Spirit' to honour Mary, LG 53. 13 LG 7 also mentions 'unifying the body' ( corpus uni ficans ). 14 According to LG 15 the Spirit preserves unity amongst all Christians by raising the desire that all 'be united' in one fold, under one shepherd. LG 25 speaks of the action of the Spirit, by which the unity of the faith is preserved. In LG 32, the discussion on unity amongst diversity of gifts and ministries is concluded with the statement that 'one and the same Spirit works all this'. In LG 41, the unity of holiness ( una sanctitas ) is linked to the Spirit ( variis vitae generibus et o fficiis qui a Spiritu Dei ). Cf. LG 49, in which 'having the Spirit' is linked to 'grow into one Church'. 15 LG 4 states that the Spirit \"both equips and directs ( instruit and dirigit ) [the with hierarchical and charismatic gifts\". See LG 7, \"according to His own richness and the needs of the ministries, [the Spirit] gives His di fferent gifts for the welfare of the Church. What has a special place among these gifts is the grace of the apostles to whose authority the Spirit Himself subjects even those who were endowed with charisms\". Cf. the gift-related statement in LG 15: the Holy Spirit is said to work \"with his sanctifying power, through gifts and graces\" in all Christ's disciples; cf. the ministries-related statement in LG 32: the Spirit is said to be the guarantee of the unity of graces and ministries. Cf. also two state- ments on the Spirit who leads. According to LG 4, the Spirit leads the Church into full unity with Christ ( ad consummatam cum Sponos suo unionem perducit ), and according to LG 43 the hierarchy oversees the religious life under the lead of the Spirit ( duce Spiritu Sancto ).249 The Holy Spirit 's Activities According to Lumen Gentium Sixth, the Spirit is understood as moving people and moving the Church, e.g. in the statement that \"[the Spirit] vivi fies, LG 7). Lumen gentium 14 states, in a sub-clause, that the Spirit moves catechumens and thus helps them to \"seek with explicit intention to be incorporated into the Church\". Finally, Lumen gentium 40 claims that \"Christ sent the Holy Spirit upon all that He might move them inwardly to love God (...) and each other (...)\". Then, in the Mariological chapter of the constitution, the Holy Spirit is said to form Mary into a new creation, and to have overshad- owed Mary ( LG 56, 59 and 63), for example in the statement in which the Church fathers called Mary \"holy and free from all stain of sin, as though fash- ioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a new creature\" ( LG 56). Other activities, finally, mentioned once or twice, include activities such as indwelling and tes- tifying to divine sonship, rejuvenating the Church, compelling the Church to cooperate with God's design, guiding the apostles, and rendering eschatologi- cal gifts. The question that then arises after this enumeration is: what is the signi fi- cance of these facts? These data indicate at least that Lumen gentium conceives the Spirit as involved in the Church both in a concrete and a diversi fied man- ner. The concrete nature of the Spirit's involvement is apparent from the fact that the dogmatic constitution articulates speci fic activities. The Spirit is not in general \"the soul of the Church\" , but rather He brings forth very concrete actions: He sancti fies, gives life, moves, and so on. This diversi fication of pneu- matological activities is apparent from the fact that there is not just one single activity, but seven. And, when studying these passages, the Spirit's activities are interrelated, yet none is deemed more important than the others. This result already implies a critique of Patrick Mullins's claim that the Spirit's mis- sion to \"continually Church\" constitutes the unique core of LG's pneumatology. 16 Rather, one ought to accept that Lumen gentium 's pneumatol- ogy is multifaceted. 16 Cf. the subtitle of the thesis ''The Holy Spirit was Sent at Pentecost in Order that He Might Continually Sanctify the Church\". See Mullins, The Teachings of LG on the Holy Spirit , e.g. 168, 172-176, 186, 379. Cf. the Commentarius in AS II/1, 229-230. For although the section's De Spiritu Ecclesiam sancti ficante has a wider range, \"The Son's Spirit is sent to complete his [the Son's] work, by inwardly vivifying the Church, and by directing and renewing her through various min- istries and gifts, until He leads her to her final beatitude\".250 Moons 2 The Holy Spirit's Activities in Mystici Corporis In order to comprehend the particularity of Lumen gentium 's pneumatology, a step backwards may o ffer fruitful insights. Some twenty years before Lumen gentium , Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical on the Church as the mystical body of Christ, Mystici corporis (MC).17 Although the encyclical did not exclusively deal with ecclesiology but also included the more spiritual topic of unity with Christ, the latter was always considered within the context of the Church as mystical body. For, as the title reads, the encyclical is devoted to the topic of 'The mystical body of Jesus Christ and Our unity with Christ in the Church (nostra in eo cum Christo coniunctio )'. Crucial for my contribution is the fact that Mystici corporis gave ample consideration to the Holy Spirit. 18 Before returning to the question as to which precise activities are linked to the Holy Spirit in the 1943 encyclical, four preliminary remarks are needed. For a start, Mystici corporis 's pneumatology, much like the conciliar constitution would be in 1964, was framed within an overall ecclesiological re flection. 19 Secondly, I will not focus on its 71 explicit references to the Spirit, but rather develop an interest in the 118 statements that are developed from these refer- ences. Thirdly, within this vast amount of pneumatological topoi, I will limit myself to those statements in which an active involvement of the Holy Spirit is speci fied. Finally, the o fficial edition of the encyclical does not contain section numbering. For practical reasons, I will refer to the section numbers added to the English translation on the Vatican website. 20 17 Sedis 35 (1943), 193-248. 18 Some contemporary commentaries noted that this was uncommon for mystical body the- ology and welcomed it with delight, see e.g. T. a ical appreciation of MC's pneumatology, J. Moons, \"The Spirit in pre-conciliar International Journal of Philosopy and 246-247. 19 The notes of Sebastiaan Tromp, who is acknowledged as Pius XII's ghost writer, are very helpful for further exploration. See S. Tromp, \"Annotationes\" , Periodica and 393-395. Cf. the encyclical's later edition with considerable clarifying notes and other additions, S. Tromp, Litterae encyclicae (Rome: PUG , 1958). textual editions add numbers, amongst which is Tromp's, but they all di ffer.251 The Holy Spirit 's Activities According to Lumen Gentium This said, I can now proceed with an in-depth analysis of the pneumatology of Mystici corporis. Although the encyclical uses a broad variety of terms and concepts to describe often similar actions of the Spirit, the following three types of activity can be distinguished. First and foremost, nine times the Spirit is said to work in various ways in the Church and in souls. For example, article 57 states that \"to the members [of the Church] He is present and assists ( adsistit ) them in proportion to their various duties and o ffices\" , and that \"it is He who, while He is personally pres- ent and divinely active in all the members, nevertheless in the inferior members acts ( operatur ) also through the ministry of the higher members\". 21 Similarly Lumen gentium 63 refers to the Spirit's operation ( operari ) when it claims that \"the Spirit of our Redeemer ... penetrates and fills every part of the Church's being and is active within it until the end of time ( perpetuo et intime Ecclesiam replet et in ea operatur ) as the source of every grace and every gift and every miraculous power\". On another nine occasions, the Spirit is said to act as both 'inspiring' and 'moving'. For example, the opening article of the encyclical claims that the Spirit moves people and invites them to contemplate the mystical body: \"this doctrine [of the mystical body] by its sublime dignity invites all those who are drawn by the Holy Spirit ( homines, quotquot spurred ( instigantur ) on by of the Holy Spirit (intimis suasionibus impulsionibusque ) to fear and are moved to ( exci- tantur ) prayer and penance for their sins\". 22 Furthermore, the Spirit is twice said to unify the Church, to o ffer gifts, to enable the Church to ful fil her mis- sion, and to complete the Church. Mentioned just once are the actions of helping the apostles at the start of their mission, making people into adoptive children of God, ensuring new growth in the Church, covertly leading the Church, and making people resemble Christ, as well as commanding people to 21 See MC 57 ( adsistit where Christ 'together with the Spirit' is said to give and ( See MC 76, where the Spirit is said to work in the soul ( ( Divini Spiritus actioni ), specifying that this action requires our action as well. 22 Further MC 4 speaks about the Spirit who stimulates so that people desire to seek the Kingdom of God ( desiderium, quo Divino Sancti instinctu ) the confession of venial sins.252 Moons Christ's life, making people lead holy lives and inspiring others to do the same, and pronouncing judgement on the leaders of the nations. A second range of pneumatological activities contains eight cases where the Spirit is de fined as a principle and source. For example, the Spirit-focused reflections in Mystici corporis 56 to 58 starts by saying that \"if we examine closely this divine principle of life and power given by Christ, insofar as it con- stitutes the very source of every gift and created grace, we easily perceive that it is nothing else than the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete\". Thus the Holy Spirit is more or less identi fied with \"this divine principle of life and power\" as well as with 'the source of every gift and created grace'. Similarly, article 57 describes the Holy Spirit in a sub-clause as \"the invisible principle [of the body of Christ]\" , and states that \"[to Him] is to be ascribed the fact that all the parts of the Body are joined one with the other and with their exalted Head\". The Spirit is thus described as a principle of unity. The encyclical further explains that \"it is He [the Spirit] who, through His heavenly breath of life, is the principle of every supernatural act ( parts of the Body\". Once more the Spirit is seen as a principle, this time of supernatural acts. 23 In three cases, the image of the source is alluded to by the verb that is being used, such as when Mystici corporis 12 explains that Christ, \"as the new Adam, might be the source whence the grace of the Holy Spirit should flow unto all the children of the first parent ( As an aside, I might remark that especially in these cases, Mystici corporis renders its statements in an indirect manner. For example, article 56 states that \"we easily perceive that this divine principle ... is the Holy Spirit\" instead of \"this divine principle is the Holy Spirit\". Similarly, the encyclical's subsequent article states that the joining of 23 Further, see MC 57 ( anima ). See MC 62, where MC 68 the Spirit is considered - together with the Father and the Son - as the 'most divine Spirit is called 'a source from which all supernatural power flows into the Church and her members' ( fontem, ex quo quo ) and MC 68, where the peoples are said to be able to work together for God's glory 'from the power' of the Spirit virtute, ... ). 24 Further, ) the Church. In MC 91 faithful) are said to be imbued ( perfundimur ) by the Spirit. Cf. MC 56, ' effusione '. Cf. MC 33, where the Spirit is said to be coming down without the image of water, to 'descend and remain upon Christ' ( descendentem manentemque super eum ).253 The Holy Spirit 's Activities According to Lumen Gentium the members of the mystical body should be \"ascribed to ( attribuendum )\" the Holy Spirit rather than that \"the Holy Spirit joins the members\". 25 A third group of activities, according to Pius XII's encyclical, consists of the Spirit's indwelling and presence in Christ ( five times) and in the faithful (six times). For example, article 56 includes in its list of the Spirit's activities that \"this Spirit delights to dwell in the beloved soul of our Redeemer as in His most cherished shrine\". Similarly article 57 indicates that the Spirit is \"entire in the Head, entire in the Body, and entire in each of the members ( totus in Capite cum sit etc )\" and that \"He is personally present (...) in all members ( per se in omnibus membris habeatur )\".26 Once again, the question arises as to what signi ficance these facts may have. What do they communicate about the activities of the Holy Spirit? For a start, they reveal that Mystici corporis already considered the Holy Spirit from a mul- titude of angles. In this case however, a clear stress was laid on his role as ultimate principle or soul, and as an indwelling presence. Further, the pneu- matological activities portrayed in the encyclical remain strikingly abstract and unspeci fied, so that the Spirit's concrete impact is a bit unclear. One may ask what the, admittedly very fundamental, description of the Holy Spirit as \"principle of unity\" signi fies in concrete terms? Does the Holy Spirit bring about unity? And if so, why does the encyclical refrain from explicitly stating this? So, one is left with a somewhat ambiguous picture. Let me then enter into a comparison of the pre-conciliar and conciliar way of dealing with the Spirit's activities. 3 A Renewed Concept of the Holy Spirit? While exploring Vatican II's alleged rediscovery of the Holy Spirit, I have brie fly listed the activities linked to the Holy Spirit in both Lumen gentium and in Mystici corporis . A comparison of these results may reveal a more nuanced 25 Seven statements are indirect statements. See MC 56, ' facile ... fitiari potest '. 26 For Christ, see also MC 31, where Christ is said to have 'adorned' ( ornavit ) his human nature with the Holy Spirit to make it a suitable instrument for redemption. MC 33 (descen dentem manentemque super in eo Spiritus habitat ); MC 57, where the Spirit is said to be ' totus in Capite ..., totus in Corpore, totus 57 praesens est ; praesentiam speci fies that the Spirit does not dwell in those who do not belong to the Church.254 Moons comprehension of Vatican II's pneumatological preferences. For a start, it is important to note that the di fference between the two documents is not pri- marily a quantitative one. While Lumen gentium has 156 Spirit-statements dispersed over a total sum of 17,500 words (the Nota explicativa praevia excluded), i.e. 8.9 per 1000 words, the encyclical of Pius XII holds a total of 118 Spirit-statements in 15,500 words, which o ffers a rather similar rate of 7.5 words per 1000. Other than a numerical approach, a qualitative comparison does reveal two major di fferences related to the various types of activities and to the articula- tion of the Spirit's active involvement. First, whereas the conciliar constitution lists a wide variety of activities, the encyclical mainly conceives the Holy Spirit as acting as principle or source and as indwelling. These categories link up with Yves Congar's claim that pre-conciliar pneumatology idiomatically considered the Holy Spirit in its relation to the Church's hierarchy and to indwelling 27 - although one should admit that the extensive re flection on the Holy Spirit as principle of grace in articles 56 to 58 does not fall into either category. The sec- ond di fference lies in the fact that Lumen gentium articulates the Spirit's acti vities concrete manner than Mystici corporis . This latter insight is the basis for my further re flections here. The claim that conciliar pneumatology is developed in a more concrete fashion than it was in the teachings of Pius XII can be substantiated in two ways. First, where Mystici corporis uses nouns to articulate the Spirit's involve- ment, gentium opts for the use of verbs. For example: while both documents link the Spirit to the notion of holiness, the conciliar constitution speaks of sancti ficare (LG 4, 12) and of 'sanctifying power' ( LG 15) where the encyclical rather described the Spirit - together with the Father and the Son - as the source ( fons ) of \"the continual sanctifying of the members of the Body\". The latter description may be fundamental, but it altogether distances itself from exactly de fining the Spirit's active involvement. Similarly, where Lumen gentium describes the Spirit as life-giving ( vivificans , LG 7, 8, 13 and 48) or as 'the Spirit of life' ( LG 4), a phrase such as the one in Mystici corporis 56 described the Spirit's involvement in a much more abstract manner, namely as \"this divine principle of life and power given by Christ\". Another indication that the conciliar constitution has a more speci fic pneu- matology lies in its tendency to specify the context of the Spirit's activities, defining both the Spirit's relatedness to those in whom he acts, and his manner 27 Cf. Y. Congar, Je crois en l'Esprit Saint , vol. 1 (Paris: Cerf, 1979), 215-216. For further study of the matter, see E. Groppe, Yves Congar's Theology of the Holy Spirit (Oxford: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 2004).255 The Holy Spirit 's Activities According to Lumen Gentium of exercising activity. For example, when articles 9 and 15 of Lumen gentium describe the Spirit's activity (using both the substantive and verbal forms actio and operare ), the dogmatic constitution also speci fies the context of pneuma- tological activity. Article 9 states that the Church renews herself \"under the action of the Holy Spirit\" , thus linking actio with ecclesial renewal. Similarly, article 15 claims that the Spirit operates through his sanctifying power in non- Catholic Christians. Thus the general idea of operare is concretized in an ecumenical sense and direction, imbedding the Spirit within a model of eccle- siological inclusivism. 28 Mystici corporis , abstract and signi ficantly less outspo- ken about the context of the Spirit's work. An exception to this rule is found in section 87, where Pius XII stated that \"the heavenly Spirit does not e ffect operari non vult ) unless contribute their daily share of zealous activity\". Here the general term operari was in fact linked to sanctifying and to the faithful, and it was even conditioned by the concrete religious commitment of the faithful. Also in article 57, de fining the Spirit as \"an invisible principle\" a link with unity is given, albeit not in the ecumenical sense it would gain at Vatican II. In most other cases however, the encyclical is far removed from contextually-framed pneumatology. In the same article 57, for instance, this is illustrated by a statement such as: [t]o the members [of the Church] He is present and assists them in pro- portion to their various duties and o ffices, and the greater or less degree of spiritual health which they enjoy. It is He who, through His heavenly breath of life, is ( est habendus ) the principle of ac reapse salutaris principium ) in all parts of the Body. It is He who, while He is personally present and divinely active in all the members, nevertheless in the inferior members acts also through the ministry of the higher members'. I quote these three sentences in their entirety, since they over flow with pneu- matological references yet remain highly 'theoretical' and never quite de fine 28 LG uses the following words in the following context: operatur in LG 15 (the Spirit sancti- fies non-Catholic Christians), LG 19 (those hearing the gospel accept it because of the Spirit's work), LG 32 (unity and diversity in the Church: the Spirit works all these things), LG 44 (the Spirit's working in the Church is shown in the religious life); actio in LG 9 ('under the action of the Spirit' , the Church renews herself), LG 25 (because of the action of the Spirit, the Church's unity of the faith is preserved); agit in LG 50 (the unity with the heavenly Church is realized in liturgy, in which the Spirit 'acts' upon us); aguntur in LG 41 (those led by the Spirit strive for one holiness).256 Moons the concrete meaning of the fact that the Spirit is present in all, assists, and is a principium . In general, Mystici corporis leaves it unspeci fied what the Holy Spirit really does, and indeed concludes its re flection by summarizing the Spirit's activities as being the \"soul of the Church\". The same type of approach is found in Lumen gentium 63, where it is written that \"that which lifts the Society of Christians far above the whole natural order is the Spirit of our Redeemer who penetrates and fills every part of the Church's being and is active within it until the end of time as the source of every grace and every gift and every miraculous power\". Yet again, considered within the general framework of conciliar ecclesiol- ogy, Lumen gentium tends to o ffer more precise statements, for example where it deals with the Spirit's role in leading and guiding the Church. Rather than simply positing the factum of pneumatological guidance, it concretizes the fact that the Spirit directs the Church with or through \"hierarchical and charis- matic gifts\" ( LG 12). Further, by stating that Church authority has the duty, \"under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit ( duce Spiritu Sancto ), of interpreting these evangelical counsels\" , it makes clear whom the Spirit leads and what for. This stands in contrast to statements by Pius XII, who claimed that ( MC 69) \"the Divine Redeemer sent the Paraclete, the Spirit of truth, who in His name should govern the Church in an invisible way (arcanem sumeret gubernatio- nem ), so, in the same manner, He commissioned Peter and his successors to be His personal representatives on earth and to assume the visible government of the Christian community\". It is speci fied in relation to whom the Spirit works, namely the Church, but it is not speci fied how the Spirit undertakes this invis- ible leading role, or what for. Yet another example can be o ffered where both texts use the expression of \"the Spirit of truth\" , where one is struck by the fact that only in the council teaching is this expression speci fied through three concrete fields of action. The conciliar constitution on the Church clari fied that the Spirit arouses the sensus fidei (LG 12), enlightens the Church to keep the truth ( LG 25), and teaches the Church ( LG 53). 29 29 See MC 56 veritatis ). See LG 4, 'the Spirit leads the Church into all truth'; LG 12, the supernatural 'sense of the faith' ( sensus fidei) is aroused and sustained by the of truth'; LG 25, the 'Spirit of truth' enlightens the Church to keep the truth; LG 53, the Church is said to 'be taught by the Holy Spirit' to honour Mary.257 The Holy Spirit 's Activities According to Lumen Gentium 4 A Pneumatological Conversion? So, a comparison between Mystici corporis and Lumen gentium reveals that the latter document holds a signi ficantly more concrete view of the Spirit's active involvement in the Church and the world. This di fference is all but minor, and it points to an altogether di fferent imagining of the Holy Spirit. Thus, this pneumatological evolution may be linked with what Bernard Lonergan has called 'theological conversion'. Although the notion of conversion is primarily situated in the areas of faith and spirituality, it may be validly used in a theo- logical sense too. Lonergan explains that both theological oratio obliqua ) and communication ( oratio recta) are in need of conversion, that is: they require an openness to change and to being changed, to adopting new horizons and starting from new roots. Only such fundamental openness will enable one to interpret and understand what others have said and are saying, and to communicate it in a comprehensible manner. 30 Often, openness will require a change of course, or di fferently put: conversion. One is compelled to hear, interpret, understand and speak di fferently. The substantial evolution in the pneumatological utterances mentioned above of Pius XII and Vatican II suggest the occurrence of such a conversion in the magisterial discourse between the 1940s to the 1960s. In the analysis above we have detected its fruits, yet we do not know its roots yet. What then makes Lumen gentium imagine the Holy Spirit di fferently? In my opinion, the answer to that question lies first and foremost in the di fferent objectives of both mag- isterial texts. Clearly, the 1943 encyclical's objective was twofold: on the one hand it aimed at maintaining the institution-focused understanding of the Church as a social-juridical reality as had been traditionally done since the late nineteenth century, while on the other hand it sought to conceive the Church in a theological perspective. 31 Consequently, Mystici corporis developed Christ's relatedness to his Church in a twofold manner. It conceived Christ firstly as the transcendent head of the Church, from whom both the historical origin of the Church and its actual functioning depend. Next it developed the nature of the Church as a hierarchical organisation, in which Christ is present in a mediated 30 B. Lonergan, Method in Theology (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1971). See espe- cially pages 127-136, and of roots' , see 269 and 271. 31 For these objectives, see MC 9-10. A short and solid introduction into the topic of mystical body theology and MC's reception of it, see E. Hahnenberg, \"The Mystical Body of Christ and Communion Ecclesiology: Historical Parallels\" , Irish Theological Quarterly 70 (2005), 3-30, 6-13.258 Moons manner, through the hierarchy. Article 40 may serve as an example here, for it tried to reconcile the views that Christ leads the Church through the hierarchy (cf. MC 38) and that He does so directly by himself (cf MC 39). Doing so, the passage distinguishes between an ordinary, visible governing through Christ's vicar, and an extraordinary, hidden governance by Christ himself and thus reveals the consequence of its double objective and the way it is developed. The Christological impact of this type of thinking is important, since Christ is in fact 'banished' to the transcendent realm, where he invisibly governs the Church. His role in the concrete reality of the Church is a mere mediated role, through the catholic hierarchy. 32 The result is also that the encyclical's pneu- matology su ffered from this twofold orientation in Mystici corporis . In the first place, the Holy Spirit - much like Christ - was 'banished' from the centre of reflection. He may act as general 'principle' or 'soul' of the Church, but concrete implications are not drawn, to the e ffect of a pneumatological marginaliza- tion. 33 In addition, due to the encyclical's focus on the biblical metaphor of the body of Christ, the Holy Spirit is often conceived as secondary or at least remaining in the shadow of Christ. 34 By contrast, conciliar ecclesiology is much less focused on the institutional and structural nature of the Church. Rather Lumen gentium conceives the Church primarily from a sacramental and incarnational point of view and develops a deepened sense of the Church as mystery. The institutional aspect is imbedded in this broader perspective (as is clear from the internal order of chapters in the dogmatic constitution on the Church). 35 From the outset, the conciliar constitution stresses that there are not two Christ's, one identical with the hierarchy and one transcendent, but there is one Christ, the light of the people ( LG 1). The Church, including its concrete hierarchical aspect, depends on this light and is called to pass it on. This in itself constituted an 'ecclesiological conversion'. The result is that that Lumen gentium 's ecclesiol- ogy does not 'marginalize' Christ, but rather puts him at the centre. Strikingly, at Vatican II this Christocentric turn did not come about without including a renewed awareness of the Holy Spirit's role in the Church. This is illustrated at its best when one compares the pre-conciliar draft of the so- called Schema De ecclesia , which stood very close to the general theological 32 Cf. Hahnenberg's claim that the encyclical's theological (Christological) understanding of the Church in fact serves to justify prevailing, hierarchical structures, in his \"The Mystical Body of Christ and Communion Ecclesiology\" , 11-13. 33 Cf. the section on the Spirit as the soul of the Church in MC 60-66, especially MC 65. 34 Cf. the introduction of the Spirit-focused sections MC 56-58: an extensive re flection on Christ is followed by a short re flection on the Holy Spirit in which what has been said about Christ is now understood in pneumatological terms. 35 Cf. the short sketch of the connection between the eight chapters by G. Philips.259 The Holy Spirit 's Activities According to Lumen Gentium framework of Mystici corporis and upheld a binary theological introduction in which only the Father and the Son are mentioned, 36 with the renewed concil- iar schema on the Church that was accepted in 1963. This second draft now contained a pneumatological section which would ultimately end up be coming article 4 of Lumen gentium . The redaction history of the conciliar con stitu tion reveals more such evolutions, for instance the increase of pneumatological ref- erences in the chapter on eschatology from just one in the September 1964 version to eight in the October 1964 text. 37 All of this makes it clear that the conciliar debate on ecclesiology implied a rediscovery of the role of the Holy Spirit in ecclesiology. Di fferently put: the council's ecclesiological 'conversion' went hand in hand with a Christological and a pneumatological conversion. The departure from a pre-conciliar focus on the Church as perfect society, which implied a marginalization of both Christ and the Holy Spirit in ecclesio- logical discourse, explains why and how Vatican II contains a large number of pneumatological statement which are far more concrete on the Holy Spirit's involvement in the Church, and stretch out ecumenically beyond the con fines of the Roman Catholic Church. In the end, conclusions to all of this are at once moderate and quite real. The particularities mentioned above in Lumen gentium 's articulation of the Spirit's involvement in the Church do point to a new pneumatological orientation: other than in the 1940s Vatican II re-imagined the Spirit as having a concrete impact on Church life. Although this pneumatological conversion cannot be denied it does not stand on its own: Vatican II has developed an integrated pneumatology, and therefore the pneumatological conversion necessarily remains tentative and interrelated. It cannot be detached from Lumen genti- um's broader Christological and ecclesiological conversion. This, from the viewpoint of pneumatology, holds risks of its own. There are many indications that the Council's renewed pneumatological awareness remained limited, and that Vatican II's strong Christocentric focus has led to a relatively minor role for the Spirit. In the end, one might conclude that the pneumatological changes touched upon in my contribution are best interpreted as a first step toward further pneumatological conversion rather than representing a fully- fledged turnabout. 38 36 See AS I/4, 12-13. 37 For the old and new text, see AS III/5, 49-55.

In the paper which the Louvain professor Gustave Thils, on behalf of the Secretariat for Christian Unity ( SCUF ), wrote in 1 961 on De oecumenismo catholico et de opere conversionum , we notice how the guidance of converts no longer figures high on the list of priorities for the Catholic Church. Indeed, only one line is dedicated to the apostolate of conversions in the Decree of Ecumenism Unitatis redintegratio (UR 4). In the following chapter, we will unfold the reasons why and will end with a short re flection on two important moments in the reception history of the Council. 1 The Slow Transition from Apologetics to Ecumenism within the CCEQ (1952-1963) and the SCUF (1960-1962) The Catholic Conference for Ecumenical Questions One of the most important instruments for promoting a more ecumenical atti- tude in the Catholic Church in the decade before the opening of Vatican II was the Catholic Conference for Ecumenical Questions (CCEQ ). It was the result of an initiative to enhance the quality of the ecumenical re flection among the leading ecumenical centres in Europe by inviting them to participate in annual meetings. The instigators of this initiative were Frans Thijssen (1904-1990) and Johannes Willebrands (1909-2006), both of which were Dutch priests. Between 1952 and 1963, nine such meetings were organized, focusing either on ecumenical themes 1 or on themes related to the reform of Roman Catholic 1 The meetings of Utrecht (1953) and Mainz (1954) were meant to prepare a Catholic reaction on the theme of the Evanston assembly of the World Council of Churches, dealing with 'Christ - the Hope of the World'; and the one in Chevetogne (1957) on a theme proposed by the ecclesiology. 2 Its secretary, Willebrands, had in 1948 agreed to become the first president of the Sint Willibrord Vereniging , a society to promote ecumenical contacts in the Netherlands, which had come to replace its rather apologeti- cally oriented predecessor. 3 Especially during its first years, the work of the Catholic Conference still reflected a strong preoccupation with the goal of promoting conversions. 4 The constitution, written by Thijssen and approved during the opening meet- ing in Fribourg (1952), made a distinction between the 'apostolate of individual returns' and 'ecumenical work' , while acknowledging that the ultimate goal Division of Studies, 'The Lordship of Christ on the Church and on the World'. The meetings in Paderborn (1956) and Gazzada (1963) also focused on ecumenical themes and dealt with the relationship between mission and unity, and with the ecumenical situation at the time of the Council, respectively. 2 The conference of Paris (1955) focused on the images of the Church and the two meetings immediately preceding the Second Vatican Council dealt with 'Di fferences compatible with unity' (Gazzada, 1960) and 'Renewal in the Church' (Strasbourg, 1961). On the work of the Catholic Conference for Ecumenical Questions, see: M. Velati, Una Catholic Conference for Ecumenical Questions (1952-1963)\" , A. Denaux, P. De Mey (eds.), Johannes Willebrands and P. \"L'\u00e9volution th\u00e9ologique et cum\u00e9nique Theologica, 39) 7-39. Nieuwe visies Pers, 1998). In to the final meeting in 1963, \"Un aper\u00e7u et une Pays-Bas\" , Thijssen does not believe that the change of paradigm has been entirely successful: en servir pour notre propre correction. A cette fin le dialogue 2) VM, 2015), 83-114. 4 The evolution of Willebrands in this regard is similar to that of other hierarchs in the Catholic Church. Cf. R. Burigana, et de l'\u00c9glise de Montr\u00e9al au moment de Vatican II. I. Les premiers \u00e9branlements; II. L'engagement r\u00e9solu\" , Science et Esprit 52 (2000), 171-191; 293-319.265 Ecumenism and the Apostolate of Conversions remains the same: \"the case of individual returns only often appears to be less complicated than that of collective return\". 5 In his opening discourse, Father Willebrands also seemed to promote the work of conversions, referring to the case of Johannes Michael, a former German Protestant theologian: \"Conversion is the return of a person who lived only from one part of the revelation to the totality of the paradosis in order to live from now on in the plenitude of Christ\". 6 One year later, while being himself the host of the conference, as president of the Major Seminary of Warmond, he invited Coadiutor Bishop Alfrink to address the participants. The bishop focused especially on the importance of the apostolate of converting non-Catholics, which in his diocese resulted in 1000 conversions a year. 7 The reaction of Father Villain from Lyon is worth quoting in full: What a surprise and what a shock! \"We too, we are engaged in ecumen- ism,\" the Church hierarch mentioned right from the outset. But about which ecumenism did he speak? The answer came as from the second phrase. It pertained to converting Protestants, starting with their pastors, and the speaker exposed in great detail the di fferent methods of conver- sion which were used in the archdiocese. I was seated in between Father Congar and Father Dumont. At each new strophe we bowed our heads a bit more. Finally, my head touched my knees. 8 In the conclusion of Willebrands's opening speech during this conference, the speaker feels obliged to defend the ideal of ecumenism as R\u00fcckkehr in response to an objection made by the Dutch Reformed theologian Arnold van Ruler (1908-1970), who had stated: \"Rome wills ecumenically not a conversation, but submission and return to the only true Church\". 6. In this paper I make use, with thanks to my hosts, of the Fonds Willebrands (Monastery of Chevetogne), the Fonds De Smedt and the Fonds Philips (Centre for the Study of the Second Vatican Council, KUL euven), the Fonds Moeller and the Fonds Stransky (St. Paul's College, Washington DC). In the body of this chapter, I have translated quotations from other languages into English. 6 J. Willebrands, \"Introduction \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence transizione , 59.266 De Mey We want a conversation in complete freedom, we want submission and return in complete freedom, and only when the returning brother has in free conviction, and free choice, and in the light of faith, come to the insight that Rome is truly ecumenical; the pillar of truth which comprises everything and everyone. 9 The Secretariat for Christian Unity In the years before the Council, among the sta ff members and consultors of the Secretariat for Christian Unity, 10 there equally was no consensus upon the precise relationship between the goal of the apostolate of conversion and the work of ecumenism. According to Mauro Velati, we should not be surprised to still find astute defenders of conversion and return, since the return of the 'dis- sidents' to Rome had been a major goal during the ponti ficate of Pope Pius XII, fostered by unionist movements such as the Rome-based Foyer Unitas , and by religious congregations in the United States such as the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement, and the Paulist Fathers. 11 Cardinal Bea had even deliberately avoided using the term 'ecumenical' in the name of the new Secretariat, which at the outset was often translated in Italian as the secretariat 'per l'unione'. 12 During the first plenary meeting of the Secretariat in November 1960, ten sub-commissions were created that would prepare texts and vota on di fferent themes. The third sub-commission had to deal with the theme, De conversioni- bus individualibus et de conversione communitatum: Conditiones ponendae. When in August 1961 the number of sub-commissions was being enlarged to fifteen, the goal of the third sub-commission was rede fined: \"a) De oecumen- ismo Willebrands Chevetogne), 10. 10 For the full list and some background on each person, see: Velati, Dialogo e il concilio\"). A letter that the young Paulist Father Thomas Stransky sent to the Belgian Dominican J\u00e9r\u00f4me Hamer on February 20, 1961, is very reveal- ing in this regard: \"On the whole, I think our methods of attracting non-Catholics to take instruction are authentic and valid. (...) Much of this concern only for convert work is changing, but it still is by far the predominant one. Hence, the importance of showing: 1. exactly how ecumenism and direct convert-work di ffers from one another, yet harmo- nize in the general Mission of the Church. 2. how the laity should be instilled with a desire to bring individuals into the Church, as well as groups. 3. how authentic \"proselytism\" is not something to be shunned, but must be done\" (ibid., 30-31). 12 Ibid., 25.267 Ecumenism conditione of Davis Oscott College, Birmingham, Paulist Father James Cunningham (1901-1994), and Father Edward Francis Hanahoe (1913-1994) of the Franciscans of the Atonement. 14 In 1961, the group was enlarged - in an attempt by secretary Willebrands to achieve a better bal- ance among the ideological di fferences - with the Louvain professor Gustave Thils (1909-2000) and the German Oratorian Werner Becker (1904-1987). 15 Among the achievements of this sub-commission, I will only focus on Thils's report, De oecumenismo catholico et de opere conversionum (which, despite its Latin title, was written in French), and thereafter will brie fly remark upon Hanahoe's report, De modo unionis Protestantium . Both reports were presented during the fourth plenary meeting in August 1961. 16 Before speaking about ecumenism and its urgency, the Louvain theologian begins with a re flection on the term 'ecumenicity' which he understands as a form of 'universality' , even though he explained in the discussion of this text that he actually now preferred the term 'catholicity'. 17 Drawing on the approach to the catholicity of the Church in Congar's Chr\u00e9tiens d\u00e9sunis ,18 he finds it important that the 'quantitative' or 'geographic' dimension of univer- 13 Ibid., 97-98. 14 Ibid., 173. 15 Ibid., 511. 16 Even if Thijssen was asked by Willebrands to collaborate to the drafting I take the doc- \"De Oecumenismo Catholico et de opera to be largely the work of Thils. Cf. De Mey, 'Gustave Thils and Ecumenism at Vatican Council II' , in The Belgian Contribution to the Second Vatican Council. International Research Confer- ence at partim. 18 Y. Congar, Divided Christendom: A Catholic Study of the Problem of Reunion (London: G. Bles, 1939), 93-114. Congar distinguished 'quantitative' from and concludes that 'the very idea of catholicity involves the relation of diversity to unity and of unity to diversity' (ibid., 99) He then, however, made a distinction between 'catholicity' and 'ecumenism' which Thils (and probably Congar neither in the 1960s) will not repeat in exactly the same terms: \"Apart from the embodiment of unity there might be 'oecu- menism' , but not true catholicity. For catholicity is the taking of the many into an already existing oneness. Whereas what is to-day called 'oecumenism' is the introduction of a certain unitedness into an already existing diversity - oneness in multiplicity. (...) In other words, there may be, and there is, a non-Roman 'oecumenism' - there can indeed be no other. But there cannot be a 'non-Roman Catholicity'\".268 De Mey sality/catholicity is complemented by a 'qualitative' one that can function as a negative and as a positive criterion. In Thils's opinion, the Church \"is not bound to any particularism of rite, liturgy, theological form, disciplinary custom, etc.\" , but, positively formulated, \"she can perfectly integrate a plurality of rites, litur- gies, theological forms and disciplinary tradition\". 19 The Catholic Church should apply the same catholicity that she has learned to practise while being in full communion with the Eastern Catholic Churches, in her contacts with \"all the separated Christians\". She should, therefore, \"consider this plurality as a richness, a desirable value, a good to be pursued, in view of the full realisation of this form of universality which is ecumenicity\". 20 When re flecting on the nature of ecumenicity, Thils insists that this is the gift of Christ to his Church, yet it is also a gift 'susceptible to growth'. 21 Even if it is his conviction that the other Christian churches not only need to obey 'divine law' but also 'ecclesiastical law' , Acts 15:28 inspires him \"to legitimately ask whether, in order to remain faithful to the spirit of the apostles, one should not avoid imposing on the separated Christians what is not indispensable and to let them enter into the Lord's house with all their proper traditions, even if they were less perfect and developed in a way which is less appropriate\". 22 As a result, he is then ready to de fine ecumenism as \"all the e fforts that make effective the realisation of ecumenicity as well as all concrete examples of these e fforts: personal steps, common initiatives, works and studies, institu- tions and meetings and even movements and groups\". 23 The balance that Thils sees between, on the one hand, the work of ecumenism and, on the other, the apostolate of conversions, becomes clear when one observes that the latter is only treated at the end of his paper and comprises of only one page. A foot- note makes it clear that he prefers to speak about \"Ecumenism and the personal union with the Catholic Church\" and to avoid the term \"conversion, since, in this context, it is sometimes inadequate and often ambiguous\". 24 According to Thils, the Spirit sometimes moves people to unite themselves to the Catholic Church in her current shape, and others who - even while still remaining in their own communities - strive to enhance \"the ecumenicity of the Catholic Church, so that she can more clearly become the home of all their separated brethren\". He is convinced that, \"when Christians of the second group unite 19 Velati, Dialogo e rinnovamento , 543. 20 24 Ibid., 549.269 Ecumenism and the Apostolate of Conversions themselves personally to the Catholic Church, they represent for her a ferment of incomparable ecumenicity\". 25 Thils became a member of the Secretariat for Christian Unity after the founding General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, Willem-Adolf Visser t Hooft (1900-1985), had praised Histoire doctrinale du mouvement cum\u00e9nique , published in 1955. 26 The learning experience of his collaboration with the work of the Secretariat encouraged him to thoroughly revise this book for the 1963 second edition. The section on cum\u00e9nisme et conversions is entirely new 27 and explores the work of 'conversion' or 'incorpo- ration' - work that he deems legitimate and extremely valuable in a missionary context - and the work of 'ecumenism' , as two \"distinct, but not opposed activi- ties\". So he de fines these two works in the following way: There is 'incorporation' or 'conversion' 28 when 1) a Christian (or a group of Christians) passes over to the Catholic Church, 2) because he finds in this passage the concrete solution to a personal religious problem con- cerning the true way of eternal salvation, 3) without aiming directly or expressly at the exercise of any form of in fluence, either on the commu- nity from which he comes or on the Catholic Church into which he is incorporated (even if, as is evident, he always necessarily exercises a cer- tain degree of in fluence de facto). 29 There is 'ecumenism' when 1) a Catholic and a non-Roman Christian (or, again, a group of Catholics and a group of separated Christians) meet and engage in dialogue; 2) when they are in at least a certain way repre- sentative for their respective communities (be it through their 'Catholic' or 'Lutheran' way of life or through their theological knowledge, or by virtue of a delegation received by their ecclesiastical authorities); and thus 3) in view of knowing one another better and developing a higher 25 Ibid., 548. 28 Because 'conversion' seems to presuppose a moral necessity, it is, in Thils's opinion, \"sometimes used in such an inappropriate way that one can ask whether truth and equity do not require us to proscribe it as a common theological formula\" (ibid., 293). \"Incorpo- ration\" is maybe not the best alternative, since in Lumen gentium it will be used rather to describe how non-Catholic believers, through their baptism, also form part of the body of Christ. 29 Ibid., 292.270 De Mey esteem for one another, living together in a more agreeable way, collabo- rating and praying together when circumstances permit, re flecting together on the shape of their community and striving to make the doc- trinal equilibrium of their respective communities more clear and vital and its physiognomy more beautiful; 4) which will evidently result in something good for the union of Christians. 30 Finally, Thils gives a very nuanced answer about the goal of ecumenism, in which the abuse of ecumenism for apologetic purposes is clearly rejected: Can one say that the final goal of ecumenism is the unity of all Christians in the Catholic Church? No, if one understands by this that ecumenism is a tactical means to achieve the conversion of the interlocutor, by feign- ing encounters and dialogue. One must be fair and loyal. The ecumenist accomplishes a speci fic and valuable task, which is formally distinct from that of 'conversion'. Yes, if one wants to say that the final goal that Catholics envisage in all ecumenical endeavours, is the acceptance by all Christians of Catholic ecclesiology and, as a consequence, the union of all in the Catholic Church, but a Catholic Church with a new shape, as Vatican II made clear, i.e. with a vital new equilibrium, a new doctrinal equilibrium, a renewed physiognomy, in short: in the spiritual fullness of a catholicity that has been perfectly spread. 31 A quick glance at Father Hanahoe's report, De modo unionis Protestantium , makes it clear that the Secretariat for Christian Unity was not just composed of theologians with a great enthusiasm for ecumenism because Father Hanahoe does not even mention the term ecumenism one single time. He only speaks about \"reconciliation with the Catholic Church\" by individual Protestants or by 30 Ibid., 294. 31 Ibid., 296. The position of Thils is not much di fferent from the Votum de oecumenismi , submitted by Congar to the Theological Commission on October 27, 1961 (F. Philips 234). Cf. ibid., 5: \"Oecumenicus motus ad of Conversions groups of Protestants ( coetus Protestantium ).32 In fact, because private judge- ment in religious a ffairs is a great value in Protestantism, he cannot imagine a corporate union of Protestants with the Catholic Church otherwise than by way of \"individual conversion\". 33 The author also re flects on the validity and desirability ordaining married Protestant pastors for the diaconate or the priesthood after being received into the Catholic Church. In theory, there is no objection and it would also encourage Protestant pastors to convert if they were able to continue their pastoral ministry in some form. Father Hanahoe, however, also enumerates many practical di fficulties. 34 Whereas the exchange of views on the report prepared by Thils was a very peaceful one in which Cardinal Bea even repeated approvingly a key idea of the Louvain theologian, 35 Hanahoe received immediate strong criticism from Hamer: The work of conversions is a work to be pursued but, apart from the work of conversions, there is the work of ecumenism. (...) Ecumenism, as Prof. Thils has explained, is an aspect of the manifestation of the universality of the Church. If one may not forget conversions, one should also not forget ecumenism. 36 Maybe because of the immediate response by Hanahoe - \"these are di fferent activities, but they have the same goal\" 37 - Willebrands tried to conclude the debate in a reconciliatory mode: \"The work of conversions and the ecumenical work are complementary, but we need a profound study to precisely establish their relations\". 38 32 Velati, Dialogo une note essentielle de l'\u00c9glise\". 36 Ibid., 569.

The final draft was completed in July 1962 after taking into account the remarks that the Central Preparatory Commission had made. 39 The Coordinating Commission, however, decided that only drafts prepared by one of the conciliar commissions could be discussed in aula . At this point, the internal debate within the Secretariat concerning how to promote ecumenism without neglecting the work of conversions seems to have been 'solved'. Their draft makes no mention at all of separated Christians entering into commu- nion with the Catholic Church, but instead focuses on 'ecumenical' work. Most of the paragraphs of the later Chapter Two of the Decree on Ecumenism, deal- ing with 'The practice of ecumenism' , are here discussed in two paragraphs: one dealing with activities that can be exercised together with our separated brothers - dialogue, prayer, collaboration (\u00a7 3) - and the final paragraph that focuses on \"Particular activities within the Catholic community itself\". This concluding paragraph speci fically mentions \"the interior renewal of the Church, the need \"to manifest more fully the note of catholicity\" , and, in the end, it uses the term conversion in a di fferent sense: \"There is no true ecumen- ism without the conversion of the heart\" (\u00a7 4). The draft prepared by the Oriental Commission and entitled Ut omnes unum sint ,40 consists of 52 paragraphs. When it starts, as in article 11, to describe \"The works of the Church in view of the restoration of unity\" , the focus is on the work of ecumenism, not on the apostolate of conversions, but ecumen- ism clearly understood as the return to the Catholic Church. For this work 39 Ibid., 825. This document has been published in Acta et documenta concilii oecumenici Vaticana II apparando Praeparatoria (Vatican City, 1969-1995), vol. 4, 785-792. A very helpful study of all three documents, including a translation in French, is found in Christophe-Jean Dumont, \"La gen\u00e8se du d\u00e9cret Conversions \"supernatural means\" (art. 13-17) are necessary (such as prayers and inter- nal renewal), \"theological means\" (art. 18-22), final subsection, the bish- ops are asked \"to stimulate, lead and develop ecumenical action\" (art. 39) and all the faithful are exhorted \"to procure the return of their separated breth- ren to Catholic unity by their words, their activity and especially their prayers\" (art. 43). Chapter 11 of the draft of the dogmatic constitution De Ecclesia , prepared by the Theological Commission, is entitled De Oecumenismo. 41 Two paragraphs describe \"The relationship of the Catholic Church to individual separated Christians\" (art. 50) and \"The relationship of the Catholic Church to separated Christian communities\" (art. 51), respectively. Because it assumes that the other Christian churches and communities are de ficient as regards the means of grace and unity, the Catholic Church \"looks with maternal love upon them individually and lovingly invites them to herself\" (art. 50). Still, the Theological Commission has great esteem for these communities because, in them \"there are certain elements of the Church, especially the Sacred Scriptures and the sacraments, which, as e fficacious means and signs of unity, can produce mutual union in Christ and by their very nature, as realities proper to Christ's Church, impel towards Catholic (art. 51). 42 Section 52 is thematically con- 41 I make use of the translation made by J.A. Komonchak, Draft of a Dogmatic Constitution on the Church , at <https://jakomonchak.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/draft-of-a-dogmatic- constitution-on-the-church/> (Accessed 19 December 2015) 42 One thus observes that the most famous line in Lumen gentium , assuring Catholic faithful that, on the one hand, they can find \"the Church of Christ\" in their own Church, while, at the same time and on the other hand, inviting them to take part fully in the ecumenical movement; since \"outside its structure many elements of sancti fication are to be found which, as proper gifts to the church of Christ, impel us towards catholic unity\" ) (LG 8), is only partially the work of the mature Council. It remains actually remarkably faithful to the schema, De ecclesia , presented by the Theological Commission. Read together with the previous \u00a7 50, it is highly probable that most members of this commission will have understood 'Catho- lic unity' to refer to the unity found in the Catholic Church. Thus, they probably under- stood the term in the same way as Congar had done in Divided Christendom : \"The goal of an authentic reunion movement must be Catholic unity; the unity, that is, of the fullness of the mystical Christ. It must therefore be concerned with reintegration in the Una Cath- olica\" (Congar, Divided Christendom , 252). Not all of them will have agreed with the much more nuanced account of 'Catholic unity' that Congar wrote down R\u00e9fl\u00e9xions sou- mises \u00e0 la Commission Th\u00e9ologique , in response to his nomination as consultor to the 274 De Mey nected to the two previous paragraphs and describes \"the relationship of the Catholic Church to the ecumenical movement outside the Church\". This move- ment receives a considerable amount of praise. At the same time, however, one repeats the three conditions for unity, derived from Bellarmine's De Contro- versiis , but here ascribed to the will of Christ, implying that those working for ecumenism in other Christian churches must become aware of the need to return to the Catholic Church: But if it is to conform to Christ's will, this manifestation of unity must be strictly shaped in accordance with the same Christ's will, in unity of faith, sacramental communion, and government. Those, therefore, who seek to obey Christ's will with all their hearts and to grow in their degree of \"ecu- menicity,\" must, led by the Spirit of Christ, draw closer and closer to that Church which, although it is a single and indivisible house of God, still rejoices in its many mansions all over the world, in unity of faith, govern- ment and communion beneath the one Vicar of Christ. Theological Commission (24/09/1960): \"By this very fact we would have and we would present a dynamic notion of the unity of the Church, that is, a notion oriented towards the catholic unity, in perpetual growth, which is the goal of missionary e fforts. Too often the Church's unity is presented only as an already fashioned framework which one must enter and remain in. This is not wrong, but it is insu fficient. Unity is ceaselessly to be achieved an promoted, as much on the level of the universal Church as on that of parishes or local communities. This point has great pastoral importance\". ( Congar's Initial Propos- als for Vatican II, at <https://jakomonchak. files.wordpress.com/2012/02/congars-plan-for- the-council.pdf> (Accessed 19 December 2015), 5) Maybe 'Catholic unity' is one of these expressions found in the documents of Vatican II of which the interpretation has been deliberately left open in order to allow for many possible interpretations (and thus mak- ing more Council Fathers ready to vote in favour of the documents). I am, therefore, no longer sure of the claim I made in an earlier article on the interpretation of the same expression in LG 13, that 'Catholic unity' was de finitely not the unity only to be found in the Catholic Church, but a characterization of the eschatological outlook of the Church of Christ, and thus unity in reconciled diversity.

De pluriformiteit the Apostolate of Conversions The Debate on Ecumenism and Conversion during the Second Period and Intersession Because the Council Fathers were not particularly enthusiastic about the draft on ecumenism presented by the Oriental Commission, it was decided that a mixed commission would make a synthesis of the separate documents pre- pared by the Oriental Commission, the Theological Commission, and the Secretariat for Christian Unity. Since the Oriental Commission was very unwill- ing to cooperate, Mauro Velati is right to mention about this draft that, \"a text elaborated by the Secretariat could finally arrive in the hands of the fathers of the council\". 43 As was the case with the draft prepared by the Secretariat for Christian Unity one year earlier, the first chapter does not yet mention the work of conversion. The chapter dealing with the practice of ecumenism now starts with two paragraphs that are almost identical with the 1962 draft, dealing with \"The internal renovation of the Church\" and \"The conversion of the heart\". 44 The presentation of the new draft to the Council Fathers on November 18, 1963, was accompanied by three reports. Maybe in order to anticipate ques- tions about the absence of a passage on the apostolate of conversions, Joseph Martin (1891-1976), the Archbishop of Rouen and member of the Secretariat for Christian Unity, used this topic as an illustration of the fact that the Secretariat was already preparing a directory to deal with particular norms. One of the questions to be treated there would be \"which place the reconcilia- tion of individuals desiring to enter into the Catholic Church and their preparation can claim for itself in the pastoral work of the Church. It should also be clear that no opposition needs to exist between this form of apostolate and the action which is properly called ecumenical\". 45 43 Mauro Velati, Lamberigts conciliaires \u00e0 Vatican II (Leuven: Peeters, 1996), the 1967 Directory on Ecumenism issued by the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity , however, this will not be a very prominent theme. The only relevant paragraph seems to be \u00a7 28: \"In some places and with some communities, sects and persons, the ecumenical movement and the wish for peace with the Catholic Church have not yet grown strong (cf. Decree on Ecumenism, n. 19), and so this reciprocity and mutual understanding are more di fficult; the local Ordinary or, if 276 De Mey The reading of the relationes was at the same time the start of the public debate on De oecumenismo . Because several Council Fathers asked to better define the di fference between the work of ecumenism and the apostolate of conversions, this could no longer be ignored while preparing the third draft of De oecumenismo . In what follows, I will mention a few of them. 46 The new Archbishop of Westminster, John Carmel Heenan (1905-1975), addressed the Council Fathers on November 19, 1963 in the name of all the bishops of England and Wales. He was aware that some people believed \"Catholics in England to be indi fferent to the ecumenical movement\". He admitted that Catholics in his country were waiting for an o fficial standpoint from Rome before being willing to engage in ecumenical action, but now he could promise the separated breth- ren in his country that the dialogue with them would be promoted in the future. In the opinion of Heenan and his fellow bishops, the precise nature and goal of ecumenical action was not yet su fficiently clear. He made a proposal that, at the same time, contained a clear delineation of ecumenical action and individual conversion: \"Ecumenical dialogue is not oriented towards individ- ual souls ... but takes place especially among communities\". 47 In his intervention on November 25, 1963, Anicetus Fernandez (1895-1981), the Master General of the Dominican order, expressed the hope that the next draft would be better able to counter an opinion sometimes heard among the Catholic faithful, that \"ecumenism does injustice to the work of conversions and to the vigour of the preaching of the Gospel\". It is therefore important to underline, in his opinion, that each of the four forms of the one ministry of the need be, the episcopal conference may indicate suitable measures for preventing the dan- gers of indi fferentism and proselytism among their faithful in these circumstances. It is to be hoped, however, that through the grace of the Holy Spirit and the prudent pastoral care of the bishops, ecumenical feeling and mutual regard will so increase both among Catholics and among their separated brethren that the need for these special measures will gradually vanish\". Cf. \"A Directory for the Application of the Second Vatican Council's Decisions on Ecumenism\" , Acta Apostolicae Sedis 59 (1967), 574-592. 46 I selected them among the seven references mentioned in the Relatio justifying the addi- tion of a few extra lines on this theme during the next session. Cf. Unitatis Redintegratio. 58. 47 AS II/5, 366-368. The same point is also made in the intervention by Archbishop Maurice Roy of Qu\u00e9bec, which he had submitted in written form. Cf. Ecumenism the Apostolate of Conversions Word of God are indispensable: the work of conversions, Catholic ecumenism, missionary work, and the re-evangelization of the Catholic faithful. 48 Even if the observers from other Christian churches and communities, generally speaking, had a signi ficant in fluence both on the event and the documents of the Second Vatican Council, 49 their pleas not to proceed with the plan to add a few lines on the apostolate of conversions, however, were apparently ignored. During the weekly meetings between the observers and members of the Secretariat for Christian Unity, the observers had the opportunity to make comments on the documents that were currently being discussed in aula . At the meeting of November 19, the Anglican Canon Bernard Pawley expressed his concern about the new theme introduced by Archbishop Joseph Martin in his Relatio . Even if the Archbishop had only spoken about the instructions to be contained in the ecumenical directory, this was already a reason for serious concern for Canon Pawley: \"In England at least the inclusion of such instruc- tions at this point would undermine people's con fidence in Roman Catholic intentions\". 50 48 AS II/6, 26. 49 Cf. P. De Mey, \"As Separated but Closely Related Brethren ( fratres seiuncti ). The Harmoni- ous Collaboration of Council and Observers on the Decree on Ecumenism 50 years ago\" , le sch\u00e9ma De Oecumen- ismo\" (F. September 1964 (F. Moeller, 2059), 6, this is a reason of serious concern: \"Zahlreiche Bisch\u00f6fe want to add, here, the reflection on conversions from a famous Protestant theologian who has not been an observer stricto sensu . Karl Barth (1886-1968) had been invited to attend the last two ses- sions of the Council but had to decline because of his poor health. In September 1966, however, the 80 year old Barth made a pilgrimage Ad limina apostolorum and was even received by Pope Paul VI. His own image of the Catholic Church had so much changed that he believed it was no longer necessary to promote individual conversions in between both churches: \"'Conversions' from us to the Roman Catholic Church or from there to one 278 De Mey On November 20, a meeting of the sub-commission De quaestionibus theo- logicis et de citationibus biblicis was scheduled which made an attempt to provide a clear de finition of both the apostolate of conversions and 'Catholic ecumenism'; however, the report contains the warning that this is only to be considered as provisional work. 51 The sub-commission then decided to start from the de finition that the Archbishop of Westminster had proposed. According to Archbishop Martin the distinguishing element of ecumenism was \"that it is addressed to the communities as such\". Bishop Emiel- Jozef De Smedt of Bruges, however, did not entirely agree, since it is possible that two individual persons can engage in ecumenical dialogue apart from any refer- ence to their communities. For him, the distinguishing element is to be found \"in the nature of the act. In the apostolate of conversions one tries to convince, whereas in ecumenism, in the context of a dialogue, one gives a testimony of one's own faith\". 52 At the end of the second session, the sta ff members of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity re-read all oral and written interventions of the Council Fathers and copied them into new documents pertaining to the decree and its chapters 'in general' and to the individual paragraphs. 53 On the basis of this preparatory work, changes were proposed to the previous draft in response to interventions by particular bishops. On February 11, 1964, the decision was made \"to mention the work of conversions\" and the following text was proposed: It is, therefore, clear that no opposition exists between this ecumenical work and the apostolate of reconciliation of individuals and the prepara- of our churches have as such no signi ficance signi ficance only if they are in the form of a conscientiously necessary 'conversion' - not to another church, but to Jesus Christ, the Lord of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church. Basically both here and there it can only be a matter of reach one heeding in his place in his own church the call to faith in the one Lord, and to his service\". K.

Therefore, the new lines were added to the schema of De oecumenismo : ... because the apostolate of the reconciliation of individual believers has equally to be recognized as a work of the Holy Spirit and is in no way opposed to the ecumenical work. This apostolate, however, is essentially 54 \" De oecumenismo . Chapitre I, n\u00b0 3. Mention de l'uvre des conversions , 11.2.1964\" (F. Stran- sky, box 8). A line added by Stransky in pencil is very instructive. He mentions that the drafters were \"Hamer, Feiner, Moeller, using Relatio ad Patres Concilii\" . During the discussion, apparently, it was decided to remove the redun- dant word 'individualis,' also found in Martin's relatio and also to first make mention of ecumenism. A comparison with the relatio (see n.46) makes it clear that actually only the line about the inspiration by the Holy Spirit of both forms of apostolate is a Spiritu Santo inspiratum'. These lines have been inserted in the working draft of the Secretariat. Cf. \" De oecumenismo 11.2.1964\" (F. De Smedt, 1095), 10, and were motivated by father John Long in his ...\" This version was included in the final draft sent to the Council Fathers, cf. AS III/2, 296-329, 300. The careful study of the application of the hermeneutical tool of juxtaposition in the documents of Vatican II has been one of the hallmarks of the research of my esteemed colleague Henk Witte. See: a.o. Witte, \"Reform with the Help of A Challenge to the Interpretation of the Docu- ments of Vatican II\", The Jurist 71 (2011), 20-34.280 De Mey distinguished from the ecumenical movement, which has another goal and is of a di fferent nature. 56 The Substantial Impact of the Modi Submitted during the Third Period During the third period of the Council, the Council Fathers still had the occa- sion to propose modi fications to the new schema. Because this draft had been approved with a two-thirds majority, however, of the almost two thousand modi presented, the only ones accepted were those that attempted to help overcome potential misunderstandings of the decree, and which remained faithful to the intention of the previous schema. One of the twenty-nine approved modi pertains to our passage. All these modi , including those rejected, received a brief response by members of the Secretariat. 57 In two of the eleven modi 58 dealing with our passage, the Council Fathers who were either strongly opposed to ecumenism or to the work of conversions requested the removal of the entire passage. Even if the decree states that there is no opposition between both activities, for Bishop Angelo Barbisotti (1904-1972), from the Ecuadorian diocese of Esmeraldas, the opposite seems to be the case: \"As of the day when they began to speak about ecumenism, the number of Protestant conversions strongly diminished and, on the con- trary, Protestant propaganda among the Catholic faithful, especially in Latin America, became stronger\". Five Council Fathers - among whom four mission- ary bishops were of French origin - equally were in favour of an omission or a radical reformulation of the entire passage, because \"individual conversions are not the object of the decree\". Continuing, they stated that it is \"super fluous to mention this theme here, because the legitimacy of conversions appears from the declaration De libertate religiosa \". Conversely, these fathers expected \"an explicit contempt for proselytism\" in the text. An anonymous request signed by 96 Council Fathers expressed the hope that the passage would be concluded with a reference to the missionary com- mandment in Mk 16:15. According to them, \"passivity in the apostolate towards other Christians leads to the diminishing of conversions to the Catholic Church\". The reaction from the Secretariat was rather harsh: 2005, 102. 58 All quotations from relevant modi are borrowed from AS III/7, 42-45, or from submissions 1276).281 Ecumenism and the Apostolate of Conversions Using these words in our text would mean identifying baptized Christians with pagans, which would be false and disastrous. The di ffusion of the Gospel among non-Christians according to the commandment of the Lord is precisely greatly helped when we converse with other Christians in the way, described in this Decree. The request by the Bishop of Mainz and consultor of the Secretariat, Hermann Volk (1903-1988) and by the Bishop of Chur, Johannes Vonderach (1916-1994) to speak about the 'work' rather than the 'apostolate' of conversions, as well as to transfer the statement about the distinction between the two activities from the concessive clause to the main clause was also attended to, albeit not their proposed text revision. The most successful modus , however, was submitted by the Archbishop of Elisabethville, Joseph-Floribert Cornelis (1910-2001), a monk from the Bene- dictine abbey of Saint Andrew, Zevenkerken. 59 The Secretariat was directly involved in the drafting of the modus. Several draft versions are found in the archive of another monk from the same abbey, Jacques Dupont (1915-1998), who was never appointed a peritus at the Council but still engaged in conciliar work (F. Dupont, 830). As co-drafter the name of Emmanuel Lanne (1923-2010) is mentioned. Lanne was a monk of the Benedictine abbey of Chevetogne and member of the Secretariat since January 1963. The Secretariat decided to approve his new draft since \"the meaning intended by the decree is bet- ter expressed by this new formulation\". The reasons are clearly outlined in the citation below: It is, however, clear that the work of the reconciliation and preparation of those individuals who desire the full Catholic communion, is distin- guished by its nature from the ecumenical enterprise; nevertheless there is no opposition, since both of them proceed from the action of the Holy Spirit. 60 Reasons: a) The word 'apostolate' has to be reserved for the evan- gelization of non-Christians; if it is applied to Christians it smacks of 59 Cf. E. Louchez, \"Ev\u00eaques , The Belgian Contribution to the Second Vatican Council (n. 15), 647-684. 60 There is a slight di fference between the version of the modus - \"Patet especially in the ears of non-Catholics. b) One should speak first of the work of conversion, so that the ecumenical action of Catholics does not seem to have the work of conversions as its goal. c) Because non-Catholic Christians are not simply outside the Church, they can- not properly be said \"to enter into the Catholic Church\". 61 d) the word 'inspired' ( inspiratum ) is not an accurate expression here. e) It should be logical first to speak about the distinction of each work and thereafter about its non-distinction. f) One should say 'therefore' of 'action' ( actionem ), so that 'action' is reserved for the Holy Spirit. Why is it no longer stated in the final version of the decree that both ecumen- ism and conversion \"proceed from the action of Spirit\" ( Spiritus Sancti is the result of one of the well-known changes that Pope Paul VI himself had proposed after the Secretariat had studied the modi submitted by the Council Fathers. One week before the Decree on Ecumenism would be promulgated on November 21, 1964, the Pope had asked to see the list of approved modi fications. Relying on a list of modi fications prepared by his personal theologian, the Italian Dominican Mario Ciappi (1909-1996), who, theologically-speaking, belonged to the con- ciliar minority, the Pope indicated in a con fidential list which modi fications he supported and which not. The protagonists of the Secretariat were aware of the huge di fficulty: if the desire of the Pope was not met, the decree would not be promulgated; if the list of the Pope were followed entirely at the moment of the final vote, many Council Fathers would perhaps express their frustration about this blatant non-recognition of their work with a negative vote. 63 The 61 A similar request is found in another modus, submitted by Bishop Garabed Amadouni (1900-1984), Apostolic Exarch I am indebted to Velati, \"L'ecumenismo mentions that Willebrands at first had objected to this particular change, originating in the personal irritation of Ciappi against relating the ecumenical movement and the Holy Spirit, but that he eventually accepted the modus (ibid., 447). One wonders whether there is a link between the request of the Pope to remove the reference to the Spirit in this passage and the acceptance of a modus submitted by 18 Council fathers during the discussion on Ori- entalium Ecclesiarum in October 1964, asking that one should recognize \"the in fluence of 283 Ecumenism and the Apostolate of Conversions consultor of the Secretariat, Johannes Feiner, considers this particular altera- tion, like most others, to be mainly stylistic in nature: The statement in the altered text that both the acceptance of individual non-Catholic Christians into the Catholic Church, and also ecumenical work, proceed from God's providence, instead of from the action of the Holy Spirit, as in the earlier text, presents a di fferent point of view, with- out contesting the previous point of view. The preface has already derived the ecumenical movement from the work of the Holy Spirit. 64 3 Postlude: Postconciliar Tensions between Ecumenism and Conversion in the Magisterium The internal discussions on the precise relationship between 'Catholic ecu- menism' and 'the work of conversions' within the Secretariat for Christian Unity, as of 1961, clearly revealed the existence of a tension between advocates of a more ecumenical approach and defenders of the apostolate of conversion. The majority opinion within the Secretariat clearly was in favour of ecumen- ism; as can be derived from the fact that neither the draft prepared prior to the Council nor the revised De oecumenismo from 1963 are interested in the theme of conversions. The addition of a few lines on the relationship between ecu- menism and conversion to the 1964 draft of De oecumenismo was the result of the grace of the Holy Spirit\" when an Orthodox is received into the Catholic Church. OE 25 now reads: \"Nothing more than what a simple profession of the catholic faith requires should be asked of people of separated eastern churches coming into the unity of the catholic church under the in fluence of the grace of the Holy Spirit\". The Benedictine abbot Johannes Maria Hoeck, an in fluential member of the Oriental Commission, was rather critical about this paragraph, belonging to a section dealing with 'Relations with the brethren of the separated churches': \"That individual conversions should be spoken of here of all places, and this too at the beginning, cannot be regarded as fortunate\". Cf. J.M. Hoeck, \"Decree on Eastern Catholic Churches\" , H. Vorgrimler (ed.), Commentary on the Documents of Vatican II (London: Burns & Oates, vol. 2, 1968), 1-56. 64 J. Feiner, \"Commentary on the Decree on Ecumenism\" , H. Vorgrimler (ed.), Commentary on the Documents of Vatican II, 57-164, 162. The reference to \"the marvellous ) has some a ffinity with a line in the modus proposed by the archbishop of Aix-en-Provence Charles de Provench\u00e8res (1904-1984), who was of the opinion that \"the work of reconciliation is almost excused\" in the original passage. He believed that it was important \"to say clearly that this work was a great gift of God\" ( clare debet dici hoc esse magnum donum Dei ).284 De Mey many pressing interventions by the Council Fathers, even if the modi continue to re flect the divergence of opinions on this topic. The disadvantage of the compromise reached in the final version of UR 4 is that it can be explained in two di fferent ways: those strongly defending the way of ecumenism may point to the fact that the priority of the decree is clear, since only 30 out of 5.000 words deal with the work toward conversions; critics of ecumenism may argue that the many interventions of the Council Fathers in favour of the apostolate of conversions in the end resulted happily in the recognition of the equal importance of and essential distinction between both pastoral approaches. The encyclical Ut unum sint (1995) by Pope John Paul II seems to pursue the line of the Secretariat for Christian Unity and is most interested in the \"clear connection between renewal, conversion and reform\" (art. 16) which the Decree on Ecumenism defends in the second chapter. 65 The novelty of Ut unum sint is that it explicitly implies the inclusion of the Petrine o ffice in its re flection on conversion (art. 4), culminating in an invitation to the lead- ers of the other Christian churches and their theologians (art. 96) to help the Pope \"to find a way of exercising the primacy which, while in no way renounc- ing what is essential to its mission, is nonetheless open to a new situation\" (art. 95). 66 65 Cf. Pope John Paul II, Ut Unum Sint: On Commitment to Ecumenism , at <http://w2.vatican. va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum- sint.html> (Accessed 19 December 2015). Even the following line is inspired by UR 6 and not by the reference to the work of conversions in UR 4: \"Only the act of placing ourselves before God can o ffer a solid basis for that conversion of individual Christians and for that constant reform of the church, insofar as she is also a human and earthly institution, which represent the preconditions for all ecumenical commitment\" (\u00a7 82). 66 In his apostolic exhortation Evangelii gaudium (2013) Pope Francis acknowledged: \"We have made little progress in this regard. The papacy and the central structures of the uni- versal Church also need to hear the call to pastoral conversion\". (\u00a7 32) made the necessary path of conversion also very much concrete in a chapter written one year after the papal encyclical on ecumenism: \"Les con prolonge de Vatican II sur Conversions The apostolic constitution Anglicanorum coetibus (2009) by Pope Benedict XVI,67 which argued for creating canonical structures to allow \"groups of Anglicans to be received into full Catholic communion individually as well as corporately\" , is a perfect illustration of the clear distinction which UR 4 has installed between ecumenical action and the work of conversions. 68 Yet, whereas the Ponti fical Council for Promoting Christian Unity has always sup- ported the dialogue between communions on the way towards full visible unity, now the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith takes the lead in promoting ecumenism in its own way, taking a literal interpretation of the goal of 'Catholic unity' ( LG 8) as its motto and imposing the Catechism of the Catholic Church as \"the authoritative expression of the Catholic faith\". Defenders of this initia- tive praise its ecumenical orientation, insisting especially on the willingness of the document \"to maintain the liturgical, spiritual and pastoral traditions of the Anglican Communion within the Catholic Church\". 69 Most Catholic ecu- menists, however, are of a di fferent opinion as they wonder how the proposed structure of the personal ordinariate can be reconciled with the indispens- able place of the bishop in Anglican ecclesiology. 70 The executive body of the 67 All references are taken from Pope Benedict XVI, Apostolic Constitution Anglicanorum Coetibus providing for Personal Ordinariates for Anglicans Entering into Full Communion with the Catholic Church , at <http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_consti tutions/documents/hf_ben-xvi_apc_20091104_anglicanorum-coetibus.html (Accessed 19 December 2015). 68 Cf.

Mayer Today it would seem that converting from one Christian church to another is no longer as contentious and critical an issue as in former centuries. 1 Back then, depending on who the person was who converted, this could have a huge impact on both internal and external a ffairs and even on the existence of whole nations. 2 In times of increasing religious freedom, conversion has become an individual a ffair, at least in the western world. But particular problems arise when the person converting has previously been committed to ecumenism. 1 'Conversion' - A Mixed Blessing in Ecumenism? In recent decades quite a few theologians involved in ecumenical studies and dialogue have converted. 3 As Michael Root, formerly Professor of Systematic Theology at the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary in Columbia, SC, now Professor of Systematic Theology at the Catholic University of America and at the time of his conversion in 2010 a Lutheran member of the International Lutheran-Roman Catholic Dialogue remarked: 1 In order to keep things simple, the 'politically correct' Roman Catholic way of speaking of 'churches and ecclesial communities' will, where theologically possible, be substituted by the sociological descriptive use of the terms 'church' or 'denomination'. 2 Some prominent examples are King Clovis I, Frederick the Wise, and Henry VIII. Emperor Constantine , who is often mentioned as an example, does not quite fit the list, since he con- verted from being a non-Christian to Christianity. 3 E.g. (in chronological order of conversions) the renowned expert in Eastern Orthodox studies, Bishop Kallistos Ware (*1934), raised Anglican, became Greek Orthodox in 1958; Richard John Neuhaus (*1936), the founder of First Things and author of The Naked Public Square , became Roman Catholic in 1990; Jaroslav Pelikan (*1923), a preeminent church historian and professor at Yale, decided together with his wife to convert, or rather as he put it 'return' , to Orthodoxy in 1998; Ola Tj rhom (*1953), professor of the Norwegian School of Mission and Theology, Stavanger, a previous sta ff member of the Institute for Ecumenical Research in Strasbourg, became Roman Catholic in 2003; Karl Christian Felm y (*193 8), who had been professor of theology at Heidelberg, became Russian Orthodox in 2007. \u00a9 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden , 2016 |doi 10.1163/9789004319165 Key Concept or Hot Potato in Ecumenism ? [a] risk of ecumenical study is that one will come to find another tradi- tion compelling in a way that leads to a deep change in mind and heart. Over the last year or so, it has become clear to me, not without struggle, that I have become a Catholic in my mind and heart in ways that no lon- ger permit me to present myself as a Lutheran theologian with honesty and integrity. This move is less a matter of decision than of discernment. 4 Such instances of individual conversion generally pose a challenge to the atmosphere in an o fficial ecumenical dialogue. It is not generally welcomed by either group whenever, in a bilateral dialogue, a member of one denomination converts and becomes a member of the other denomination. It tastes like pros- elytism and is generally felt not to be a form of Christian witness but rather the corruption of it. At best, the speci fic witness of the convert to the theological position of his or her church is called into question, and this not only by dia- logue partners, but also by the church authorities who delegated this person who subsequently converted. Such individual conversions create a dilemma for o fficial ecumenical dialogues: On the one hand, the relation between ecu- menism and membership of a particular Christian denomination 5 cannot just be regarded as a relic of pre-ecumenical days. On the other hand, it has to be acknowledged that the conversion from one denomination to another, at least in most cases, involves a more intense search for religious truth. 6 Perhaps Jaroslav Pelikan, decades before his own conversion to Orthodoxy, gave the best formulation of why individual conversions cause unease among ecumen- ists: \"Conversion is an individualistic solution to a church problem [...] The 4 M. Root, Statement to the Lutheran Theological Seminary Faculty (2010): <https://scecclesia. wordpress.com/2010/08/20/news-just-in-michael-root-becomes-catholic/> (Accessed 10 July 2015). 5 As Roman Catholic members of an international dialogue commission, it is required that they are delegated by the Vatican, more precisely they are approved by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Secretariat of State at the request of the Ponti fical Council for Promoting Christian Unity ( PCPCU ); cf. also PCPCU , Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism (1993) no. 174: \"The participants in certain dialogues are appointed by the hierarchy to take part not in a personal capacity, but as delegated representatives of their Church. Such mandates can be given by the local Ordinary, the Synod of Eastern Catholic Churches or the Episcopal Conference within its territory, or by the Holy See. In these cases, the Catholic participants have a special responsibility towards the authority that has sent them\": <http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/ponti fical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_ chrstuni_doc_25031993_principles-and-norms-on-ecumenism_en.html> (Accessed 10 July 2015). 6 Cf. C.J. Peter, \"Ecumenism and Denominational Conversion: Re flections of a Roman Catholic\" , Communio (1976), 188-199.290 Mayer individual who rashly seeks to hasten its solution by a precipitate action of his own may well be postponing the eventual solution. The road to solution [...] is through mutual understanding, study and witness\". 7 Yet how can such a church problem be grasped and how can it be addressed by conversion? First of all, conversion has a lot to do with ecumenism, if ecu- menism is really to be lived and not just theoretically re flected on. And this also involves - at least to a certain extent - individual conversion. \"There can be no ecumenism worthy of the name without a change of heart. For it is from renewal of the inner life of our minds, from self-denial and an unstinted love that desires of unity take their rise and develop in a mature way\" ( UR 7).8 Thus already the assessed the mutual fferent churches and ecclesial commu- nities, even without decades of practical experience in bilateral dialogues. Some paragraphs earlier in the same document had stated, \"it is evident that, when individuals wish for full Catholic communion, their preparation and rec- onciliation is an undertaking which of its nature is distinct from ecumenical action. But there is no opposition between the two, since both proceed from the marvellous ways of God\" ( UR 4). In fact, seen in this light, conversion seems to be a prerequisite for true ecu- menism , while, at the same time, it can also aggravate ecumenical relations. Is 'conversion' thus an equivocal term? Does changing one's denomination have nothing whatsoever to do with the attitude needed to allow for changes required for ecumenical rapprochement and vice versa ? Or is it already enough to state, as Unitatis redintegratio 4 does, that \"both proceed from the marvel- lous ways of God\" but are distinct? What are the key features that characterize conversion understood as one of the principles of ecumenism? The following re flections identify conversion as a fundamental Christian atti- tude that is an indispensable trait of true ecumenism. Tracing the ob servations of the Groupe des Dombes, an independent dialogue group of French- speaking Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed theologians, founded in 1931, four key features of conversion as an ecumenical principle are identi fied. At the beginning of the ecumenical movement, the di fferent Christian denom- inations realized that competing with each other and trying to poach converts from each other would compromise the Christian witness. How are the mecha- nisms that were developed in the course of the last century in order to get 7 J. Pelikan, The Riddle of Roman Catholicism (New York: Abingdon Press, 1959), 199-200. 8 For the sake of easy veri fication all texts from Vatican II are quoted according to the English online translation on the Vatican website: <http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_ vatican_council/documents> (Accessed 10 July 2015).291 Conversion : Key Concept or Hot Potato in Ecumenism ? beyond a mere 'doctrine divides, service unites' attitude, functioning today? Have they been superseded, made redundant or missed their point altogether? We will take a closer look at two documents, the encyclical Ut unum sint (1995) and Christian Witness in a Multi-religious World (2011), in an attempt to answer these questions. Given the close connection between conversion and (self-) renewal, a concrete example is analysed more closely. What can this analy- sis tell us about the future tasks of the Roman Catholic Church with regard to its ecumenical relations? These re flections are undertaken from a Roman Catholic perspective and the awareness that in ecumenism there can be no Archimedean point from where we can survey the whole ecumenical land- scape objectively and with a view of its totality. Although, like any academic discipline, theology should strive for a general intelligibility of its subject mat- ter, it is a sobering thought that even the greatest objectivity is still very much just one of many possible perspectives. Henk Witte, to whom this volume is dedicated, has always been highly conscious of this. To him, a theology that is based on the concrete experience of the self-revelation of God in history actu- ally requires some degree of personal commitment. 2 Some Key Features of 'Conversion' as an Ecumenical Principle The Biblical Greek term \u00b5 designates the change of one's inner attitude 9 that leads to , the resulting shift of one's actions into a di fferent direction. 10 Conversion comprises a revision of one's religious view not only 9 Cf. R. Schnackenburg, \"Metanoia\" gew\u00e4hrte Heilsm\u00f6glichkeit'. 10 This is who sepa- rates the two and insists that epistrophe VII,518c-519b)\".292 Mayer with regard to the past but also to the future. It requires a new orientation that is generally seen as a response to a call coming from God. This is true for the Old and the New Testament. More speci fically, for Jesus himself, the act of \u00b5 is closely linked to his proclamation of the kingdom of God, as for instance in Mark 1:15: \"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; \u00b5 , and believe in the good news\". In an eschatological horizon, Jesus calls for immediate (cf. Mt 21:28-31), wholehearted (cf. Lk 13:1-5; 18:9-14) 12:43 ff) \u00b5 . Being a Christian rests on this conversion that is required by the coming, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is a conversion to God the Father in Jesus Christ through the Spirit. In both elements a renunciation of former attitudes and a new orientation are present. With regard to this tem- poral component, a time before and after the conversion can be identi fied. Conversely, Christian existence as a whole is marked by a conversion to God that is an ongoing process, a process of Christiformitas , becoming like Christ by following Christ. This basic conversion is called 'Christian conversion' by the Groupe des Dombes in its 1991 ground-breaking study, For the Conversion of the Churches (FCC).11 Such a conversion's absolute nature opens onto a process: that is never accomplished fully in this world. This conversion to faith is initiated and celebrated in baptism. Thus it concludes an 'already there' but also a 'not yet'. It is a grace that opens onto a task. It leads into an existence that must undergo a continual conversion. That conversion is a struggle conducted in grace against all forms of sin, personal and collec- tive ( FCC 39). These considerations reveal two important features of conversion as an ecu- menical principle: As a phenomenon, conversion is not con fined to the ecumenical realm . Instead, it is a general attitude of Christian life. And its tem- poral yet at the same time processual character is essential. Conversion is not brought about once and for all at one speci fic point in time. It is an on-going process, even in ecumenical contexts, while there can or, rather, should be, an identi fiable moment or act when the process of conversion is initiated. Beyond this basic existence in conversion that characterizes any Christian identity, the Groupe des Dombes further identi fies ecclesial and confessional conversion, whereby \"ecclesial conversion is the constant e ffort of the church community 11 Groupe des Dombes, \"For the Conversion of the Churches (1991)\" , C.E. Cli fford (ed.), For the Communion of the Churches: The Contributions of the Groupe des Dombes (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2010), 149-223.293 Conversion : Key Concept or Hot Potato in Ecumenism ? as such to strive towards its Christian identity\" ( FCC 41). And in the speci fically ecumenical context of ongoing division, they state the following: Confessional conversion is first of all conversion to the God of Jesus Christ and consequently a fraternal reconciliation among the churches as they seek full communion and full mutual ecclesial recognition - not to the detriment of confessional identity, but for puri fication and deep- ening in line with the gospel ( FCC 51). Church unity can come about only through a continuous process of conver- sion that leads to increasing convergence. Continuing, \"conversion is not simply at the source of the ecumenical movement. It represents its constantly underlying motivation. When conversion flags, the ecumenical movement stagnates or even goes into reverse. All the Christian confessions and all the Christians in each of them have to keep moving forward in the attitude of con- version\" ( FCC 134). The convergence resulting from the process of conversion is itself a process of ecumenical rapprochement: if churches come closer to God in Jesus Christ through the Spirit, it can only mean they are coming closer to each other. The \"need for the Christian churches [...] to walk the way of conversion towards more visible structural and sacramental unity\" 12 is entailed by the logic of belief in Christ as such. Thus, the conversion required for church unity is not only that of individuals nor of the Church of Christ as a whole, but is also a 'confessional conversion'. Could the mutual recognition that the di fferent churches and ecclesial communities are in a process of conversion leading to an increasing communion - although communion is still imperfect among those churches, each of them is in full communion with Christ - open up a way for a mutual recognition as churches? The various churches and ecclesial com- munities would be in a phase of companionship, together attaining an ever greater communion with Christ and thus with each other. This would be close to what Cardinal Kasper calls 'ecumenism of life': a common orientation towards Christ, comprising the whole life of the churches. 13 Such a growing convergence through conversion also requires that conver- sion contains a potential of renewal and reform , since conversion is not just 12 P. Murray (ed.), Receptive Ecumenism and the Call to Catholic Learning : Exploring a Way for Contemporary Ecumenism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008 ), 32. 13 W. Kasper, \"\u00d6kumene des Lebens\". Paper given at the Katholikentag, Ulm 2004: <http:// www.foerderverein-unita-dei-cristiani.com/seite/pdf/wk_oedl.pdf> (Accessed 20 July 2015).294 Mayer a change of attitude towards others but also a renewal of one's own practices. The attitude of conversion already presupposes sinful traits of the Christian, ecclesial, and confessional existence. These traits are to be found in any denom- ination. They are already there qua conditio humana and they are ecumenically decisive. They require a change of the basic attitudes of self-segregation and separation. They require doctrinal openness and the insight that the whole truth might be more than the sum of its parts. On the other hand, the compat- ibility of ecumenical documents with the doctrine of the churches engaged in dialogue with each other ensures that they are mutually acceptable. When di fferentiating the levels of conversion, the Groupe des Dombes links them to di fferent corresponding forms of identity. 14 This shows that Christian, ecclesial and confessional identities are inseparable from, and indeed grounded in, conversion. Identity is always lived by conversion to God, in each case. Ultimately, there exists a kind of dialectics between conversion and identity . What gives a speci fic church its identity? The answer of the Groupe des Dombes is: a speci fic combination of Christian, ecclesial and confessional identity with corresponding forms of conversion. Ecumenically, however, the emphasis is on 'confessional identity' , for 'confessional conversion' is the attitude required for any progress of the ecumenical movement. Realistically, however, the Groupe des Dombes points out: The forms of resistance to the ecumenical movement and to the confes- sional conversion it calls for, are many: a preference for the more comfortable status quo, a fear of losing one's confessional identity, and, above all, indi fference on the part of the majority. Non-doctrinal factors are still important: the old clich\u00e9s and fears continually reappear while the gap separating theologians undertaking research, church o fficials, and the majority of the Christian people becomes more pronounced. These attitudes often express a false idea both of unity and of truth, of identity and conversion ( FCC 134). The main problem seems to be the dialectics of confessional identity and con- version. The obstacle to confessional conversion is the fear that distinctive features of 'confessional identity' that are considered to be indispensable will be lost in the process of conversion. This fear triggers concepts such as 'ecu- 14 In For the Conversion of the Churches Christian identity is dealt with in nos. 15-21, ecclesial identity in nos. 22-25, and confessional identity in nos. 26-35.295 Conversion : Key Concept or Hot Potato in Ecumenism ? menism of pro files'15 or 'ecumenism of di fference'. The idea behind these notions is that a sharper pro file would facilitate honest confessional ecumeni- cal progress. This certainly has something to commend it. Yet such concepts also re flect the fact that some churches tend to establish their own identity solely by de fining themselves negatively, as being di fferent from the others. 16 Churches that adopt concepts like these are no longer keen on ecumenical exchange and partnership. They no longer strive to 'act together in all matters except those in which deep di fferences of conviction compel them to act separately' , 17 as set out by the Lund Principle . Does this mean that Christian churches today would be better o ff without their confessional identities, which cause ecumenical resistance and pose a threat to the identities of other churches? The Groupe des Dombes points out that the distinction between ecclesial and confessional identity is not univer- sally accepted, neither by the Orthodox Church nor by the Roman Catholic Church, since both never understood themselves theologically as confessions (cf. FCC 26). However, these two churches face the same obstacles and hin- drances when dealing with their identities. Confessional identities must thus be converted to be faithful to themselves, so that the churches can experience their Christian identity in these confessions, and at the same time in dialogue with the other. Therefore the Groupe des Dombes reaches the conclusion: For our part [...] we see the ecumenical movement as a great pro- cess of conversion and reconciliation of our diversities in the quest for 15 Cf. e.g. W. Huber, \"Was bedeutet \u00d6kumene 55 (2009), 39-51. 16 E.g. 'We are Protestants because we are not Catholic, we don't have holy water, candles, the sign of the cross' etc., while it would be possible to de fine being Protestant also in a positive way, e.g. as being committed to the gospel. A recent church o fficial example is the Archbishop of Canterbury's invitation to a Primates' meeting dating from 16 September 2015 where he states \"We have no Anglican Pope\" instead of describing the function of the Primates in the Anglican Communion more concisely: <http://www.archbishopofcanter bury.org/articles.php/5613/archbishop-of-canterbury-calls-for-primates-gathering> (Accessed 15 November 2015). 17 O.S. Tomkins (ed.), The Third World Conference on Faith and Order, Lund, Sweden, 1952 (London: SCM Press, 1953), 15-38; 16.296 Mayer communion among confessional identities that, once cleansed of their unevangelical or sinful elements, can receive each other, become comple- mentary, and enrich each other. Di fference is legitimate within koinonia (communion). Thus the churches are invited to arrive at a common rec- ognition of what distinguishes legitimate di fferences from separative divergences. Confessional identities are not to be abandoned, but to be transformed. Such a vision aims at always linking the concern of unity with that of mission. It is received as faithfulness to the Spirit who leads us forward ( FCC 153). 3 Beyond a 'Service Unites' Attitude \"Linking the concern of unity with that of mission\" indeed serves as an ecu- menical litmus test. A glance at church history reveals a quite competitive attitude among the respective churches. As Kurt Aland states in his study on the history of conversion, Der Glaubenswechsel in der Geschichte : \"The strength of a church is mirrored in the conversions it attracts, as far as they are genuine\". 18 Going back to the roots of the ecumenical movement shows that both con- cepts - that of individual and of confessional conversion - are not totally separated after all. The di fficulties that prompted the Edinburgh 1910 World Missionary Conference were related to denominationalism and, ultimately, to the question of which denomination someone should choose if he or she wanted to convert and become a Christian. The motto 'doctrine divides, ser- vice unites' , the watchword of the Life and Work Movement and one of the strands that led to the founding of the World Council of Churches in 1948, rep- resents a first step of some churches into the direction of common action when facing worldwide problems. But is this enough? What would be the ele- ments of an ecumenically 'sustainable' conversion? After three decades of o fficial ecumenical involvement, the encyclical of John Paul II on commitment to ecumenism, Ut unum sint (UUS), reviews some 18 : Key Concept or Hot Potato in Ecumenism ? elements of an ecumenically sustainable conversion from a Roman Catholic perspective: \"An overall view of the last thirty years enables us better to appre- ciate many of the fruits of this common conversion to the Gospel which the Spirit of God has brought about by means of the ecumenical movement\" ( UUS 41).19 This movement is classi fied as a process of conversion that has led from competition to not just common social action, but to common witness as well. 20 Following Vatican II, the pope points first to \"the need for interior con- version\" ( UUS 15) along the lines of Jesus's call to repent. This need for personal, interior conversion indicates \"the fundamental need for evangelization at every stage of the Church's journey of salvation\" ( UUS 15). Yet there is also a need for communal conversion, de fined as the \"desire of every Christian Community for unity\" ( UUS 15). Communal conversion is based on: The knowledge that the Spirit is at work in other Christian Communities, the discovery of examples of holiness, the experience of the immense riches present in the communion of saints, and contact with unexpected dimensions of Christian commitment. In a corresponding way, there is an increased sense of the need for repentance ( UUS 15). The driving force behind this sentiment is clearly a desire to ask for forgiveness for past failings. 21 \"All the sins of the world were gathered up in the saving sac- rifice of Christ, including the sins committed against the Church's unity: the sins of Christians, those of the pastors no less than those of the lay faithful\" (UUS 34). In this context, even sinful structures are denounced. This calls for a \"necessary puri fication of past memories. With the grace of the Holy Spirit, the Lord's disciples, inspired by love, by the power of the truth and by a sincere desire for mutual forgiveness and reconciliation, are called to re-examine together their painful past and the hurt which that past regrettably continues to provoke even today\" ( UUS 2). In all these instances the retrospective ele- 19 John Paul II, Ut Ecumenism (1995): <http://w2.vatican.va/ content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint. html> (Accessed 6 July 2015) 20 Especially, the studies of Faith and Order are mentioned as \"useful tools for discerning what is necessary to the ecumenical movement and to the conversion which it must inspire\" ( UUS 17). 21 Cf. most prominently the confession of sins and asking for forgiveness in a mass of repen- tance celebrated by John Paul II on the first Sunday of Lent, 12 March 2000: <http://www. sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/document sandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/> (Accessed 20 July 2015)298 Mayer ment dominates. Yet what about any present exclusions and shortcomings? The pope only speaks of the connection between renewal, conversion, and reform in UUS 16. It is labelled as part of the teaching of the Second Vatican Council. Frank and honest dialogue is supposed to lead to a kind of correctio fraterna . \"The increase of fellowship in a reform which is continuous and car- ried out in the light of the Apostolic Tradition is certainly, in the present circumstances of Christians, one of the distinctive and most important aspects of ecumenism\" ( UUS 17). Spiritual ecumenism ( UUS 21) is identi fied as a basis for reform and renewal which transforms ecumenical dialogue into a 'dialogue of conversion': Dialogue cannot take place merely on a horizontal level, being restricted to meetings, exchanges of points of view or even the sharing of gifts proper to each Community. It has also a primarily vertical thrust, directed towards the One who, as the Redeemer of the world and the Lord of his- tory, is himself our Reconciliation. This vertical aspect of dialogue lies in our acknowledgment, jointly and to each other, that we are men and women who have sinned. It is precisely this acknowledgment which cre- ates in brothers and sisters living in Communities not in full communion with one another that interior space where Christ, the source of the Church's unity, can e ffectively act, with all the power of his Spirit, the Paraclete ( UUS 35). The idea of a 'dialogue of conversion' is taken up again in UUS 82, first on an individual, 22 then on a communal level. 23 The encyclical concludes: \"Only the act of placing ourselves before God can o ffer a solid basis for that conversion of individual Christians and for that constant reform of the Church, insofar as she is also a human and earthly institution, which represents the preconditions for all ecumenical commitment\" ( UUS 82). With regard to the four key features of conversion, clearly the potential of renewal and reform, especially that of self-renewal, remains underdeveloped 22 \"The Catholic Church must enter into what might be called a 'dialogue of conversion' , which constitutes the spiritual foundation of ecumenical dialogue. In this dialogue, which takes place before God, each individual must recognize his own faults, confess his sins and place himself in the hands of the One who is our Intercessor before the Father, Jesus Christ\" ( UUS 82) [my italics]. 23 \"The 'dialogue of conversion' with the Father on the part of each Community , with the full acceptance of all that it demands, is the basis of fraternal relations which will be some- thing more than a mere cordial understanding or external sociability. The bonds of frater- nal koinonia must be forged before God and in Christ Jesus\" ( UUS 82) [my italics].299 Conversion : Key Concept or Hot Potato in Ecumenism ? in Ut unum sint . The other features are taken up as positive aspects of conver- sion. Here, a spiritual aspect is highlighted for the first time as being in keeping with 'Christian conversion'. It is developed into a 'dialogue of conversion' in the context of spiritual ecumenism. However, what is clearly not yet within the focus of Ut unum sint is the situation that is dealt with in the ecumenical text Christian Witness in a Multi- religious World: Recommendations for Conduct , which was jointly published in 2011 by the Ponti fical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, the World Council of Churches, and, at the invitation of the latter, the World Evangelical Alliance. 24 In a worldwide multi-religious context, this text addresses the newly critical situation of the conversion of Christians by other Christians. It focuses on the practical consequences and is less concerned with the topical issue of dou- ble religious belonging 25 than with the blunt fact of 'sheep stealing' by other Christian communities. Although it had been hoped that, through the mod- ern ecumenical movement, the competitiveness of former mission strategies had been superseded, this clearly was not the case. For indeed there has been a con flicting understanding of evangelism, conversion and proselytism that causes, once more, severe ecumenical problems similar to those at the begin- ning of the ecumenical movement. Some Christians think it is appropriate to also include the members of other churches in their evangelising e fforts. They justify their attempts by pointing out that, despite being baptized, these Christians are only 'nominal' or 'lukewarm' and need to be re-evangelized and converted to the Saviour. On a worldwide scale, this practice causes a lot of tensions. As the text argues, \"Christians fighting among themselves to convert baptized Christians and others pose a serious missiological and ecumenical problem\". 26 Such forms of proselytism hinder a common witness and enhance Christian disunity. \"This situation requires the disciples of Jesus to seek mutual conversion before converting others\". 27 Meanwhile, the current conversion debate resulted in a 24 World Council of Churches/ Ponti fical Council for Interreligious Dialogue/World Evan- gelical Alliance, a for Con- duct (2011): <https://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-programmes/in ter religious-dialogue-and-cooperation/christian-identity-in-pluralistic-societies/chris tian-witness-in-a-multi-religious-world> (Accessed 11 July 2015. 25 Cf.

It caused inter-religious distrust and con flicts, since the established Christian churches sought to be left alone, while other religions and proselytizing Christian groups demanded the free- dom to propagate their message. It sparked both a human rights debate and a legal battle - with local political leaders politicizing the conversion debate and human rights organizations, as well as some western governments intervening, in favour of religious freedom. In this situation, Christian Witness in a Multi-religious World seeks to over- come and minimize the controversies and tensions related to Christian mission and conversion by an ethical approach. In doing so, it lays out twelve principles for Christian witness in ful filling Christ's commission in a multi-religious con- text. 28 As a practical guide, the text concludes with six recommendations: Christians are asked to study the issues mentioned in the document with an eye to formulating guidelines relevant to Christian witness, if possible ecumeni- cally, and in consultation with representatives of other religions. Christians are asked to build relationships of respect and trust among churches and other reli- gious communities to overcome suspicions and breaches of trust. They are encouraged to strengthen their own religious identity and faith and deepen their knowledge of other religions. They should cooperate with other religions for jus- tice and the common good, call on governments to respect religious freedom, and pray for all neighbours . Since these recommendations were thought necessary by the bodies draft- ing Christian Witness in a Multi-religious World , it seems quite clear that conversion still remains one of the hottest issues to be tackled in an ecumeni- cal context. And this is not only true of 'communal' or 'confessional' conversion that might be ecumenically decisive and an instrument to foster ecumenism, but also of the conversion of individuals as long as the distinction between converting and proselytising is blurred. 28 These are acting in God's love; imitating Jesus Christ; Christian virtues; acts of service and justice; discernment in ministries of healing; rejection of violence; freedom of religion and belief; mutual respect and solidarity; respect for all people; renouncing false witness; ensuring personal discernment; and building inter-religious relations (4-5).301 Conversion : Key Concept or Hot Potato in Ecumenism ? 4 Conversion as (Self-)Renewal and Reform: Some Future Tasks for the Roman Catholic Church When, during one of their recent ad limina visits, the African bishops com- plained about the proselytizing of Charismatic and Pentecostal groups, Pope Francis is reported to have told them to ask themselves what might be lacking in the Roman Catholic Church. 29As we have seen in Ut unum sint , the potential for self-criticism and self-renewal in ecumenical exchange with others seems severely underdeveloped. Simultaneously, however, there is a clear priority of unity. Similar to conversion, the movement towards unity is a process. In 2006 Pope Benedict still pointed out: \"we must tolerate the separation that exists. St Paul says that divisions are necessary for a certain time and that the Lord knows why: to test us, to train us, to develop us, to make us more humble. But at the same time, we are obliged to move towards unity, and moving towards unity is already a form of unity\". 30 That we are travelling 'towards' unity together rather than 'back to' unity is what conversion towards Christ means. In this context, J\u00fcrgen Moltmann deplores the fact that the aim of ecumenical dialogue is no longer identi fied as 'unity and renewal' , but only as 'unity'. 31 How far does 'ecumenical' conversion, understood as the conversion of all dialogue partners to Jesus Christ, need to go hand in hand with renewal and reform, especially in a re flexive sense? This seems a question that the Roman Catholic Church needs to learn to answer, despite the many o fficial assertions of an indispensable link between conversion and the willingness to reform that already exists. And this needs to be done in practice in order to retain ecu- menical credibility in the future. Conversion can never just concern only the others. It never happens with- out self-renewal. This comprises the revision of former attitudes and tenets. Pope Francis's apostolic exhortation Evangelii gaudium (EG) seems to lay the 29 Cf. W. Kasper, Papa Francesco: La riv Queriniana, 2015), 86. XVI, To the Clergy of Rome (2006): <http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/ en/speeches/2006/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060302_roman-clergy.html> (Accessed 28 July 2015). 31 als Ziel geblieben\".302 Mayer foundations for such a revision. 32 It propagates a church of dialogue mirroring the dialogue of God with his people (cf. EG 143). It suggests, as an image for unity, \"not the sphere, which is no greater than its parts, where every point is equidistant from the centre, and there are no di fferences between them. Instead, it [suggests] the polyhedron, which re flects the convergence of all its parts, each of which preserves its distinctiveness\" ( EG 236). It acknowledges that a structural conversion not only means a re-interpretation of structures but also an actual restructuring and goes even as far as contemplating \"a con- version of the papacy\" ( EG 32). Recalling John Paul II's attempt to find \"a way of exercising the primacy which, while in no way renouncing what is essential to its mission\" ( UUS 95), the current pope states: \"We have made little progress in this regard\" ( EG 32). It is to be hoped that such progress is made soon and that equally soon this process of conversion can no longer be reversed. In any case, conversion as a key ecumenical concept remains a 'hot potato' not just because of a few individual conversions but, first of all, because within an ecumenical context the di fferent meanings of conversion (i.e. moving from one church to another and the fundamental principle of conversion to God) are not su fficiently distinguished; secondly, because of abuses that tend towards proselytism among Christians; and, last but not least, because by its very nature, conversion is a challenge to Christian life.

The 1993 Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism rightly interprets the \"change of heart\" , which the Decree on Ecumenism sees as the soul of the movement, in this sense: In the ecumenical movement it is necessary to give priority to conversion of heart, spiritual life and its renewal. \"This change of heart and holiness of life, along with public and private prayer for the unity of Christians, should be regarded as the soul of the whole ecumenical movement, and can rightly be called 'spiritual ecumenism'\" ( UR, n. 8). Individual Christians, therefore, insofar as they live a genuine spiritual life with Christ the Saviour as its centre and the glory of God the Father as its goal, can always and everywhere share deeply in the ecumenical movement, witnessing to the Gospel of Christ with their lives (Cf. ibid., n. 7). In this text, conversion is understood as an act of individual Christians. In a similar way, the division of Christian churches and ecclesial communions is considered to be the result of the sinful behaviour of individual Christians. Although their sins a ffect and wound the Church, one cannot say that the Church as such is sinful, but her members are. Saying that the Church itself is guilty of the sin of division would seem to contradict the creedal formula that asserts the holiness of the Church of Christ. Or, as the International Theological Commission put it in its 1999 document Memory and Reconciliation : From a theological point of view, Vatican II distinguishes between the indefectible fidelity of the Church and the weaknesses of her members, clergy or laity, yesterday and today ( GS, 43 \u00a76), and therefore, between the Bride of Christ \"with neither blemish nor wrinkle ... holy the and Method of ARCIC III immaculate\" (cf. Eph 5:27), and her children, pardoned sinners, called to permanent metanoia , to renewal in the Holy Spirit. \"The Church, embrac- ing sinners in her bosom, is at the same time holy and always in need of puri fication and incessantly pursues the path of penance and renewal\" (LG, 8; cf. UR, 6).1 Conversion, therefore, can be understood as the turning of a sinner to God (cf. the Hebrew Biblical term b and the Greek epistrephein ). In the quoted texts, 'conversion' is not understood in the sense of pagans leaving their past way of life and embracing the Christian faith, but in a more special sense: \"Men are converted when, by the in fluence of divine grace in their souls, their whole life is changed, old things pass away, and all things become new\". 2 Or, as Arhur D. Nock de fined it: \"The reorientation of the soul of the individual, his deliberate turning from indi fference or from an earlier form of piety to another, a turning which implies a consciousness that a great change is involved, that the old was wrong and the new is right\". 3 Hence, conversion can be seen as a (spiritual) movement within the person consisting of the following components: an act of introspection leading to (1a) the awareness that the way one lives is wrong and sinful (contrition), and (1b) eventually to the confession before others (God or humans) of that sinful state, together with a request for pardon (repen- tance) and (2) to a turn towards God, finding expression in a (more or less) radical change of mind and life in order to ful fil more fully the will of God (change in behaviour and attitudes). The first moment looks back to the past and the present, whereas the second component looks out towards the future. Conversion cannot be reduced to the first component of contrition, repen- tance and confession. It should be completed by a real change of mind and life. Feelings of guilt and repentance alone cannot be called 'conversion'. No one can deny that the personal conversion of the members of the churches is an integral part of the ecumenical movement; yet, the ecumenical movement also contains a corporative and institutional dimension. The Dutch Reformed theologian Van Ruler has formulated the problem of the institu- tional character of the ecumenical problem in a very lucid way. According to 1 International Theological Commission ( ITC), Memory and Reconciliation: The Church and the Faults of the Past (1999), 1,2. In 5,3 the ITC speaks of the \"sin of division\": \"To the extent that some Catholics are pleased to remain bound to the separations of the past, doing nothing to remove the obstacles that impede unity, one could justly speak of solidarity in the sin of divi- sion\" (cf. 1 Cor 1:10-16). 2 Cf. <http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/conversion/> (Accessed 14 August 2015). 3 Cf. A.D. Nock, Conversion: The Old and New in Religion from Alexander the Great to Augustine of Hippo (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1933), 7.306 Denaux him, the ecumenical problem is the problem of the division of the Church. The division of the Church is in essence a division of institutions. Even where there is agreement with respect to the content and practice of faith, churches remain institutionally divided. The main ecumenical problem is the organisational, institutional forms of the Church. With respect to this present situation, there are three possible attitudes. Either one church summons other Christians to return: this is the possibility of pretension . Or, secondly, one can resign oneself to the incompre- hensible multiplicity of churches: this is the possibility of resignation . Finally, one can strive towards one Church, which is one both in a numerical sense and in a visible organisational sense: this is the possibility of perseverance . When longing for the unity of Christianity, one has to realise that what one longs for needs to take a 'form'. The united Church will, in one way or another, take a confessional and liturgical form, but also a form of church order. We will not reach that goal only with dialogues, collaboration, common worship, exchange of preachers, open communion or inter-communion. We need to be one people, living in full communion. Perhaps for the time being, one may have to settle for a kind of federation of confessions or churches. Finally, how- ever, one has to accept that the \"church orderly\" tunic of the body of Christ should be \"seamless, woven in one piece from top down\". For the sin of 'divi- sion' , there is but one kind of healing possible. That is, to see clearly that the heart of the ecumenical problem lies in disunity of the institutional dimension of the Church. We have to be willing to continually hammer on the anvil of institutional uni fication and, in the meantime, to have the courage and the joy to be an institutional Church. 4 The ecumenical movement tries to bring corporate bodies, churches and ecclesial communions to visible, sacramental and institutional unity. The divi- sion of churches is against the will of God. Division is a sin. Unity is what God wants (John 17). One could say that the divided churches are in a state of sin, in as far as they stick to their confessional identity without the will to change. Hence, a more corporate form of conversion, i.e. an ecclesial conversion, is also needed. It seems to us that certain developments in the last decades point in that direction. 4 A.A. van Ruler, De betekenis van het institutaire 176-200, esp. 194-197. We summarise here a larger description of van Ruler's position in our paper: Holy Spirit, Authority and Unity , A. Denaux, D. Donnelly, J. Famer\u00e9e (eds.), The Holy Spirit and Ecumenism: Proceedings of the Conference Organized by the Card. Suenens Center at Bose (Italy), 14-20 October (Leuven: Peeters, 2005), 265-285.307 Receptive Ecumenism and the Mandate and Method of ARCIC III Two Texts That Look Ahead Shortly before and after the publication of the Directory, two texts were pub- lished that already expressed the idea that the Church as a whole should not only search for continual puri fication and renewal, but also be ready for con- version. In his 1995 encyclical Ut unum sint , Pope John Paul II notion of 'social sins' and of 'sinful structures' that need conversion (par. 34): Even after the many sins which have contributed to our historical divi- sions, Christian unity is possible , provided that we are humbly conscious of having sinned against unity and are convinced of our need for conver- sion. Not only personal sins must be forgiven and left behind, but also social sins, which is to say the sinful \"structures\" themselves which have contributed and can still contribute to division and to the reinforcing of division. Of course, elsewhere the Pope states that 'social sin' is an analogous concept that should be used with caution. 5 But in paragraph 84 of his encyclical, he states that even communities can be converted: The experience of ecumenism has enabled us to understand this better. If, in the interior spiritual space described above, Communities are able truly to \"be converted\" to the quest for full and visible communion, God will do for them what he did for their Saints. He will overcome the obsta- cles inherited from the past and will lead Communities along his paths to where he wills: to the visible koinonia which is both praise of his glory and service of his plan of salvation. Four years earlier the informal ecumenical dialogue Groupe des Dombes , con- sisting of Protestant and Roman Catholic members, published a common 5 I quote from International Theological Commission ( ITC), Memory and Reconciliation: The Church and the Faults of the Past (1999), 1.3: \"John Paul II also promoted the deeper theological exploration of the idea of taking responsibility for the wrongs of the past and of possibly ask- ing forgiveness from one's contemporaries, when in the Exhortation Reconciliatio et paeniten- tia [1984], he states that in the sacrament of Penance \"the sinner stands alone before God with his sin, repentance, and trust. No one can repent in his place or ask forgiveness in his name\". Sin is therefore always personal, even though it wounds the entire Church (Ibid., 31) ... Also the situations of \"social sin\" - which are evident in the human community when justice, freedom, and peace are damaged - are always \"the result of the accumulation and concentra- tion of many personal sins\". While moral responsibility may become diluted in anonymous causes, one can only speak of social sin by way of analogy (Ibid., 16).308 Denaux statement Pour la conversion des \u00c9glises. 6 In this document, a link is made between the question of confessional identities and the need for conversion. The group di fferentiates three types of identities and corresponding con- versions. The first type is 'Christian identity' by which they mean one's belonging to Christ founded on the gift of Baptism. The corresponding Christian conversion means the response of faith to the call that comes to us from God through Christ. The second type is 'ecclesial identity and ecclesial conversion'. Ecclesial identity means the belonging of an individual or of a confessional church to the 'one holy, catholic' Church. Ecclesial conversion means the e ffort required from the whole church and from all churches to be renewed and become more capable of ful filling their mission in accordance with the motto ecclesia semper reformanda. The third type is 'confessional identity and confessional conversion'. Confessional identity means belonging to a confessional church with its speci fic cultural and historical context and its own spiritual and doctrinal profile. By confessional conversion the group understands the ecumeni- cal e ffort by which a Christian confession cleanses and enriches its own inheritance with the aim of rediscovering full communion with other confessions (vide 29). 7 The main problem today is that the divided churches fear losing their con- fessional identity, when they engage in a structural path into the ecumenical movement. Hence, there is a growing tendency among the churches to stick to their confessional identities and refuse structural changes in the way their ecclesial life is organised. Ecumenical progress, however, will be dependent on the readiness of the divided churches to partially give up their confessional identities, while at the same time preserving their ecclesial and Christian identity. This will require from all of the churches at least a real confessional 'conversion'. In what follows, we will examine some developments which point in the same direction, i.e. that ecclesial bodies take initiatives which imply accepting 6 Groupe des Dombes, Communion et conversion des \u00c9glises: \u00c9dition int\u00e9grale des documents publi\u00e9s de 1956 \u00e0 2005 (Collection Compact) (Montrouge: Bayard, 2014), 233-338; English trans- lation: Groupe des Dombes, For the Conversion of the Churches (Geneva: W orld Council of Churches Publications, 1993); and C.

More speci fically, we will explore the opportunities these devel- opments o ffer to the actual dialogue between the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church ( ARCIC III). 2 Ecclesial Repentance The first development we want to consider is the practice of ecclesial repen- tance. Jeremy M. Bergen de fines ecclesial repentance as \"the act in which the church/denominational bodies make o fficial statements of repentance, apol- ogy, confession or requests for forgiveness for those things which were once official church policy or practice\". 8 This is a relatively new phenomenon, which only started in the twentieth century: \"Indeed, in the entire history of the Church there are no precedents for requests for forgiveness by the Magisterium for past wrongs. Councils and papal decrees applied sanctions, to be sure, to abuses of which clerics and laymen were found guilty, and many pastors sincerely strove to correct them. However, the occasions when ecclesi- astical authorities - Pope, Bishops, or Councils - have openly acknowledged the faults or abuses which they themselves were guilty of have been quite rare\" , the Dutch Pope and former Leuven university professor Adrian VI (1521-1522) being a notable exception. 9 In recent decades, we have seen that churches or denominational bodies in North America, Western Europe and Australia as well as ecumenical bod- ies such as the World Council of Churches' Faith and Order have published statements of ecclesial repentance. These actions from churches are part of a larger phenomenon: \"These churchly actions have elicited considerable inter- est and controversy both within the repenting denominations and among the public at large. In part, this is due to a broader trend in which the collective apology is employed in political, legal and business spheres (while celebrities 8 J.M. Bergen, Ecclesial Repentance.

Sharkey and T. Weinandy (San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2009), 187-228, esp. 191: \"One famous example is furnished by the reforming Pope Adrian VI who acknowledged publicly in a message to the Diet of Nuremberg of November 25, 1522: \"the abominations, the abuses ... and the lies\" of which the \"Roman court\" of this time was guilty, \"deep-rooted and extensive ... sickness\" , ex- tending \"from the top to the members\". See the text in Appendix.310 Denaux seek to outdo each other in o ffering profuse apologies for various misdeeds). Governments and nations debate if and when apologies should be o ffered for past wrongs and scholars address what they mean. Victims of historical injustices, or their heirs, quite rightly seek recognition of their su ffering and correction, often in the form of apologies and reparations\". 10 One can also see that the faults for which churches make statements of repentance are varied. It can be made for sins in general; the use of methods contrary to the Gospel 'in the service of the truth' (violence, intolerance etc.); the disunity of Christians: sins which have rent the unity of the Body of Christ; offences against the Jewish People, the people of the Covenant and the bless- ings; the ways that the weakest groups in society, such as immigrants and itinerants, have been harmed by hatred and the desire to dominate others; and sins against human dignity, particularly against women. Other reasons for expressing ecclesial repentance have been: sins against the rights of the person - victims of abuse, the poor, those killed by abortion and those 'exploited for experimental purposes by those who ... distort the aims of science'; o ffences against aboriginal people (Canada, Australia); slavery and /or racism; apart- heid in South Africa; clergy sexual abuse; war, civil war, crusades; conduct towards homosexual people; and others (Galileo; the Inquisition; support of eugenics). 11 We provide below some examples of ecclesial repentance with respect to the disunity of churches. The Lambeth Conference 1920, Resolution 9, Reunion of Christendom In 1920, the Lambeth Conference adopted and sent out the following Appeal to all Christian people: We, Archbishops, Bishops Metropolitan, and other Bishops of the Holy Catholic Church in full communion with the Church of England, in Con- ference assembled, realising the responsibility which rests upon us at this time, and sensible of the sympathy and the prayers of many, both within 10 Bergen, Ecclesial Repentance , 3-4. 11 See a survey Repentance , 307-331. See also L. Accattoli, When a Pope Asks Forgiveness: The Mea Culpa's of John Paul II, trans. J. Aumann (Boston: Pauline Books & Media Center, 1998). The Survey includes a Preface, An Examination of Conscience (xv- xxix); Part One: Historical and Ecumenical Precedents (1-80); Part Two: Pronouncements by John Paul II (80-253; including notes). Interestingly, Accattoli observes that the \"'con- fession of sin' was first expressed by the Protestants, and for a long time the Catholic Church refused to do the same\" (11). Later the Catholics, especially under John Paul II, became one of its greatest protagonists.311 Receptive Ecumenism and the Mandate and Method of ARCIC III and without our own Communion, make this appeal to all Christian people. We acknowledge all those who believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, and have been baptized into the name of the Holy Trinity, as sharing with us membership in the universal Church of Christ which is his Body. We believe that the Holy Spirit has called us in a very solemn and special manner to associate ourselves in penitence and prayer with all those who deplore the divisions of Christian people, and are inspired by the vision and hope of a visible unity of the whole Church .... [...] The causes of division lie deep in the past, and are by no means simple or wholly blameworthy. Yet none can doubt that self-will, ambi- tion, and lack of charity among Christians have been principal factors in the mingled process, and that these, together with blindness to the sin of disunion, are still mainly responsible for the breaches of Christendom. We acknowledge this condition of broken fellowship to be contrary to God's will, and we desire frankly to confess our share in the guilt of thus crippling the Body of Christ and hindering the activity of his Spirit. 12 According to J.M. Bergen, \"The statement is notable as the first confession of the sin of division by an o fficial organ of one of the divided churches\". 13 It is also notable for speaking about \"the sin of division\" and for seeing \"self-will, ambition and lack of charity\" as main causes of maintaining the \"breaches of Christendom\". Pope Paul VI (1963-1978) Jeremy Bergen is aware that already \"Adrian VI (1522-1523) deplored the faults of his times, precisely those of his immediate predecessor Leo X (1513-1521) and his curia, without, however, adding a request for pardon\". Nevertheless, he adds that \"it would be necessary to wait until Paul VI to find a pope who expressed a request for pardon addressed as much to God as to a group of con- temporaries. In his address at the opening of the second period of the Second Vatican Council (1963), the Pope asked \"pardon of God ... and of the separated brethren\" of the East who may have felt o ffended \"by us\" (the Roman Catholic Church), and declared himself ready for his part to pardon o ffences received. 14 12 <http://www.methodist.org.uk/downloads/ec-1920-Lambeth.pdf> (Accessed 17 August 2015). 13 Bergen, Ecclesial Repentance , 22. 14 \"If we are in any way to blame for that separation, we humbly beg God's forgiveness. And we ask pardon too of our brethren who feel themselves to have been injured by us. For our 312 Denaux In the view of Paul VI, both the request for and o ffer of pardon concerned solely the sin of the division between Christians and presupposed reciprocity. 15 Second Vatican Ecumenical Council (1962-1965) In its decree on ecumenism, the Council was aware of the ecumenical potential of a mea culpa . In article seven, the 1964 conciliar decree Unitatis redinte gratio affirms that the witness of 1 John 1:10 also applies to \"sins against unity\" , and then says: \"We therefore, in humble prayer, beg pardon of God and of our sepa- rated brethren, just as we forgive them that trespass against us\". This request for pardon is part of what has been called \"spiritual ecumenism\" , recognizing that the actual division of the churches is a sin and that metanoia and prayer are essential parts of ecumenism. Just like Christian spirituality, ecumenism needs to be rooted in conversion: Requesting pardon of 'separated brethren' was a means by which to remove a barrier to dialogue and enter into a spirit of humility, openness and willingness to hear the other. In this light, the request for forgiveness paired with an o ffer of forgiveness may be interpreted as an example of the give and take of a true dialogue. But what is the nature and meaning of the trespasses that led to separation? These would be discussed in actual dialogues with other churches and, through an attempt to view history through the eyes of another, further repentance. 16 John Paul II (1978-2005) 17 In line with Paul VI and Vatican II, John Paul II18 renewed expressions of regret for the 'sorrowful memories' that mark the history of the divisions among Christians. He also extended a request for forgiveness to several historical events in which the Church, or individual groups of Christians, were variously implicated. Furthermore, in his Apostolic Letter Tertio millennio adveniente (nrs. 33-36), the Pope introduced a new aspect: he expressed the hope that the Jubilee of 2000 might be the occasion for a 'puri fication of the memory' of the part, we willingly forgive the injuries which the Catholic Church has su ffered, and forget the grief endured during the long series of dissensions and separations\" (quoted from Bergen, Ecclesial Repentance , 23). 15 ITC, Memory and (n\u00b0 1,1). 16 Bergen, Ecclesial Repentance , 24. 17 See L. Accattoli, When a Asks Forgiveness . 18 In Ut unum sint , 88, John Paul II reminds us that the memory of most other Christians is marked by certain painful recollections and then says: \"To the extent that we are respon- sible for these, I join my Predecessor Paul VI in asking forgiveness\".313 Receptive Ecumenism and the Mandate and Method of ARCIC III Church through repentance ( TMA , 33).19 The Roman Catholic Church's Day of Pardon on the first Sunday of Lent, 12 March 2000, on the occasion of the Jubilee and the new millennium, was an impressive expression of the inten- tion of the Church to repent for the past sins of its members. 20 Pope Francis In his Address to the Delegation from the Czech Republic , on the Occasion of the 600th Anniversary of the Death of Jan Hus on Monday 15 June 2015, Pope Francis said: Six centuries have passed since the day that the renowned preacher and Rector of the University of Prague, Jan Hus, died tragically. Previously in 1999, St John Paul II, in an interv ening international symposium dedi- cated to this memorable figure, expressed his \"profound regret for the cruel death in flicted [on him]\" , and he numbered him among the 19 ITC, Memory and Reconciliation , 193 (n\u00b0 1.3): \"33. Hence it is appropriate that, as the Sec- ond Millennium of Christianity draws to a close, the Church should become more fully conscious of the sinfulness of her children, recalling all those times in history when they departed from the spirit of Christ and his Gospel and, instead of o ffering to the world the witness of a life inspired by the values of faith, indulged in ways of thinking and acting which were truly forms of counter-witness and scandal. ... It is fitting that the Church should make this passage with a clear awareness of what has happened to her during the last ten centuries. She cannot cross the threshold of the new millennium without encour- aging her children to purify themselves, through repentance, of past errors and instances of in fidelity, inconsistency, and slowness to act . Acknowledging the weaknesses of the past is an act of honesty and courage which helps us to strengthen our faith, which alerts us to face today's temptations and challenges and prepares us to meet them. 34. Among the sins which require a greater commitment to repentance and conversion should certainly be counted those which have been detrimental to the unity willed by God for his People. In the course of the thousand years now drawing to a close, even more than in the first mil- lennium, ecclesial communion has been painfully wounded, a fact 'for which, at times, men of both sides were to blame'. Such wounds openly contradict the will of Christ and are a cause of scandal to the world. These sins of the past unfortunately still burden us and remain ever present temptations. It is necessary to make amends for them, and ear- nestly to beseech Christ's forgiveness\". 20 This consisted of a papal mass concelebrated with 30 cardinals and bishops. \"A 'Universal Prayer' , in which invitatories read by seven cardinals or archbishops for seven kinds of sin were followed each time with a prayer by the pope, constituted the core act of asking God's forgiveness. The service concluded with a series of promises by the pope on behalf of the church to never again commit certain o ffences\"; cf. Bergen, Ecclesial Repentance , 116. For the seven kinds of sin, see paragraph 3 of part II of this paper (the seven sins first named).314 Denaux Reformers of the Church. In the light of this approach, the study must continue on the person and activity of Jan Hus, who for a long time was the subject of contention among Christians, however today he has become a reason for dialogue. This research, carried out without condi- tioning of an ideological type, will be an important service to the historical truth, to all Christians and to the whole society, even beyond the bound- aries of your Nation. 21 And at an o fficial event at the Vatican on the previous Friday, Pope Francis commented on the speech that he was preparing for a ceremony of religious reconciliation and forgiveness that would be taking place on the Monday after- noon at the Nepomuk Papal College in Rome. The pope said that Hus's burning at the stake, after refusing to recant his alleged heresy, was an injury to the Church itself. It is an occasion where the Church should ask forgiveness for it, as should be done for all the acts in history when killings had been committed in the name of God. He referred speci fically to the Thirty Years War, which in particular devastated the Czech lands and much of the rest of Europe in the early seventeenth century. 22 In a similar way, Pope Francis, during his visit to the Waldensian temple in Turin on Monday 22 June 2015, asked for forgiveness for the Roman Catholic Church's treatment in the past of the Waldensians: Unfortunately, it happened and continues to occur that brothers do not accept their di fferences and end up making war against one another. By reflecting on the history of our relations, we cannot help but be saddened by the disputes and acts of violence committed in the name of our faith, and I ask that the Lord grant us the grace to recognize ourselves all as sin- ners and to be able to forgive one another. It is by the initiative of God, who never resigns himself to the sin of man, that new ways open to expe- rience our fraternity, and we cannot escape it. On behalf of the Catholic Church I ask your forgiveness. I ask your forgiveness for unchristian-like and even inhuman attitudes and conduct which, historically, we have had against you. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, forgive us!\" 23 21 <http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2015/june/documents/papa-fran cesco _20150615 22 valdese.html> (Accessed 17 August 2015).315 Receptive Ecumenism and the Mandate and Method of ARCIC III Problems and Implications The recent practice of ecclesial repentance is not without problems and asks for some clari fications. Firstly, a varied terminology is used: mea Culpa , ecclesial repentance, apology, puri fication/reconciliation of memories. The expression 'ecclesial repentance' is the most fitting, because it makes clear that this has to do with a corporative event, even when an individual church leader speaks for the church as a whole, and that this event may be part of a larger conversion process. The expression \" mea culpa \" sounds rather personal and is less appropriate for what is meant here. The 'puri fication/reconciliation of memories' can be understood as part of the ecclesial repentance. Secondly, an exact knowledge of the facts is required before asking for for- giveness (historical dimension). The historical truth may be di fferent from the historical perception of both parties involved and this perception has suf- fered from the prejudices of biased historians, both Catholic and other. Hence, the history confessed must be a true account of the past, not a biased history projected by the other party or by both churches involved. A question can be asked: Is it possible to have an accurate account of the history of the past, given that every history is inevitably told from a particular perspective? Thirdly, whose guilt does the church confess? Its own, or that of its mem- bers? Sin is a personal reality. Therefore, technically speaking, the Church as such cannot sin, since we believe in the 'Holy' Church (creed). How can this belief be related to the fact that members of the Church (bishops and popes included) have committed sins against the unity of the Church, which still affect the Church today in such a measure that \"the Church\" as one subject asks for forgiveness and seems to assume the sin of its members just as Christ, the Holy one, has taken upon Himself the sin of humankind (theological dimension)? 24 Fourthly, \"the past exerts its in fluence on the present in the form of memory, especially the 'common memory' that carries the burden on conscience 24 My Anglican friend and member of ARCIC III, Charles Sherlock, made the following com- ment on this question: \"Here I'd want to distinguish the Church as the object of faith - credo ecclesiam unam sanctam - the 'Church mystical' , seen through the eyes of faith, as Hooker would put it, and the churches / Church universal, seen through the eyes of sight. The former is the spotless Bride, an eschatological reality in both theological and tempo- ral senses - that towards which God is God's people, as the key aspect of the new creation in Christ. The latter is the necessarily finite, and thus under the reign of sin and death - a position to which your citations of popes seem to me to come increasingly close, but a step which Rome has thus far not quite taken. In teaching and preaching, I often make the point that we must see God's people, especially as gathered in a particular congregation, in both ways at the same time, or we either become cynical or remain too idealistic!\"316 Denaux (Nostra aetate , 3). Because these scandals are remembered, their negative effects continue in the present\". 25 The International Theological Commission has given a thoughtful description of how these bad memories of the past might be puri fied: Purifying the memory means eliminating from personal and collective conscience all forms of resentment or violence left by the inheritance of the past, on the basis of a new and rigorous historical-theological judg- ment, which becomes the foundation for a renewed moral way of acting. This occurs whenever it becomes possible to attribute to past historical deeds a di fferent quality, having a new and di fferent e ffect on the present, in view of progress in reconciliation in truth, justice, and charity among human beings and, in particular, between the Church and the di fferent religious, cultural, and civil communities with whom she is related. Emblematic models of such an e ffect, which a later authoritative inter- pretative judgment may have for the entire life of the Church, are the reception of the Councils or acts like the abolition of mutual anathemas. These express a new assessment of past history, which is capable of pro- ducing a di fferent characterization of the relationships lived in the present. The memory of division and opposition is puri fied and substi- tuted by a reconciled memory, to which everyone in the Church is invited to be open and to become educated. 26 Some may think that there is more at stake here than just memory. 27 It is a fact that we are not united. The seed of division that was sown remains with us still. Hence, the question is whether going back to see who sowed it, and determin- ing how and why it was sown, will really help us, especially as we were not actors at the time? Should we not rather focus on what we want to become and let byg ones be bygones? We might think of God's own memory of our sins: He remembers them no more! Fifthly, lest 'ecclesial repentance' remains a purely verbal act, the Church should commit itself to change things, to develop a particular action to restore or, if possible, to undo the wrong practices of the past. Sixthly, ecumenical dialogue can play an important role in the examination of conscience: one side may recognize its own failings only in the light of how others see us. 25 Bergen, Ecclesial Repentance , 126. 26 ITC, Memory and Reconciliation , 216 (n\u00b0 5,1). 27 We received this re flection from Sister Teresa Okure, member of ARCIC III.317 Receptive Ecumenism and the Mandate and Method of ARCIC III Finally, according to some, we should add a scriptural or Gospel dimension to the historical and theological dimensions. 28 This perspective will be that of the recognition of the impossibility of making amends for the past (especially when we were not the actors). In light of this, we should focus on both our individual and corporate responsibility as well as our accountability for the Gospel of Jesus and the Gospel, who is Jesus. Readiness to forgive wrongs done is at the centre to the Gospel itself. The entire Christ-event concretizes, incar- nates and sums it up. If we are truly his followers, whether as Catholics or Anglicans, we should each assume the responsibility of ensuring that our par- ticular interests do not stand in the way of the Gospel. 3 The Mandate and Method of ARCIC III In 2011, the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission ( ARCIC ) started its third phase of dialogue. 29 The Preparatory Commission for the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission formulated the mandate of ARCIC III in terms that the Standing Committee of the Anglican Communion and the Ponti fical Council for Promoting Christian Unity then presented. At this point in the ecumenical journey, they charged the Commission with undertaking a third phase of its work. They stated that \"from the beginning of the dialogue, the commitment of the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church has been to seek 'restoration of complete communion in faith and sacramental life'\". 30 This goal and this commitment have not changed. Nevertheless, we charge ARCIC with re-examining how, in the light of our common journey over more than forty years, this goal is understood and this commitment pursued today. They also asked the Commission to promote the reception of its previous work by pre- senting the work of ARCIC as a corpus, with an appropriate introduction. On the basis of the mandate expressed in the 2006 Common Declaration of Pope Benedict XVI and Archbishop Rowan Williams, they a ffirmed the two interrelated areas as critical for further work: the Church as Communion, local and universal, and how in communion the local and universal Church may come to discern right ethical teaching . In both areas, the Commission was asked to build on the already agreed statements of the first two phases of dialogue. 28 We again thank Sister Teresa Okure for this suggestion. 29 Cf. Programme for ARCIC III. ARCIC III Paper 2011.05.02. 30 1966 Common Declaration of Pope Paul VI and Archbishop Michael Ramsey.318 Denaux The methodology of ARCIC is an ev olving reality that could be divided into four stages. 31 I will discuss each of these stages here: A hermeneutics of overcoming doctrinal division by going to the origins : The initial mandate was to \"inaugurate between the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion a serious dialogue that, founded on the Gospels and on the ancient common traditions , may lead to that unity in truth, for which Christ prayed\". In the first, 'classic' phase, the Commission made signi ficant progress by working together from the scriptures and ancient common tradi- tions and, as time went on, developing the theology of koinonia. This employed fresh language to 'get behind the past' , while continuing to be nourished in a real, yet imperfect, communion. Such an approach produced much fruit around issues arising from the divisions of the Reformation, and o ffered new perspectives for church authorities to consider. Still, it was impotent to resolve issues which arose since the breach of communion. An eschatological hermeneutics : The doctrinal hermeneutic of ARCIC II, as in its later 'Agreed Statements' , thus deepens ARCIC 's classic method by orienting it to working backwards from the future, as well as forwards from the past. This can be seen in the \"patterning power of the kingdom\" vision of Life in Christ , the 'Yes/Amen' and reception motifs in The Gift of Authority , and especially the 'reversal' of Romans 8:30 in Mary: Grace and Hope in Christ . In taking an eschatological perspective into its hermeneutic, the Commission recognised that reconciliation can only come about as an act of hope and faith, as a graced response to the divine initiative. Above all, ARCIC II's call for mutual re-receptions of treasured traditions cannot be otherwise than a provi- sional expression of divine koinonia . This doctrinal hermeneutic means that our actions in the service of full, visible unity in Christ must be inseparable from mutual openness and deep humility. A hermeneutics of practice : ARCIC III will continue the method of ARCIC I and II so far as possible. It will not only look to what we can say together about the Church as communion, local and universal, and how, in communion, we come to ethical discernment and teaching. It will also explore how our tradi- tions live this ecclesial communion in practice in relation to such things as ecclesial self-understanding, ecclesial structures, processes of decision-mak- ing and of discerning right ethical teaching ( inter alia by case studies). This will include each tradition seeing and recognising in its own communion the shortcomings and problems that hinder us from living more e ffectively and authentically ecclesial communion on the local and universal levels. The latter would be an act of ecclesial repentance. 31 Cf. ARCIC III Papers 2014.05.03 (drafted by A. Denaux).319 Receptive Ecumenism and the Mandate and Method of ARCIC III A hermeneutics of receptive learning : ARCIC III is open for the gifts to be received from each other's tradition that might contribute to overcoming the proper shortcomings. It is a dynamics of receiving and giving gifts, of receiving and giving elements of the Apostolic Tradition, which might have been obscured or forgotten in the course of our wounded histories. The latter two phases were the result of the members' discussion on the use of an appropriate method in the work of ARCIC III. The appointment of Professor Paul Murray as a member of ARCIC has played a decisive role in the decision to emphasise an hermeneutics of practice and of receptive learning. As is known, he is the initiator of the concept of 'receptive ecumenism'. 32 According to him, 'receptive ecumenism' represents a simple yet far-reaching strategy. The basic principle is that ecumenical progress is only possible \"if each of the traditions, both singly and jointly, makes a clear, programmatic shift from prioritising the question, what do our various others first need to learn from us, to asking instead: What do we need to learn and what can we learn - or receive - with integrity from our others?\" 33 Receptive ecumenism wants to extend the call for spiritual ecumenism \"beyond the level of individ- ual learning and growth alone to include also the even more challenging levels of necessary communal, structural and ecclesial conversion\". 34 Murray sees two supporting assumptions behind the need for receptive ecu- menism: first there is the conviction that the call to organic, structural ecclesial unity is still of permanent signi ficance, and next one notices \"the related con- viction that ecumenical theology must today be a matter of praxis ... and not simply a matter, important though it be, of theoretical, conceptual, doctrinal definition and re-imagining\". 35 Receptive ecumenism begins by having the courage to look at the present di fficulties within one's own tradition and then to ask \"how the di fficulties in one's own tradition might, with integrity, be cre- atively addressed and one's tradition accordingly re-imagined in the light of learning from one's signi ficant ecumenical others\". 36 In short, \"we need not 32 See P.D. Murray (ed.), Receptive Ecumenism and the Call to Catholic Learning: Exploring a Way for Contemporary Ecumenism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), particularly Murray, \"Receptive Ecumenism Catholic Learning: 30-45; and P.D. Recognising the Need for an Gear-Change\" , in Christ 45 (2011), 200-211; 2012.06.02. 33 Murray, \"Receptive Ecumenism Learning, 30-45, Ibid., 34. 36 Ibid., 39.320 Denaux just increased mutual understanding and appreciation between traditions [this was mainly the approach of ARIC I and II], but direct, explicit and e ffective self-criticism, growth, development, change-continuing ecclesial conversion to the truth of God in Christ and the Spirit - within each tradition respec- tively\". This should be the approach of ARCIC III.37 4 Conclusions: ARCIC III and Ecclesial Conversion At this juncture, we can integrate the di fferent threads. In the first part of our paper, we have recognised that 'conversion' is at the heart of the ecumenical movement, but that in addition to the personal conversion of individual mem- bers of the Church, there is also a need for an 'ecclesial conversion'. Though 'sinful structures' and 'ecclesial conversion' are analogous concepts, they are nevertheless very e ffective realities in the life of the churches. As Murray puts it: there is a need \"to transpose the ethic of self-criticism and conversion that lies at the heart of Christian life from the level of personal ethic wherein we are used to applying it and to apply it to the collective ecclesial level\". 38 The concepts and practices of 'ecclesial repentance' and of 'receptive ecu- menism' have their own speci fic characteristics, which could be complementary. Ecclesial repentance focuses on the sins and faults of the past, that it honestly 37 Murray, \" ARCIC III: Recognising the Need for an Ecumenical Gear-Change\" , 208. 38 Ibid., 209. In an email of 1 September 2015, Paul Murray drew my attention to a paper he presented to the Catholic Theological Society of America in June 2013 (which is not yet published), entitled: \"Growing into the Fullness of Christ: Receptive Ecumenism as an Instrument of Ecclesial Conversion\". There, he \"draws out the way in which the under- standing of ecclesial and confessional identity at work in Receptive Ecumenism ( RE) is somewhat di fferent from the way in which the Groupe des Dombes (GdesD) thinks about it in For the Conversion of the Churches . For the Groupe des Dombes it is about being pre- pared to relinquish that which distinguishes as a point of separation in order to open a way to a commonality that can be enough to unify. By contrast, for RE it is about each asking what is signi ficant about the distinctive di fferences of the other, and what can even be learned from these in transposed form. The hoped-for result is not a stripping (kenosis) of di fferences towards a greater commonality but a learning across and from dif- ferences such that they might cease to be di fferences of division and become di fferences of fruitful diversity and mutual enrichment. In other words, the di fference in the under- standing of conversion that is at work here (a stripping and reducing, on the one hand, and an intensi fication and expansive growth, on the other hand) is also tied up with a di ffer- ence in how the structural goal of unity is envisaged. For RE the goal is very de finitely a communion of communions and traditions that can recognise each other and speak to each other across abiding di fferences of emphasis and expression\".321 Receptive Ecumenism and the Mandate and Method of ARCIC III confesses and for which it asks forgiveness. Through this, it hopes to come to a puri fication of wounded memories. Receptive ecumenism is more oriented towards recognising present di fficulties in one's own tradition, and by doing this, becoming open to learning from other traditions how to solve these di ffi- culties (through an exchange of gifts). This requires primary focussing on practical and organisational issues at stake. 39 Both practices of ecclesial repentance and receptive ecumenism can be integrated into the more general concept of 'ecclesial conversion'. Above we have distinguished two complementary aspects in the conversion of individual persons: it is an act of introspection both leading to the awareness that the way one lives is wrong and sinful (contrition), and eventually to the confession before others (God or humans) of that sinful state, together with a request for pardon (repentance) and leading to a turn towards God, finding expression in a (more or less) radical change of mind and life in order to ful fil more fully the will of God. In an analogous way these two aspects are also integral to what we call 'ecclesial conversion'. The first aspect is more of a retrospective nature: each confessional tradition should engage in a retrospective examination of conscience of its sinful past and in recognising the di fficulties that are present in its life and practice, confess them before God and the other as sinful and recognise that they prevent us from being fully Christ's Church. It also tries to see the link between the faults of the past and the di fficulties in the present, in order to purify the wounded memories. The second aspect is more of a pro- spective nature: each confessional tradition should be open to a radical change of its confessional identity in a more genuine ecclesial (organisational and sac- ramental) 'form' , through a process of learning and a receiving gifts from other confessions. ARCIC III has the mandate to study the mutual relationship of the local and the universal church and their respective roles in taking right moral decisions. If it is the mandate of ARCIC III to help the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church to come to an 'ecclesial conversion' in this respect, its members should suggest that the mandating Churches start a process of healing the wounded history between them and, therefore, go back to the beginning of the separation between the two churches - to the extent that going back to a very complex beginning is helpful. Indeed, on the one hand, \"the Anglican communion began its separate life in the reign of the English king Henry VIII (d. 1547) when in 1533-34 the Church of fied the 39 Ibid., 209: \"Receptive ecumenism recognises that this means that we need to focus on the organisational structures, processes and cultures of the churches and how they are chal- lenged to learn from each other\".322 Denaux pope and unilaterally asserted its autonomy under God as a local expression of the universal church. This step hardly altered the outward appearance of the church; the old mass, for instance, remained its central liturgy through- out Henry's reign. But the principle of autonomy was an explosive force which led to more profound and extensive changes\". 40 On the other hand, \"if the first cause of the breach was the failure of the Papacy to deal with the conse- quences of the Renaissance of thought by calling a Council, the second was the temporal claims of the Bishops of Rome\". 41 There have been faults on both sides. In a certain sense, the division between Rome and Canterbury is a shared responsibility. In the field of the relationship between the local and the universal Church and their respective governance structures, we might say that the main dif- ficulty to be identi fied on the Anglican side is the principle of provincial auton omy, 42 whereas on the Roman Catholic side, it would be the excessive centralisation resulting from a certain view on the primacy of the Bishop of Rome. 43 If we are to overcome the impasse in which our two churches find themselves (provincial autonomy versus Roman centralization), both commu- nions will have to come to an ecclesial repentance as well as conversion. With this in mind, the following four steps need to be taken: First of all, an honest historical study of the origins, in which the responsi- bility of both parties in the process of separation is described and recognised 40 Dictionary of the Ecumenical Movement , Bonino, P. Webb (eds.) (Gen\u00e8ve/Grand Rapids: World Council of Churches Publications, 2002), 21-22. 41 B. Pawley, M. Pawley, Rome and Canterbury Through Four Centuries: A Study of the Relations between the Church of Rome and the Anglican Churches 1530-1973 ( L o n d o n / O x f o r d : M o w - brays, 1974), 4. 42 The issue can be seen in the reluctance of Anglican Provinces to accept the attempts to come to an 'Anglican Communion Covenant' , in which provinces are invited to give up partly their provincial autonomy in order to come to a more e ffective instrument of com- mon decision on the level of the international Communion. See the text <http://www. anglicancommunion.org/media/99905/The_Anglican_Covenant.pdf?author=Covenant &subject=Covenant> (Accessed 20 December 2015). And how the churches reacted so far: <http://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/39753/provincial-reception-of-the-an glican-covenant-for-acc-rev.pdf?subject=Covenant> (Accessed 17 August 2015). 43 When Archbishop Giovanni Benelli was substitute, or deputy, of the Secretariat of State, he made the following observation: \"The real, e ffective power of jurisdiction of the pope over the whole Church is one thing. But the centralization of power is another. The first is of divine law. The second is the result of human circumstances. The first has produced many good things. The second is an anomaly\". Quoted in J.R. Quin, \"The Exercise of the Papacy. Facing the Cost of Christian Unity\" , Commonweal 123, 3 (July 12, 1996), 11-20, 18.323 Receptive Ecumenism and the Mandate and Method of ARCIC III (action to be taken by each church). Next follows a description of the intrinsic link between the respective positions taken at the origin of the separation and the actual impasse in which they find themselves. Their confessional identity with respect to authority-structures is partly de fined by the breach at the ori- gin (action to be taken by each church). Third, a sincere recognition and confession of the faults of the past and of the actual defects in our governance systems and the damage this has caused to each other and to the Church of Christ and its mission, as well as a quest for pardon and forgiveness from God and from each other (action to be taken by each church). Finally, an action plan in which both communions show a readiness to correct or change their actual governance systems so that a more balanced governance practice emerges which enhances the communion within and between our churches (action to be taken by each church). 5 Appendix: Pope Adrian VI's Message to the Diet of Nuremberg of November 25, 1522 In the last and most remarkable portion of the Instruction, Pope Adrian set forth with broad-minded candour the grounds on which the religious innovators justi fied their defection from the Church on account of the corruption of the clergy, as well as that corruption itself. \"You are also to say\" , so run Chieregati's express instructions, \"that we frankly acknowledge that God permits this persecution of His Church on account of the sins of men, and especially of prelates and clergy; of a surety the Lord's arm is not shortened that He cannot save us, but our sins separate us from Him, so that He does not hear. Holy Scripture declares aloud that the sins of the people are the outcome of the sins of the priesthood; therefore, as Chrysostom declares, when our Saviour wished to cleanse the city of Jerusalem of its sickness, He went first to the Temple to punish the sins of the priests before those of others, like a good physician who heals a disease at its roots. We know well that for many years things deserving of abhorrence have gathered round the Holy See; sacred things have been misused, ordinances transgressed, so that in everything there has been a change for the worse. Thus it is not surprising that the malady has crept down from the head to the members, from the Popes to the hierarchy. We all, prelates and clergy, have gone astray from the right way, and for long there is none that has done good; no, not one. To God, therefore, we must give all the glory and humble ourselves before Him; each one of us must consider how he has fallen and be more ready to judge himself than to be judged by God in the day of His wrath. Therefore, in our name, give promises that we shall use all diligence to reform before all things the Roman Curia, whence, perhaps, all these evils have had their origin; thus healing will begin at the source of sickness. We deem this to be all the more our duty, as the whole 324 Denaux world is longing for such reform. The Papal dignity was not the object of our ambition, and we would rather have closed our days in the solitude of private life; willingly would we have put aside the tiara; the fear of God alone, the validity of our election, and the dread of schism, decided us to assume the position of Chief Shepherd. We desire to wield our power not as seeking dominion or means for enriching our kindred, but in order to restore to Christ's bride, the Church, her former beauty, to give help to the oppressed, to uplift men of virtue and learning, above all, to do all that beseems a good shepherd and a successor of the blessed Peter. Yet let no man wonder if we do not remove all abuses at one blow; for the malady is deeply rooted and takes many forms. We must advance, therefore, step by step, first applying the proper remedies to the most di fficult and dangerous evils, so as not by a hurried reform to throw all things into greater confusion than before. Aristotle well says: 'All sudden changes are dangerous to States'\". 44 Bibliography Accattoli, L. (1998). When a Pope Asks Forgiveness: The Mea Culpa's of John Paul II, trans. J. Aumann.

Birmel\u00e9 Chapter ential Conversion Churches Andr\u00e9 Birmel\u00e9 This Festschrift for Henk Witte has conversion as its theme. This basic notion of the Christian message is generally understood as applying primarily to the individual who is called to reorient his or her life in the light of the Gospel. However, the concept of conversion is not limited to individuals alone, but is also applicable to the Christian community as a whole. The people of God as such is also called to conversion, in order to draw closer to the will of God. For more than fifteen years, Henk Witte has been a member of the Klingenthal Group, an informal ecumenical gathering which meets every eighteen months in the Alsatian village of Klingenthal at the invitation of the 'Centre for Ecumenical Studies' of the World Lutheran Federation in Strasbourg. The Group comprises about fifteen theologians who are specialists in ecumenism. This small group of experts, coming from di fferent Christian communities, works free from pressures, and sees itself as a simple place of exchange regarding developments and new perspectives in the quest for unity. Henk Witte is a loyal participant, who never ceases to impress on the group the urgent need for the conversion of all the churches, including his own, the Roman Catholic Church. Only if all sides are prepared to reorient themselves will we be able to surpass the divisions still preventing the full ecclesial com- munion of all the Christian confessions. Only thus can they attain a visible unity and a more credible witness to the world. To embark on t he necessary conversion of the Churches, we propose to take the text published by the Groupe des Dombes in 1991, For the Conversion of the Churches. 1 The Groupe des Dombes, founded in 1937 by Father Paul Couturier, gathers about forty French-speaking theologians at the end of summer each year, half of them Catholic and half Protestant. It is an informal group with no formal mandate from any Church. Its published works have often proved to be thinking ahead of their respective Churches' curve. Its first publications on the Eucharist and ministry came in advance of the o fficial dialogues organized by * This chapter has been translated from French into English by Jack McDonald ( KU Leuven). 1 Groupe des Dombes, Pour la conversion des Eglises: Identit\u00e9 et changement dans la dynamique de communion (Paris: Le Centurion, 1991). English Version: For the Conversion of the Churches (Geneva: WCC 10.1163/9789004319165 _019327 The Essential Conversion of the Churches the Churches on these topics, dialogues which themselves often referred to the ideas of the Groupe des Dombes. 2 The text, For the Conversion of the Churches is itself an example of this valuable foresight. As early as 1991, it set down the methodological factors at play, which would be taken up later in o fficial ecu- menical research. Up to that point, dialogue had concentrated on dogmatic themes, but the Groupe des Dombes sketched new parameters, which allowed the debate to move from a collection of agreements concerning individual themes to a large and general consensus. For this new stage, the conversion of the Churches is indispensable. This document is now twenty- five years old, but its proposals have lost nothing of their appropriateness and still call for practi- cal realisation. In this essay, we would like to underline three factors which confront the Churches: terminological issues, historical context and biblical witness. We shall subsequently examine each of these issues. 1 Terminological Issues The first part of the document of the Groupe des Dombes suggests some termi- nological keys. All the documents of the Groupe des Dombes begin in this fashion. To see this as simply 'clues for a terminology' would be too modest a title. Fundamental givens of the debate, which are already half way to conclu- sions, are actually being expressed. The first terminological key is provided by the articulation of the relation between identity and conversion. We need to coordinate these two terms and not to oppose them. The non-biblical notion of identity is popular in the mod- ern social sciences. The danger consists in conceiving of it in a static manner. Identity is always in the process of becoming and never de finitively achieved. To speak of a Christian identity makes sense only in relation with the conver- sion which is the constant reorientation of life. Conversion is \"an essential constituent of an identity which seeks to remain alive and, quite plainly, faith- ful to itself\" (\u00a714). Identity always has a relational dimension, a faithfulness open to the truth which calls us constantly to new forms of obedience. Christian identity, like conversion, consists in turning unceasingly, always and vigorously towards the One who is the way, the truth, and the life. To under- stand it as a return to first principles would be an unfortunate mistake. Conversion \"is a grace which opens onto a task ... It is celebrated in the 2 For this, see Vers une m\u00eame foi eucharistique? and Pour une r\u00e9conciliation des minist\u00e8res , texts published by Presses de Taiz\u00e9 in 1972 and 1973. English versions: Towards one Eucharistic Faith? and For the Reconciliation of Ministries (London: SPCK 1973 and 1975).328 Birmel\u00e9 proclamation of the Word, and in the sacramental act of reconciliation, as it is likewise in the sacrament of the Eucharist\" (\u00a739). The Groupe des Dombes - and here is the hallmark of its way of addressing the issue - deduces from this that what applies for the identity of the Christian individual, logically applies to the Church as well; which is nothing other than the communion of believ- ers, the people of the baptized. \"Ecclesial identity must always place itself in the service of Christian identity\" (\u00a725). In this way, all ecclesial identity is called, in the image of the identity of the believer, to constant conversion. Next, the very idea of ecclesial identity is a delicate one. We cannot speak of the Church's identity without factoring in the incarnations of this identity in the forms and ways of confessing our faith in the world. This confession is expressed through denominational identities. A denominational identity is, according to the Groupe des Dombes, a positive factor. An individual's conver- sion is always the conversion to the Church as well as conversion to a professing identity (\u00a7112). That each denominational identity is understood as a full and authentic expression of the Church of Jesus Christ in its singularity and its wholeness is not in itself to be regretted. The di fficulty appears when a denom- inational identity is understood as exclusive and when it sets itself up as the only authentic identity. When this happens, the link with the fullness of the Church expressed in and through other denominational identities is compro- mised, with each denomination trying \"to safeguard its own identity jealously and to be scarcely open to the share of truth present in its partner\" (\u00a732). Thus, we are no longer confronted with a legitimate denominational identity but with a sectarianism that ends up in mutual rejection and division. Church history shows that this is a road often travelled. The modern ecumenical move- ment has as its goal to rise above this denominational sectarianism and to reach towards a unity of denominational identities which are legitimately dif- ferent. Such a task is essential. It is also delicate because each denominational family must move beyond the temptations of sectarianism and enter into a genuine movement of conversion. It must rediscover a complete loyalty to the Gospel and therefore confess its own limits and insu fficiencies. This process will lead believers and their respective churches to recognize that elements of church identity exist \"which it is incapable, at least for the moment, of receiv- ing and incorporating into its own existence\" (\u00a747). Only in this way will the path be opened to genuine unity, \"a full mutual ecclesial recognition\" (\u00a751). This sort of ecclesial conversion is always the conversion to Jesus Christ of all individuals and of the Church in itself, a conversion which includes forgive- ness. This conversion does not happen to the detriment of denominational identity, but puri fies denominational identity by deepening its anchoring in the Gospel. Thus, the document of the Groupe des Dombes outlines from the 329 The Essential Conversion of the Churches beginning, which is just supposed to be a clari fication of vocabulary, the fun- damental systematic choices which it will later con firm through a historical survey and a return to biblical a ffirmations. From the o utset, the document outlines an understanding of the unity of the Church and proposes the ecumenical methodology which needs to be applied to realize this. A suggested structure is o ffered which, in 1991, was hardly on the agenda of the movements towards unity in the di fferent Churches. Yet these structures can be described as prophetic because they would go on to charac- terize the ecumenical movement of the last twenty- five years, even if we hardly ever acknowledge the text of the Groupe des Dombes which had first sketched them out. From where we are now, we can elucidate four aspects proposed by Dombes: The first entails its positive understanding of denominational identity. We can only access ecclesial identity through denominational identities. This way of proceeding contradicts what had previously been the norm in ecumenical research: people were convinced that only by moving beyond all confessional identities would arrival at true unity be accomplished. All the methods of the World Council of Churches, and in particular the model of conciliar commu- nity which it approved at the General Assembly in Nairobi in 1975, went in this direction. The convergence proposed by the BEM text (Baptism, Eucharist, Ministry) in 1981 was conceived in the service of the same vision. After the General Assembly in Canberra in 1991, people began to distance themselves from this vision. Little by little, a more positive understanding of denomina- tional identity on the road to unity gained ground, and it was this which led to declarations of communion between diverse denominational families. The Groupe des Dombes had already undertaken this evolution and so performed pioneering work. The second factor, which has been taken up elsewhere, is the conviction that the same Gospel truth can be expressed in di fferent ways. Another tradi- tion will use other options which stem from its history, its tradition of prayer and its speci fic theological stresses, and which are capable of being the vehicle of the same truth which is expounded in my Church. The Dombes document refuses to de fine this truth. Its references to the Word, to the sacraments of baptism, reconciliation, and Eucharist, which we have mentioned above, are of course valuable and have been cited in many ecumenical projects. It would have improved the Dombes text if it had speci fied that the Word is the truth which makes the Church one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. It would have been important in particular to speak in this context of ministry. This task remains unfinished in the Dombes text, as elsewhere.330 Birmel\u00e9 The third signi ficant conclusion is the value of di fference. Ecumenical searching does not have the aim of abolishing di fference. All seeking after uniformity is sterile and sluggish (see \u00a7191). This contradicts the very idea of conversion, which is invariably a reorientation and reincarnation of the Gospel in contexts which never cease to renew themselves. The aim is not to suppress di fferences. On the contrary, it is to transform the nature of di ffer- ence. Separated bodies must be seen as legitimate. True unity encompasses the legitimate di fferences of di fferent ecclesial identities. Rejecting di fference is the same as denominational sectarianism: in this case, an ecclesial fam- ily only accepts its own convictions and rejects o ff-hand any other identity which expresses the Gospel in another way. The only options in this line of thought are the absorption of other denominations or maintaining the current stand-o ff - options of no ecumenical interest (see \u00a7194). It is this sclerosis of denominational identity which we need to move beyond. Concerning this latter point, we should not give in to the relativism where all di fferences are desirable in themselves. That has been the feeling of some dialogues. The task of dialogues is to rework di fferences which have ended in separation in order to transform them into legitimate di fferences. They try to understand the sense and the origin of another expression of the same Gospel truth. But they are not for all that an end in themselves. Dialogues run the risk of being an endless spiral where we can always find the theme which will be the subject of the next professional study. The end-point of dialogues is to pro- pose to the Churches the ways which will permit them to declare that former condemnations do not apply to other Churches in the current state of their teaching. If this is the case, then a declaration of communion (or of partial communion) becomes possible. Such declarations lend to dialogues their ulti- mate sense and authority. The Dombes text speaks neither of theological dialogues nor of their direction. But this way of seeing things is made possible by the basic options suggested in For the Conversion of the Churches . 2 Historical Context The second part of the document suggests a method of testing these basic a ffir- mations by studying the history of the Church. The section, entitled 'Examples from History' , takes up more than half the document, and here too the work of this uno fficial group is true to itself. All its previous publications work in the same direction. We could explain this by the fact that a majority of its mem- bers are historians, but this would only be part of the story: the group is convinced that modern ecumenical work only makes sense by reference to the 331 The Essential Conversion of the Churches history which triggered the divisions. Understanding these events is the first step in moving beyond them. First and foremost, an initial approach is o ffered by the mention of the first Christian centuries. Their example shows, according to the Groupe des Dombes, that initially the Church knew how to struggle for the truth without ossifying itself in de finitive formulae. The Council of Nicea, the theology of Basil of Caesarea and the Council of Ephesus are cited as evidence. That these were open to di fference is proved by the pronouncements of Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras I in 1967 and the encounter of the Eastern Orthodox with the Coptic Church in 1989 (\u00a760f). In these declarations, the Church leaders considered that the divisions of the time happened above all due to lin- guistic misunderstandings (\u00a757-63). We could add here the declarations made by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church, on the one hand, and the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Coptic Orthodox Church on the other, in 1984 and 1988 respectively; declarations which draw a line under the Christological dis- agreements following the Council of Chalcedon in 451. 3 We might find ourselves a bit surprised by the interpretation favoured here by the Groupe des Dombes: in reality, these various events also engendered anathemas and divisions. It is only recently that the idea of linguistic di fficulties and misunderstandings has appeared as the hermeneutical key allowing us to understand the disputes of earlier times. It stretches credibility to cite the doctrinal developments of the first Christian centuries as examples of open and generous confessional identities. Of more interest is the example of St Augustine (\u00a764-72). His story is that of the articulation between personal conversion and the conversion of the Church, which he would be led to direct. His own personal conversion to God is also a conversion \"to the Catholic Church received as orthodox\" (\u00a768). Called first to priesthood, then to the episcopate, Augustine's personal conver- sion \"triggered a dynamic of renewal for the ancient Churches of the West and the East and exercised a crucial in fluence on the Latin Church in the follow- ing centuries and especially on the Protestant Reformers\" (\u00a772). The following centuries would be characterized, however, by an insistence on identity-with- out-conversion, which would lead to a hardening of the rupture between East and West (\u00a773-85). A second central point in this more historical part of the document is devoted to the events of the 16th Century. Martin Luther is approached in a positive way. Following his personal conversion, he launched an urgent appeal for the conversion of the Church. He had no intention of splitting from the 3 Texts in: J. Gros, H. Meyer, W. Rusch (eds.), Growth in Agreement II: Reports and Agreed Statements of Ecumenical Conversations on a World Level 1982- 1998 (Geneva: WCC , 2000), 691f.332 Birmel\u00e9 Church, indeed quite the contrary, but he was not listened to. There were some attempts at conciliation, not by ecclesiastical but by political authorities, in particular Emperor Charles V, but these political moves failed. As the docu- ment argues: The Protestant Reformers credited the church they had reformed with full ecclesial identity. When they claimed this for their churches alone, expecting that the whole Western church would reform itself according to the same criteria, the dialogue on unity became sterile, for the Roman church did the same over against them (\u00a793). In contrast to St Augustine, whose individual conversion stimulated a conver- sion of the Church, the Reformers' conversions did not have the same impact on the Church of the 16th Century. Thus, separation was e ffected and, in spite of various attempts at mediation, especially after the Thirty Years War, the dif- ferent Churches dug themselves into confessionalism. This was an inevitable consequence of each Church claiming an exact identity between its own denominational ethos and the fullness of the nature of the Church. This exclu- sivism dominated everywhere and became the norm for more than four centuries. According to the Groupe des Dombes, there was an inversion of pri- orities, with denominational identity trumping Christian identity (\u00a7121). Any notion of Christian unity was thus impossible. Even justi fied insistences on this or that aspect of the faith became occasions for perverting Christianity because they were a ffirmed in an exclusive way, and hence sealed o ff any pos- sibility of dialogue (\u00a7 195). The procedure of this text is rigorous and its logic pursues a single aim: to show that the divisions in the Church are the consequence of a false insistence on denominational identity to the detriment of the Church's larger general identity. Every initiative with this sort of intention has a tendency to interpret every salient fact through the lens of its declared aim. In doing this, it therefore has a tendency to forget the facts which indicate that the situation is more complex. For example, it is going too far to claim that the Reformers consid- ered the doctrine of the Visible Church as a negative development (\u00a792 and \u00a7123): Luther and Calvin, of course, speak of the Invisible Church that goes beyond the Visible Church of our age. They nevertheless insist on the fact that we only have access to the Invisible Church via the Visible. Similarly, we are not doing justice to the Roman Catholic Church in contending that it is now noth- ing more than an institution and a hierarchical structure which has forgotten the message of the Gospel (\u00a7124). These over-simpli fications are surprising, but, even so, the basic theory of the Groupe des Dombes is sound: a hardening 333 The Essential Conversion of the Churches of attitudes provoked the defence of various confessionalisms, and this hap- pened as much in the Roman Catholic Church as elsewhere, which needs to be understood as a denominational Church alongside others. This attitude has produced a generalized doctrinal and attitudinal fossilization and has pre- vented all dialogue. Thirdly, it is only \"in fact as soon as Christians recognize that their confes- sional church lacks ecclesiality because of division, the process of ecclesial and confessional conversion to full catholicity becomes possible again\" (\u00a7122). This understanding only struck the Churches in the 20th Century because of the ecumenical movement, which the document welcomes, as a conversion to an ecclesial identity that moves beyond earlier denominationalisms. The text relates in brief (perhaps too brie fly) the history of this before the Second Vatican Council. Concerning the Roman Catholic Church, it stresses the sym- bolic gestures made by the Church; in particular the meetings of the popes with the leaders of other Christian families (\u00a7136f): These symbolic gestures which are the product of conversion become in turn generators of the spirit of conversion. They encourage and embolden Christians of every confession to be involved in a similar process. As such these gestures are indispensable for the dynamics of unity (\u00a7141). Both the work of Faith and Order and the conciliar decree Unitatis redintegra- tio of Vatican II, should be understood as decisive facts that demonstrate a departure from confessionalist arthritis and entry into a broader ecclesial identity. The Dombes document scarcely spends any time discussing doctrinal dialogues however - only one page of three paragraphs (\u00a7142-144). It would probably have been desirable for the Dombes to pay more attention to this issue. The approach favoured by the Dombes text had already been rehearsed in various other ecumenical dialogues, such as that between European Lutherans and Reformed: these two denominations signed the Leuenberg Agreement in 1973, which precisely understands denominational identities as legitimate expressions of a wider ecclesial identity. Leuenberg is mentioned without further explanation (\u00a7145), and with analogous dialogues with Anglicanism not being mentioned at all. This omission is probably explained by reasons of diplomacy: extended discussion of the various dialogues undertaken by the Churches of the Reformation would have fractured the delicate Catholic- Protestant balance that the Groupe des Dombes tries to maintain at all costs. In 1991, the Roman Catholic Church had not begun this level of dialogue. It was only in 1990 that Rome committed itself to this route, one which would result 334 Birmel\u00e9 in 1999 in the Common Declaration concerning the Doctrine of Justi fication; a document presented substantively later than that of the Groupe des Dombes. At the same time, the Groupe could never have predicted the current retreat to confessionalism which we see more or less everywhere in today's Church: Rome now proposes a very limited interpretation of the words subsistit in in the Constitution on the Church of Vatican II, an interpretation that reduces ecclesial identity to a unique Roman Catholic expression. This has not stopped the contemporary ecumenical movement from engaging in new articulations of ecclesial identities, which have not been abandoned but trans formed in the light of the lifting of historic anathemas. We have learned to distinguish between sectarian di fferences and legitimate di fferences (\u00a7153). A conversion of the Churches is right on track in spite of certain very traditionalist tenden- cies that seek to derail all progress. 3 Biblical Witness The return to a biblical witness has only occurred at a third stage in a docu- ment which begins with systematic and continues with historical approaches. This part is also very brief and shows that the authentic articulation of identity and conversion is a major biblical concern. The text does not treat the theme of conversion in the biblical message in its entirety. It is limited to a few signi fi- cant aspects on which to ground the necessary conversion of the Churches. In the first instance, the text proposes an equivalence between conversion and repentance by distinguishing the two terms in the following way: conver- sion is suggested to the pagan who discovers the Gospel, whereas repentance is essentially limited to Jews whose already existing loyalty to God simply needs reorienting (\u00a7156). In both cases, the life-change is indicated by baptism, which is the particular moment that is a sign of conversion. In both cases, one needs to renounce a way of thinking or behaving considered to be bad. But this reorientation only makes sense if the new life has a well-de fined content. This content is a response to the call of Christ and an invitation to follow the exam- ple of Christ who himself underwent a 'conversion': \"he renounced his divine condition and turned towards human beings\" , as the hymn in Philippians (2:6- 11) sings forth - a passage which is quoted in full in the document (\u00a7164f). In a paradoxical twist, Christ leads humanity in a movement from death to life, which is the only way of bestowing a full identity. This attitude characterizes the entire life of Jesus as the one who goes out in search of men and women who are lacking in life: \"this movement of turning calls for reciprocity\" (\u00a7167). The believer must commit himself or herself to this in every moment of his or 335 The Essential Conversion of the Churches her life. One gives up certain elements of their identity, which are important to them, without ever renouncing the heart of their faith. In this way, the biblical narrative shows that the reordering of life does not involve any loss of identity but, rather, asserts a re-engagement of identity. The Dombes text illustrates this with several examples such as the Prodigal Son, where the younger brother finds his identity by means of a reorientation of his life, whereas the older brother loses it (\u00a7172). What remains the case is that identity is always fragile because it is vulnerable to temptation (\u00a7174f). From this it follows that con- stant conversion is needed (\u00a7177 and \u00a7195) Next, the particular interest in this return to the biblical texts comes from the fact that the Groupe des Dombes shows what is important to the individual, in the biblical texts, is equally valid for the whole of the people. The Old Testament already witnesses to this. As Jacob who struggles with God becomes Israel (Genesis 32:28), so the people themselves together receive the name which is his individual identity. The people as a whole are nonetheless required to return constantly to God, and calls to conversion and to a return to God are often heard in the Old Testament (\u00a7170f). The New Testament does not lag behind here: the new identity of Cephas who becomes Peter applies to the whole Church. Calls for the conver- sion of the Church are constant, as is shown for example in the letters written to the Churches in the second chapter of Revelation (\u00a7173). For the Groupe des Dombes, the repentance and conversion of the Churches is evidently necessary. Without stating it, the Groupe operates a pre- cise ecclesiology: the Church is the community of believers. It is not simply a gathering of the converted, it is the Body of Christ. But there is no dimension to the Church which is anything other than the communion of believers. In this sense, what applies to individual believers applies equally to the Church. Therefore, the urgency of repentance and conversion for believers is directly transferable to the Church. This reality seems to be simply obvious for the Groupe des Dombes, which demonstrates it with various biblical references. In other words, the Church is not so much on the side of God, as He relates to believers, as it is on the side of the believers as they relate to God. The Church is therefore itself vulnerable to temptation and called to constant repentance and conversion. This is the fundamental theological choice at work in this document. Finally, the Groupe des Dombes comes to a logical conclusion in the diversity of expressions of the one Church that are apparent from the New Testament period. There are from the beginning di fferent groups within the Church. The recognition of diversity is part of the being of the Church (\u00a7162). Con flicts are present from the very first New Testament texts, as is shown by the history of the first council, the gathering held in Jerusalem in Acts 15 (\u00a7163). 336 Birmel\u00e9 It is only in freedom and obedience to the Gospel that we can manage to avoid schism. Reconciliation is essential and fundamental (\u00a7175). The Dombes document sees, right from the first Christian century, indicators of di fferent denominational identities which stem from speci fic cultural and historical contexts. Pagan-Christian communities had a speci fic doctrinal and spiri- tual pro file that di ffered from the Jewish-Christian community in Jerusalem. The speci ficity of this era was its capacity for reconciliation. It is this capacity that enabled the Church to maintain its identity in a reconciled diversity. This capacity included conversion in the wake of Peter's, who went through a con- version during his encounter with Cornelius (Acts 10). It is undeniable that the Groupe des Dombes has, in authoring these passages, a de finite preconception which it wishes to justify by allusion to biblical witness in the final pages of the document. We do not criticize this because it is exactly in this area that modern exegesis can be applied. Church identity develops its own grammar from the beginning via particular confessional identities, which must remain open to conversion and must resist confessionalism and fossilization. The first Christian communities have shown us the way here. The closing remarks of the document are slightly disappointing. They are limited to a call to the Churches truly to conform themselves to the una , sancta , c a t h o l i c a e t a p o s t o l i c a e c c l e s i a . All the Churches are asked to move beyond their respective sclerotic tendencies. The Protestant Churches are asked to rediscover the Eucharist in order to be closer to the Church across the centuries. Catholics are asked to give constant and universal priority to the message of Jesus Christ which goes above and beyond all insistence on historic institutions. Of course these remarks are correct. But they only relate obliquely to the dynamic of the actual text. It is true that this text announced its own conclusions in the introduction. Because of this, the conclusion itself lacks brio because it is simply a repetition of what has already been stated. What we take to heart from this call for the conversion of the Churches is the necessity of repentance and conversion which applies to all confessional identities, including Roman Catholic identity. In doing this, the text opens an unexpected chapter. Recognizing the Church's capacity to sin is not a natural Roman Catholic re flex. Vatican II certainly envisaged some Church reform, but the imperfection of the Church applied only to the Church's individual mem- bers, not to the Church itself. 4 Since then, attitudes have apparently evolved. In particular, Pope John Paul II apologized many times for the Church's mistakes 4 Cf: Unitatis redintegratio. The decree on ecumenism speaks of the errors of the Church in suis membris (UR 3).337 The Essential Conversion of the Churches and a ffirmed that the Church is at the same time holy and sinful. 5 This realiza- tion is working its way through the Church, but it is far from being accepted by all. The Groupe des Dombes's text reminds us of its urgency. Only repentance and the conversion of denominational identities can open the way to the genu- ine unity of the Church of Christ.
