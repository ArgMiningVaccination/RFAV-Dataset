Individual results may vary. Very good for helping asthma sufferers! My husband was diagnosed by a pulmonologist as having asthma or possibly COPD. He was given a prescription for a steroid inhaler. After 4 days, his symptoms were so bad he had to stop taking this medication. While it helped his lungs feel more open, he developed hoarseness and sleep deprivation, blurred vision, shakiness and rapid heart rate. When he started on Lignosus, it took close to three weeks but he did stabilize and did not use the inhaler at all. He has continued to improve over the past two weeks. We are looking forward to continued improvement using this product. He feels good when hiking and has less congestion. Perfect product for asthma. This product is great. I have asthma. When I feel my lungs start to get tight I take to capsules and it greatly reduces the frequency that I have to take my inhaler. It also helps me when I have a cold both with breathing and helping to clear chest congestion. I also give it to my family when they have a chest cold to help them too (they don't have asthma). I am grateful that I found this! Jessie, Age 29 United States Saved my 7-year-old daughter from bad asthma cough. My 7-year-old daughter suffered from bad asthma cough. Lignosus improved her breathing and relieved her cough & asthma symptoms. Happy as a new person living again. This lung supplement, Lignosus,is my new lifesaver, after all these years I have gone through. I used to have heavy, strong asthma attack in the middle of my sleep, not everyday but depending on the weather. As I just begin to lay down I feel the heavy congestion in my lungs starting to wheeze. Literally every time when this happens I honestly feel scared to sleep because I always feel that, is thinking my last sleep? Will I wake up again? Is there anything that can help me breathe like a normal person? I felt scared, and didn't know what to do. During and after the asthma/allergies attack takes at least 4-5 hours until 70% back to breathing. Until I realized maybe my lungs are weak and sensitive, and so I should find a supplement to support my lungs before they worsen up in the future. Then yes, I have found Lignosus and since the day I started taking this supplement my fears during sleep are gone and my asthma attack hasn't come back yet. Also my strong crazy allergies has eased much more. Thank you and thank you!! Very good for helping asthma sufferers! My husband was diagnosed by a pulmonologist as having asthma or possibly COPD.

I have been suffering from a variety of respiratory issues for years - chronic cough, rounds of bronchitis, constant chest congestion and pain, shortness of breath. I have an inhaler but it just doesn't work. I've run the gamut of answer from steroids, OTC meds and antibiotics. Nothing ever worked and all had side effects.Well, I was just getting over the flu and was terrified of the respiratory problems I would suffer afterward. So I bought this product just to try it and was shocked at how well it worked. At first, I stopped coughing but the inflammation was still in my chest and it was the weirdest feeling! The next day, inflammation was gone and no coughing, it just kept getting better. This month, I have picked up a strong cold and took 2 sachets daily for 1 week straight and it worked wonders. It saved me a doctor's visit and more RX medications. I have recommended this respiratory supplement to anyone that will listen. I feel like I've found a miracle answer to the terrible coughing that has plagued me for years. Kim, Age 42 United States Very good for helping asthma sufferers!

The pollution part is a little challenging in New York City though. So, this product helps with that as well. Ain Hadi, Age 31 Indonesia No more troubled breathing even in smoggiest days! I started taking these after I moved to Dubai because I was having some trouble breathing due to the air pollution here. These really work!

I often work in dusty environments. I keep this handy and take 2 sachets daily just for preventative measures. It helps to cleanse my lungs. Justin W,, Age 29 United States Work in dusty environments. Take this to protect lungs. I often work in dusty environments. I keep this handy and take 2 sachets daily just for preventative measures. It helps to cleanse my lungs. Justin W,, Age 29 United States Taking this for immune and respiratory health support! I was looking for supplement for lung health since pandemic outbreak. I feel my body is stronger now. Sandy Yeo, Age 43 Singapore I'm using it for additonal protection for my immunity! I use the product as an aid to keep my lungs helthy and strong. This helped to boost my body immunity. In using it I have had a noticeable decline in health issues (colds, flu). Good to have this in time of the Pandemic as part of my health remedies. Angela G., Age 29 United States My lungs are healthier now! I started to take this product as a supplement to strengthen my lungs , as pandemic protection. This gives me peace of mind. Jessica M., Age 28 United States It worked! Helped me relieve infected mucus and sinus issues! This product is amazing! I felt amazing... sinus pain, pressure, and dryness inflammation gone. I thought nothing would ever help me. I've tried everything out there and even had two sinus surgeries and this product turns out to be my miracle. Great job! Rebecca, Age 29 Australia It is better than any cold medicine sold out there! Helped me clear out the infected mucus. I suffer from chronic sinus infections from colds and chest infections if the cold reaches my lungs, both produce an extreme amount of mucus. Probably a result of having Sjogrens. This works quickly, and I can breathe normally fairly soon. What I love and this may be gross is that it allows me to blow the infected mucus from my nose. I have narrow nasal passages and every time I get a cold I immediately clog up and can't breathe. I have used nasal sprays and neti pots (tried also all OTC cold medicines and breathe right strips, and natural medicines) which work but for a short time and do not help me clear out the infected mucus. I'm usually miserable for two weeks and have missed many days of work because of a cold gone infected.I wish I had known about this product sooner. It really does balance out the mucus levels. I will of course buy this product again. I take 2 sachets daily. Used for a week and a half. This was the first time I ever remember having a cold and not being miserable. I love this stuff. I had a bad sinus infection in May 2020 which had me hunting again for relief, I bought this for my next cold. I caught another cold last month and it is over and here is my review and recommendation. If you suffer from chronic misery from colds, I recommend trying this product, it worked for me and I couldn't be happier. Samantha, Age 45 United States It really improves my breathing. Don't think it's placebo. The third box of Lignosus I've purchased. I've always had a lot of trouble breathing at night, for one reason or another, and this helped clear it up significantly. I've been taking this product for 3 months now, I became convinced it wasn't placebo, they open my airways and unblock mucus pathways. I can sleep better at night. Rebecca B, Age 38 United States Unblocks mucus pathways. Lignosus unblocks mucus pathways. I can sleep better at night. Overall, I've been looking for a product to assist me with my breathing and this has helped me a lot. Will continue to purchase. Roseiana, Age 29 Indonesia Opens up lungs and nasal passageways. Enhances breathing and oxygenation. Great product! On the first day after taking 2 sachets, I was breathing much better. I felt more oxygenated. I slept so much more soundly on the very first night! I highly recommend Lignosus! I started taking this during late fall when both home and work environments are so dry. It has helped immensely! Avron L, Age 42 Czech Republic My lungs feel like the airways are more open. I smoked for 5 years and even after quitting smoking for 2 years, I still experienced wheezing and bronchitis. Since using this herbal supplement, my lungs feel like the airways are more open, like I can breathe better and am taking in more oxygen. I've always been a fan of herbal remedies and Lignosus just gives me one more reason to! Jared K, Age 36 United States I could feel the airway in my chest open up. I have allergies, Chronic sinusitis/rhinitis is the diagnosis. I could feel the airway in my chest open up wider and I could feel the mucus loosening up. I was expelling mucus by the mouthful. It cleared me up in 2 days! Buy it! Thank God for this alternative! Keith Miller, Age 41 United States Helps clear congestion and open airways. Since I started using this product a few months ago I rarely have to use either one of my inhalers. In my experience, this lung support does what it says it will do. Helps clear congestion and open airways to make breathing easier. Lisa, Age 29 United States This is the BEST respiratory product in the market! Best product I have ever invested in!!!! I have been using this for over 3 months and no longer have to suffer with respiratory infections!! It has taken care of sinus issues and my post nasal drip as well!!!!

Easy and very convenient to take and very effective for me! Shail, Age 25 Malaysia Really does help stop the post nasal drip. I have chronic sinus problems for years and since purchasing this, my post nasal drip has stopped! Now, i just consider this a very little problems. Hoping that taking these powdered supplement will eventually lead to a complete clearing up of the condition. But for the record, it really makes me happy! Starley L, Age 29 United States Works very well to clear my post-nasal drip. This product works very well to clear my post-nasal drip.

This product has kept the sinus inflammation from turning into a sinus infection! I recommend! Anand, Age 28 Malaysia Awesome product for smokers and chronic bronchitis. It cleared my lungs! Love it. If you have any lung issues you will know within a few days of taking this because it will open up your lungs. I grew up with parents that smoked like chimneys. Being hospitalized every year for chronic bronchitis, my lungs had severe issues due to the smoke and horrible antibiotics that I had to take all the time. Then I was bright enough to smoke for a few years, after which I quit. After a week of taking this I was able to do something I never knew I was missing; breathing with all my lungs ! Wish I knew about this product earlier! Asgard G, Age 30 United Kingdom My lungs are much clearer now! I've used Lignosus to help clear my lungs of phlegm and I've been a long time smoker. I have quit smoking and taken this per day and my lungs are much clearer. I would recommend this product. James, Age 29 United States I smoke a lot, this reduced a lot of my sputum. It's good for me. Because I smoke a lot, Lignosus helped me reduce a lot sputum. I like it. Oliver, Age 34 United States This relieved my coughing and sensitive throat. I am a light smoker for more than 10 years. My throat is often uncomfortable and cough drops are not helping. I did a research and WOWED by the benefits of the tiger milk mushroom especially in the immunity. After taking Lignosus, one thing I obviously feel is I have less mucus when my throat is uncomfortable. This relieves me a lot. For other improvements I am afraid I can't tell yet. But definitely, I will buy again! Mr Lim, Age 51 Singapore Happy as a new person living again. This lung supplement, Lignosus,is my new lifesaver, after all these years I have gone through.

This is a great vegetarian product with natural herbs. You can definitely tell just by the smell. They are very easy to swallow.
