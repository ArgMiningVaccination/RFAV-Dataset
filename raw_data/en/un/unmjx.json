Formal training not required in Alberta GARRET HARVEY | gharvey@cjournal.ca Albertans looking to challenge driving offences should be careful about who they hire to help them. Some people may turn to a traffic agent, a person who can \u2014 for a fee \u2014 represent you in traffic court. The problem is that such agents don't need to be certified or experienced. Some established agents, like Charlie Pester, are fed up with the situation. \"As far as I'm concerned these inexperienced agents have no pride in what they do, they are just looking for a quick buck,\" says Pester, who is an ex-police officer and the owner of the traffic ticket agency, Pointts. Pester believes inexperienced agents only find clients because they offer a slightly cheaper price for representation. Pester also says every operating agent should be covered by errors and omissions insurance - just like private practice lawyers in Alberta. That insurance would mean traffic agent clients could have their court costs covered if the negligence of an agent causes a lawsuit. But since that insurance isn't required, Pester claims many of the inexperienced agents don't even bother with the expense \u2014 which can climb up to around $2,000 a year. ANYONE CAN BE AN AGENT Deborah Prowse, a former Justice of the Peace and current owner of the traffic ticket agency Demerits, also thinks members of her industry should have a code of conduct or be regulated by the government. Such regulations don't exist in Alberta, Prowse says.\"Whether or not you understand the justice system, the elements of an offence or the procedures of a court room, you can call yourself a traffic agent.\" ONTARIO HAS IT UNDER CONTROL That's not the case in Ontario, where traffic court agents - along with other paralegals -have been regulated since 2007. Pester says that \"when Ontario set their regula- tions, they brought in the people that had been active agents for at least three years.\" At that point, those agents were required to pass a licensing exam, as well as be of good character. New agents have to take an approved college course. On top of that, paid agents in Ontario are required to be covered by professional liability insurance. Pester says Alberta may not have adopted these regulations because, in comparison to Ontario, the number of agents here is very small. WHEN THINGS GO WRONG Pester says the case of Dennis Young is a prime ex-ample of the need to regulate traffic court agents. Back in 2011, CTV News reported that Young's traf- fic ticket company \"made off with their money before fighting tickets in court.\" Different firms, including Pointts, picked up some of the cases that Young left behind. Prowse says that people who find themselves unexpectedly unrepresented by their agent \"may even find out that there is a warrant out for their ar-rest because no one represented them in court. There is nothing that would oversee an agency being shut down like that.\" The Calgary Journal was unable to obtain contact information for Young, whose phone number has changed. WHAT CAN ALBERTA DO? As a result of such controversies, Prowse says, \"I think that there is a need to take steps in some fashion to protect the public.\" Pester agrees something needs to be done, as well.\"At the very least, every agent needs to be covered by errors and omissions insurance.\" The Albertan Government did not respond request for comment on whether it would look at regulating traffic court agents. \"Whether or not you understand the justice system, the elements of an offense, or the procedures of a court room, you can call yourself a traffic agent.\" \u2014 Deborah Prowse, former Justice of the PeaceUnlike in Ontario, Alberta does not require formal training for traffic agents.Photo Ilustration: Garrett Harvey/Calgary Journal January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 3 Laugher amidst the pain Mary McQuarrie stays sprite despite leg amputation, organ failure JENICA FOSTER | jfoster@cjournal.ca Murphy gnaws on a bone as Seamus and Dibley wrestle each other to the ground. Cricket barks, egging the two on. Boomer and Sassy sit on their fluffy blankets watching the show with tired eyes, they've seen this before. And then there's Mary. She sits in her chair and wheels around, nicking doorframes and walls as she plays with her six loving dogs. Mary McQuarrie is constantly reminded of the traumatic day she lost her right leg. She now uses a copper prosthesis to walk, but finds it tiring and uses a wheelchair around the house. She said it is difficult to keep her balance with the prosthetic leg. If she has an object in her right hand, she must pick up an object of similar size and weight in her left hand to stay afoot. FROM TWO LEGS TO ONE A year before McQuarrie lost her leg, her foot swelled giving her \"elephanti-tis,\" as she calls it. She said doctors at-tributed this symptom to her diabetes, because she had previously nicked her foot on chicken wire while tending her sweet peas. She went to the Rockyview General Hospital where doctors were able to reduce the swelling. In March 2011, she said her husband left to work in Indonesia as a pilot. She emailed him saying she had high fevers that caused violent shaking. \"I laid here for three weeks waiting for my husband and I heard nothing. I emailed my sister-in-law and said, 'I need help' and I heard nothing,\" she said. Out of the blue, a neighbour came by, took one look at her and rushed her to the hospital. Twelve hours later she had endured multiple organ failures and her right leg just below the knee had been chopped off. Doctors ampu-tated her right leg because the Septis infection was spreading so rapidly that it would have eventually reached her heart. ESCAPE CAREWEST After spending almost two months at the Rockyview hospital, McQuarrie was transferred to a long-term care facility. She became a part of the musculo-skeletal unit of Carewest. Here's where the scheming began with three other ladies: one had smashed her arm need-ing six surgeries to get it straightened out; another had her left leg ampu-tated; and the last one had her leg amputated all the way up to the top of her thigh. The pack formed missions, she said, making the staff very nervous. One mission involved the hunt for a lemon meringue pie. \"Us diabetics, they don't give you any treats. So she (McQuarrie's pack mate) was supposed to be my lookout, but she chickened out and let me go into enemy territory.\" Other mischievous acts included hid- ing, moving a seat and sitting in each other's beds to fool the staff. She said they just did silly things to keep them occupied. \"You just put one step in front of the other,\" said Shirley Heschl, one of McQuarrie's pack mates. \"The pain is enough to send anybody to their bed and take their drugs. But we can live it with them.\" Carewest sits on the bank of the Glenmore Reservoir. McQuarrie said there was a path that dipped down and came back up the other side. She said she would gain enough speed on her wheelchair to make it three quarters of the way up the far side of the path. \"Of course I would get hell every time I did it, but they wouldn't give me a helmet.\" With friendly support McQuarrie was able to recover. She had told the doctors that the day she put on her prosthetic leg, was the day she would walk out the door. And she did. \"I was their star pupil. Now if they could have only put duct tape over my mouth I would have been perfect for them.\" CONFUSION AND LACK OF SUPPORT Currently, home encompasses her birds, six dogs and an abundance of overflowing brown boxes filling every room. She said she hasn't been in her living room since she was spring clean-ing before she went to the hospital. There is a collection of Swarovski crystals, old Canon cameras, pillows and collectables from travels abroad. Other rooms feature her husband's boat models and clothes. Her husband was a man who spoiled her rotten, she said. During 21 years of marriage, she said he never raised his voice to her and never criticized her. But then she said he was gone. \"It was demoralizing to me when I woke up and he wasn't there,\" McQuarrie said. After months of complete silence, McQuarrie said she finally heard from her husband. \"For 18 months I hung like a pi\u00f1ata. I didn't know if I was coming, going, leaving or staying. Everybody wanted to know what happened, ask him,\" she said. Mary's husband did not reply to an email request asking for comment. She says going through this has caused her to become disillusioned with people. She said people will say, \"If you need anything just give me a call.\" Now she tells them that if they don't mean it, they shouldn't say it. FROM HERE ON OUT McQuarrie said, \"I don't fantasize about murdering my husband any-more.\" She said she wants to sort out her marriage. She said she hopes a handyman is in her future to help her do the things that she can't around the house. As for her sense of adventure, McQuarrie said she would love to try driving a standard car with a left-foot accelerator like they have in Europe. Her prosthetic leg will keep chal- lenging her for the rest of her life, but McQuarrie will continue to see humour and laugh amidst the pain. Mary McQuarrie holds one of her six dogs. Despite losing her leg and battling a myriad of obstacles, she has never lost her ability to laugh.Photo: Jenica Foster/Calgary Journal January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 4Volunteering: a western concept? Stats suggest immigrants less likely to lend a hand JOCELYN DOLL | jdoll@cjournal.ca As the immigrant population in Calgary increases, the amount of people volunteering in the city may be decreasing. That's because immigrants are less likely to volunteer than Canadian-born residents, as reported by Statistics Canada in May of 2012. A 2006 Statistics Canada report said that 71 per cent of Calgary's population had volunteered in the past year. By 2020, it's estimated that Calgary's total immigrant population will reach almost half a million, compared to 300,000 in 2010, according to a 2011 City of Calgary fact sheet. There are many reasons why immi- grants would shy away from volunteer-ing experts said. For starters, Anoush Newman, execu- tive director at the Calgary Multicultural Centre, said that volunteering is a very North American idea. She said that many immigrants come from countries where everyone looks after their own family. \"We are getting people coming to Canada who don't understand or who don't have the experience of volunteer-ing for the community,\" Newman said. Peter Elson, acting director institute of non-profit studies at Mount Royal Uni-versity, agreed with Newman. He said that \"in many cases new immigrants are not as aware as other groups of the actual opportunities to volunteer.\" Karen Franco, director of com- munications at Volunteer Calgary, said that in addition, newcomers might not have the time to vol - unteer. \"It is a busy time when they're settling, finding ac- commodation, w ork, and get - ting children into school,\" she said. Elson said that a lack of confidence in language skills, as well as the mandatory criminal record checks that are required for some voluntary positions may also prevent people from volunteer- ing. \"If people come from a regime or come from countries where doing a police check could have very dire and severe consequences that would certainly be enough in terms of turning people off to volunteering,\" he said. However, the Statistics Canada report also stated that immigrants tend to donate more than Canadian born residents, and are also more likely to be regularly affiliated with religious organizations. Franco said that when immigrants get involved in the community, they are more likely to engage with such orga-nizations, as well as cultural groups, be-cause that is their first point of contact. \"Those early days of volunteering for a newcomer often are in the community that they are most familiar with,\" she said. Elson also said that it's very difficult to get stats about informal volunteering. Informal volunteering is when im- migrants help out members of their community or family, but do not register as a volunteer at an organization. Elson recommends patience when trying to recruit immigrant volunteers. \"It takes time and sometimes genera- tions before people feel comfortable in terms of volunteering,\" he said. Greyhound cuts still affect rural Alberta Decision to cut passenger sevice taking its toll on small town residences ZO\u00cb CHOY | zchoy@cjournal.ca For many of us living in the city, means of transportation are readily available; but when it comes to our neighbouring rural friends, it's not to be taken for granted. Many residents of rural Alberta are still struggling to deal with the impact of Greyhound's year-old decision to cut passenger service to 14 towns and cities. Cold Lake was one of those commu- nities affected by the cuts. \"It was a shock to everybody - to all the communities in Alberta. It sort of hit everybody between the eyes,\" said Craig Copeland, the city's mayor. Cold Lake is just over three hours away from Edmonton and eight hours away from Calgary - not counting stops on the bus. Copeland explained that many resi- dents - especially seniors - utilized the transportation service on a day-to-day basis. \"There were six-to-ten people a day that would use the Greyhound on a frequent basis to get to medical appointments or to visit people in the city,\" he said. Despite Greyhound cutting its transportation services to areas like Cold Lake, the company contin - ues to run a courier service to the community, spark - ing some confusion from those being left behind. \"They got rid of the passengers but they're still delivering freight and I ques - tion that,\" Copeland said. \"It was a double-edged sword; kind of like freight became more important than people in the business scheme of things.\" Greyhound did not return a call seek- ing comment on the issue. Since the cuts have been made, another private company, the Northern Express Bus Line, has tried picking up where Greyhound left off. Unfortunately, some residents report new problems have arisen with the new service. Connie Axell, Cold Lake senior said, \"It used to be only four hours on the bus, and now because there's only one bus for the whole area, it runs from Edmonton, goes to St. Paul, etc., and to here, so it's like a milk run; you're almost six hours on the bus.\" As well, due to the Northern Express being a smaller, family-owned com- pany, ticket prices have risen and times of departure pushed back. \"Before, the bus used to get in here around six to eight, you'd get in around noon, and then you could catch the six o'clock bus back out. \"But this way, you have to spend a couple days in the city, so it costs a lot of money,\" Axell said. Evelyn Berkshire, another senior living in Cold Lake, said she has also experienced some of the problems Axell is facing. \"It's tough. For me to go down in a hotel for two nights, take a cab, and then to eat, I'm looking at close to $700,\" she said. Both have since opted to hire some- one with a vehicle to drive them to Edmonton, resulting in missed medical appointments. Axell said, \"I can't go anymore on the bus; it's just not feasible for me. I don't know what the answer to this situation is.\" The Greyhound service cut has also prevented family and friends from visit-ing those in the region. There have been mixed opinions on whether or not the city of Cold Lake could do something more to help residents like Axell and Berkshire since the changes. However, despite the reported troubles that have since arisen from the new bus line, Copeland commented about Northern Express Bus Line: \"It's good to see they've picked up that slack.\"\"It was a double-edged sword; kind of like freight became more important than people in the business scheme of things.\" \u2014 Craig Copeland, Cold Lake mayor Photo Illustration: Jocelyn Doll/Calgary Journal January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 5If you're a summer bike commuter living in Calgary, there are two things you can do to extend your biking season: move to a city with milder winters, or get on board with winter cycling. There are a number of cyclists in the city that ride avidly from the time the snow melts in spring all throughout the summer, until snow returns. However, brave bikers can do a number of things to join the city's growing community of winter cyclists. SAFETY Staying safe on winter roads is a major concern for people who consider winter cycling. That's because many people aren't sure how to stay safe when the snow starts to fall. Sean Carter, who owns BikeBike and is a year-round bicycle commuter, says, \"Some folks don't want to fall down, or they're worried about getting hit by a car.\" He says some of those fears are valid, but almost all can be mitigated with the right gear and the right preparation. A simple piece of gear that can make all the difference for winter bikers is a set of studded tires. They're exactly what they sound like: tires with studs to increase traction on snow and ice. Carter uses studded tires - which also decrease a bike's speed - putting them on both the front and back of his bike, \"because I want to not have to think about what conditions I'm riding through.\" But even if you take a spill during the winter, bike mechanic Bob (The Wrench) Nowak says it's nothing like falling off your bike in the summer. \"The load is dissipated as you slide so it's nowhere near as bad. Plus you're in this massive padded clothing anyway, and if you fall into a snow bank, you're usually laughing.\" CLOTHING Frozen fingers and toes; frost in your eyelashes; shivering to the very core: these images are just a few that may flash in people's minds when they picture what winter biking is like in Calgary. But Steve Zacharias, who was a cyclist with Fireball Couriers in Calgary for ten years, says the only challenges involved in winter cycling that don't exist in the summer are \"slippery roads and frost bite.\" \"It's easy to stay warm,\" he adds. \"Being outside is fun as long as you're warmly dressed.\" In fact, Carter says that cyclists are more likely to over dress than under dress for the winter weather. \"People think that there's this myth that you really need to gear up, to go buy all this plastic, water-proof stuff and I just disagree with that,\" says Carter. Instead, his advice for people who are getting into winter cycling is to just get going, and to figure out what works best for them along the way. \"Don't try to over complicate it if you're going to give it a shot, just give it a go and use the stuff you already have in your closet.\" GEAR In terms of the bike itself, experts and more casual commuters alike recommend using an older, beaten up bike in the winter rather than a brand new one. Ian Parsons, who works at Total Energy, a downtown oil and gas company, says \"The salt and the slush can be a little hard on the bike.\" Parsons has been a winter cyclist since his university days in Ottawa and never looked back. Carter adds that the chemicals that the city puts on the roads \"will weld bike parts together; it's really nasty, so if somebody is going to be riding in the winter it's a really good idea to do some preventative maintenance as often as possible.\" MAINTENANCE Winter maintenance can be more of a commitment than it can be in the summer time, so it's a good idea to be prepared. Carter says he recommends washing your bike once a week with soapy water to get salt and chemicals off. Bikes simply get dirtier and are more likely to get dinged by small rocks and gravel in the winter, so a little extra care will help it last longer. Parsons also advises taking a bike mechanics course to prepare for maintenance that winter riding requires. \"I've got four bikes now, and I know how to fix them all so I never need to go to a bike shop,\" he says, adding that this has saved him a lot of money in the long term. ROUTE PLANNING Another big consideration when preparing for winter biking is planning your routes. Carter says that the city helps with this: \"The Parks Department plows the pathways, and they're incredible. After a snowfall, they're usually out and have cleared most of the paths by 6:30, 7 o'clock in the morning. \"If you live close to the Bow River or Elbow River pathways there's a really good chance that your commute might actually be faster in the winter then it is in the summer because of how bad the gridlock is in the wintertime here.\" Carter adds that being flexible is also a great way to get comfortable with winter biking. \"Don't assume that when the snow falls you can go on the exact same roads that you did before. It's not a bad idea to experiment through the winter with different ways of getting places.Winter biking How to prepare for Calgary's cold weather commutes Olivia Grecu | ogrecu@cjournal.ca Photo Illustration: Derek Mange/Calgary Journal With the cold Calgary weather, some cyclists shy away from commuting by bike. However, some steps can be taken to make the frosty conditions more bearable for bikers. January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 6In Calgary there is a growing number of cyclists who are willing to face the harsh winters in order to get exercise, skip the bus, save a buck or save the environment. But the city needs to provide an extra something in order to keep that number on the rise. Richard Zach, the vice president of Bike Calgary, said that the trend of winter cyclists in Calgary has been on the rise in the last five years. According to statistics released by the City of Calgary in 2011, the number of cyclists in 2010 increased nine per cent from 2002. The data showed 9,438 cyclists commuting in and out of the central business district within a 16-hour period. The numbers are expected to continue climb-ing. In Copenhagen, Denmark, also known as the City of Cyclists, the number of cyclists puts Canadians and Calgarians to shame. In 2010, with a population of 1.08 million people, 50 per cent of residents in the Greater Copenhagen Area commuted by bike, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website. Mikael Colville-Andersen, a creator of Cycle Chic \u2014 a photo blog that displays stylish women on bicycles \u2014 is often referred to as Denmark's bicycle ambas-sador. He said that he recently saw stats that showed the Yukon and the Northwest Territories had the highest bicycle commuter statistics in Canada. \"I've never been there,\" he said. \"I thought it was pretty funny.\" The 2006 census released by Statistics Canada reports that 2.6 per cent of people in the Yukon com-muted to work by bicycle and 2.0 in the Northwest Territories, compared to the 1.1 per cent in Alberta in the same year. Colville-Andersen said that even Montreal, often referred to as North America's premier bicycle city, doesn't leave its bicycle lanes open during the winter. STEP 1: INFRASTRUCTURE Some city elements that may encourage cyclists could be adding lanes on busy streets, providing locations to securely store bikes and gear, setting up showers and other amenities for those with longer commutes, and maintaining paths and lanes. \"Infrastructure makes people feel safe. It also keeps them safe,\" Colville-Andersen said. Cycle tracks, or barricaded lanes on busy streets that separate cyclists from traffic and pedestrians, are an example of this kind of infrastructure. The City of Calgary is looking to install the first phase of cycle tracks in spring 2013; according to their website, the tracks will be set up on 6th Street and 7th Street S.W. Colville-Andersen said that it's important for cities to ensure proper winter up-keep of the cycling tracks. But \"that's what makes people ride their bikes,\" Colville-Andersen said. He said that in Copenhagen, when snow is fore- casted, all of the tracks are salted and prepped. When the snow hits, the lanes are quickly cleared. \"If it's a snow storm you can see these little bike lane cleaners buzzing up and down six or seven times before the roads are even touched.\" In Canada, Colville-Andersen said he thinks it shouldn't be difficult to keep up maintenance and snow removal of the tracks thanks to the \"arsenal of snow clearing machinery that Canadian cities have.\" Despite this though, Colville-Andersen said that he thinks some Canadian cities aren't making the effort to clear the bicycle lanes. \"Snow plows just shove it rudely off to the right and it usually ends up in the bike lane.\" STEP 2: STREAM LINE ROUTES Colville-Andersen said: \"All we want is a quick A to B; this is universal with homo sapiens. We're like riv-ers, we'll always try to find the quickest route.\" He said that because of this, bicycle routes need to be streamlined to cut down the travel time for those using them. But in Calgary this may be difficult because of the city's size. Bicycle commuter Max Shultz said \"One thing about Calgary compared to European cities is that we're super spread out and we're not very cycle-friendly.\" Colville-Andersen said that the city can help streamline bicycle routes by putting them on main roads rather than residential routes.By adding cycle tracks, he says that he thinks more people will take bikes, even on cold, wintery days. STEP 3: EDUCATION Richard Zach, vice president of Bike Calgary, said edu-cation is also a big factor in encouraging winter cycling. He said that he thinks it makes citizens more confident while cycling - especially in tough, winter conditions. That's why he said he thinks bicycle education \"should start in the school but it should also be a part of driver's education.\" WHY SHOULD WE CARE? Colville-Anderson said encouraging cycling in Calgary is important because bicycles have become the symbol of a modern city. Using Paris and New York as examples, he said: \"Modern cities now are the ones that are prioritizing bicycles, public transport, pedestrianism, and trying to take away car trips. \"This is the new normal.\"Colville-Anderson says he thinks a lot of Canadian cities are lagging behind in terms of making them-selves more bicycle-friendly. \"There's no place for automobiles in the big cities, or in our future,\" Colville-Andersen said.Cycling up to speed City lags behind on infrastructure, says enthusiast CAITLIN C LOW | cclow@cjournal.ca The bike racks on Stephen Avenue were nearly full despite the snowy weather in November.

A program that is run by the city to discourage vandalism contracts artists to paint public art pieces on local utility boxes. With the newly painted boxes throughout the city, there has been a sharp decrease in graffiti on city-owned power and utility boxes. Peter Bushe, a road sign and streetlight project specialist, is in charge of the program and helps or-ganize and make things as simple as possible for the commissioned artists. A painted box can cost up to $700 to $1,100, which includes artist fees and $400 to $700 to prep the box and provide and supply special paint. The funds come from money that is allocated in the city's budget for graffiti removal, Bushe said. Bushe said that since the introduction of the pro- gram, the city has seen a 91 per cent to 92 per cent reduction of vandalism for the utility boxes. However, Bushe said that he also shares a similar motive as the artists. \"We want to get rid of vandal-ism and graffiti but we are also trying to inject a little more art into Calgary,\" he said. Multi P ur P ose a rt Local participants have come to see the boxes as a way to bring life to Calgary communities. However, Wil Yee, who has done six boxes for the program, said that it was also an interesting way to give back to the community. \"Not everyone wants to go to an art gallery, it's a great way to share it while participating in your city,\" he said. One of Yee's first boxes - located on 16th Avenue and Center A Street N.E. - displays two colourful Chinese New Year dragons. Yee said that it was an honour to complete it for the Chinese community. Emma Bresola, an Italian immigrant and artist, has painted four boxes through the program. In an email interview, Bresola, who has been living in Calgary since June 2010, said that she was looking for local art opportunities and found the applica-tion online. Bresola said that she has received public praise while doing her boxes. \"People were grateful for what I was doing for the City. Most of them told me that was an awesome, great, joyful and ironic job,\" she said. The artists have a signature styles, and Bresola is not an exception. She calls her designs \"Dino Sounds.\" Her boxes are playful and childlike, featuring parad- ing dinosaurs engaged in activities such as playing instruments, wearing roller skates and driving cars. It is the perfect scene of a child's mind, even down to the bright colours used to exaggerate the playful nature of her pieces. \"Somebody said my work makes people smile and this comment make me really laugh: 'Did you paint this so funny? I want to be like you when I grow up!' - and he was not a child.\" While many artists said they had fun doing the boxes, they were all aware and even happy to help stop vandalism in the Calgary community. Yee said that the program is doing a fantastic job and that it's a bonus that it helps deter vandalism. \"We understand that was the point of the program but it works hand in hand,\" he said. \"We are praised for bringing art to the community but there are many purposes of art.\" Bresola also said that the idea of using art to deter vandalism was an enjoyable and fun way to bring awareness to the issue. \"Using art to deter vandalism is a demonstration that we should not underestimate the worth and power of art. Maybe even vandals smile when they see colourful dinosaurs around Calgary instead of anonymous grey boxes.\" One of the many \"Dino Sound\" boxes by Emma Bresola. Since the program began, there has been more than a 90 per cent decrease of vandalism towards the boxes.Photo courtnesy of Emma Bresola One of Wil Yee's boxes showcasing his signature Chinese dragon.

In a recent article published by The Walrus magazine, Canada research chair Ken Coates and professor Bill Mor-rison said that many arts graduates are destined to remain in debt and underemployed. Elsewhere, a 2009 survey by the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission found that, two years after graduation, only 45 per cent of employed arts graduates held jobs that required a university education. By compari-son, 77 per cent of applied arts and sciences graduates held jobs that required a university education. That kind of evidence is the reason Coates and Morrison argue that Canadians should question their belief that \"personal choice trumps all other considerations when students apply to university.\" Nevertheless, universities routinely entice prospective students with the promise that an arts education will give them the skills they need to succeed. On Mount Royal University's Faculty of Arts webpage, Dean Jeffrey Keshen composed a message to prospective students: \"Employers seek arts graduates because of their broad knowledge and extraordinary ability to synthesize and clearly explain patterns drawn from vast amounts of information.\" University of Calgary Faculty of Arts Dean Richard Sigurd- son was unable to comment. As for Keshen, he rejects Coates and Morrison's argument as too practical an approach to choosing a career path.He says: \"I heard it when I was going into university: 'Make sure you take a practical degree.' You know what a practical degree is? A practical degree is one that you feel passionate about; because if you feel passionate about something you're going to do really well at it,\" he says. \"The worst thing is to tailor your career to what you think the job market's going to be demanding of you because, I can tell you, the job market's always going to change.\" Keshen says it is the responsibility of universities to reach out to employers and \"make them better aware of the qualities that arts students bring, which is the ability to adapt to situations with that type of skill set and flexible thinking that we encourage. Karim Dharamsi, the chair of Mount Royal University's general education department, objects to the suggestion that critical thinking skills are the domain of the arts alone. Instead, he says that critical thought \"belongs to every discipline\" and that the specialty of arts graduates is their ability to work with text, as well as making sense of really complex ideas. However, Simon Fraser University marketing professor Dr. Lindsay Meredith believes universities are justified in emphasizing the value of the critical thinking skills gained with an arts degree. She says: \"That variation in the subject material gives [arts students] a different perspective, a wider perspective, and that helps people become much more flexible in how they approach the problem, and getting away from, 'Gee, I'm a hammer and I'll define every problem to be a nail because that's what I know how to do.'\"However, Meredith argues an arts degree needs to be supplemented with business courses, additional degrees or experience to have currency in the corporate world. \"If the student has no training in any kind of manage- rial skills like marketing, accounting, a little bit of finance, HR, then clearly they have no skill level to take into the organization.\" Whether arts students are aware of the need to acquire these extra skills is difficult to measure. University of Calgary career services director Col- leen Bangs says that students benefit most from their services if the students themselves are actively planning for the future. \"Oftentimes the biggest challenge for grads of bach- elor of arts programs is just that they're not quite sure exactly what they want to do and how they can apply their skills.\" Moreover, Mount Royal University's career and employ- ment development supervisor Patsy Valenzuela warns students, \"It's not good enough to say that you're a great critical thinker.\" \"You have to have really clear examples of how you can apply that in the world of work,\" she said. As for Bangs, who holds an arts degree herself, she says: \"Something I often tell students here is you have to be willing to start entry level. My first professional job I worked as a receptionist.\" \"I had to be willing to put in my time learning about organizations, and the degree seemed to open doors as I got more experience.\" Some question the value of an arts degree, others defend it JESSICA RYAN | jryan@cjournal.ca Practical Global Focused10x7.5 BW Now Accepting Applications for September 2013 The Master of Public Policy at The School of Public Policy is a career-focused, twelve-month, professional graduate degree program for individuals interested or engaged in the business of public policy analysis and practice.

Ald. Andre Chabot posed a question from the community that perturbed nearly everyone in the room. \"A resident in my ward informed me of something I found quite troubling, it seems that without know-ing she has violated a bylaw regarding 'cat trap-ping,'\" Chabot said. A confused silence fell over the room, no one sure what to make of the issue. Cat trapping is when a resident catches cats in a city-certified trap on their own property. However, a contract must be obtained from the city first, to ensure only people who are authorized may trap the animals. People cat trap for a variety of reasons: the cat may be feral, or it could be a neighbour's cat that is terrorizing their property. Once the cat is caught, it must be taken care of so no harm comes to the cat, like malnourishment or exposure to cold weather. It is then the trapper's job to take the cat to animal services, where charges may be filed towards the cat's owners. The woman, who has chosen to remain anony- mous as she fears backlash from her neighbours for the act, said that she wasn't told of a bylaw stating that after Oct. 15, cat trapping was no longer permit-ted. \"There's no mention of dates on the contract, and I had brought in a cat on the 19th of October and not heard a mention of this,\" she said. The issue with trapping after a certain date is that it's considered cruel to the animals to keep them in a cage in the cold weather. Although the woman says the weather was fine the night she caught the cat, the officer at Animal Services wouldn't budge on the matter. After being told she was cruel to the cat, the woman's contract for trapping was suspended indefinitely. It was then that she called Chabot, and he brought the issue forward to the council. \"Are there parameters specifically around the date, and are our contracts specific on this issue? Is an apology to the resident in order?\" Chabot asked the council. The stunned silence lasted only a few moments, until Erika Hargesheimer, the General Manager of Community Services and General Services stood up. \"I'll look into the particulars of this contract and respond back to Alderman Chabot. If the terms under which this contract was issued were not clear with respect to a date limitation, then an apology would be warranted,\" Hargesheimer said. Unfortunately for the cat trapper, this doesn't necessarily mean she'll get her license renewed next year. Despite some nagging thoughts, she's decided to take the high road. \"I had thought to continue to trap - I have a right to protect my property - and take the cats out of the city, leaving them in some field somewhere, but came to the conclusion that doing that would endanger the cat and I'm not that kind of person,\" the woman said. Once the matter was resolved in city council, May- or Naheed Nenshi simply shrugged his shoulders. \"Cat trapping. Learn something new every day.\" Legislation has suspended cat trapping as the weather now gets too cold at night for the animals to be caged.

He was the party's leader until 2000, when the Reform Party evolved into the Canadian Alliance. Manning also served as a Member of Parliament for the riding of Calgary Southwest from 1993 to 2002. Although he has officially been retired from political life for a decade, Manning has remained as political as ever, frequently appearing as a media commentator and public speaker. He is also the CEO of the Manning Centre for Building Democracy \u2014 a Calgary-based con-servative think-tank. Manning recently sat down for a conversation with the Calgary Journal where he discussed his work with the Manning Centre, his interest in environmental issues, as well his thoughts on the need for citizens to engage with public issues. Editor's note: questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity. Y O u've been R e T i R ed f RO m p OL i T ic AL O ffice f OR 10 Y e AR s. Wh AT h A ve YO u been up TO? My main area of work has been with the Manning Cen-tre, which is focused on building democracy. It involves raising money and putting those funds into programs designed to strengthen the knowledge, skills and ethical foundation of political practitioners \u2014 particu-larly those that come from a conservative orientation because that is where I have my influence. We have a location in Calgary that is going to be at the heart of our training centre. It will be opening next year. I have been 100 per cent involved in that. Wh AT is YO u R visi O n f OR T his cen TR e? Wh AT d O YO u h O pe TO A chieve W i T h i T? There are two levels. The first is that we want to improve the success of campaign managers and candi-dates in the sense of winning more elections. But more importantly than that, we want political practitioners to be able to govern in accordance with their principles once they get elected. Part of our impetus in setting up the Manning Cen- tre is that the old idea was you learned a lot of this on the job. But with the pace of news today and the rise in instant communication, you better arrive at your posi-tion \u2014 whether it's a campaign manager or candidate who is either running for office or one who has already been elected \u2014 well prepared. Otherwise, you can make just one mistake and you will be on YouTube tonight and be finished by tomorrow morning.

Whe R e d O es YO u R pe R s O n AL in T e R es T in envi- RO nmen TAL issues c O me f RO m? I believe that there is common ground between con-servation and conservatism. The words have the same root. So conservatives shouldn't see environmental conservation as a departure from their conservative philosophy. Way back when I was studying physics in university, one of the few laws of physics that I actually remem-bered learning was the law of conservation of energy and mass. If you take a ton of oil sands out of the Atha-basca and you get 500 pounds of oil, what happens to the other 1,500 pounds? The law of conservation of energy and mass says that it has to go somewhere. You can't extract things from nature to produce goods and services without having waste and pollution to deal with. Secondly, like many older people, I have been quite influenced on environmental issues by my children. We have five children. Along with our oldest son, we are involved in organic ranching in the Cypress Hills. He is very dedicated \u2014 and we are too \u2014 in conserving that unbroken area of grassland. So my children have influenced me in this regard.

He believed you should get experience in other areas, such as business, before becoming involved in politics. I never planned on a political career. In 1965, there was an opportunity to run in a riding that I didn't have much chance of winning. I took advantage of that to get some experience. But then I went on to work in management consulting for 20 years before I became involved in a political career. Wh AT AR e YO u R T h O ugh T s O n T he p OL i T ic AL LA ndsc A pe in A L be RTA ?

There have always been long periods of a one-party government. After a while, the government gets tired and old. It then rejuvenates itself \u2014 it gets a new lease on life with a new leader or a new theme. Alberta governing parties have been able to do that \u2014 that is why they have been in power so long. But at some point, that no longer works and the governing party gets replaced. The odd thing about Alberta politics is that no government has ever been replaced by its traditional opposition. A new group coming out of the woodwork has always replaced it. Until I see something different, I think that pattern will continue to hold.

One negative argument is that if you choose not to involve yourself in the politics of your country, you will end up being governed by those who do. So if you don't like what is going on or you don't like the direc-tion that some issues are taking, all you need to do is to stay uninvolved and things will continue to get worse. The second argument is more inspirational and involves the Reform Party story. Whether you believe in our particular method or viewpoint is not the point. The tools of democracy \u2014 freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of trying to persuade people to do something \u2014 still exist. With the Reform Party, a small group of people was able to take those tools and change the national agenda. It's true that the change wasn't anywhere near the degree that we had hoped for \u2014 but it can be done. So I try to hold that up. If people feel passionately enough about something, they can bring about change. There is enough freedom in Canada, and the population is not that big. When you have to move 50 million people in the United States or you don't even show up on the radar screen, that is one thing. But in this country, we managed to move two million people and it was enough to get the other parties to change their agendas. \"If you choose not to involve yourself in the politics of your country, you will end up being governed by those who do.\" \u2014 preston manning, Reform p arty leader,1987-2000 After retiring from Parliament in 2002, Manning is now the CEO of the Manning Centre for Building Democracy.Photo: Karry Taylor/Calgary Journal January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 11 Saving face Albertans explain their feelings towards United Nations Paulina liwski | pliwski@cjournal.ca Canada's Conservative govern- ment may have no greater ally than the people of Alberta in its ongoing criticism of the United Nations. But supporters of the interna-tional organization are now working to change that. According to a statement obtained by QMI Agency, the government's criti-cism recently took the form of Canada chastising the United Nations for its \"one-sided\" treatment of Israel. That criticism was prompted by the international organization's Human Rights Council sending a fact-finding mission to \"investigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people.\" But Canada's attacks on the United Nations have included Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, John Baird's infamous speech criticising it for spending \"too much time on itself,\" as well as Conservative MP suggesting Canada pull out of the international organization. According to an online poll by Aba- cus Data, those criticisms may find the most support in Alberta where 27 per cent of residents have an unfavourable impression of the United Nations \u2014 the highest level in Canada. The Alberta sample of the poll was comparatively small \u2014 100 out of the 1,008 randomly selected Canadian adults who participated in the survey. Still, Melanie-Anne Bonnar, the presi- dent of the United Nations Association of Canada in Calgary, said that she was surprised by the results. She believes the main reason for this lack of support is the inability of the United Nations Security Council reach-ing important decisions and resolving major world conflicts internationally. But she pointed out: \"The United Nations is so much more than just the Security Council. It's comprised of over 50 organizations, specialized agencies and programs that are doing a whole range of different services that are working towards the bet-terment of the world.\" However, when asked about Albertans' lukewarm approach to the United Nations, David Co - letto, CEO of Abacus Data stated it's hard to pinpoint what drives people's opinions about the in-ternational organization. Coletto said Canada spends a lot of money on the United Nations and some Canadians are left wondering whether it is worth it. \"Canadians generally want to support the UN and they think it's important, but they scratch their heads when it does something unpredictable like appointing countries with questionable human rights re - cords to the human rights com - mission.\" Alternatively, Mount Royal University policy studies pro - fessor Duane Bratt stated the findings are not that surprising and that they correspond with polls that he has seen before. Bratt said he believes the Conservative government's criticism of the United Nations has in fact caused Albertans to feel this way. \"We can see that with the de - feat of the Canadian bid to get on the Security Council as well as the speech that John Baird gave to the general assembly back in September criticizing the UN.\" The Calgary branch of the United Nations Association of Canada will be looking into some solutions to improve its image in Alberta. Bonnar said the group is trying to create more opportunities for the public to voice their concerns and opinions on how the UN should im-prove its image. \"The association will be focusing on engaging Calgary's youth on what the United Nations does and why it is so important for Canada to be continu-ally involved in the United Nations.\" Abacus conducted the poll on June 26, 2012. It had a margin of error of 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20.

My doctor reas-sured me this was a normal thing for many young women. In 2004, my doctor finally decided to investigate my family medical history and took blood work. She told me I had high levels of active testoster- one hormones. She referred to them as active sex hormones. On top of weight gain, I started developing acne - something I never had to deal with earlier. My body hair was also gradually getting darker. Then I started growing hairs in strange places. I quickly plucked them, freaking out thinking I was transforming into a man. Little did I know, there was a lot more happen- ing inside my lady bits, and all of these symptoms were caused by the irregularities in my hormone levels. Kerissa Nielsen - a homeopathic doctor who specializes in hormones and women's health at the Nielsen Homeopathic & Integrative Clinic in Calgary - explains polycystic ovarian syndrome - or PCOS - as a \"hormonal, reproductive and meta-bolic disorder, where there are abnormal levels of testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, glucose and insulin in the blood.\" That abnormality, in turn, leads to the formation of cysts in the ovaries. How did my doctor miss this? She had been see- ing me for most of my life. Nielsen explained that PCOS is often misdiag- nosed because the symptoms are plentiful and have roots in a variety of other conditions. Nielsen said PCOS affects five to 10 per cent of women in their childbearing years and it's the most frequent cause of infertility. She said symptoms can include: not ovulating, not menstruating, heavy periods, spotting, irregu-lar periods or cycles, infertility, weight gain, exces-sive hair growth, acne, changes in skin, dandruff, insulin resistance or high insulin, high cholesterol and hypertension. Nielsen said, \"The cause is unknown,\" but she said it is most likely related to genetics. That means PCOS may be hereditary. Thanks mom. It wasn't until 2009 - when I saw Nielsen - that I was diagnosed with the condition. She suggested I take this diagnos's to my medi- cal doctor to get more bloodwork and an ultra-sound. My doctor seemed surprised when I brought up the idea of PCOS but said it could explain most of the issues I had brought to her in the past. At the age of 20, the idea of possibly not being able to conceive was terrifying. It wasn't until early 2012 that I was officially tested, with my new doctor confirming I did, in fact, have PCOS. This syndrome is not a pretty one, nor is it very apparent to people. But when I look in a mirror I see a lot more. This syndrome basically strips me of my femininity. The invisible syndrome PCOS affects many women, but they may not even know they have it. This could be a result of the lack of awareness sur- rounding the syndrome. Although the origins of the syndrome are unclear, Nielsen believes PCOS is related to diet, genetics, stress levels, hours of sleep and outside influences of hormones - such as the birth control pill or other pharmaceuticals. One of the tell tale signs is fast weight gain.It is still unknown whether or not the weight gain causes the cysts that lead to PCOS or vice versa. Nielsen said, \"The question is like, which came first the chicken or the egg. No one really knows this answer.\" h ow T o regain con T rol There is no real cure for PCOS, but the symptoms can be controlled. Birth control is the main pill prescribed to help level progesterone, estrogen and testosterone levels. Nielsen said it only takes care of half of the issue and there are more natural steps the individual can take to get control. By losing as little as 10 per cent of total body weight, periods will quickly become more regular. Nielsen said, \"Watch what you are eating, staying away from sugars, bad carbs and high estrogenic foods,\" This will help control insulin and hormone levels.\" Nielsen said another good way to regulate hor- mones is to \"have intercourse, and primarily have an orgasm, minimum, once a week.\" This will exercise your hormones. When hormones start to balance out, symptoms will subside, but they'll never go away completely. r ound ou T T he T rea T men T Nielsen said that because PCOS is on the rise, more doctors are beginning to immediately test for addi-tional symptoms leading to faster diagnoses. Medical doctors will treat the condition's symptoms, but Nielsen recommends also seeing a homeopathic, naturopathic or Chinese medical doctor. Nielsen also says to eat well, sleep lots, work out, and keep stress levels under control. \"Please do not try to 'fight' this on your own,\" Nielsen said. There is a lot of ways to seek out help and there are tons of support groups online such as soulcysters.com. So be your own medical advocate, ask your doctors questions and tell a loved one. Tell your mothers, your sisters, your girlfriends, about this syndrome. More people need to know about PCOS, especially since it affects so many of us.

Do you follow me so far?\" \"Where are you going with this dad?\"\"You need to decide if you're going to go on a doping regimen or not. It's going to be your best shot at making it pro.\" He perks up. He's taking me serious at this point.\"I don't get it Dad. Why do I have to? Can't I just play the way I've been playing? I'm really good aren't I?\" \"Well son, it all started with a man named Lance Armstrong who pulled off the greatest doping pro-gram of all time, culminating in an unprecedented dynasty of seven straight Tour de France victories...\" Progressive idea or foolish notion? Writing about this conversation makes me uncom-fortable, but it could very well be a reality if some academics and casual armchair quarterbacks had their way. A recent article written by Ellis Cashmore \u2014 a British professor of culture, media and sport \u2014 tries to make the argument for the legalization of doping in sports on the grounds that it would make sports safer for the athletes. Just listen to any sports talk radio show since Lance Armstrong gave up his fight against doping allegations, and you'll hear similar musings from callers to radio hosts. I would venture to guess most supporters of legalization have never played sports competitively, if at all. Steroids have been at the forefront of many of sports modern scandals : Canadian Sprinter Ben Johnson losing his Olympic gold, the MLB steroids scandal of the late nineties that later spawned the Mitchell Report, to Lance Armstrong and the US Postal team. There has been a constant cat and mouse game between doping athletes and the agencies charged with sniffing out the cheaters who use. Critics, like Cashmore, charge that anti-doping agencies have been behind the curve of the manu-facturers of the performance enhancers. I'll concede that he may be right, but does that mean we as a society should just quit trying to catch cheaters? The essence of sport has always been our best versus your best: the ancient Olympics, the gladiator battles of Rome, David and Goliath. Some of the greatest moments in sport have come from an underdog overcoming almost insur-mountable odds to defeat it's opponent. Legalizing drug use into sports erodes that pure essence. If you are not feeling ready to play, no problem, just take an \"upper\" and you're ready to compete. Feeling outmatched? Don't try to train harder or work at getting better, just inject a growth hormone and you are now equal to your opponent. By accepting cheating as a fact of life, and allow- ing it to become part of the fabric of the institution of sport, we lose that essence of competition. And don't forget the moral implications. It's naive to think that only trained adult athletes will take performance enhancers if they became legal at an elite level. Teens will no doubt feel the pressure from peers and perhaps even their parents to take performance enhancers too. I don't need a doctorate to understand that if these drugs cause adverse health effects to adults, it could only be worse for a child. a t the end of the day Call me a purist, an idealist, or just a guy stuck in an old mindset and in need of a progressive perspec-tive to the way life is now. Maybe my feelings on sport are irrational because I'm too emotionally involved in it and I'm unable to stand back and take an objective look. But if you ask anyone who has played and enjoyed sports, their greatest motivation was that they just loved to play; win or lose they loved the competi-tion. To paint all pro athletes as dopers and cheaters because of a minority of them are wrong. There are many who have excelled and been successful cleanly. I would venture to say that there are far more who compete clean than \"dirty\". It is akin to painting all bank industry workers as money grubbing thieves, because of a few at the top of Wall Street who got greedy. Back to my conversation with my son. \"But dad, I'm really good. You know that. I'm good without the drugs, can't I be the best without them?\" \"Society tells us no my boy. If you're not cheating, you're not trying.\"Will we soon see the day where you can buy steroids in the same stores as your sports gear?Photo Illustration: Geoff Crane/Calgary JournalEverybody's doing it...

She has established multiple kids cancer care pro- grams and won many prestigious awards, all while balancing a busy professional and personal life. \"I had no idea how difficult it was going to be, I just knew it had to be done,\" McIver says. McIver started her battle against childhood cancer in 1988, initially running the organization out of her basement. \"Everything was from ground zero ... with just passion to guide me, and my little angel on my shoulder,\" McIver says. I N s PIRA t I o N fo R th E f ou N d A t I o N McIver's little angel is her son, Derek Wandzura. Derek was five-years-old when he was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor in 1986. Derek was about to go through a bone marrow transplant at the Alberta Children's Hospital and McIver wanted to give him a place to be a kid. \"I needed something for him to look forward to after he finished that horrible journey.\" It took eight hours for doctors to remove Derek's brain tumor and 10 weeks of radiation. Afterward, he had to relearn how to walk and talk. \"It stunted his growth, and it stunted his learning, but it didn't stunt his love that he had for all his fam-ily and friends,\" she says. \"That's the way I remember Derek.\" Derek passed away four years later, when he was only nine. \"In between that time, he fought like anything to live, but it was just not to be.\" McIver says that at the time she was a legal as- sistant, with no experience with fundraising or event programming, and that she learned how to fund-raise through her peers and by reading books in the evening. \"I only had passion - no information. I had no idea what I was getting myself into,\" McIver says. She formed a board of directors for Kids Cancer Care mostly through her friends: lawyers, doctors, accountants and parents. McIver says she put in 18 hours every day \"for years on end.\" \"It was a formidable time ... because I was so na\u00efve. What would take everybody a couple of hours to do took me twice as long to do because I had to learn how to do it for the first time,\" she says. PR o GRAM s th R ou G h th E fou N d A t I o N McIver and her organization have just finished their first season of Camp Kindle, the first specialized chil-dren's cancer camp in Alberta, just north of Cochrane. The group purchased the camp in 2009 at a cost of $10-million. The camp offers an activity centre, sports fields, a climbing tower, swimming pools, a music hall, as well as full kitchen facilities and a medical centre, all of which are wheelchair accessible. \"That's the place where they come to be healed, and discover new joys, and new meaning of life, and new friends - and really, just rekindle their spirits,\" McIver says. Kids Cancer Care has also funded a floor at the Health Research Innovation Centre at the University of Calgary - the Hughes Children's Cancer Research Centre. McIver says that the organiza- tion has also put hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last 12 years toward hospital programs. McIver happily proclaims, \"Alberta probably en- joys the biggest advantage of any place in the world for programs, services, care, treatment, research - everything.\" In 2008, she also founded the Derek Wandzura Memorial Scholarship Fund, which offers $5,000 in bursaries to post-secondary students who have dealt with childhood cancers. R E co GNI t I o N AN d A w AR ds Though McIver has been the recipient of multiple prestigious awards, she says she is most proud of is the Governor General's Meritorious Service Medal. She wears the pin proudly on her collar every day. \"I call it my Derek pin because I remember him and think about him every morning that I put it on,\" she says. t h E f utu RE McIver has been married for five years to Ric McIver, Alberta's Minister of Transportation. Though both have demanding schedules and Ric spends a lot of time in Edmonton, McIver says they make each mo-ment count. Ric says, \"We're partners; we're a team. Our time together is precious.\" Christine says, \"We're so fulfilled in our profes- sional lives, that now we are helping each other to be fulfilled in our private lives too.\" For the future of KCC, McIver hopes the organiza- tion can continue to provide programs, services, and funding towards research. She said that all of the current programs are strong, and that they are making sure that they are getting efficacy for every donor's dollar. \"I hope that we're able to realize our dreams, and that the social enterprise part of Camp Kindle thrives into tomorrow.\" Christine McIver was awarded the Governor General's Meritorious Service Medal in 2004.

But today, Allard lives a very independent life and is able to do all the simple things that others take for granted, thanks to her guide dog Zircon. Together they make a team and even have a name: put them both together and you have \"Ziane.\" Zircon is constantly by her side. In the morning, he nibbles on her ear to wake her up. \"Every morning I get up smiling because of him, he has made my life whole and complete,\" Allard said. The bond these two have is clearly evident, and Allard said that Zircon has given her a \"new leash on life.\" When talking about Zircon, Allard has a smile on her face that can't be broken. Teri Maxwell has been friends with Allard for the past six years and has seen many changes in her since Zircon came into her life, which was only a few months ago. \"They instantly clicked, she's so much more upbeat and confident,\" Maxwell said. Allard was born with what is known as Usher's syndrome, which is associ-ated with hearing and vision loss. The syndrome is gradual, so Allard pre-pared herself mentally for the day that she would be completely blind. Maxwell said: \"With her syndrome she was confined, but now with Zircon she can get up and go. It changed her outlook.\" Zircon came from BC and Alberta Guide Dog Services, which is a reg-istered charity that provides profes-sionally trained guide dogs for visually impaired people. These dogs, which are normally labs, golden retrievers or golden retriever lab crosses, go through an extensive training pro-gram. During this training, the dogs are taught to help their user navigate roads safely by locating landmarks and avoiding obstacles. Brenda Wagner was the trainer for Zircon and said she easily fell in love with him. Zircon was the 12th dog she trained. \"It still chokes me up knowing the difference a dog makes in a person's life,\" Wagner said. \"With Zircon it was easy to get at- tached. He was a delight.\" Zircon is a true testament to a man's best friend and has given Allard the best gift anyone could ask for: to lead a normal, independent life.

Moving to a new country can require numerous adaptations, one of them being the need to learn a new language. Husband and wife Patrick Xiao and Sue Guo, moved to Canada from Bei-jing 10 years ago. Their native tongue is Mandarin Chinese. Upon moving, it was crucial that they improved their Englis, in speaking, reading and writing so they could be better integrated in society. When they arrived in Canada, Guo and her husband were able to manage with the little bit of English instruction they received in China as well as the English as a Second Language program they enrolled in after moving here. Guo also relied on other readily avail-able resources such as TV and radio to improve her English skills. Susan Bowen, a Grade 2 teacher at Calgary Christian School, explained the importance of being able to read and interpret the messages within our environment. \"Our society is rich in text, from road signs to news reporting. As we contin-ue in this age of information overload, we will be challenged more and more if reading is difficult or strenuous for us,\" Bowen said. Having been here for a decade, Guo said she and her husband now feel comfortable with English, and their daughter initially struggled but caught up quickly. It is their younger son, Patrick, who is having difficulty. Patrick is in Grade 1, and Guo said he is behind the expected reading level. Bowen said this generates overall concern for his future academics be-cause literacy is the base of educational understanding. \"Early reading fluency is the founda- tion upon which later academic success is built,\" she said. \"It is critical for work-ing independently, comprehension and for reading for pleasure.\" Guo said they found out that Patrick was struggling during parent-teacher interviews. Since then, Guo said they have come up with a ways to get him reading. She said they made flash cards, and the rule is that Patrick has to practice pronouncing the words on the cards each day. If he practices as he's supposed to, he is rewarded. \"This really works,\" Guo said.In addition to this, Guo said they will likely seek further assistance for Patrick to help him learn the fundamentals of English. She said they are hoping to enroll him in the Kumon reading program. Literacy coach Meran Wilson said there are many things foreign parents can do to help their kids learn English. \"Calgary offers many resources for children to be successful readers,\" Meran said. \"The public library has free programs for children as well as dual language books on CD and DVD. They also have a website for children to access from home or while visiting the library. \"The Calgary Zoo and Telus Spark Science Centre are wonderful places to visit where children can develop language skills and learn about the world around them. When riding in a car, a bus or on the CTrain, parents can talk to their children about the sights they pass.\" Meran said that reading the signs in our environment \"develops a memory bank of words.\" Guo has found that helping Patrick practice reading benefits her at the same time. \"When I don't know a word, I'll look it up online and learn the meaning,\" she said. \" It helps me too.\" Patrick and his mom Sue read short stories regularly to improve his reading skills.Photo: Sydney Karg/Calgary Journal January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 16\"I started with nothing,\" Leah Layden said. \"And I mean that, so to have what I have now is an enormous step for me.\" That enormous step means that Layden has gone from being on EI, to now being her own boss and the owner of her own business. After graduating from a self-employment program run by the non-profit group Momentum, Layden opened Double Elle Bakery in the southeast community of Grandview just over a year ago. \"I needed support,\" Layden said of the Momen- tum program, \"and I knew I couldn't just open a business on my own and expect to succeed right away. I wanted to get a skill set that would help me with that.\" WHAT IS MOMENTUM? Momentum gives lessons and coaching to those in low-income households for managing their finances, gaining trades skills and starting a business. \"Not everyone is cut out to work a regular job,\" Layden said. \"It gives an opportunity to people who wouldn't normally be able to go to university. It's excellent.\" Layden said that the key to Momentum was pro- viding people with support and useful information and tools, so that they could be better prepared for the future. \"They are realistic,\" Layden said. \"They are not just saying, 'Here's an outline of how to run a business.' They really step you through it and make you think in different ways that you wouldn't normally.\" \"They force you too plan, and the support is key.\"Carolyn Davis, community relations' associate director for Momentum, said that the courses are about saving money, building assets and having the knowledge to use them. \"If you know how to manage your money than you can really manage your life.\" Davis said that Momentum views social and physi- cal assets with a holistic approach. The program asks participants to consider whom they know that could help them, what transportation is available to them, and how their confidence and education level might influence their plans. \"We aren't selling anything. We are not the bank, and we don't have a product up our sleeve that we think would be a good idea,\" Davis said. \"We know that one size doesn't fit all. It's free, and we are independent of financial institu-tions or creditors.\" WHY MOMENTUM? Mike Hawkins graduated from Momentum, and then owned and operated Computer Tech for 10 years. He said that the networking, website and accounting proce-dures Momentum taught were important for those who did not have prior instructions. \"Unfortunately a lot of people just don't have that low-cost ac-cess,\" Hawkins said. \"Otherwise you're looking at going to univer-sity, and some people just don't have that option.\" Leah Layden said that after hit- ting financial walls for so long, Mo-mentum gave her the opportunity to create a sustainable business and the knowledge to operate it. \"I think eventually I would have gotten where I wanted to be, but it would have taken longer,\" Layden said. \"I certainly wouldn't have as much support or met the great people that I did. \"They are familiar with running businesses, they know what it takes, and they've experienced what I'm experiencing now,\" she added. Carolyn Davis said that going to a class also lets individuals meet other people who are at the same point in their lives, facing the same challenges or are asking the same questions. \"They are not alone, and they don't have to battle these challenges on their own,\" Davis said. WHAT DO YOU GET? Momentum's entrepreneurial courses can range be - tween a few hours to six months, depending on the intensity of the program, and focus on business de - velopment training. \"We don't offer business ideas,\" Davis said. \"Indi - viduals have an idea. They have something that they want to get off the ground and are ready and willing.\" Layden said that the most important thing is to be clear on what you want to do and be passionate about it; otherwise you are just chasing an idea. \"When I went into this I really wanted to open a bakery, and many people have good ideas, but you should really want it first,\" Layden said. \"You should have a good idea of what you're aiming for.\" Davis cautioned that success should not always be judged in the traditional sense. That means, she said, that sometimes having the ability to walk away early is the best move. \"Sometimes success might look like coming to the program, doing a feasibility study and determining that the idea is not feasible,\" Davis said. \"Then not sinking any more money into it.\" She added that anyone could benefit from the courses Momentum offers; it is simply how the indi-vidual uses the information. For Layden, she found her success in running her own bakery. \"I got tired of working for other people,\" Layden said. \"I just wanted to do something for me, and there are always lulls in business. There are some ups and downs, but I'm paying my bills and staying afloat.\" Non-profit group gives Momentum to small businesses Courses and coaches offered to those with low incomes CASEY MAGNUS | cmagnus@cjournal.ca Photo: Casey Magnus/Calgary Journal Leah Layden has followed her dream of starting a bakery, using old family recipes that were passed down through her family. \"We aren't selling anything. We are not the bank, and we don't have a product up out sleeve that we think would be a good idea.\" \u2014 Carolyn Davis, Community relations for Momentum January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 17 The words young and entrepreneur often seem to go hand-in-hand thanks to successful twenty- something businesspeople, such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg or Microsoft's Bill Gates. But older entrepreneurs can have just as much impact and an even greater chance of success when it comes to starting and keeping a company profitable. Elias Borges, a Canadian patent lawyer, says younger entrepreneurs tend to have less money; and as a result, they will usually just have the idea for an invention and back out of the patent process once they find out how much it costs. He calls these entrepreneurs \"basement adventur- ers.\" By comparison, according to Borges, mature entrepreneurs will often use the nest egg they have saved up to get their idea going, continuing to work a regular job while working on their own business. Mature entrepreneurs have more ideas, but they also have a lot more at risk, with family and a mort-gage to pay. Murray Crane, 55, is one of these entrepreneurs. He has worked in many fields, such as sales and software, and is currently the president of Rail Decks. Rail Decks is an innovative company that found a better way to transport industrial commodities. Crane says he loves being his own boss and doing some-thing he is passionate about. But he's careful about where he puts his money. Comparing older entrepreneurs and younger en- trepreneurs, Crane says, \"We're at a different stage in life, so were not going to throw money away. We're a lot more careful about what we do with our money. \"When your kids get older you all of a sudden have this time on your hands and have a desire to learn more, to start over again, that second chance in life,\" Crane added. Moreover, according to Crane, \"It does take a lot of experience to get into things,\" including coming up with great business ideas. That experience is some-thing older entrepreneurs can have in spades. Ray De Paul, the director of Institute for Innova- tion and Entrepreneurship, says older entrepreneurs usually create businesses that are beneficial to the in-dustry they have worked in and the connection they made in those industries can help them succeed. \"The days of working some place for thirty five, forty years and retiring are kind of gone\" says De Paul. \"People realize that they don't just want a good pay-check, they actually want to love what their doing.\" Crane says that having control over your hours and being able to do what you want is great and it can be a big draw for older, prospective entrepre-neurs. \"That's where you see a lot more older people get- ting into it, fifty plus entrepreneurs getting into things, because they have a lot of experience and credibility. \"They've got networks all over the place of people who trust them, and they have some money behind them,\" Crane says. A point that was also mentioned by De Paul is that it is the connections the entrepreneurs already have that help them succeed. Motherhood or a career? That's the question that many moms ask them- selves as soon as they see that blue line on a pregnancy test. The choice used to be black and white for some. Either you would stay at home changing diapers or go out to earn a paycheck. But there's a shift in post-baby life for women. Some women are no longer choosing between being a mom or a businesswoman. They are choosing to have both. And they aren't just going back to their pre-baby jobs. They're becoming their own bosses. That's what Karen Doucette did. Owner of Princess Please and a mother of two - and soon-to-be three - started her company over a year ago selling homemade headbands and little girl accessories online.She says the biggest benefit of running her own busi- ness is that she doesn't have to change her lifestyle. \"You get to still stay at home with your kids and raise them and be with them and be there for everything but you can still, throughout the day and at night-time when they go to bed, do your business and still have that income come in.\" Women like Doucette have been dubbed 'Mompre- neurs.' They set up and run their own businesses amidst making baby food and vacuuming up Cheerios. According to Statistics Canada, 910,000 women are self-employed. Statistics Canada also notes that 46 per cent of small to medium-size businesses are in part owned by women. And some of these women are 'Mompreneurs' like Doucette. Doucette says she thinks more moms are turning to business-ownership because it blends their desire to be at home with their kids and make an income. And it appears that other women see the value in both. A 2012 survey by BMO Bank of Montreal suggests that of the Canadian women surveyed, 71 per cent of them want to start their own businesses. Doucette also says as a 'Mompreneur,' you are sup- ported by other moms who are tackling raising kids and running a business simultaneously. \"I think stay-at-home moms are looking for ways to support other stay-at-home moms,\" says Doucette, and because of this built-in support system, more and more moms can start their own businesses and be successful.

TV, magazines, movies and billboards are all different means for these messages to reach you. Even the clothes we wear function as a sort of moving billboard. But do we always notice when we're being marketed to? Problems with Ads Bruce Chambers, CBC Radio's Ad Guy, believes that advertising is usually quite devious in general. People may not realize that mar- keting that is aimed at marginalized groups like women, people of colour, and the LGBT community is still a com-mon problem today. Chambers began his career as a copywriter at a radio station, but even-tually moved on to work for different advertising agencies. \"I have been writing advertising for a long time and enjoying it, but always feeling a little bit guilty about what advertising does to people,\" Chambers said. The desire to undo some of the harm he has done over his career is what lead him to become CBC Radio's Ad Guy.\" Over the past 10 years, Chambers has been using podcasts and radio to deconstruct ads and reveal their inner workings to the public. Chambers explained that companies \"market at the margins\" or try to target small groups of people in advertising. \"They basically help them feel less good about themselves and once they have them feeling inferior, they introduce a product that makes them feel good about themselves,\" Cham-bers said. They know people don't like being degraded, Chambers said. So they make it appear as though they are be-ing empowering to these marginalized groups. In actuality, it's the same old manipu- lation just being dressed up in \"sensi-tive new clothes,\" as Chambers puts it. He calls this \"enlightened sexism.\" Chambers said women are tradition- ally undervalued in advertising. They are dressed up in skimpy bathing suits and placed in front of products regard-less of whether they are relevant to the product or not. Women are often used as props and sex objects in order to sell a given product, said Chambers. Women are the biggest victims of marketing, but they are not the only ones. At a talk recently given at Mount Royal University, Chambers discussed the particular challenges the LGBT community has faced in terms of advertising. \"Traditionally, marketers either ignored gays and lesbians or portrayed them negatively or just made them the punch line of jokes,\" said Chambers. This began to change in 1981 when marketers started targeting ads spe - cifically at the LGBT com - munity, Chambers said. Ab - solut Vodka became the first major company to launch an ad campaign aimed towards the LGBT community. Stephen Wright, presi - dent of Pride Calgary, also se es marketing towards the gay community becoming more of a trend. \"Probably within the last year or so because of the push for gay marriage, you are seeing more advertising come in,\" says Wright. \"It's still not where I would like to see it but unfortunately I do not control the advertising industry.\" Companies are slowly starting to real - ize that there is a big market in the LGBT community, said Wright. This is why we are beginning to see more blatant adver - tising than in the past.Wright knows that the community is being targetted for advertising purposes, but he said that this is the point of ad - vertising. With almost every gender, race and sexual preference being targeted by advertising at one point or another, it's hard to say that any one group is being singled out. He believes that's just the nature of the beast. At Chambers' panel discussion at Mount Royal University, many audience members said that he did not give the consumer enough credit. One member of the audience challenged Chambers and said that individuals always have the ability are to say no. Another said that people do not buy things just because of advertising. Chambers had an answer for both questions. He said, the truth is, we do buy things because of commercials. After all, if advertising didn't work, it wouldn't exist. Chambers said that even if we are aware of the techniques, it can be tough to overcome every type of ma-nipulation that faces us. For Chambers, the important thing is that we are aware of the advertising going on around us. Oftentimes, advertising uses emotion to win individuals over. By being mindful of this, we can help prevent ourselves from being pulled in by marketers, he suggests. \"The last thing marketers want you to do is stop and think,\" he said. Markerters want you to make a quick decision with your emotions, an im-mediate gratification kind of thing, said Chambers. h ow to overcome A d s The best thing to do is stop and think and put some analysis in it, explains Chambers. You will find that the product isn't something you need . This is prob-ably the best tip for how to overcome this manipulation, said Chambers. People are often lost in the number of advertisements their subjected to on a daily basis.Photo Illustration: Derek Manage/Calgary JournalNew heights in niche markets cUrtis dowh ANiUK | cdowhaniuk@cjournal.caAdvertisments create problems for certain demographics \"The last thing marketers want you to do is stop and think\" \u2014 bruce chambers, cbc r adio's Ad Guy January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 19Thomas King and 'The Inconvenient Indian' Thomas King says he has spent a lifetime thinking about what it means to be an aboriginal in North America. Born in California in 1943 to a Greek mother and a Cherokee father, King immigrated to Canada in 1980 to teach native studies at the University of Lethbridge before moving on to teach English and drama at the University of Guelph. The author of a number of acclaimed novels, includ- ing \"Green Grass, Running Water\" which was nomi-nated for a Governor General's Literary Award in 1993, King also created and starred in the CBC Radio One show Dead Dog Caf\u00e9. In 2003 he became the first ab- original person selected to deliver the Massey Lectures and in 2004 was named to the Order of Canada. KIng recently published his 13th book \u2014 \"The Incon-venient Indian: A Curious Account of Native People in North America.\" The book, which King refers to as \"part history and part memoir,\" looks at the long history of aboriginal and non-aboriginal relationships in North America. King recently discussed his new book with Calgary Journal reporter Karry Taylor. Editor's note: Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity. WHAT LED YOU TO WRITE THIS BOOK? I say in the introduction that it's a conversation that I have been having with myself for the past 50 years, at least. One problem I see in native and non-native relation - ships in North America is that non-natives know very little about native history. What they see as anoma-lies \u2014 protests that have happened at Caledonia or Oka \u2014 they believe that these things just come out of nowhere and have no history behind them. Or if you take the road that is trying to be punched through a native reserve here so that Calgary gets a ring road around it \u2014 that has a very long and inter-esting history. I find that most people don't know that history. They think that these things are 20th or 21st century anomalies. They aren't. So I thought that one of the things that I could do with a history book is to try to explain not the history itself, but the arcs of the history \u2014 the kinds of policy decisions and events that have led to all this. I wanted to show the reoccurring patterns. Native history is really just a series of reoccurring patterns. We don't move forward so much as we literally just repeat the same things over and over. The terms of reference may change, but the ideas behind those policy decisions really don't. I also wrote it for native people because sometimes we don't understand our own overall history. We understand tribal histories and band histories. But we often don't understand the overall history of Indians in North America any better than anybody else. THIS BOOK HAS A VERY PARTICULAR VOICE \u2014 YOU USE HUMOUR, SATIRE AND SARCASM. WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO WRITE THE BOOK THIS WAY?I could have written a straight history book \u2014 the kind where you keep your biases hidden and you make it seem like you are a neutral and unbiased observer. That is a perfectly good way of writing a book. But it's not my way. I decided to make it a personal book and to make it part history and part memoir. It was easy for me to write it that way. I wanted it as a conversational piece as if I am sitting down and having a cup of coffee with you and we are yapping about native history. YOU USED THE TERM INDIAN IN THE BOOK'S TITLE. IN YOUR OPINION, IS THAT A PROBLEMATIC TERM?It is a problematic term. I think now, in Canada espe-cially, people would prefer the term First Nations. That is fine with me. But I would prefer to use just band designation like Blackfoot, Cree and Coast Salish.In the book I talk about native peoples as a whole entity. They don't exist as a whole \u2014 but I do talk about them that way. So I needed some sort of collective term. I had some choices. There is Amerindian, which I hate because it's an anthropological term. There is First Na-tions, First Peoples, Native Peoples, Indians \u2014 all those were available to me. I had to decide on what my main term was going to be, so I decided on Indian. Not that the other terms are not as good. Some of them are even better. It's just that in the North American imagination, which is outside of native peoples, Indian is a term that still has purchase. YOU DISCUSS A LONG NORTH AMERICAN TRADI- TION OF NATIVE CULTURES BEING CO-OPTED AND COMMERCIALIZED IN THINGS LIKE MOVIES AND ADVERTISING. WHERE DOES THIS FASCINATION COME FROM?It's a European fascination with native people too. But in terms of commercial renderings of native people, because we are associated with land husbandry we are then are also associated with spirituality and purity. Everybody from environment companies to Victoria Secret likes to use Indian iconography. Victoria Secret just had a show where they had one of their models come down the runway in a full, feathered headdress that reached the floor. People say to me, 'Well those things have changed.' But then I see the Victoria Secret thing and I say, 'No, they hav - en't changed that much.' From an advertising standpoint, Indian iconography is still a powerful thing. Westerns are still being made, and when you make a western, you need to have Indians in feathers and leather. If you look at all the advertisers who use Indian iconog - raphy, it's a fairly large lineup \u2014 everything from Indian Motorcycles to Land O' Lakes butter. This list just goes on and on; but all that is not about native people. It's about a particular image that exists in the North American imagination that really has very little to do with native people \u2014 especially with contemporary native people. But it's still a powerful symbol. YOU WRITE IN THIS BOOK THAT NATIVE CULTURES ARE \"REMARKABLY TENACIOUS AND RESILIENT.\" ARE YOU HOPEFUL FOR THE FUTURE? I am a pessimist. I don't think things are going to get better. But I wake up every morning and I am hopeful that they will. I think that as long as North America goes after na - tive land the way that they have in the past, and the way that they do right now, it is simply going to cause more confrontations. There's always an oil company that is looking for land to drill on or for land to build a pipeline through. There's always a corpo - ration wanting to take over part of native land for some type a project. I suspect that none of this is going to stop until there is not one square foot of native land left in native hands. That is depressing for me be - cause if we lose our land base, we lose everything. I hope I am wrong about that. Am I hopeful? I would be more hopeful if native people were better orga - nized to fight it. We need to be a heck of a lot more proactive as a group. The hard thing is that the tribes and the bands are so different, with dif-ferent languages, mean- ing there has never been a fully functional nation-al native organization. Certainly the Assem - bly of First Nations is doing some of this. They represent many of the tribes and bands \u2014 but not all. So I don't know. THIS HAS BEEN A DEPARTURE FROM WHAT YOU NORMALLY WRITE. WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING? Fiction. This book was, in many ways, my first work of non-fiction. But now I am going back to fiction. I like to create the world myself. I don't like facts getting in my way. I like to control any word that comes out of everybody's mouth. It makes things much easier. And I like fiction. It pleases me to write it. I don't dislike nonfiction, but I have to struggle more at it. Although with this book \u2014 it took me six years to write the silly thing\u2014 once I got into it, I did enjoy it.

She added that women are often attacked on online games just because they are women and said that a stereotype has been placed on every female who plays a game online. The group was created so women can avoid this. Lo noticed that in comparison to men, women are more frequently targeted for harassment. So Lo set out to create a harassment free forum. Today the site has more than 8,000 members. \"I originally created /r/girlgamers to provide a forum for discussing women in gaming, as well as for women in gaming to find each other,\" said Lo. \"These stereotypical female beings are generally perceived to lack gaming skill and can only succeed because of the help they are given by their male coun-terparts. In short, it is called 'attention whoring' and is a label frequently given to women in gaming, regardless of their behavior,\" Lo added. WHAT IS REDDIT? Reddit is a social media website with forums known as \"subreddits\" that include topics such as video games, politics, news, music and science, as well as bizarre top-ics, such as a university student posting daily pictures of his roommate sleeping. As of November, there are 187,384 subreddits. Lo felt that many of the forums are centered around topics that can make women feel uncomfortable, so Redditor Lady Gamespace was created, followed by its sister group on Facebook, to give women an exclusive forum. The Redditor Lady Gamespace forum was created for women who want to discuss the experiences they have had as a result of their gender. It's a place where girls can be girls without the fear of social judgment. A DIFFERENT VIEW Shawn Savard is a moderator on Reddit - someone who approves posts on forums and creates rules. \"I think the Internet should just be for everyone,\" Savard said. \"There doesn't need to be segregation or any -isms based on people's beliefs or traits. That being said, I am completely open to people forming groups based on their interests or in this case, gender.\" \"Reddit has communities for everyone and as such, there are subreddits designed with women as the main demographic,\" Savard added. \"Everyone is allowed the chance to be outspoken or quiet. I have no qualms with this system and think it's better for the commu-nity.\" WORDS FROM THE MEMBERS Dee Ribeiro, a member of Redditor Lady Gamespace, said that there is a stereotype that there are no female gamers online. \"I know that for me, I got kicked out of a raid in 'World of Warcraft' for being a girl,\" Ribeiro said. \"I don't agree with it, but I have met more than a handful of people who follow this rule to the core. They are vicious and ruthless, whether it is comments or the way they communicate to you. Not all people are this way online, but more often than not I have to deal with people who behave this way.\" Charlotte Rouget-Murphy, said she joined the group to see if her experience in gaming was any different and to meet like-minded females. \"I feel that it is good for women who feel threatened or mistreated by the gaming community, and to also find a place where you can find more people like your-self where you can talk about girly things,\" Rouget-Murphy said via email. \"I have met a few good friends in the group,\" she added. \"We speak daily.\" Sierra Arena, said she has previously fallen victim under gaming sexism as well and said that \"Women seem to provoke it more.\" Redditor Lady Gamespace members' discuss every- thing from the latest games to which stores have sales going on. \"It's nice to have others to talk to about these things aside from other people in everyday life. It can't always be candy and sunshine, there has to be some mud in it too,\" Ribeiro said. \"I have made a lot of friends on there, three of which I talk to every single day on Facebook,\" Arena added. Arena is planning on flying to Canada to meet with Ribeiro, and the two girls are planning on sending each other Christmas presents.

Exploring the possible lunar connection to luscious locks VERONICA POCZA | vpocza@cjournal.ca Is there a natural and affordable way to ensure strong hair and growth? Sarah Lane, mother of two, says she grew her hair out for her wedding by \"basing haircuts around the moon's phases.\" \"I started doing it as soon as we got engaged,\" Lane says. Although her wedding was close to 10 years ago, Lane can still recollect the noticeable speed her hair was growing. \"I used this technique for about eight months up to my wedding,\" she says. \"My hair grew from above my shoulders to my collarbone, which is quite a bit.\" How does hair grow? What encourages growth and healthy hair? As the generation notorious for wearing extensions, coloring hair and using damaging heat tools \u2014 it is likely that we all want to know. Lane, who is part of a family of hairstylists, mentions that timing haircuts with moon phases is known in the hair and astrology worlds \u2014 but reaching out to those who aren't involved in either can be difficult. \"I even thought it was ridiculous at first. I was like 'Yeah, I'm sure,' \" laughs Lane. Lane still doesn't know much behind the science of it, but she knows she saw the results. \"I still don't really understand how it works,\" she says. \"I was told to try it, it was free, it doesn't hurt to try, so why not?\" CONNECTION BETWEEN MAN AND MOON? The idea of associating our hair growth with something as distant as the moon seems like an odd idea. We need somebody who has knowledge of hair and beyond. Edina Jarjoura, a hair stylist at Karma Salon and Spa, who also has clients for reiki and energy healing, would seem a perfect representation of the relationship between hair and the moon's influence. \"The idea that the moon can influence your hair is far fetched for most people,\" she says. \"You can't just jump in and say the moon will make your hair grow.\" Jarjoura emphasizes the importance of taking steps toward understanding this connection. \"The moon's energy, and understanding it along with your energy, can have an influence on your body,\" she says. Like other hairstylists interviewed by the Calgary Journal, Jarjoura says that stress is one of the main things that can determine hair health. She also says hormones play a large role in hair health. \"Moods have an effect on the health of your body. If you can become aware of these moods, the hormones that accompany them and control them \u2014 then you can reduce stress,\" she says. \"Reducing stress will help you exude that positive energy that you need in order for your body to reach it's full, nurturing potential \u2014 this results in healthy hair.\" This is where the moon comes in. Jarjoura says it can strongly influence our moods. UNDERSTANDING THE MOON Jarjoura explains that connecting ourselves with the moon can be an in-depth, exact and technical process. She describes how to relate the moon to your hair growth: \"As a general rule, I tell most people to start tracking. Record when you are most positive, when you are feeling most negative, and what the moon is doing during those specific times.\" Jarjoura says that to grow your hair out, you must trim only the ends, and should do so during the times when your body is in a nourished and positive state. When would this be? She explains that the time cannot be generalized, that it will have to take research to find each individual's optimum timing. Jarjoura says knowing each moon phase's qualities will help with tracking responses and timing growth. \"This doesn't mean hair will grow \u2014 this means hair will not continue to split and break,\" she says. \"Usually during the new moon, hair will be stronger and more nourished. It is the time of nourishment and regeneration.\" Anyone feeling behind, wondering what the new moon is? THE MOON PHASES Karen Shelton, the Texas-based founder of HairBoutique.com and who has written many (and some of the first) articles on the relationship between hair and the moon, says it is vital to know the moon phases. The new moon is the first phase of the month. It \"symbolizes brand new beginnings, rejuvenation, sprouting, and outwardly directed energy,\" she says. The first quarter, or second phase \"should promote growth, development, [and] shaping things that have already begun,\" she says. The third, or full moon phase, brings \"maturing, bearing fruit and abundance. Everything finds its final form,\" she says. She adds that the third quarter, or the fourth phase, then \"promotes endings, dissolving, retiring, peace, reflection and closing chapters.\" \"Hairstrology,\" the relationship between hair and astrology (including the moon, stars, energy, etc.), has been a key topic on Shelton's website, which she says helps women \"understand the condition of and influences on their hair.\" Shelton has clarified the importance of knowing the moon phases in order to properly track your body (and hair's) response to the moon. \"This is how one will be able to notice patterns,\" she says. Shelton has been studying astrology and the moon for 15 years and also has a background in hair styling. She says that she has learned enough to know that \"they are definitely connected.\" IT'S UP TO YOU Shelton says that the results turn out best when the tracking of the moon is tied to an individual's own personal natal chart. Judith de Haan is a Calgary-based astrologer and practitioner of Gestalt, which applies astrology to daily life and decisions. De Haan is able to provide natal charts with the nitty-gritty information. Astrologers like de Haan are one of the sources we can use to get to know the moon phases and become familiar with our own energy. \"You can become more self aware and self controlling as a result of these sessions,\" says de Haan, describing the benefits of learning astrology. De Haan says that you can learn to encourage, limit or control almost anything to do with your physical and mental health through astrology and self-awareness. \"It starts and ends with observation and correlation,\" says de Haan. Meanwhile, Lane hasn't continued with timing her hair cuts with the moon phases, as she has cut her hair into a short bob since the wedding. However, she says if she were trying to grow out her hair long, she would try it again. \"You are going to get your hair cut anyways. It can't hurt to just try and book it around the moon phases and see if anything happens. It worked for me. My hair grew a lot.\" Hairstylist Edina Jarjoura believes in cutting hair based on moon cycles.

Lauren Lane Decor, originally started by Tara Jamieson in 2011, sells refurbished furniture and offers hands-on classes. On July 7, Jamieson passed away after she was in an ATV accident and was hit by a drunk driver, leaving Lauren Lane Decor to her sister. Jamieson's sister, Avery Lane, has dropped her construction job to take over Lauren Lane Decor. \"This was our place; I couldn't imagine anyone else taking it over,\" said Lane in regards to taking over Lauren Lane Decor. Lane has changed her life to take over her sister's shop, going from working as a roofer and sider full-time to running the shop. Lane said she acted as a part time \"slave laborer\" to her sister during her spare time on nights and weekends, going along to do most of the heavy lifting. But now that she's changed from casually helping out to being the owner she says she has found something she loves to do and wouldn't give up. Lane started out as a social worker before moving on to roofing, and Jamieson began as an accountant in the oil and gas industry of Calgary. Both sisters later moved on to refurbishing furniture and Lauren Lane Decor \u2014 with the moniker combining Jamie-son's middle name with Lane's surname \u2014 was born. Lane said it turned out to be something that they both ended up loving. HANDS-ON CLASSES Jamieson claims she isn't a businesswoman, she is all about the hands-on, but she must be doing some-thing right with the do-it-yourself classes offered at the studio because they are just as full as ever. Classes are usually limited to around eight to enable Lane to offer each individual the help they need. The business offers a variety of different sessions \u2014 anything from beginner chalk painting classes, to advanced embellishing classes, and everything in-between. Lane is now teaching these classes, some-thing she is able to do in part from her sister's teach-ings, as well from her own experience and learning techniques by trial and error. Classes resumed earlier this month for the first time since Jamieson passed. Lane looks forward to adding a new class to the schedule as well: a session where people can come in, pick a chair she already has and refurbish the chair, with wine and hors d'oeuvres offered. Lauren Lane Decor also does furniture refurbishin- for customers. Lane says she's done everything from refurbishing a single piece, to doing multiple pieces for some businesses. As well, Lane goes out \"trea-sure hunting\" to find pieces to refurbish herself and sell in the showroom. \"Refurbishing furniture will never go out,\" she said. \"The styles may change, but we just need to adapt to that.\"Arlette Kent of Edmonton was a first-time user of the Annie Sloan chalk paint and took the begin-ner class from Jamieson a few months before she passed. She said she enjoyed the class so much she has already signed up for one of the advanced classes to improve her skills and to work on a particular piece. Kent says the class was perfect, not just because of the products, but also because of Jamieson's helpful tips and her disposition. \"She was kind, helpful and even packed up a tool box for me with all the stuff I needed and sent me on my way,\" Kent said via email. ADDING ONTO LAUREN LANE DECOR Lane has now added an online site called \"Found\" to sell some of the furniture she refurbishes. Found was started by Lane's friend and photographer, Kristen Shima. It offers Lauren Lane Decor the opportunity to have a wider variety of customers, since it allows customers from places other than Calgary to see the furniture and purchase it. Shima said her favourite thing about refurbishing furniture is watching people create, because every-one creates differently. Lane added, \"I think I am just taking the business down these different paths that Tara would've done if she had had the chance.\" Lane has found peace of mind simply by some- thing she found on her sister's old Lauren Lane Decor blog. \"I read on her blog the other day something that makes this all a lot easier: 'If something happened to me tomorrow \u2014 I would be okay because I'm the girl that went for it!'\" Lauren Lane Decor reopens DIY classes full as ever Laren Pritchard | lpritchard@cjournal.ca Lane says pieces such as this one will change colors up to four times before she finishes them.Avery Lane loves to work with her hands and bring new life to furniture.

The usual resolutions pop up each January: getting in shape or losing weight, travelling more, spending less, making more money and maybe quit smoking. With that in mind, it leaves to question the absence of resolutions surrounding mental health. The Cana-dian Mental Health Association states that one in five Canadians experience a mental health issue each year. This begs the question, why mental health doesn't crack the list of common resolutions. Corey Mackenzie, an associate professor for the department of psychology at Mount Royal University, feels that changes in mental health are challenging. \"We tend to get into patterns of interacting and patterns of behaviour that are challenging to break out of and to make positive changes in terms of either re-ducing negative symptoms or else improving general well-being,\" he said. \"It's not easy.\" When asked what resolutions people should be making on this front, he suggested: \"It should be about coping better with moods and anxiety, and that's not what people are doing.\" NOT ON THE LIST Taking care of mental health issues as a New Year's resolution has a lot to compete with. According to the University of Scranton's Journal of Clinical Psychology, losing weight as well as staying fit and healthy appeared in the top five of the jour-nal's March 2012 poll on the New Year's resolutions. Anything related to mental health failed to appear on the list. T HE b ENE f ITS O f d OIN g SO Umair Sajid, a University of Calgary student, is making 2013 his year to have a better sense of his mental health, vowing to have a more positive outlook on life. \"So, no matter what's happening or how stressed you are, you're able to internalize it better \u2014 it's all about internalizing and perception.\" Sajid recognized the benefits of taking a mental health resolution, knowing that having a place to turn to for support in times of need is helpful. \"Once you're stuck in a rut and you get down, you usually don't have anything to turn to,\" he said. P OTENTI a L r O adb LO ck S Every resolution comes with its fair share of problems. With staying fit, eating that box of donuts might feel easier than doing 100 sit-ups at the gym, which often does happen. With mental health, Mackenzie emphasized that it's the \"how-to,\" that can halt the path to achieving mental health goals. Mackenzie said that the major focus in mental health is often placed in treatment, and not in the terms of \"what you need to do,\" in order to have a better sense of mental health.\"The fact that we need to reduce stress is pretty clear for all of us. The how you do that, is much less clear,\" he said. In an Oct. 2007 publication, the American Psycho- logical Association offers tips for managing personal stress. \"Consider healthy, stress-reducing activities such as meditation, exercising or talking things out with friends or family,\" the publication suggested. \"Keep in mind that unhealthy behaviours develop over time and can be difficult to change. Don't take on too much at once, focus on changing only one behaviour at a time.\" The association also highlighted that seeking out professional help is the most important factor in deal-ing with stress and other mental health issues. dOESN 'T ST a N d ON ITS O w N Taking a mental health resolution can reap multiple benefits, but having that resolution in conjunction with another resolution, such as staying fit, can rack in twice the perks. \"Mental health is just as important, if not more important than physical health,\" Mackenzie said. \"The important message is that these two aren't separate and independent, they're closely related in ways that most people don't appreciate.\" Sajid agreed, \"When you look at health, it is com- posed of physiological and psychological. \"You really have to look at those two things together to have a fighting chance about any other resolution.\"A New Year for mental health Keeping your stress in check caMErON PE rrIEr | cperrier@cjournal.ca \"I'm going to do some painting and printmaking hopefully.

More importantly, it serves as proof of someone's wishes to be an organ and tissue donor. It's common to miss the checkboxes and signa- ture line that identify one's wishes on the back of the card. Jessica Royan, co-founder of non-profit Because I Can Project, created for organ donation awareness said, \"most people are never even told it's there. I didn't know until I was 30 and saw it one day.\" \"I thought, 'What? I've been carrying this around in my wallet and had no idea? I can't be the only one,'\" said Royan. The lack of knowledge among her family, friends and everyone else she talked to in Calgary, called for a solution. The result of this discovery is the creation of her project, which aims to improve awareness within Canada. \"There isn't nearly enough awareness,\" explained Royan, who, to many people's surprise, has no per-sonal reason for wanting to spread the message. \"I have never had a family member or someone close to me be in need of an organ, but it's crazy that becoming a donor is so easy. So many people don't do it. It bothers me because I don't think people don't care about organ or tissue donation, they just don't know enough about it,\" she continued. WHY DON'T PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT?Royan said the current system for organ donation registration across Canada is very scattered. The registration process is different within each prov-ince, with only three \u2014 Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba \u2014 adopting an official registration system. In Alberta, people's wishes are not recorded anywhere for documentation. Royan also noted that having no official paperwork or system could be why organ donation isn't talked about in families or schools. \"I think it's a little taboo for people to talk about organ donation because the topic does revolve around death,\" she said. THE DIFFERENCES WITHIN CANADA The other half of the project is co-founder, Shelley Hunt. Being from British Columbia, Hunt has experi-enced the relatively new registration process active in her province. \"This system definitely works better than what's currently implemented in Alberta and other prov-inces,\" she said. Having an actual registration system, whether online or at an office, provides a means of tracking organ donor rates and accessing people's wishes upon the time of death. \"It just helps avoid the awkwardness of having a family decide for you on an already upsetting day,\" said Hunt. \"This way, you are guaranteed to have your wishes met and they don't have to step in and make an uninformed decision.\" She explained that a transplant team deals with the patient's records, eliminating the \"most common myth among organ donating, which is doctors are not working hard to save patients who are willing to donate their organs,\" \"Not only is this entirely untrue, but the doctors wouldn't even have access to that information,\" she said. \"It is information for the transplant team and the doctor will just focus on the task at hand.\" In Alberta, there is no way of knowing a patient's wishes. \"Making your family aware of your choice is so important, and given the current system, they are the ones who will make the decision upon that day, so it's best they know exactly what you want,\" said Hunt. Hunt noted that as the donor, you need to make your preference known to your family, but even that doesn't serve as a guarantee. It seems easier and more official to have a registration process. WHAT'S GOING ON A push for national consistency is underway, as a petition is circling from the Because I Can Project for Canada to adopt an \"opt-out program.\" Royan said this is a program currently active in Spain and she suggested it is the reason why Spain's organ donor count is among the highest in the world. The opt-out program would work in reverse, as everyone is born an organ donor and only signs the paperwork to unregister from donation. Alison Dudus, a Calgarian who waited over four years for a kidney transplant, believes this system would eliminate wait times and increase awareness. She emphasized the importance of making your choice known. \"It'd be easy because if you don't want to do it, you just sign the paper work and that's that,\" Dudus said, insisting that it's more likely for people to do the paperwork for something they want to make sure doesn't happen. \"It's not like anyone would be begging you at the last minute to change your mind. We just need a way of tracking those who do want to be organ donors, so that nobody can override their wishes in the end,\" she said. \"I thought, 'What? I've been carrying this around in my wallet and had no idea? I can't be the only one.'\" \u2014 Jessica Royan, co-founder of Because I Can ProjectMany Albertans are unaware of their rights when it comes to organ donation.

It's a raw pasta sauce for the zuchinni pasta Jenice Schneider is making. Spaghetti-like strips of crisp zucchini stand in place of the traditional flour and egg pasta. This plate of masquerading as spa- ghetti - though delicious - may have a few Italian nonnas rolling over in their graves, but it's more important that no animals were harmed in its making. Schneider, 35, is a vegan. And she has been for seven years. \"I don't have any right to derive pleasure from the pain and suffering of others, so that's how I guide myself,\" said Schneider, an Okotoks mom. Schneider is known as an ethical vegan and doesn't use any product that is from an animal - like silk or leather - or that has been tested on an animal. She said she won't go to zoos or aquariums, either. Schneider said she's always had a deep sense of empathy for all creatures on earth, human and animal alike. Despite being surrounded by ani- mals her entire life, Schneider said she was never taught about animal suffer-ing by her parents. Her mom served meat for dinner, though Schneider wouldn't touch a rare steak, Selena Bird said, Schneider's younger sister. Schneider added that she was never comfortable eating meat, but the reason for that didn't click until many years later. The media coverage of a seal hunt was what opened her eyes to animal rights, Schneider said. \"I went, 'Wait a minute, why are these poor animals being bludgeoned to death?' Then I made the connection to the food I ate, specifically meat,\" Schneider said. \"I wouldn't eat my dog, why would I eat a cow?\" Schneider said it impacts most of her decisions, large and small. From buying shoes, to ordering her wedding cake, to posting on Facebook about dairy farms and rescued puppies. Being vegan is part of Schneider's identity, said husband Tom Schneider. Tom said he had never met a vegan before Jenice, and at first thought the lifestyle was silly. \"You become more informed and learn more about the environment and the things that are occurring so you change your tune,\" Tom said. While Tom is not vegan, he respects Schneider's lifestyle. The couple recently had their first child, Nellie. She will be raised as a vegan. \"It really wasn't a decision because it's like, how could I be vegan and not feed my daughter the same way? I think it would be very hypocritical if I fed my daughter meat and I proclaim to be vegan,\" Schneider said. Schneider hopes that by raising her daughter to be kind to all creatures, that the vegan lifestyle will be Nellie's first nature. She recognized that Nellie will grow up in a non-vegan world: friends who eat meat, clothes made from leather and field-trips to the zoo. \"I hope that she gets it and that she embraces it.\" Jenice Schneider said she hopes that her daughter Nellie embraces her vegan lifestyle and is kind to all creatures on earth.Photo by : Devon Jolie/Calgary JournalSon's health scare drives new lifestyle Mom becomes holistic nutritionist to share awareness SHANNON GALLEY | sgalley@cjournal.ca Enza Ward is a mother, a wife, and now a busy holistic nutritionist at the Holistic Institute of Health and Fertility in Calgary. Eight years ago, Ward and her husband David's world turned upside-down when their two-year-old son Brandon started crying after a routine nap. \"He just started doubling over in pain, he was holding his stomach, then he started throwing up.\" They took Brandon to the hospital. \"They said, 'we just need to open him up and see what is going on,'\" she recalled. Brandon had his appendix removed and doctors found he had Acute Recur-rent Pancreatitis. A week later, Brandon was re-admit- ted to the hospital because his lipase levels were through the roof. Since doctors couldn't figure out what caused Brandon's pancreatitis, the Wards took matters into their own hands. Not finding any answers from conventional medicine, Enza Ward looked through the yellow pages in search of a naturopath that could pos-sibly help her son. They found Dr. Anton Kodet, an inte- grative medical care doctor in Calgary who takes on cases that haven't been solved by conventional medicine. In following Kodet's instructions by avoiding dairy and most wheat products and using a combination of treatments, Brandon hasn't had any more bouts of pancreatitis since he's first visit. Ward said, \"After about a year he started to build up his immunity and started to thrive more over time. It was a slow progression.\" \" [In Brandon's case] My goal was to reduce the levels of inflammation and irritation; I was reducing the levels of inflammation by reducing the irrita-tion,\" said Kodet. \"The digestive system is irritated by cold, hard foods, mainly cooling and dampening foods.\" \"Patients who follow my directions under normal circumstances dramati-cally improve the conventional progno-sis,\" he added, \"It is laborious, but the Wards have done it.\" Ward, a former computer program- mer turned stay-at-home mom saw the benefits of the holistic approach and was inspired. In 2011, she enrolled in the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition and is now a registered holistic nutritionist. She now works at The Holistic Institute of Health and Fertility in Calgary. \"I wanted to know more, I wanted to meet other like-minded people,\" Ward said. She has put together a four-week program to teach people about her experiences and the basics of nutri-tion about food that might be hard to understand, such as super foods and probiotics. \"We absolutely are what we eat, and food does make a difference,\" she said.

With each beat, they become more excited. The girls slowly sashay from one corner of the room to the other, gliding across the floor as if the movement was effortless. However, this is not the case.All seven little girls suffer from different levels of cerebral palsy. Although the movement is difficult, the four to seven year olds do their best to mirror the actions of their dance mentors and teachers. The class for these little dancers is organized by the Cerebral Palsy Association in Alberta and takes place weekly at Counterpoint Dance Academy in southwest Calgary. Mezaun Lakha-Evin, associate executive directive at the association, describes the class as being an outlet for the children to express themselves while having social interaction. The class allows the girls to make friends and build self-esteem because they are doing something that other children are doing she said. \"Our kids go in there not knowing what is go - ing to happen, but they leave with big smiles,\" she said. She added that the weekly dance class is beneficial to the children because it is giving them \"the opportunity to do the best they can with what they've got.\" With cerebral palsy, it is about being able to use the muscles as much as you can, for as long as you can.\"Dance gives the opportunity for using muscles that are probably not generally used,\" Lakha-Evin said. Although the seven little girls suffer from different levels of mobility, visual or other disabilities, Lakha-Evin said that for the duration of each class \"in their minds, they are dancing.\" \"There is nothing stopping them from being balleri- nas. There is no 'can''t' in what they can do.\" Along with improving motor skills, the long-term benefits of this class are larger than just the dance movements, it's the confidence that is built within each dancer. \"It is really about the idea of kids feeling that they are a part of a larger community,\" Lakha-Evin added. The assocation's Dance Without Limits program began two and a half years ago when the demand for the class became evident here in Calgary. A similar program has been around for five years in Edmonton. Another company in Calgary that focuses on using a similar therapy form is Dubasov Dance and Wellness Inc. The studio offers pro-grams to people of all ages with different disabilities. Founder and owner of the studio, Telisa Dubasov said her goal was to get students with cerebral palsy, autism or Down syndrome \"moving and to find a differ-ent means of expression for themselves. Of these children with special needs, she said \"a lot of them are non-verbal, a lot of them have behavioral issues and a lot of them don't often get the opportunity to participate in mainstream activities.\" The current dance class is a \"therapeutic program in disguise,\" Dubasov said. \"There are physical benefits from the class.\" \"Most little girls in terms of ballet just want to dance, and this gives them the opportunity to do that while gaining gross motor skills, fine motor skills, while get-ting social interaction,\" she said. Even though it may not look like a typical dance class, Dubasov said that all of the dancers are engaged in their own way. Courtney Heppner, a mother of a student in the class agrees with the benefits explained by Lakha-Evin and Dubasov. \"I love that she can do a dance class where most typical ones she wouldn't be able to fit in. And she can be like all the little girls,\" she said of her daughter Keziah Heppner, who has been in the dance program for two years now. Although at times there are challenges, she always finds the class enjoyable. The smile on Keziah's face widens as her mother said she likes \"to be able to dance and have fun and be a princess.\" The long-term social and confidence skills are what draw students and parents to these types of classes, Lakha-Evin said. The overall goal of these programs, she added, is to \"give them the confidence to try something as they get older - to continue dancing, to want to go to rock climbing or horseback riding because someone said they could be in a dance program when they were four years old.\" \"There is nothing stopping them from being ballerinas. There is no 'can't' in what they do.\" \u2014 Lakha- evin, Cerebral Palsy Association Carley Roberts sings along with the music.Photo: Bre Brezinski/Calgary Journal Dancers in the Dance Without Limits program meet weekly at Counterpoint Dance.

Photo: Bre Brezinski/Calgary Journal January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 28 Camping in the winter months offers a unique set of challenges, but enthusiasts say the rewards can be well worth the trouble. Glenn Lilly, has done a lot of winter camping and says that the solitude found in the wilderness dur- ing the wintertime is a rare occurrence many people don't get to experience. \"It is extremely quiet out there, so wherever you go, you have it to yourself,\" Lilly says.\" It's absolute dead silence, which is kind of a unique experience if you're used to going to some of the big parks in the summer and there are just throngs of people. Go winter camping and you'll have the place to yourself.\" Not only is there a sort of isolation to be found when camping in the winter, Lilly says that the snow acts as a blanket that muffles everything. Camping in the winter can prove to be a very peaceful experi- ence, he says. A big part of camping is being able to enjoy na- ture. In the winter, the scenery is especially beauti- ful. Lilly says that if the moon is out on a clear night, the reflection off the snow can make it look almost like daylight. \"I've been out there when the northern lights have been directly overhead. There are pinks and reds and greens and they're just sort of floating across the sky and you just basically flop down in the snow, make yourself a comfortable couch in the snow, and you look up and it's just amazing,\" Lilly says. Of course the number one challenge when camping in the winter is staying warm. Justin Howse, a sales representative at Campers Village, says that all gear being used during the winter should be insulated. \"Whether it's your boots or whether it's your jacket, you'll need a thicker one. Wearing layers, that sort of thing, you have to be very warm and very comfortable at all times,\" Howse says. Especially when it comes to the sleeping bag, it is important to prepare for sub-zero temperatures. A regular sleeping bag that works well in the summer months won't necessarily cut it in the winter. Extra consideration should be taken to get a warmer sleeping bag, although these can be costly, ranging from $150 to as much as $500. For someone who doesn't want to spend the money, Howse sug- gests that they purchase a liner, which cost about $60. Liners can be used in an existing sleeping bag in order to boost the thermal rating. When considering shelter, there are two ap- proaches. A camper can use a tent, and Howse recommends a four-season tent because they are designed differently to have more insulation, or there is the more labour-intensive method of build-ing a snow shelter. Lilly says that he has always preferred the snow shelter because he finds they are actually warmer than tents because of the insulating properties of the snow. He says that the challenge of making a snow shel - ter is part of the appeal to camping in the winter. It becomes a complete experience. He says that he likes to make a type of snow shel- ter called a \"quinzee.\" A quinzee is a hollowed out pile of snow that can be fairly labour-intensive to make. \"We had a great time when we'd do it,\" Lilly says. \"It was a kind of ritual every year when we'd go out, a few buddies and I. I think a big part of it was to just enjoy nature, the challenge of building the quinzee, and really what we did out there was mostly the journey in and the journey out,\" Lilly says. How to Build a Quinzee 1. Make a pile of snow about seven to eight feet high and wide enough across to fit two people. Mix the snow so that it hardens better. 2. Shape the mound into a dome and let it harden for about 90 minutes. Hollow out the mound allowing for walls to be about one to two feet thick. 3. Make elevated sleeping platforms to allow cool air to flow down and out of the quinzee. Poke a ventilation hole near the top. 4. Building a quinzee is tiring work. Change into warm dry clothes after construction. Lastly, mark the entrance and keep a small shovel inside in case you need to dig your way out.

Step. Step. Crunch. It's a daily occurrence for Dave Ware. He looks down, stretches out his foot and begins to sweep it across the beige carpet of his basement floor in northwest Calgary. Lego bricks go flying off to the side only to join thousands more that have taken over the room. Some may call it a children's toy, others a hobby. For 41-year-old Ware, Lego is a life-long passion that turned into a busi-ness venture. \"It can become whatever you want it to be,\" he said. Ware, the face of Brickwares, has made a name for himself in recent years by creating custom Lego mosaics; a craft shared by only a handful of people in Canada and the United States. From maps to mosaics Ware said he was inspired to try his own hand at Lego mosaics during a trip with his oldest son to the Calgary Science Centre, where he saw a map of the Egyptian Nile made entirely out of Lego. \"I really liked that idea of a poster or a painting done with the bricks,\" he recalled. \"I thought, 'Oh, I wonder if I could do that?' So, I came home and did a really small one.\" Since 2006, Ware has hand-crafted over 20 custom Lego mosaics. Ware said he especially likes science fiction or comic book images, although anything with \"bold splashes of colour in them\" will do. Depending on the size and intricacy of the mosaic, Ware said his pieces can include upwards of 5,000 \"studs\" and can take anywhere from 40 to 100 hours to complete. \"I'm a bit of a night owl,\" joked Ware, who works as a full-time oil and gas analyst. He started doing commission pieces about three years into his mosaic work to help fund his \"very expensive hobby.\" Ware has built quite the portfolio since, his commission pieces growing larger in size and magnitude by the year - not to mention, demand. In October, Ware completed a five-by-five foot mosaic of SAIT Polytechnic president Irene Lewis, to celebrate her retirement in his biggest piece to date. \"My calendar is getting booked up fast which is good,\" he said. \"It's kind of gone from just a hobby to a hobby that I can make a little bit of money at.\" a Lego ce L ebrity in the making Since 2009, Ware has regularly attended BrickCon, an annual Lego convention held in Seattle, where he has won a number of awards for his work. Ware said he likes to stay connected to local Lego enthusiasts, too. \"They're a really good bunch of people,\" he said. He has participated in community Lego shows in Silver Springs and Millican Ogden since 2010, pick-ing up yet more awards along the way. Ware is also a member of SALUG (Southern Al- berta Lego User Group). The group was started 10 years ago to bring like- minded adults together over their love of Lego. They currently have about 20 members. \"He (Ware) is a cool guy and he does some great work,\" said SALUG president Adam Murtha. \"The group is always happy to have him. We're always interested in what he's working on.\" \"He's almost like a Lego celebrity,\" he said. a F ami L y tradition Ware said both his sons, eight-year-old Finny and three-year-old Max, are huge Lego fans. \"I really like Lego,\" said Finny, who has competed in local competitions with his dad. \"Basically, you can build anything with it.\" Ware's wife, Kate Ware, said she always supported his Lego work. The couple's deal is to keep his work quarantined in the basement - well, as much as it can with two kids. \"I love sitting and helping but I think it's really important that the boys have something that's very dad,\" Kate said. \"I think it's just a very versatile, posi-tive thing for the family.\" a Lego- L aden F uture Ware has some lofty plans for the new year. He is expected to build a Calgary Tower Lego robot, as well as a large mosaic of a Calgary icon, using the two $1,200 Grassroots Inspired Grants he received from Calgary 2012. Ware will also be involved in the February 2013 SALUG community show. Ware said he would eventually like to become a Lego-certified professional. He is currently being mentored by the only one in Canada - Robin Sather of Brickville DesignWorks. Ware said his love of Lego stems from its \"endless possibilities.\" Although, it seems the same could be said of his future. p ame L a d i p into | pdipinto@cjournal.caDave Ware of Brickwares approaches 'celebrity' status with rare custom mosaic workBuilding a name for himself Photo: Pamela Di Pinto/Calgary Journal January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 31 'War Brides' from World War II Artist captures the essence of women through paintings of their wedding day photos ARYN GUTHRIE |aguthrie@cjournal.ca Bev Tosh captures women on what may seem the most important day of their life - their wedding day. Her studio is lined up with paintings of brides' faces staring back at you. These paintings are on brown, rough planks of plywood and are lined up against white walls. To the right of each painting there is a white, thin-like mate-rial that features the name of each woman and her story. As I walked into her studio I couldn't help but wonder: Who are these women? These women are Dutch war brides -- women who married a Canadian foreign service man during World War II. They were brought together because of war and hostility, Tosh says. They are couples who would have never met if it weren't for the war. Tosh has painted more than 140 war brides over an 11-year span, but has recently been working on a section of her piece that features only Dutch war brides. \"Those stories of the occupation and liberation just really resonated recently,\" she says. Tosh currently lives in the southwest of Calgary with her husband. She is 64 years old and is the president of the Burns Visual Arts Society. The so-ciety aims to provide studio space at a reasonable cost for working visual artists. The project started with a portrait of her mother who was a war bride that married a pilot with the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Tosh's mother was expected to follow him by boat from Saskatoon after the war. \"I had no idea I'd be following through with this huge body of work,\" Tosh says. When Tosh was nine, she travelled by boat from New Zealand back to Saskatoon after her mother had left the marriage. \"My mother retraced the journey she had made as a hopeful young war bride a decade before tak-ing her two daughters back to her family home in Saskatchewan,\" Tosh says. \"I was old enough to feel my homeland slide away as the (boat) departed New Zealand. It remains a profound memory. I'm sure those who emigrated by ship share a similar defining mo-ment.\" Women's stories have always been an interest to Tosh. She says what's fuelling her is the stories told by ordinary women who were put in extraordinary situations. \"They all had to say goodbye to all they'd known and had to follow a man that they'd married to a country they hadn't really chosen. They had chosen the man. So often, some of them were not wel-comed,\" Tosh says. \"As a visual artist, and as an interest in women's journeys, I feel honoured to be able to work through (the brides) and continue with them,\" Tosh says. However, Tosh describes her work as a journey as well as a struggle to paint each one. \"You think it would get easier after a length of time,\" she jokes. One of the war brides that Tosh painted was a woman named Margaretha Hemmings, who fol-lowed her husband to Nova Scotia from Amster-dam after the war. She now lives in a seniors home in Calgary. Hemmings recalled receiving her orders to board upon the boat that took her to Canada. \"We having a saying in Dutch. When you say 'A' you need to say 'B,' meaning you can't go back on your word. I married this man and now I had to go.\" \"I was on the boat and saw Holland going away in the mist, and I thought: When will I ever see (my family) again?\" For Hemmings' daughter, Margaret Iskander, Tosh's portraits are more than just capturing a woman on her wedding day, but the impact these women had on Canadian culture. \"I think it's great that (Tosh) is doing this,\" Iskander says. \"There's a lot of focus on the soldiers and there should be because they were heroes and gave their lives. \"But I'm glad the brides are being seen as con- tributing to the country and as a real change in our society of that time.\" Bev Tosh prepares a portrait of a war bride who travelled to Canada from Scotland at her studio in the Burns Visual Art Society.Photo: Aryn Guthrie/Calgary Journal \"They all had to say goodbye to all they'd known and had to follow a man that they'd married to a country they hadn't really chosen.\" \u2014 Bev Tosh, artist January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 32 From trash to art Local artists explore themes of waste, beauty and the environment KARRY TAYLOR | ktaylor@cjournal.ca A few years ago, Sierra Love moved to a property that contained a greenhouse full of old household items left behind by a previous owner. Initially unsure of what to do with it all, she came to see the situation not as a problem, but rather an opportunity\u2014to create art. \"I have a problem throwing things out because I hate to waste anything,\" Love says. \"Over time, you have all of this stuff and wonder what you will do with it all.\" Love decided to make the unwanted items into art. Two years ago, she teamed up with two friends, fellow artists Jordan Friesen and Amanda Lingwood, to create the concept for a unique art show. \"We generate a lot of waste,\" Love says. \"All three of us have very different artistic styles but that was a theme that we all believed in.\" The result of their collaboration was an art show held in the spring of 2011 called \"Resurrections.\" The show's aim was to explore themes including waste, beauty, and the environment. The artists were allowed to buy paint, but all other base materials had to be items that had been recycled, reclaimed or otherwise discarded. All proceeds of the Resurrections shows are donated to community organizations that reflect the themes explored. The latest show supported Open Streets Calgary. Inspired by the success of their initial show, Love, Lingwood and Friesen de-cided to expand their scope. They now hold two shows a year. Their latest show displayed the work of 12 artists from across Canada. Cody Thompson and Kai CB collaborated on \"E is for Everyday Evolutionaries\" using ink drawings and aerosol on scrap wood (right). Sierra Love used a recycled vacuum cleaner among other household objects in \"I Do Love. Reprise Enter Meltdown\" (far right).

But two of Calgary's most prominent bands are unsigned and independently run. Black Phoenix Orchestra is one of these bands. BPO and front man Darren McDade made headlines last year when they won $25,000 as part of radio station X92.9's Xposure contest. And while winning that kind of prize might seem like the ticket to hiring a massive production staff, the business of BPO is still independently run. \"Calgary is full of talented people who can really make a difference in a bands career, but we haven't found one yet that will be a part of us through thick and thin,\" McDade says. \"To find someone willing to put their name on it is hard.\" McDade says that BPO had issues with hiring people to help with the business side of their music. A few years ago, he says a lack of communication and inexperience on the part of their manager led to the band not getting to play at a music festival. Since then McDade has been in charge of all things business. Nevertheless, the lure of hired help can be hard to resist - especially when it comes in the form of a record label willing to foot the bill for a band strug-gling with expenses. Peeling off the labels While not being signed can add to the financial struggle of being in a band, becoming a signed act comes with its own set of issues. That's something that Danny Vacon, front man for Calgary's hometown rock and roll heroes The Dudes, knows all too well. The band was signed to Calgary label Load Music for two albums - \"Brain Heart Guitar\" and \"Blood Guts Bruises Cuts\" - before taking back the reins and dropping the label for their latest release, \"Barbers, Thieves and Bartenders.\" \"It was good and bad for us,\" says Vacon about his time with the label. \"It opened up some doors and it paid for some better recordings, but eventually they just mismanaged us and we lost a lot of opportuni-ties.\" Vacon says that the label had aspirations of turn- ing The Dudes into an overnight success and the band had to turn down many shows that the label deemed low profile. As a result, he says that The Dudes missed opportunities to get their name out to a larger fan base - the opposite of what getting signed is supposed to do. After nearly two decades and one stint in the world of record deals, The Dudes are once again in control of their musical destiny. They still keep a small team for distribution and bookings, but Vacon says that running things in more of a DIY fashion has let them grow momentum faster and allowed them to play the kind of shows they want to play. BPO are in a similar situation, even if it's not the ideal situation for the band. McDade says that he would much rather focus on the music and have someone else run the business side of things, but won't give up control if it means taking the band in the wrong direction. going down the diy route The information age has been a game changer for the music industry. Now bands can reach out to potential fans using iTunes and media like Facebook and MySpace, bridging the gap usually reserved for managers and publicists. With digital music sales replacing hard copy record sales in recent years, some big name bands like Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails are releasing albums digitally, independently or both. So if signed bands are going the DIY route, then it stands to reason that DIY bands are doing something right. Not knowing the dos and don'ts of the business can be stressful for a band that is just starting out. But according to one of Calgary's mainstay musical acts, if the music comes first, the business will find a way to take care of itself. \"I think a lot of times (bands) focus too much on the business of it all when the most important busi-ness is what you do with your pals in the basement,\" Vacon says. \"You got to work, work, work - but make sure you're having an effing blast so it doesn't seem like that. If you can do that, then all that other stuff is going fall right into your lap.\" The Dudes released their new album \"Barbers, Thieves and Bartenders\" without support from a label.Photo: Ryan Rumbolt/Calgary JournalTakin' care of business Running a 'Do it yourself' band in Calgary ryan ruMbolt | rrumbolt@cjournal.ca \"I think a lot of times (bands) focus too much on the business of it all when the most important business is what you do with your pals in the basement.\" \u2014 danny Vacon, front man of t he d udes January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 34The tagline for Mandy Stobo's Twitter account sums up her work: \"I am an art project of Bad Portraits. You send me a pic and I make a very poor watercolor of it that kind of resembles you, but not really.\" Stobo, a single mom, began her project when she was living in Canmore with her son. \"I needed something that was smaller and wasn't going to wreck the house, and I couldn't waste too much time driving back and forth to my studio,\" she said. \"The one thing that came to mind was faces. Everybody has a face, so I thought I should try to utilize that.\" Stobo began \"bad portrait-bombing\" friends and celebrities alike with art that she'd created from Twitter or Facebook profile pictures. \"I can't imagine being an artist in a dif- ferent time, \" Stobo said. \"It'd be impossi-ble to do what I do without social media.\" Fraser Tuff, X92.9's radio personality, has been one of her portrait subjects and is a fan of Stobo's work. \"I think that Mandy is the best,\" Tuff said. \"She's so talented and the 'bad por-trait' idea is so friggin' cool.\" Early this year, the Calgary Downtown Association decided that something had to be done about the amount of litter on Stephen Avenue - under tree grates, in particular. So they hired Stobo to paint tree grates with famous Calgarians' faces on a \"Ste-phen Avenue Walk of Fame.\" \"We wanted to turn litter into aware- ness,\" said the association's manager Cara-lyn Macdonald. \"The vibrancy of the bad portraits worked for garnering attention.\" Over the summer, Stobo became a \"permanent fixture on Stephen Avenue,\" sometimes working until 4:00 a.m. to com-plete portraits - which took her anywhere from 10 to 15 hours each \"with varnishing, sanding and scrapin' off the gum.\" \"To figure out how to paint on metal with holes is really cool for me,\" Stobo said. The project, launched in September, features 55 present and past Calgary faces. Some came out to sign their grates, including Naheed Nenshi, Darrel Janz and Brett Hart. Stobo shares a grate with poet laureate Kris Demeanor. Stobo said that she was particularly fas- cinated with lessons learned while paint-ing the block of historical contributors. \"The way Calgary began blows my mind,\" she said. \"It gave me such a love for the city.\" While the winter months may take a bit of a toll on the grates, Macdonald said the association will keep the project alive as long as possible. The group is accept-ing nominations for subjects for about 35 remaining unpainted grates, which Stobo will be painting next year as long as the grates hold up over the winter. Stobo is planning to expand into To- ronto and New York in the spring. She also has plans to travel to rural Alberta towns to share her work. She said she isn't sure what the response will be like. \"It could all fail and it could all do really well,\" Stobo said. \"I'm just excited to wait and see.\"Walk of Fame Painter uses social media to advance project NICOLLE AMYOTTE | namyotte@cjournal.ca Mandy Stobo shows off her favourite Stephen Avenue tree grate - a 'bad portrait' of Ernest Manning.

Raymond is the lead vocalist in Cal- gary's own rock band, 40 Gun Flagship, where she is known as \"Bobbie Kid.\" Singing and working at Canada Olympic Park with bobsleigh and skeleton teams have become her self-fulfilling proph-ecy. Born in Tofield, Alta., Raymond learned at a young age that she had a passion for singing. For instance, she used to sing stories instead of saying it. At age 11, Raymond took voice lessons and joined a choir. \"My mom just wanted me to be the next Stevie Nicks from Fleetwood Mac,\" Raymond said. Marty Lange, Raymond's mother, said music was a great activity for her daugh-ter to be involved in because it kept her child out of trouble. Lange believes 40 Gun Flagship has given Raymond a great opportunity. \"They have a great band,\" Lange said. \"They all get along really well and they support and help each other.\" Raymond became the band's lead singer in 2008. \"I don't know if it's a passion - more like a calling - where it feels like it's what I need to do,\" Raymond said.\" I want the band to be recognized for building ourselves up le - gitimately.\" 40 Gun Flagship consists of four members: Ryan Tremblay, Bobbie Kid, Cam Dougall and Andy Shaw. They play rock music with a combination of punk, metal and alternative rock. The genre of the music varies per song. The band's drummer Tremblay, describes Raymond as a bandmate who is extremely passionate, caring and friendly. \"She has a drive as she is the one pushing things forward, trying to get shows, getting involved in social media and promoting the band,\" Tremblay said. \"She never ceases to impress me.\" Being a part of the band has taken Raymond out of her comfort zone and given her more confidence. She said when on stage, one can sometimes fake it with an instrument but one can't fake it with their voice. As a result, one has to give it their all when on stage, Raymond said. \"Now that's how I live - all the but- tons all the way pushed all the time,\" Raymond said. The main challenge she faces of being a part of 40 Gun Flagship is time because of people's schedules, ambi-tion and apathy of the general public, Raymond said. With the apathy of the general public, 40 Gun Flagship has to continually be marketing themselves and get people excited about their band, Raymond explained. Consequently, this takes a lot of time. \"Being in a band is like being married to four people and their significant oth-ers all at the same time,\" Raymond said. Over the years, the band has won a total of $30,000 at the AMP Radio Rockstar contest, which is held annu-ally to promote Canadian artists. Since then, they have released two albums and is working towards their next one. Recently, 40 Gun Flagship has signed a licensing agreement for the song \"For- ever\" to be put out on a label in January 2013. However, it's difficult for a band like 40 Gun Flagship to become well-known. \"Calgary is a monster,\" Raymond said. \"There are amazing and talented people in this city that we are a victim of our own success.\" She said that by having shows every night with five or six bands at venues across the city, it's difficult for artists to get people to care about them. She said it's difficult to get people to care about them when there are various shows by different bands across the city. However, she said the band has gener-ally had larger audiences in Eastern Canada. Raymond plans to remain with the band because it is part of her life and who she is now. Despite it all, Raymond plans to re- main with 40 Gun Flagship because it is part of her life and who she is now.\"Being in a band is like being married to four people and their significant others all at the same time.\" \u2014 Robyn Raymond 40 Gun Flagship vocalist January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 35 It's a no-brainer National Lacrosse League institutes new concussion protocol GEOFF CRANE | gcrane@cjournal.ca The National Lacrosse League recently insti- tuted new standard procedures for assessing and dealing with players suspected of having concussions. These procedures are important in lacrosse, a game that is played from the shoulders up, increasing the chances of contact to a player's head. But the introduction of these policies comes only after other major sports organizations instituted similar measures. The procedures are \"just another piece to continue the growth of protecting the player as the years go on,\" said Brian Lemon, NLL Vice President of Opera-tions. Hockey Canada, the national body governing ama- teur hockey had such concussion protocols enacted as early as 2008. The NCAA, the largest collegiate athletic body in the United States has had policies in place since 2009. The NFL and NHL, who have received plenty of criticism for being slow to react on the headshot controversy, had policies in place in 2011. Nevertheless, the NLL insists that they are not behind the pack. Instead, the league - which has formally been in operation since 1997 - sees their new concussion policy as more of an improvement of existing efforts. According to Lemon, all NLL teams \"had their own protocols in place for a number of years.\" These protocols were administered by doctors and trainers who are experienced with professional contact sports leagues. \"This isn't something we just started. What we wanted to do was make sure we had our teams across the board all working under the same guidelines,\" Lemon said. SAFETY FIRST The new guidelines were developed by a committee of seasoned doctors from the NLL teams. They require all teams to use the same protocols in immediately assessing players who are suspected to have received a concussion in practice or a game. A flow chart of additional tests will track a player's recovery, ensuring he is healthy enough to return to game action. In addition, baseline testing for each individual play- er will be included at the beginning of each season. Baseline tests determine a players normal brain functions before an injury. If a player is suspected of having a concussion, his baseline scores will be compared to scores from a test given immediately after an incident to determine if a player has been injured. These test scores are especially important when dealing with players who report that they are feeling better after an initial injury assessment, according to Lauren Sergio, a York University concussion expert and kinesiology professor. Sergio conducted a study that found such players were often still suffering effects from their concussion. The only way to detect that was using a computer program that analyzed their baseline data against their current condition. The worst-case scenario for a player who is concussed is to go back out and receive a second concussion. \"Once you get one, it's easier to get another one, and the symptoms on the second one are worse and they last longer,\" Sergio said. REPEAT OFFENDERS PUT ON NOTICE In an effort to try and further protect players, the NLL has also stiffened its penalties for infractions known to put players at the most risk for a concussion. These include penalties for high-sticking and illegal cross checking. The hope is these changes will act as a deterrent for players from committing these infrac-tions. Calgary Roughnecks transition player Geoff Snider is looking forward to seeing the new rules imple-mented in the league. According to Snider, players for the most part have respect for one another. Like in any league however, there are some who have garnered the reputation as dirty players when it comes to illegal head shots. Those players \"are going to find themselves in posi- tions where they are being suspended from games and they're losing money, and depending on the severity it costs their team,\" Snider said. \"I'm proud that the league took this on, protecting the best interests of their players. I think it's nothing but a positive thing for the league moving forward.\" Lacrosse is a game played from the shoulders up, which can increase the chances of contact to the head.Photo: Geoff Crane/Calgary Journal \"I'm proud that the league took this on, protecting the best interests of their players.

A faint swishing noise is heard every time they take a shot, confidence building with every basketball that goes through the hoop. They are members of the Calgary Crush, the city's fourth attempt at supporting a professional basketball franchise. Owner Salman Rashidian sits at the scorer's table maintaining the scoreboard during a bevy of drills and mini-games. \"We've always thought about having a professional basketball team in Calgary. We just needed the right group of people,\" he said. \"This time around, we se-lected people who we felt would bring positive energy to our franchise and do basketball for the community for the love of the game.\" The Crush is not the first team to try and settle in Calgary. The 88's were leading the World Basketball League (WBL) in attendance, and put together a record of 151-78 in a five year span starting in 1988. As they were gaining steam, the WBL folded when founder Mickey Monus was involved in a scandal for defrauding his discount pharmacy chain to offset the league's financial losses in 1992. The Calgary Outlaws emerged in 1993 but their league closed shop a year later. Then the Drillers came and went quietly in 2005, when the team itself folded. To be successful, the Crush will look to tap into the city's basketball community, which is a growing one. Youth basketball is becoming more prominent in the city as programs like the Calgary Minor Basketball As-sociation (CMBA), Calgary Youth Development Centre (CYDC) and the Elite program are all hitting stride. The CMBA, which runs from the ages of 4-19, has roughly 3,500 kids participating this year according to CMBA President Wendy Parker. They moved to a new six-zone system this year, where teams choose from a deeper player pool. \"Rather than having two really good players on one team and playing with lower level players, these players can now excel and we can have better games against all the other areas,\" Parker said. John Hegwood played for the 88's for four years, and is now the President of Calgary Youth Development Centre and founder of Calgary Elite basketball program said that the level minor basketball play is increasing as more camps, travel teams and skill clinics become available to the players, He won Calgary's Citizen of the Year award in 2009 for his work with the CYDC. While the CYDC and the CMBA are running different programs, their goal is the same: to develop Calgary's next wave of basketball players. To do this, both Parker and Hegwood said they want the city to build a basketball centre. \"If we had a centre here some- where that was centralized and right off the LRT tracks, it would be really awesome,\" Parker said. \"It would really make people stand up and take notice.\" Hegwood echoed the senti- ment, adding that he wants to get a six-court facility for the CYDC so that he doesn't have to rely on school gyms for gym time: \"We do go under contract, but they don't have to renew each year.\" With the community working internally to expand the game in the city, the Crush could help local groups by increasing basketball's profile. Greg Smith, general man-ager and assistant coach of the Crush, thinks the club has a serious shot of impressing people. \"We wanted to bring something back to the city of Calgary so that people could see basketball at the highest level it has ever been (here),\" he said. The Crush as a team is on the same page. From a player like Jermaine Campbell who grew up in Calgary playing basketball, to Rashidian who has watched the 88's and the Drillers come and go, the motto remains: Grow the game in Calgary. Campbell played basketball at Bishop McNally High School, and went on to play at the University of Ottawa. He now lives in the city and helps out with the Genesis Pro-gram, another program that aims to focus \"on not only skill develop-ment at the team and individual level but also on transferring skills learned on the court to the outside world,\" according to their website.All the Crush need to succeed is a fan base and support from the basketball community. Smith wants to eventu-ally be able to replenish the roster with graduates from the CMBA or the CYDC, and the first step towards that is developing the players themselves. \"We are trying to start small and grow this into some- thing that is going to be long-lasting,\" he said. Smith knows that their team is able to compete with the rest of the American Basketball Association, having won their first two games in their division with more home games happening in late January at SAIT. He and the rest of the team have the same goal in mind: \"To give Calgary something exciting to come and watch.\" As the final buzzer of practice goes off, Rashidian sits with the hopes that he and his team can make a differ-ence in the city. The Calgary Crush hope to provide a level of basketball that hasn't been seen in the city since the 88's left town in 1992.Photo: Pol Nikulin/Calgary JournalBasketball returns to city Calgary Crush begin newest attempt at growing game Flexible Credible Online and DistanceMC117213did it multiple times per day. 19% Do it your way.

But the man responsible for those concessions, Mark Vaillant, vice president of food and beverage for the Calgary Flames says there isn't a lot of demand for healthier eating options - even though some sports facilities provide them. However, he says that demand may change in the future. Rory Hornstein, a registered dietician for Mount Royal University recreation service, sees the current lack of options as a big problem. \"It's ironic that you're there to watch professional athletes,\" Hornstein says, referencing the healthy lifestyle many of them have to lead. \"It would be nice if there were some healthy choices there for the spectator as well.\" However, at Calgary's sports stadiums, it's an issue of supply and demand. Vaillant says, \"We have some options but tradition- ally people don't eat them.\" \"I only get about three or four emails a year asking for more healthy or vegetarian options,\" says Vaillant. \"Literally, I can count them on one hand.\" By comparison, Vaillant says the Saddledome will go through 2,000 hot dogs, and anywhere from five to seven hundred pounds of Alberta beef on game nights. For hockey fans looking to satisfy their sweet tooth, cotton candy and ice cream are readily available to the 1.5 million people that visit the Saddledome every year. That's similar to McMahon stadium, where Vaillant co-ordinates food and beverage as well. Vaillant calls McMahon \"your typical stadium affair\" where you'll mostly find hot dogs, popcorn and burg-ers with vegetarian options being harder to come by. Despite the lack of email clamour for healthier eating options, Vaillant acknowledges there may be a growing demand from them. \"The general consumer going to a hockey game 25 years ago thought a hot dog and a beer was all you needed,\" Vaillant says. \"Now, people want to eat healthier and they want more options available to them.\" Vaillant says the Saddledome does cater to those looking for a healthy pre-game meal at in-stadium eat-eries such as the Saddleroom Grill, Dutton's Canadian Lounge and The Avison Young Club. During the game, fans can snack on a carved turkey sandwich from the Skyline Deli or veggie platters and sushi rolls from other concessions on the main con-course. And new to the Saddledome, patrons can feast on a half rotisserie chicken with fresh vegetables and salad from the rotisserie station located on the second level. But stadium goers may not be aware of those op- tions because according Vaillant, \"fans have a tendency to stay in the area where their seats are.\" As for McMahon stadium, healthy options like souv- laki are available as well. But those options may not be enough - especially for vegetarians and vegans.Rachel Leet, a lifelong vegetarian and Flames fan says, \"At sports stadiums you can always find tons of meat options like burgers and hot dogs, but there are never any tasty vegetarian options. \"There's usually cheese pizza and popcorn - that's it.\" And while she acknowledges that it's getting better in Calgary, it is tough being a vegetarian in a province that is famous for its beef. By comparison, no city in North America has been more considerate to vegetarians than Philadelphia. The home of the famous philly cheese steak sand- wich has been ranked by PETA as having some of the most vegetarian friendly sports stadiums. In fact, Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadel- phia Phillies and Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Philadelphia Eagles, are ranked number one in PETA's rankings of vegetarian-friendly stadiums for the MLB and NFL respectively. Erin Noss, communications manager for ARAMARK, food service provider for many sports stadiums in North America including Citizens Bank and Lincoln Financial, says it is important to meet the needs of everyone coming to watch a game. \"We want to make sure the gameday experience is the best possible for each fan and that there's some-thing available for everyone.\" The menu at Citizens Bank Park offers unique vege- tarian options, such as a vegetarian black bean burger, eggplant cutlet sandwich, Italian vegetable grinder, as well as the traditional veggie dog.Noss says, \"Although a vegetarian hot dog might not be the most popular thing on the menu, if you're a vegetarian, you're happy that there's a hot dog there for you.\" And those looking to get their healthy eating fix are not always who you'd suspect. In an interview with the Globe and Mail, former NHL enforcer Georges Laraque, a vegan himself, stressed the importance of living a healthier lifestyle and mak-ing more healthy eating choices along the way. \"The food is more dangerous now than it was 10 or 20 years ago in terms of all the chemicals, all the preservatives injected into it,\" Laraque says. Laraque became a vegan in 2006 after watching the documentary film \"Earthlings\" and has never looked back. And while no longer playing, Laraque was surprised to learn that his strength actually improved after mak-ing the switch. This corresponds to Hornstein's statement that \"healthy eating and athletics go hand in hand.\" And if you are going to indulge yourself with a stadium snack, the dietician urges staying away from foods that are high in salt. \"The sodium content is through the roof on a lot of those products,\" Hornstein says. \"That can lead to ad-ditional cravings for more salt or more sugar, so there's a reason why you're reaching for those foods.\" Hornstein recommends eating at home before a game or researching the nutritional information of the stadium snacks before putting them into your body. Don't eat your faceoff Some fans search for healthy eating options in sports stadiums across North America MAX SHILLETO | mshilleto@cjournal.ca Stadium food selection across North America is limited to the usual snacks, but due to popular demand more options are becoming available.Photo: Max Shiletto/Calgary Journal January 2013 | calgaryjournal.ca 38In 2006, Bret Seaton tried out for the University of Calgary's female hockey team. As a non-recruited, walk-on player, she was far from guaranteed a spot on the team. That didn't deter her. Seaton ended up being one of two walk-on players the Dinos took on that year. She hasn't looked back.\"I worked my way up from the bottom. I went from playing on the last line and made it to the first line by the end of the year,\" Seaton says. \"I also ended up getting a couple of team awards.\"It's an accomplishment that I am pretty proud of.\" In the past six years, Seaton has accomplished a lot. In 2007, she transferred to SAIT where she played two seasons with the Trojans. In the fall of 2008, she pulled double duty - playing both hockey and soccer for the Trojans. Seaton, who grew up on a farm near Brooks, gradu-ated from SAIT with a diploma in hospitality manage-ment. She then transferred back to the University of Calgary. In June of 2012, she graduated from the university with a degree in hotel and resort manage-ment. After leaving SAIT, she kept active in hockey, play-ing with teams in both the Western Women's Hockey League and the Southern Alberta Women's Hockey Association. But she found herself missing the level of play found college-level hockey. This fall, when she decided to enhance her degree by enrolling in SAIT's business administration pro-gram, Seaton was presented with a second opportu-nity to play for the school. After a three-year break, she is back on the ice for the Trojans. EXPERIENCE VALUED ON YOUNG TEAM At 24 years old, Seaton is the oldest player on the Trojans - a situation that her younger teammates sometimes don't let her forget. \"There are a lot of jokes cracked about that some-times,\" she says. \"But you have to let it roll off your back.\" While they may tease her about her age, Seaton's teammates and coaches have come to value her experience and leadership abilities. Terry Larsen, the team's head coach, says Seaton is a \"natural-born leader\" both on and off the ice. \"She's the type of player who goes out and gives you 150 per cent every single time that she steps onto the ice,\" he says. \"She's exactly what you would like all of your play-ers to be.\" Larsen says Seaton's dedication and work ethic have been appreciated. \"We have 11 rookies right now and Bret brings her leadership to those players,\" he says. \"She just auto-matically knows the right things to say. All the players listen to her. \"She's just that type of a player, and that type of a person.\" Justine Cantley, the Trojan's team captain, says that Seaton is an \"unspoken leader\" on the team. \"She brings a lot of maturity to the team. Everyone looks up to Bret,\" Cantley says. \"She has had a huge impact on the team this year.\" SPORTING BACKGROUND Seaton started out playing both hockey and ringette when she was seven years old. She says she eventu-ally decided to settle on hockey because it was better suited to her personality. \"I have always had a bit of an attitude and have always been super competitive by nature,\" she says. \"I loved the sport and the team atmosphere of it.\" Seaton comes from a sporting family. Her father Paul was a competitive water skier for Great Britain. During his career, he competed on the World Cup circuit, held several world records and co-authored a book about the sport. He also took part in the 1972 summer Olym-pics where water skiing was a demonstration sport. Bret Seaton says her father, while very modest about his own accomplishments, has served as a source of inspiration for her own athletic endeavors. \"He has always encouraged me to go as far as I can with hockey,\" she wsays. Looking to the future, Seaton is hoping to build a career in the hotel and resort field. While she has one more year of eligibility, Seaton is unsure if she will play with the Trojans again next year. For now though, she is enjoying her time \u2014 and her role \u2014 on the team this season. \"This might be my last kick at the can,\" Seaton says. \"I am very grateful I have been given the opportunity to be on the team this year.\" Bret Seaton viewed as unspoken leader Veteran player returns to play women's hockey at SAIT KARRY TAYLOR | ktaylor@cjournal.ca Originally from Brooks, forward Bret Seaton previously played two seasons with SAIT before transferring to the University of Calgary.
