Your Ultimate Guide to Prevent Osteoporosis Welcome to today's episode where we focus on the world of bone health, specifically conditions like osteopenia and osteoporosis. In this episode, we discuss the importance of maintaining strong bones and how to prevent fractures. We clarify the difference between osteopenia and osteoporosis, their prevalence, and how to identify if you're affected by them. We also talk about the risk factors for these conditions, such as age, gender, and lifestyle choices. A common misconception about osteoporosis is that it only affects older women. We debunk this myth and explain that osteoporosis can happen to anyone, regardless of age or gender. We discuss standard treatment protocols for osteoporosis and why they may not be sufficient. We offer insights on medications commonly prescribed for osteoporosis, including their impact on bone physiology and the risks and side effects that many people are unaware of. We stress the importance of a holistic approach to bone health, incorporating lifestyle changes, dietary supplements, and alternative therapies. We also highlight the connection between gut health and bone health, sharing insights on the ideal diet for osteoporosis. We recommend specific foods that can be beneficial additions to a bone-healthy plan, such as calcium-rich foods, vitamin D, and magnesium. Exercise plays a significant role in bone health, and we discuss whether having low bone density guarantees a fracture. We explain the importance of weight-bearing exercises like walking, dancing, and strength training in promoting bone density and preventing fractures. Family history and genetics don't paint the complete picture when it comes to osteoporosis. We discuss the importance of understanding your individual risk factors and taking proactive steps to prevent bone loss and fractures. To wrap up, we provide a stronger bones plan that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and bone-building supplements. We remind everyone that osteoporosis is not an inevitable part of aging and that there are multiple ways to improve bone health and prevent fractures. Armed with the right knowledge and tools, we can all take control of our bone health and live life to the fullest.

In this episode, we talk to Lisa Hendrickson- Jack, an expert in women's health, to discuss the significance of a healthy menstrual cycle and optimal hormone balance. We explore several important topics that shed light on the role of menstruation in a woman's overall physical, reproductive, and emotional well-being. One of the key insights we discuss is concept of viewing the menstrual cycle as a vital sign. Just like other vital signs, such as blood pressure and heart rate, the menstrual cycle provides valuable information about a woman's reproductive health and fertility. We emphasize the importance of paying attention to the characteristics of the menstrual cycle to gain a deeper understanding of hormonal balance and overall health. We also talk about what a normal menstrual cycle should look like. Lisa guides us through the different phases of the cycle. By understanding what constitutes a normal cycle, women can identify any irregularities or abnormalities that may require attention or medical intervention. We go on to explore the most common health conditions that can disrupt the menstrual cycle. Lisa shared her expertise on conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and thyroid disorders, explaining their potential effects on menstruation and overall health. This knowledge enables us to recognize potential signs and symptoms, leading to early intervention and appropriate medical care. By considering the menstrual cycle as a vital sign, understanding what constitutes a normal cycle, and recognizing the impact of common health conditions and birth control methods, we can take control of our reproductive health and make informed decisions for their overall well-being.

How Trauma Impacts Your Health and Actionable Steps To Heal](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/54-how-trauma-impacts-your-health-and-actionable/id1622988198?i=1000622263183) 54. How Trauma Impacts Your Health and Actionable Steps To Heal This episode is for you if you have ever experienced trauma. Which to some degree or another is all of us. We discussed why this is the case with Dr. Aimie Apigian focusing on the biology of trauma. Our discussion highlights the distinction between stress and trauma responses. Stress begins with a startle response, leading to a high-energy stress response that mobilizes the body into action. On the other hand, trauma responses involve freezing and energy depletion. Trauma responses can result in a shutdown of the body, affecting physical health and causing inflammation and other biological effects. We also discuss the role of cortisol in the stress response, emphasizing that cortisol supports the high-energy state. However, in trauma responses, the emergency brake is pulled alongside the accelerator, leading to confusing messages within the body. This can result in chronic conditions and symptoms, which are often rooted in past traumas and overwhelm. We then talk about how working with trauma responses requires a specific sequence to shift the body's programming. The first step is establishing safety, both in a felt sense and by changing the biology to a state of safety. Dr. Aimie explains somatic work, such as somatic experiencing, to help us become aware of their nervous system and track our stress and trauma responses. By using gentle tools to shift our state, we can move towards healing and rewiring trauma patterns. Overall, Dr. Aimie's insights shed light on the biology of trauma, the impact it has on physical health, and the importance of understanding the distinction between stress and trauma responses for effective healing and well-being. About our Guest Dr. Aimie Apigian, MD, MS, MPH is the leading medical expert on how life experiences get stored in the body and restoring the body to its best state of health through her signature model and methodology, The Biology of Trauma. She is a double board-certified medical physician in Preventive Medicine and Addiction Medicine. She has a Masters in Biochemistry and a Masters in Public Health.

Secrets No One Is Talking About To Improve Thyroid Health](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/52-secrets-no-one-is-talking-about-to-improve-thyroid-health/id1622988198?i=1000618469425) 52. Secrets No One Is Talking About To Improve Thyroid Health In this podcast episode Dr. Amie Hornaman joins as a guest to explore all things realated to thyroid health. We dive into important aspects such as thyroid lab tests, the significance of the often overlooked T2 thyroid hormone, the role of testosterone in women's health and its impact on the thyroid, the connection between insulin resistance and thyroid function, and the limitations of solely focusing on adrenal healing. Dr. Hornaman highlights the importance of specific lab tests that provide valuable insights into thyroid function, essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. These \"thyroid lab must do's\" form the foundation for understanding and addressing thyroid health effectively. We shed light on T2, an often forgotten thyroid hormone. Dr. Hornaman explains how T2 plays a crucial role in thyroid function and overall metabolic health. By exploring the functions and mechanisms of T2, listeners gain a deeper understanding of its impact on the body and why it should not be overlooked in discussions about thyroid health. Another intriguing topic we discuss is the relationship between testosterone and thyroid health in women. We learn how testosterone, typically associated with men, is equally important for women. We explore the intricate connection between testosterone levels and thyroid function, emphasizing the significance of hormonal balance for optimal thyroid health. We then shift to the conversation to explore the link between insulin resistance and thyroid function. Dr. Hornaman elaborates on how insulin resistance, a condition commonly associated with diabetes, can also affect the thyroid. Understanding this connection enables you to recognize the importance of managing insulin resistance as part of a comprehensive approach to improving thyroid health. We then challenge the notion that solely focusing on adrenal healing is sufficient for addressing thyroid issues. We talk about the need for a holistic approach that considers various factors impacting thyroid health, rather than solely targeting adrenal glands. By debunking this misconception, you gain a more comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted nature of thyroid health and the need for a well-rounded treatment approach.
