Warn your patients about rebound when stopping their PPIs Rebound Symptoms Acid hypersecretion after PPItherapy is more pronounced, lasts longer , and could possibly be the cause of acid-related symptoms.GERD -Food Allergies Treatment with GAS medications is associated with the occurrence of food allergy, an effect not apparently related to a diagnosis of GERD alone .GERD -Diet Commonly considered foods : oFatty or fried foods oTomato sauce, citrus, oEating at night oEating too quickly, not chewing enough oLying down after eating oSmokingGERD -Diet Biggest successes Healing Acute Care : o2 Tbsp aloe vera juice in water or chamomile tea oSlippery elm gruel or tea oDGL tablets -1-2 tabs, as needed (max qid) o1 Tbsp slippery elm gruel) oAloe vera juice (1 -3 ozbefore for missing bacteria the \"poster child\" for missing Role in decreasing risk of allergies and asthma lowered risk of peptic ulcer with H.

Pylori We conclude that H.pylori presence and CD are inversely associated , a relationship that persists after adjustment for socioeconomic factors. Future studies should address whether H.pylori modulates immune responses to a late-in-life human pathogen with potential early - life benefits . These studies indicate that H. pylori influences the microbiota and host immune responses not only locally in the stomach, but distantly as well, affecting important target organsH. Pylori Increasing treatment failure: 14 day treatment (from 10 days) Quadruple therapy (from triple) GERD -Probiotics In infants with functional GER, L. reuteri DSM 17938 reduce gastric distension and accelerate gastric emptying . In addition, this probiotic strain seems to diminish the frequency ofregurgitation.GERD -Probiotics The sequential treatment regimen achieved a significantly higher eradication rate of H. pylori compared with standard 7 -d regimen. L.reuteri supplementation could reduce the frequency and the intensity of antibiotic -associated side -effects.GERD -Probiotics L.reuteri combination alone is able to exert an inhibitory effect on H. pylori growth , and when administered with eradication therapy, it determines a significant reduction in antibiotic - associated side effects.GERD/H. pylori -Probiotics oL. reuteri inflammatory autoimmune disorders affecting the gut -anywhere from mouth to rectum oMost common types: Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative ColitisInflammatory Bowel Disease Symptoms related to inflammation of the GI tract: oDiarrhea oRectal bleeding oUrgent need to move bowels oAbdominal cramps and pain oSensation of incomplete evacuation oConstipation (can lead to bowel obstruction) General symptoms that may also be associated with IBD: oFever oLoss of appetite of shedding, and hindering the redistribution of TJs that should seal the gaps left IBD: History Of Antibiotic Use UK study following a total of 1 072 426 subjects from 1994 -2009 oIBD rates: anti-anaerobic antibiotic unexposed and person -years, respectively o84% relative risk increase oDose -response effect existed with more than 2 courses of antibiotics Pediatrics 2012 Oct;130(4):e794 -803.IBD -Decreased Butyrate -Producing Bacteria Species The dysbiosis of CD patients is characterized by reduced abundance of multiple butyrate -producing bacteria species .IBD -Diet A low -FODMAP diet does not seem to improve IBD IBD -Diet These data suggest that a diet low in FODMAPs is an efficacious treatment solution in the management of functional bowel symptoms for IBS and IBDpatientsIBD -Diet Clinical and mucosal improvement with specific carbohydrate diet in pediatric Crohn disease; N = 9IBD -Diet This retrospective review provides evidence that the SCD can be integrated into a tertiary care center and may improve clinical and laboratory parameters for pediatric patients with nonstructuring , nonpenetrating CD as well as UC.IBD-AID Nutritional Regime After following the IBD -AID, all (100%) patients were able to discontinue at least one of their prior IBD medications , and all patients had symptom reduction including bowel frequency .IBD-AID Nutritional Regime There are 4 basic parts to the diet that need to be included on a daily basis + texture changes to food: 1.Prebiotic food 2.Probiotic food 3.Good balanced diet 4.Avoidance of certain foods (modified specific CHO diet) -No processed foods, trans, refined sugar, grains (except oats), lactose http://www.umassmed.edu/nutrition/ibd/ibdaid/IBD EditionIBD -PHGG PHGG promotes colonic epithelial cell wound . These findings indicate that PHGG could be utilized as a therapeutic agent for patients with intestinal mucosal damage such as those with IBD.IBD -PHGG These findings suggest that microbial metabolites of PHGG reduce intestinal barrier defects and inflammation in colitic mice.IBD -Melatonin Shown to block the induction of drug -induced colitis in mice if premedicated with melatoninIBD -Melatonin The majority of these studies indicate that melatonin has a positive impact on IBDwith no or negligible side effects. Such results have been mostly explained through free radical scavenging and diminishing inflammation.IBD -Nutrient Deficiencies Due to chronic inflammation as well as side effects of chronically used medications, patients with IBDare also at increased risk of nutritional factor deficiencies, including iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, magnesium and vitamin AIBD -Nutrient Deficiencies Decreased food intake Increased intestinal loss Malabsorption Hypermetabolic state Drug interactions Long -term total parenteral nutritionIBD -Nutrient Deficiencies Anemia Iron, folate, vitamin B12 Bone disease Calcium, D Hypercoagulability Folate, B12 Wound healing Zinc, A & D Colorectal cancer risk Folate, DIBD -Nutrient Deficiencies Factors contributing to the development of anemia include chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, vitamin B12malabsorption secondary to terminal ileitis, folate deficiency as a result of sulfasalazine therapyIBD -Nutrient Deficiencies Iron Measurements: In patients without clinical symptoms and normal C - reactive protein (CRP), a ferritin of under 30 = Fe deficiency anemia If CRP is elevated, use iron & transferrin levels Monitor within 4 weeks -serum ferritin and transferrin levels -earlier in symptomatic patients "}
