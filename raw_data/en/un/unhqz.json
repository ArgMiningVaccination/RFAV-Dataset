It is with great pride that we announce Precision Promise, the fir st large - scale precision medicine trial that will put the patient at the center of every decision and help advance our goal to double survival by 2020. The Leading Doctors Behind Precision Promise https://www.pancan.org/news/leading -doctors -behind -precision -promise/ We're proud to partner with 12 initial medical centers who were selected through a competitive peer- review process. These 12 sites will provide treatment to patients enrolled in the Precision Promise clinical trial come spring 2017. Nation Urged to Shift from Pink to Purple for Pancreatic Cancer, A Disease That Kills More People Annually Than Pancreatic Cancer Action Network urges the nation to shift from pink during breast cancer awareness month in October to purple this November in support of pancreatic cancer awareness month by learning ab out the symptoms and risk factors of pancreatic cancer. New Guidelines Recommend Palliative Care ncer may experience painful and debilitating symptoms and side effects from their disease and treatment. Supportive (pall iative) care - which focuses on comfort, quality of life and a patient's total well -being - can help. Seeing healthcare professionals who focus on symptom management and supportive (palliative) care improves outcomes and is critical for your quality of life. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network strongly recommends that symptom management and supportive (palliative) care should be provided early in your diagnosis as well as during and after treatment.

Aspen Cancer Conference http://www.aspencancerconference.org/ Meeting : July 15 - July 18, 2017 , the Gant Confere nce Center and Resort, Aspen, CO The Aspen Cancer Conference, a series of yearly meetings conceived by Drs. Benjamin F. Trump and Curtis C. Harris, was begun in 1985. The Conference has continued to emphasize the relationships between toxicity and carcinogenesis and the identification of novel strategies in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. It is evident that new paradigms are needed to explain that an increasing number of mutagenic and non -mutagenic agents result in carcinogenesis, that cell injury and death, repair, and inflammation are constant companions of cancer .
