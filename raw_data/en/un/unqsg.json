This Request is also based upon important statewide issues for Health Related Institutions, such as providing the resources necessary to: educate a world-class healthcare and research workforce, improve the quality and availability ofhealthcare for all Texans, expand the Texas economy by increasing its institutions' ability to bring external research dollars to Texas, and to establish the first research excellence fund expressly dedicated to achieving a Top 10 nationally-ranked medical school in Texas within the next ten years. UT Southwestern (UTSW) has been very successful in achieving the public policy goals it was established to pursue, and has shown great effectiveness in being able to leverage the State's investment in these goals to obtain multiples of additional federal and private support for them. The State's investment in UTSW pays dividends many times greater than the cost, both in terms of external dollars generated for the State and in terms of results produced. Since its formation in makeshift quarters in 1943, UTSW has grown into a multifaceted academic health science university engaged in education, research, patient care, and community service. UTSW has expanded from an initial faculty of 20, housed in WWl barracks, to a faculty of over 2,000, occupying approximately 11 million square feet of space. UTSW is internationally regarded as one of the world's best research institutions, and its Medical School is the only medical school in Texas ranked nationally in the Top 20 and 25, respectively, for research and primary care. Its Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and its School of Health Professions are also highly regarded, and its Simmons Cancer Center is the only NCI-desiguated cancer center in North Texas. Members of the UTSW faculty have achieved national and international recognition for accomplishments in biomedical research, patient care and education, and many of our programs are internationally renowned. Remarkably, a star faculty member recruited back to UTSW from California last year only months later won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for seminal work in immunology accomplished on our campus in the 1990s. Now holl\\e to five Nobel Prize winners -four of whom remain active as faculty members- UTSW also leads Texas in having 19 members of our faculty in the National Academy of Sciences- the \"hall of fame\" for American scientists -and 19 members of the Institute of Medicine. In addition, UTSW has the most Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators and members elected to the Association of American Physicians and the American Society of Clinical Research- two of the most objective national measures of faculty excellence- in Texas. UT Southwestern is also poised to open its new William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital in late 2014, ahead of schedule and under budget. Construction is being accomplished using no State funds and paid in large part with faculty physician earnings that they have elected to invest in this transformative hospital, specifically designed to integrate teaching and research missions while maximizing quality and efficiency in patient care. The goal for UTSW is to forge a pioneering patient-centric University Hospital offering broad clinical expertise so that Texas residents need never again leave Texas to access comprehensive patient care on par with world-renowned centers like the Mayo Clinic. In the inextricably linked education, research and patient care missions of all nationally-ranked medical centers, UTSW has grown remarkably over the past 20 years, both in size and quality. Yet, such accomplishments and this trajectory towards top-ranked excellence are not inevitable. Constant care and strategic State investment\u00ad especially important in economic downturns in which all sources of funding contract- are essential to maintaining excellence and to advancing the quest to produce Texas' first Top 10 school. FY 2012-13 KEY BUDGET DECISIONS AND IMPACT Key Budget Decisions Page I of7 Administrator's Statement 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) --\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7---\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7---------\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7- --------\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7------ 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center ------\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7------- -------- -----------\u00b7 8/20/2012 5:36:35PM As is true for all the State higher education institutions, UTSW absorbed a considerable reduction in State funding for FY12-13. Decisions made with the funds available for the Health Related Institutions' (HRis) principal sources of State funding have affected UTSW and its operations. For example, Graduate Medical Education and Research, two of the largest and most important activities at UTSW, receive less funding and received relatively greater reductions in the 82nd Session. The two activities that receive more funding and were reduced less during the 82nd Session, the 1&0 (Student) Formula and Patient Care, are also principal activities but are not designed to sustain mature, research-intensive institutions like UTSW. UTSW owns and operates State hospitals and provides approximately 10% of its annual operating budget in uncompensated care, but it does not request or receive patient care funding. While UTSW has one of the largest medical school class sizes in the U.S. and Texas, it is at capacity and the quality of education would suffer with any increase in eurollment. Yet, the formula compensates growth in the absence of full funding for statewide enrollment increases. Funding decisions over the last several bieunia resulted in UTSW receiving less funding in FYI O-Il than in FYOS-09. In fact, UTSW now receives less funding in FY12-13 than it received in FY06-07. Impact on UT Southwestern While committed to making the best use of any funds provided and to balancing UTSW's budget with the funds provided, absorbing a significant reduction for FY12-13 after receiving a net loss in FYI 0-11 could not be accomplished without significant impact to the operations that support our core education, patient care and research missions. In FYl0-11, UTSW absorbed its reduction in the following areas: reductions in medical school faculty through elimination of strategic initiatives; reductions in classified staff in Administration and Physical Plant Services; replacement ofleased space with owned space; reductions in travel and communications budget; and exhaustive savings through long-term fixed-price utility contracts, computer vendor contracts, and other efficiencies. In FY12-13, UTSW is thus necessarily absorbing its reduced funding through reductions to operations, increased tuition and patient care. Our strategy was to apply the impact of the budget cut over the entire scope ofUTSW's operating budget, across all services and fund groups (subject to limitations imposed by statute/regulation), including clinical programs that are not directly supported by State funds, to mitigate the impact on academic programs traditionally funded by the State. The following areas were impacted: Reductions in Force-320 FTE positions reduced: While the reduction was applied to non-faculty positions, some unfilled faculty positions were eliminated in the absence of funds. Medical and resident education, research and the role it plays in basic sciences education are most affected. School of Health Professions Downsized- two programs eliminated: Baccalaureate in Medical Laboratory SCiences and the Master of Arts in Biomedical Communications programs were closed, eliminating educational opportunities for Texas students at one of the only schools of health professions that offered these programs in North Texas. Patient Care Programs Impacted -needed growth curtailed: Clinical revenues needed to fund increasing patient care demand used as a stop-gap for educational programs traditionally funded by the State. This stop gap measure immediately impacts patient care and is not a long-term solution. Student Revenue- tuition/fees raised: With a relatively small enrollment of approximately 2,500, tuition is not a large source of revenue yet had to be raised to generate Page 2 of7 --\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7--------Administrator's Statement 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) ------\u00b7- ---\u00b7---\u00b7-\u00b7---- 729 The University of Texas Southwestern -----\u00b7\u00b7 -----\u00b7---\u00b7-\u00b7--- \u00b7-----\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7----8/20/2012 5:36:35PM \u00b7\u00b7-----\u00b7\u00b7--\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7----------- income in F\u00a512-13. Adding to the impact are reductions in other parts of the State budget that also affect UTSW. For example, reductions to Medicaid and Higher Education Group Insurance, as well as programs administered by the Higher Education Coordinating Board such as the Advanced Research Program and Primary Care Residency Program. It is important to note that philanthropy, external research support and other funds cannot make up for the loss of State funds, as their specific nses are mandated by donors or the research sponsors and cannot be redirected to other purposes to offset reductions in State funds. State funds seed the research needed to secure competitive funding and are the bedrock of our mission to educate physicians, residents and the best and brightest scientists for Texas. FY 2014-15 IMPACT OF REDUCTION PLAN SUBMITTED AND CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS Impact of 10% Reduction Plan Submitted UTSW has submitted the required plan to decrease its non-formula funding for FY14-15 by 10%. At UTSW, this would result in a reduction to important Special Item programs. UTSW has already identified, realized and maximized cost-saving opportunities and implemented personnel reductions to achieve our total reduction for FY12-13. An additional 10% non-formula reduction would need to be absorbed through more reductions in personnel. This reduction would further affect the services, activities and outcomes from Special Item programs, impacting research and the role it plays in education in the basic sciences. UTSW research Special Items provide high value to Texas and have been highly successful, as evidenced in thorough reviews by external scientists on behalf of the Higher Education Coordinating Board. All programs reviewed have received the highest scores and accolades, such as the following comments made by external reviewers: \"Every measurable record of academic productivity, performance, and quality has been achieved.\" \" ... highly successful and indicative of the wisdom of targeting funding based on programmatic quality.\" \"This program is absolutely a good investment for the state.\" UTSW's research Special Items are leveraged to bring many millions to Texas in new external research funding on an ongoing basis-which fuels economic development. State funding is essential to seed the research infrastructure needed for researchers to be competitive for grants. The additional 10% reduction would restrict UTSW's ability to retain the current level of external dollars brought to Texas and to make life-changing and cost-saving discoveries for Texans. Reducing by another 10% our clinical care item, the Regional Bum Center, would inhibit our ability to serve the injured. Reducing our \"STARS\" special item, which helps science teachers from hundreds of Texas public schools be more effective teachers, would impact science education for their middle and high-school students. The FY12-l3 reduction to our Primary Care Residency Training item reduced the number of residents supported. A further reduction would lead to more Texas medical school graduates seeking residency training out of state, reduce our capacity to provide indigent care and our ability to help address one of the most pressing areas of physician shortage in Texas. Impact of Current Funding Levels Separate from the impact of the additional tO% non-formula GR reduction plan requested, if the current levels of reduced funding are ongoing, impact on educational programs and personnel on par with what was implemented at UTSW in FY12-l3 will be necessary. Page 3 of7 Near-Term: Impact on Operations Administrato1\u00b7's Statement 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Reduction in GME pipeline of new physicians: Although GME is the most effective source of physicians in Texas, UTSW subsidizes GME significantly, which makes the reduction of residents the most immediately available source of cost reductions. Further downsizing of the School of Health Professions: The pipeline of Physician Assistants and other health professionals will be further compromised. 8/20/2012 5:36:35PM Reduction in enrollment of biomedical science students: Reductions in this essential part of Texas' STEM workforce training will impact Texas' ability to create or attract biotech companies. Downsizing of Patient Care programs: Reduction of Family Medicine resident/care programs will decrease access to primary care for North Texas patients. Additional Reductions in Force-including faculty: Will impact educational programs, support services and morale. Freezes on merit salary increases for FY14-15: Will impact retention of top performers. Long-Term: Impact on UT Southwestern and Texas Lose Best and Brightest: Faculty recruitment and retention- and quest for a Texas Top I 0 school-will be set back. Lose External Grant Funding: Given UTSW's historic 7 to !leverage ratio for every State research $1 received, reductions in research support lead to loss in external grants and biotech start-up company jobs based on UTSW technologies. Lose Medical Discoveries: Royalty income, healthcare cost reductions made possible by discoveries, relocations of hi-tech companies, and promise for novel treatments for patients will be lost. EXCEPTIONAL ITEM REQUESTS Knowing the continuing budget challenge anticipated by the Legislature, UTSW's Exceptional Item requests are focused on providing significant ROI to the State. Leveraging of State dollars has always been a priority for UTSW. From 20 II data, on average, UTSW leveraged each $1 invested in research at UTSW with $7 secured from external resources. These requests are also made in the spirit of responsibility to be sure that the Legislature is informed of the needs of this institution to optimally fulfill its mission for Texas, and with the understanding that these will be assessed by the Legislature within the context of resources available and competing needs. Institute for Translational Research Translational research efforts by UTSW facu1ty to apply their basic discoveries to specific disease conditions have contributed to its long and successful history in the bench-to-bedside development of discoveries into new treatments. UTSW is now at a pivotal point for advancing its faculty's discoveries, with their efforts further and uniquely supported by essential significant infrastructure: a new University Hospital, opening in 2014 and specifically designed to support cutting-edge clinical research, and a licensing revenue-funded BioCenter, a state-of-the-art commercial campus facility strategically positioned for the biomedical industry to interact with clinical Page 4 of7 Administrator's Statement 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version I Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center medicine and academic science to accelerate bench-to-bedside progress. Recent examples of translational research successes at UTSW are: A way to direct the heart's own cells to regenerate to heal iJ1iury caused by heart attack and other disease, with drugs already in development by a newly formed biotech company A biochemical pathway and molecule with promise to actually prevent Alzheimer's, with a vaccine already in trials A new drug to control cholesterol already in trials with patients showing reductions of up to 75% for up to 3 months with a single injection. 8/20/2012 5:36 35PM Yet, development of basic discoveries into trans formative patient care therapies at UTSW requires extensive research infrastructure and funding for the earliest steps in translational research. State funding of $7.5 million per year would provide the infrastructure needed to support the extension of basic discoveries from the lab and seed the earliest steps in translational research for which there are no grant or investor sources of funding, yet are essential for fostering basic discoveries -with tremendous promise for bettering patient care, lowering healthcare costs, and ROI to the State-into novel patient therapies. Tuition Revenue Bond Funding Two Exceptional Items requested are for Tuition Revenue Bond funds to repair and restore UTSW's oldest research labs, 54-years-old in some cases, and to construct additional critically-needed research facilities. UTSW currently conducts $423 million in biomedical research per year-a major economic driver in North Texas-with an expected increase to $675 million per year over the next 10 years. Without these renovations and additional facilities, UTSW will be challenged to accommodate such growth, with a resulting loss of opportunity to bring both star researchers and external research dollars into Texas, and impact on current faculty productivity. UTSW faculty excel by many research productivity mea~ures, but adequate facilities to support their work are essential to maintaining their productivity. Based on approximately 2,000 current faculty members, $366 million in external research expenditures and 1.3 million square feet of actual research space, each faculty generates $274 per square foot of research space for a total of $190,000 generated per faculty per year in external research alone. Even greater productivity can be expected with modern South Campus facilities and critically-needed North Campus animal research quarters to accommodate research growth. STATEWIDE PRIORITIES In addition to our institutional Exceptional Items, UTSW joins the University of Texas System to support statewide funding increases in two key areas. First, UT System notes that funding for the current formulas may not serve the changing profile and needs of all the state's health-related institutions, particularly those that are mature and cannot significantly increase their class sizes. It is important for the State to incentivize and catalyze the development of biomedical research at HRis, consistent with the push for outcome-based funding for general academic institutions and recent efforts to maintain and increase research capacity and excellence at academic institutions. One of the largest returns for the State on the investments it makes with limited resources comes from its top research schools; each state research dollar is leveraged as much as 7 to I with external grants brought into Texas. Furthermore, to echo UT System, promoting success in producing research that matters and that improves the human condition will also enhance educational and patient care missions at our state's health-related institutions. Investing in top medical research programs is as important as investing in STEM initiatives and research at emerging schools, to drive the development of a skilled workforce and because these programs can have immediate impact on Texas' economic recovery, and are poised to claim status as Texas' first Top 10 nationally-ranked schools. Page 5 of7 Administrator's Statement 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version I Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center 8/20/2012 5:36:35PM lncentivizing research and providing research infrastructure through a research excellence match fund for HRis is important for several reasons. First, graduate science education, which fuels a STEM workforce, is not possible without research. In contrast to other educational paths, formal classes are a small part of the education of graduate students and post docs. Instead they receive their education over 4 to 7 years primarily by doing research side-by-side with their mentors. Therefore, without vibrant research, Texas cannot have a full STEM-trained workforce and a globally-competitive high tech industry. Furthermore, grant funding alone cannot support a research enterprise. Graduate students throughout the country receive stipends of approximately $28,000 per year, and if Texas researchers cannot pay competitive stipends, good graduate science students will simply go elsewhere. Their eventual research mentors pay the stipend with grants, but State research funding for graduate assistant stipends is essential during the first 1 to 2 years. Second, recruitment of both rising-star and top established faculty is critical for Texas' future, but investment is essential. Great science is never done in a vacuum, and top scientists are needed to attract other top scientists. Although star scientists bring or soon win many grants, attracting them requires substantial investment in infrastructure and start-up costs; often the only reason for change is access to rare multi-million-dollar facilities and state-ot:.the-art new equipment This makes recruitment packages for star faculty $1 million to more than $2 million. If Texas were to choose not to make. these investments, the opportunity costs of not bringing in such researchers would be millions more. Another issue of importance for UT System, UTSW, and indeed for Texas, is the need for the State to complete the important initiative undertaken in 2005 to provide formula funding for the costs of faculty time expended in the education of clinical residents (GME). Such education costs are distinct from the salaries of the residents and costs of supervising the care residents provide. The adoption of the principle that resident education should be formula-funded was an important achievement of the 79th Legislature. Nevertheless, the formula now funds approximately one quarter of the education costs, per the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. As pressure on other sources of funds continues to increase, State investment is needed to help UTSW maintain its residency programs, some of the largest in the country. State investment is especially needed as sustained growth in medical school enrollment promises that Texas in FY 14-15 will graduate more students than can be absorbed in existing residency programs in the state, as Texas' growing population steadily contributes to an increasing physician shortage- in primary and specialty care, and as evidence continues to show that the single best source of practicing doctors for Texas is an increase in residency positions. In summary, UTSW joins the UT System in supporting statewide funding policies for HRis that provide resources necessary to develop a world-class healthcare and research workforce; that enhance research capacity; that expand the Texas economy through teclmology; and that improve the quality and availability ofhealthcare for all Texans. Objective measures demonstrate that UTSW provides exceptional value to Texas per State dollar received, and UTSW pledges to return the State's investment many times over, while assuring quality education and health services for future generations of Texans. The University of Texas System is governed by a Board of Regents. AGENCY STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT BACKGROUND CHECKS The statutory authority for conducting background checks is Government Code Section 411.094 and Education Code section 51.215. UT Southwestern Human Resources Policy Memorandum 1.020 states: \"Positions shall be designated as security-sensitive if they are senior level administrator positions, or positions with authority for committing the financial resources of the university, or if duties of the position include handling currency, access to a computer, access to a master key, patient care, child-care in a child-care facility, access to or responsibility for pharmaceuticals, other controlled substances or hazardous substances, or the shipping, transporting, possession, receipt or access to any select agent (as defined in 18 U.S.C.

This residency education function is a major part of the primary mission of all Texas medical schools. UTSW shoulders the burden of training the vast majority of residents, in primary and specialty care, in all ofN Texas. Consequently, it has more residents than every other State institution, and thus bears the greatest share of the State's resident costs. Serving the mission of training residents has significant costs, and the primary cost borne by medical schools is that of providing education by faculty. A portion of the costs associated with faculty supervising the care residents provide are paid with some sources of GME funds from Medicare. Other than the State's GME formula, which pays only l/4 of the costs, there are no dedicated funds for residents' education. This strategy helps fund the disproportionate cost UTSW bears in educating the State's largest number of primary care residents, including direct support for 15 residents through payment of resident stipends. It is essential to continue the number and quality of primary care residency programs at UTSW since they are the most important source of primary care doctors in North Texas and statewide.

UT Southwestern is now at a pivotal point for advancing its faculty's discoveries, with their efforts further and uniquely supported by a new University Hospital, scheduled to open in 2014 and specifically designed to support cutting-edge clinical research, and a licensing revenue-funded BioCenter, a state-of-the-art commercial campus facility strategically positioned for the biomedical industry to interact with clinical medicine and academic science to accelerate bench-to-bedside progress. Recent examples of translational research successes at UTSW are: A way to direct the heart's own cells to regenerate to heal injury caused by heart attack and other disease, with drugs already in development by a newly formed biotech company A biochemical pathway and molecule with promise to actually prevent Alzheimer's, with a vaccine already in trials A new drug to control cholesterol already in trials with patients showing reductions of up to 75% for up to 3 months with a single injection. Yet, development of basic discoveries into trans formative patient care therapies at UT Southwestern suffers from lack of funding for the early steps in translational research. State funding of$7.5M per year for the Institute would support the extension of basic discoveries from the lab and seed the earliest steps in translational research for which there are no competitive grant or investor sources of funding, yet are essential for fostering basic discoveries -with tremendous promise tor bettering patient care, lowering healthcare costs, and ROI to the State -into novel patient therapies. EXTERNAL/INTERNAL FACTORS: name: 4.A. Exceptional Item Request Schedule 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Major accomplishments to date and expected over the next two years: DATE: TIME: Excp 2014 One of the largest returns for the state on the investments it makes with limited resources comes from its top research schools; each state research dollar is leveraged as much as 7:1 with external grants brought into Texas by these institutions. Investing in these top programs is as important as investing in STEM initiatives and research at emerging research universities, to drive the development of a skilled workforce and because these programs can have an immediate and dramatic impact on Texas' economic recovery. Furthermore, discoveries made in programs at Texas' top medical research schools and investment in the Institute for Translational Research at UT Southwestern hold enormous promise to dramatically improve patient care and to lower the state's healthcare costs. Year established and funding source prior to receiving special item funding: N/A Formula funding: N/A Non-general of not funding: UT Southwestern's historical core strength in uncovering the genetic and molecular causes of disease has already led to UTSW being recognized as a foremost fundamental research institution. UT Southwestern faculty are poised to have an analogous substantial impact on the bench-to-bedside development of medical breakthroughs, yet without seed funding UT Southwestern cannot capitalize and expand on its faculty's expertise to accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries into novel patient therapies. The cost of not funding the Institute for Translational Research at UT Southwestern will be in the missed opportunities to bring in millions of dollars more in grant funding to Texas, to accelerate the translational research of its renowned faculty, to recruit rising stars in translational research, and to yield breakthrough treatments for our most devastating diseases. 4.A Page 2 of 4 8/20/2012 5:36:38PM Excp 2015 4.A.

The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas does not expect any significant impact on General Revenue Appropriations for patient care due to the Health Care Reform during the 2012-2013 Biennium. Certainly, there will be an impact on the need for additional workforce as the insured population grows over the following years as a result of the Act. Additional medical students and other health care givers will be required, however, substantial increases are not likely until 2014 and beyond, after full implementation of the Reform Act. We do need to consider expanding educational opportunities, especially in Graduate Medical Education, to train a larger health care workforce now in preparation for this influx. Studies show that 85% of the students obtaining medical degrees in the state of Texas stay in Texas to continue their medical practice. Over the past several years The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas has made substantial improvements in the Information Technology systems for the Practice Plan and Hospital. We do not anticipate any significant investment in our Information Technology related to the Health Care Reform Act until 2013 or later after the Act is fully implemented and we have a better understanding of the impact and needs.

This project includes four levels of critical Vivarium and Research space to adequately support UT Southwestern's robust research enterprise. Cost Per Total Gross Square Feet $ 833 Phase 6 Project: includes a research tower and an interstitial courtyard adjacent to the existing Phase 5 Research Tower. A modern, centralized vivarium would allow efficiencies in automation and compliance oversight that would in turn decrease staffing requirements and animal housing costs. This new facility would be designed to incorporate rooms for expensive, shared equipment such as animal irradiators, imaging equipment and specialized testing equipment Without additional vivarium capacity, UTSW will experience a shortage of animal research quarters to support faculty in two to three years.

This residency education function is a major part of the primary mission of all Texas medical schools. UTSW shoulders the burden of training the vast majority of residents, in primary and specialty care, in all ofN Texas. Consequently, it has more residents than every other State institution, and thus bears the greatest share of the State's resident costs. Serving the mission of training residents has significant costs, and the primary cost borne by medical schools is that of providing education by faculty. A portion of the costs associated with faculty supervising the care residents provide are paid with some sources ofGME funds from Medicare. Other than the State's GME formula, which pays only 1/4 of the costs, there are no dedicated funds for residents' education. This strategy helps fund the disproportionate cost UTSW bears in educating the State's largest number of primary care residents, including direct support for IS residents through payment of resident stipends. It is essential to continue the number and quality of primary care residency programs at UTSW since they are the most important source of primary care doctors in North Texas and statewide. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: This item critically supports the statewide goal of decreasing the shortage of primary care doctors and providing quality primary care to the citizens of Texas. UT Southwestern continues to train more primary care doctors than any other State institution in Texas, with 624 residents in primary care programs, compared to 380 for the next highest State institution. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: Over 40% ofUT Southwestern's 1,475 residents are in primary care programs. UT Southwestern intends to continue maintaining the largest and most competitive primary care residency training programs in Texas, in order to continue graduating -150 primary care doctors every year to address the shortage of primary care doctors and provide quality primary care to the citizens ofTexas.

With increasing pressure on other sources of funding and with no other funding dedicated to this purpose, a further reduction in primary care residency program funding would not be replaced. Any futher reduction to UT Southwestern for this Special Item not only would impact the quality of the education received by the largest number of primary care residents among Texas health institutions, but would directly result in a reduction in the number of primary care residents trained. With an existing shortage of primary care doctors practicing in the state, Texas can ill afford to lose any primary care residency positions at any institution across the state. Page2of21 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Special Item: 2 Institute for Nobel/National-Academy Biomedical Research (1) Year Special Item: 2004 (2) Mission of Special Item: The Institute for Nobel/National-Academy Biomedical Research began in 2004, predicated on the fact that Texas' long-term success in biomedical science and biotechnology industry depends on having research leaders at our health institutions who rank among the greatest in the world, and this Institute is extremely effective in facilitating this for Texas' future. The National Academy of Sciences is the \"scientific hall of fame\" and election as a member is the highest honor in the U.S. for a scientist. With 70% of all National Academy members at Texas health institutions at UTSW, and with four of its now five Nobel laureates as active faculty members, UTSW is exclusively positioned in Texas for the Institute for Nobel/National-Academy Biomedical Research. Investigators of Nobel Prize and National Academy caliber conduct cutting-edge research, bring to Texas millions in grants, and attract the best and brightest co-workers. UTSW is working to further leverage the success of our globally-recognized research leaders in order to expand research opportunities, recruit more world-class collaborators, and secure more funds from sources outside of Texas. Special Item funding has been appropriated specifically to: -Provide incentives for these highly sought-after scientists to remain in Texas, -Bring many millions in outside grants to Texas, -Cultivate cutting-edge research and commercializable technologies, -Recruit rising-star scientists mentored by these scientists. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: When the Institute was first funded in 2004, UTSW was home to 4 Nobel Laureates and to 13 of the 16 medical National Academy of Sciences members in Texas. Remarkably, after only 8 years, a star faculty member recruited back from California to UTSW in 2011 with Institute support won the 2011 Nobel Prize, for seminal discoveries made at UTSW in the 1990s. Also since 2004, 6 more UTSW scientists have been elected to the National Academy and I was recruited back, so that now 70% of all members at Texas health institutions are at UTSW. This funding has paid tremendous dividends for Texas in other ways. Since inception, the Institute has had remarkable success in leveraging State investment, with almost 60 highly sought after, rising-star scientists having been successfully recruited to Texas from Harvard, Yale, and elsewhere in order to collaborate with UTSW National Academy members and Nobel laureates. Also since 2004, with Institute support all but one ofUTSW's elite scientists have been retained, although all are constantly recruited. Beyond maintaining vigorous research programs, these individuals are critically important in recruiting the best junior faculty from other leading institution. Finally, UTSW has leveraged Institute State seed research funding into a major economic engine for Texas. In general, UTSW brings in >$7 for every State research $1 spent, based on FYI 1 data, and accordingly, Institute scientists have secured an avg $36M/year in external grants since 2004. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: Page 3 of21 8/20/2012 5 36:44PM Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center When the Institute was assessed in 2006 by external scientific reviewers on behalf ofTHECB, it received the highest possible ratings and accolades such as, \"Every measurable record of academic productivity, performance, and quality has been achieved;\" \"highly successful and indicative of the wisdom of targeting funding based on programmatic quality;\" and \"absolutely a good investment for the state.\" While reduced 26% compared to FYl0-12 appropriated, funding at F\u00a512-13 levels would allow UTSW to commensurately continue to leverage the remarkable success of our globally-recognized research leaders in biomedicine in order to: -recruit more world-class collaborators who in turn attract the best and brightest co-workers (to date, almost 60 highly sought after young scientists have been successfully recruited to Texas, and one lead faculty won a 20 11 Nobel Prize) -yield new effective discoveries and cultivate commercializable technologies for our most common, chronic and devastating diseases, and -bring even more tens of millions per year in outside sources of funds into Texas' economy ($36M/year since 2004). Ultimately, Nobel Prize and National Academy caliber faculty leaders enable remarkable research productivity at UTSW. In FY11, faculty were responsible for $423M in total research expenditures, an increase of 20% in just the last 5 years. These are research dollars that are spent in Texas and that generate enormous job growth and total economic impact. {4) Funding Source Prior to Receiving Special Item Funding: Not Applicable (5) Formula Funding: N/A (6) Non-general Revenue Sources of Funding: 2012 $39,256,483 Federal Funds $12,981,383 Private Funds 2013 $39,500,000 Federal Funds $13,000,000 Private Funds 2014 $39,500,000 Federal Funds $13,000,000 Private Funds 2015 $39,500,000 Federal Funds $13,000,000 Private Funds (7) Consequences of Not Funding: Page 4 of2l 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version I Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Without research Special Item funding to support these elite research leaders, UT Southwestern and Texas are highly vulnerable to their recruitment by states interested in developing their commercial medical business base. The loss of even one more National Academy member in the next two years would have a corresponding impact on technical talent and millions in outside grant funding brought to Texas. Moreover, with increasingly limited external grant funding sources, such as the NIH, attracting the best becomes even more critical for growing the research base in Texas, while competition becomes even more fierce, and institutions without independent sources will have an even harder time recruiting and retaining star researchers. Funding to the Institute positions Texas well to be able to offer research support to attract and retain either current National Academy members or rising-star investigators who will collaborate with them. No other program in Texas can specifically target such a number of faculty of this recognized caliber, to ensure they remain in Texas, to further propel their research with the resources to build teams of collaborators, and to mentor the next generation of medical-science leaders in Texas. Such State investment in this caliber of scientists is essential for Texas to one day have a medical school that ranks in the top 10 in the nation, so that Texas' best students need not leave the state to attend a top school. Page5of21 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version I Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Special Item: 3 Institute for Innovations in Medical Technology (1) Year Special Item: 2002 (2) Mission of Special Item: The mission of this Institute for Innovations in Medical Technology (IIMT) is to cultivate cutting-edge research with potential to develop into commercializable technologies, and to help transition them from discovery to patient care. This is being accomplished by developing and maintaining a rare collection of specialized \"Core\" Laboratory facilities that support such research affordably and efficiently, retaining an extraordinary concentration of innovative biomedical scientists on our faculty and recruiting rising star faculty to Texas, bringing millions in federal and private grants to Texas, and maintaining enhanced infrastructure and expert staff to facilitate commercialization and to attract vital biotechnology partners to North Texas. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: The Institute has provided critical infrastructure for early-stage research to identify drug targets and other treatments. To achieve its chief goal oftransitioning technologies to patient care, IIMT to date has created 12 Core Labs, a rare collection of facilities providing the latest equipment and expertise necessary to support faculty research. Core Labs offer research services at marginal cost for use by all investigators, and by commercial partners housed in our new BioCenter, an incubator financed with tech transfer revenue. The cost to set up the Cores in individual labs or start-up companies would be prohibitive, but by making them widely available on a subsidized basis, many projects can tap into state-of-the-art technologies to make scientific breakthroughs. Access to the Cores has not only aided scientific discovery, it has made hundreds ofUTSW researchers more competitive for grants, resulting in $180 million brought to Texas since FY04. In addition, UTSW's Technology Development office has expanded. To date, 15 companies have been formed, raising >$1.6 billion in financing; 391 discoveries have been licensed for development; and $113 million in revenues has been generated. Most recently, three new companies were formed based on faculty research, raising in aggregate more than $40 million: Spectral MD, Peloton Therapeutics, and Vitruvian BioMedical, developing devices for long-term bed-ridden patients and drugs tor cancer and Alzheimer's Disease, respectively. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: With the Core Labs, North Texas is positioned to meet the needs of future biotech firms seeking to locate where state-of-the-art facilities are available. At UTSW in FYlO and 11 alone, 201 patents were filed, 59 patents were issued, and $22 million in licensing revenue was received. More than 15 products are in clinical trials or pre-clinical toxicology studies. On this basis and track record, the Institute at UTSW anticipates launching additional biotechnology companies in Dallas over the next two years. It is also expected that the Institute will continue to support research with its unique Core facilities, and to support technology transfer, yet support for this remarkably successful Institute will be commensurate with the reduced funds available.Research support available will continue to make hundreds ofUT Southwestern investigators more competitive for grant funding, resulting in millions more in external funding coming to Texas. Such external funding not only enhances economic development in the short term by ftmding salaries and supplies for researchers, it also enhances economic development in the long term through scientific discoveries that form the basis for the high-tech industry. Together, research and technology transfer support will lead to groundbreaking development of findings, subsequent patents filing, and ultimately commercializable technologies that will improve treatments for patients in Texas and the world.

Having access to the Core Labs has not only aided scientific discovery, it has made hundreds ofUTSW researchers more competitive for grants, resulting in $36M in funds brought to Texas in FY10-ll. On the whole, UTSW has the opportunity to create a significant commercialization center in Dallas. The BioCenter-an incubator to house industry partners and foster collaborations with UTSW faculty-holds promise for creating a critical mass for a biotech industry in Nth Texas. The Core Labs continue to identify and offer leading technologies to UTSW researchers and partners. Without continued funding, not only will research that is already identifying drug candidates and other treatments be further impaired, but the promise of a biotech industry in N Texas becomes unfeasible. Page 7 of21 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Special Item: 4 Metroplex Comprehensive Medical Imaging Center (1) Year Special Item: 2006 (2) Mission of Special Item: Modem imaging techniques permit exquisite views of both structure and function-from views of every atom in a protein molecule to functional magnetic resonance images of the neural activities that underlie complex behaviors in humans. With such amazing opportunities, the Imaging Center's scientists and doctors are engaged in both the development of imaging technologies and their exploitation to understand and treat disease. The goals of the Center are to: -Provide the only imaging center of its kind in the Southwest, allowing UT Southwestern researchers and collaborators to investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease. -Advance the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of numerous debilitating diseases through the development and use of advanced medical imaging. -Retain highly sought-after basic and clinical researchers and recruit rising star faculty to Texas. -Bring millions in federal and private grants to Texas. To achieve these goals, the Center at UT Southwestern encompasses a broad spectrum of imaging activities. The Advanced Imaging Research Center-established in collaboration with UT Dallas and UT Arlington-houses necessary state-of-the-art instruments and a variety of other imaging capabilities are encompassed in Core Labs. Ultimately, the unprecedented images and measurements of healthy and diseased tissue that modern imaging provides are crucial to developing more effective treatments for the sick and, eventually, preventive care to the well. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: Funding for the Center has accelerated existing research, enabled recruitment of more world-class faculty in other imaging-related fields, and made available to all faculty and collaborators on a per-use basis world-class imaging facilities. As a result, there is no other center in Texas and arguably in the U.S. that can match the combination of basic science strengths, clinicians seeking new insights into metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric and other diseases, and state-of-the-art equipment. The Center's equipment and corresponding imaging expertise have stimulated funding on all three UT campuses in North Texas (UTSW, UTD, and UTA) and catalyzed many collaborative research and educational programs. One of the first CPRIT multi-investigator grants to develop novel cancer imaging technologies was awarded to 8 Center faculty with 2 scientists each from Texas A&M and MD Anderson. This substantial award was made possible only by the availability of the Center's unique imaging equipment and faculty expertise not found elsewhere in Texas. The Green Fellows program which brings 20 ofUTD's brightest undergraduate science/engineering students to UTSW each spring semester for a concentrated research effort continues to thrive. New funding in the imaging sciences has steadily increased since the Center was established, totaling $51M in FYl0-11. Center faculty have secured significant funds from NIH (a large-scale center grant, a collaboration with Duke, plus many individual awards). (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: Page 8 of21 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center No other Imaging Center in Texas and arguably in the U.S. can match the combination of basic science strengths, clinicians seeking new insights into metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, and other diseases, and state-of-the-art equipment. The Center includes research-dedicated 3T and 7T human and animal MRis, analytical NMR and small animal PET systems, optical imaging, and in-house radiochemistry and imaging agent development. The uncommon close proximity of the human and animal research labs to UTSW's clinical facilities aids progress. Visitors often remark on the uniqueness and breadth of Center capabilities. Advanced imaging is critical to the future of Texas, since the far-reaching impact of the new techniques means that only institutions with world-class imaging facilities and expertise will claim top-tier status in medical research. In the next two years, the Center plans to install a cyclotron to produce PET imaging isotopes that will catalyze development of novel metabolic tracers for improved imaging of cancer, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, and diseases of the aging brain such as Alzheimer's. A new graduate program in Biomedical & Molecular Imaging will be available to students at the three North Texas UT campuses beginning September 2013. These efforts will enable UTSW to improve diagnosis and treatment for patients throughout Texas, to leverage State investment to bring in more millions in grants, and to advance in its quest to claim Top 10 status.

Retention and recruitment of world-class faculty to continue to position Texas as a leader in imaging science demands such infrastructure. Without support, the facility could not be maintained, world-class faculty could not be retained and rising stars could not be recruited. Funding is vital for economic development, production of a highly-trained workforce to develop imaging technologies in Texas, and research collaboration among the three North Texas UT institutions. The 26% reduction to research Special Items in FY12-13 already has hindered vital support for this Center. The opportunity cost of not funding or further reductions for this facility and this expertise would be in the loss of scientific discovery and hundreds of millions in future external grant funding. Funding enables UTSW to improve diagnosis and treatment for patients throughout Texas, to leverage State investment to bring in even more millions in grants, and to advance in its quest to soon claim Texas' first Top 10 university ranking. Page 10 of21 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Special Item: 5 (1) Year Special Item: (2) Mission of Special Item: Regional Burn Care Center 1978 Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center The Regional Burn Center's mission is to provide excellent comprehensive acute burn, as well as rehabilitative care and education, and banked organs and tissues tor clinical transplant for adult and pediatric patients statewide. Banked skin was even utilized to save lives in Washington DC in the aftermath of the 9-11 Pentagon disaster. The Center is the only American Burn Association (ABA) and American College of Surgeons (ACS) verified Burn Center in North Texas, providing a vital designated resource for disaster management of burn trauma. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: The center has forged significant improvements in its education, resuscitation, research and prevention programs, and in its patient care in burn trauma medicine. Caring for over 600 burn patients annually (644 in 20 12), a third of whom are children, the Center has developed improvements in burn care that have reduced the average in-hospital length of stay from 1. 7 days to under 1 day per percent body area burned since 1990. In addition, the average burn survival rate is approximately 90% for burns covering SO% of the body (up from 20% in 1970). These improvements are due to many factors, most significantly developments supported by State appropriations. Advancements in resuscitation, surgical intervention, metabolic support, and the use of banked skin to name a few have all been important in the improved outcomes experienced in our Burn Center. Equally important, the center serves as a regional and statewide resource for teaching and referral for the latest techniques in burn care and prevention. Furthermore, leveraging of funding for this program has resulted in national recognition and a coveted burn center grant from the NIH. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: The center combines emergency care, in-hospital treatment of acute pediatric and adult burns, as well as reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation to meet UTSW's mission to provide the best comprehensive patient care. With its renowned clinical research, the Center also serves to advance the goals of medical care, improved patient survival and morbidity. The banking of human skin has added greatly to the pursuit and realizations of this goal. Technological developments for skin have lead to the extension of other bankable tissue needs for a wide variety of medical problems in orthopedic, neuro, and oral surgery, ophthalmologic and trauma patients. In addition, every year residents and medical students as well as professional health students, faculty and other advanced personnel are trained in clinical and rehabilitative burn treatment and in the use of homologous tissue and transplants.

State funding has furthered the relationship between care delivery, teaching, and innovative research, allowing these programs to contribute to medical care statewide. Reduction in funding would seriously hinder these efforts.

The condition causes excruciating pain, organ damage, and premature death in children and adults. There is a pressing need to better understand the biology of the disease and to translate scientific discovery into better treatments and eventually a cure. UT Southwestern's Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center has made dramatic progress in clinical research which has brought improved treatments and set the stage for future scientific discoveries. With continuing added support from this State Special Item, UT Southwestern's mission is to maintain and build upon its world class Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center focused on the following: research leading to curative treatments, development and refinement of new and improved therapies to control disease complications, and marked expansion of treatment clinics for children and adults in order to improve the length and quality oflife. The Center has been and plans to continue to be recognized as one of the world's best. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: Tremendous progress has been made at UTSW in fundamental research to find new techniques to repair the genetic mutations involved in sickle cell. UTSW researchers are internationally known for their seminal study, the Dallas Newborn Cohort, describing outcomes of the world's largest group of children with sickle cell disease diagnosed at birth since 1983 and followed continually in UTSW' s clinics and hospitals. The complications, treatments, and successful outcomes of these patients have been described in two key scientific publications in 2004 and 2010 that are among the most highly cited in the world. Over 100 publications in major scientific journals have resulted from the Center's research, focused on new treatments for the disease, prediction of disease severity, and studying mechanisms of stroke, a common complication in affected children, and how best to diagnose it and even prevent it. This work includes unique methods to study oxygen levels in the brain and blood of affected children. Such advances have resulted in UTSW's selection to lead an elite international research initiative endorsed by the United Nations and to serve as co-chair on an NIH panel to develop sickle cell treatment guidelines to be used by primary care physicians. The Center continues to expand its clinics and a major new initiative to care for and conduct research involving adult patients throughout North Texas. The number of pediatric and adult patients now followed in the Center numbers 1,000. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: In 2008, the prior NIH-designated Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers were replaced by a smaller Basic and Translational Research Program through a competitive grant process, with UT Southwestern being one of only five of the original comprehensive sickle cell center institutions chosen in this successor program. UT Southwestern is also participating in six other NIH-supported multi-center clinical research studies and has been a leader in each of them. A major program accomplishment has been the recent recruitment of a young sickle cell specialist (one of few in the nation) who will focus full time on patient care and research in both children and adults. Over 20 research projects are currently being conducted in the Center, with plans to expand fundamental research as well, aimed at better understand the sickling process and to eventually employ genetic testing and treatment to cure this debilitating disorder.

The condition causes severe pain, diminished IQ, severe organ damage (especially involving lungs, kidneys, and heart) and early death (often in young adulthood). Despite dramatic progress in recent years, it remains a disabling condition. All out effort is needed to fmd a cure. A reduction in State support will seriously hinder the Center's continued efforts to serve as an international Center of Excellence to mount its broad attack on sickle cell disease, ranging from basic molecular genetics research to the development and refinement of new therapies. Moreover, State funding is essential for UT Southwestern to remain well positioned nationally and internationally to receive additional external support and continue its track record in groundbreaking discoveries and successful efforts to offer specialized care for these patients. Page 14 of21 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Special Item: 7 Science Teacher Access to Resources at UT Southwestern (STARS) (1) Year Special Item: 1994 (2) Mission of Special Item: The STARS program is dedicated to maintaining a robust educational partnership between UTSW and secondary teachers, and providing programs for bright secondary school students. STARS has two goals: to improve science education in the North Texas area and beyond, and to increase the interest and enthusiasm among bright secondary school students to pursue careers in STEM fields, especially as they impact the future of biomedicine. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: STARS has developed free educational outreach and professional development services for science teachers, as well as paid summer research and other opportunities for secondary school students. Since its inception, STARS has offered services to over 7800 teachers from 4900 schools. An estimated 39,000 students have been impacted by teacher and direct student participation. In the last two years there has been spectacular growth, with teacher participation increasing 64%, and student participation increasing 80%. Several core programs have been staples in the STARS repertoire for many years. These include a Basic Science Symposium and In-services program, Summer Research Programs for students and teachers, and customized Medical Center Tours. New programs in the past few years include an Exploring Post for secondary school students to explore careers in biomedicine, annual Women in Science and Medicine workshops, and UTSW hosting annual district science and engineering fairs for the Dallas lSD and Uplift Education (a charter district serving a disadvantaged minority student population at several Dallas area sites). In the past several years l 00% of students in the Summer Research Program have graduated from high school and gone on to prepare for careers in health-and science-related fields. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: Demand of student and teachers for more STARS activities is higher than ever. 546 students applied in 2012 for the Summer Research Program, yet we could only accept 41. We have recently been successful in obtaining funds from resource-rich schools and districts to support their students in summer research, but it is proving more difficult to fund students from more needy backgrounds in Dallas and neighboring urban public school districts, such as Mesquite, Arlington and Ft. Worth. Registration at many of the science symposia must be capped at 250 due to lack of resources. There is demand to increase teacher training lab exercises from only biology into chemistry and physics. Continued funding will allow STARS to maintain current extensive programs. New initiatives include websites to distribute resources to teachers, including original video animations of basic concepts of biology, already sustaining 30,000 downloads, and free virtual instruments (with lab activities) on the web such as the virtual microscope and spectrophotometer. By developing scientifically strong future students to come to UTSW from across Texas, STARS promotes a stronger academic population that in turn helps to keep UTSW in top standing among medical institutions nationwide. Strong support from the state allows us to continue to support the vast growth and high demand of all STARS initiatives and, in particular, maintain summer research positions for the brightest and most underserved students.

It has allowed the leveraging of new and expanded programs with external grants. One example is a 5-year grant, expiring in 2012, to train teachers and students from lowest-performing Dallas ISD schools, as well as the building of the uniquely effective Science Suitcases (portable demonstrations of scientific principles) and the virtual instruments described above, which have proven critical aids for teaching in low-income schools where real instruments are too expensive to purchase and maintain. STARS has shown that students enrolled in this program have increased their biology class final grades by an average of over 8 points, compared to matched students not participating (from 75% to 83%, for example). Continued State funding will allow STARS to expand such programs to include even more teachers and students. Without funding, local science educators and UTSW faculty would lose the opportunity and inherent potential in partnering in the educational process of science. Much knowledge would not be shared and would never serve to spark the interest of our future scientists who are currently secondary school students. State funds are more important than ever to maintain core STARS programming. With the current economic climate, many public, private and industrial outreach opportunities on which STARS has depended for expansion of core prograrnrning have contracted or disappeared. Page 16 of21 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Special Item: 8 (1) Year Special Item: (2) Mission of Special Item: Institutional Enhancement 2000 Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System ofTexas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Enhancement funding plays a significant role in fmancing the core missions of all Health Related Institutions by providing a base level of funding for services and programs. Institutional Enhancement funding helps support leading-edge and innovative programs in graduate research education not otherwise supported by formula funding. The purpose of Institutional Enhancement at UT Southwestern is to help provide the highest quality education in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease to our medical students. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: Institutional Enhancement support has contributed to maintaining the highest standard of excellence in myriad clinical programs. In the recently-released 2012-13 U.S. News & World Report's America's Best Hospitals, UT Southwestern Medical Center is nationally ranked or recognized in 12 specialty-care areas,. This makes UT Southwestern one of two highest ranking health care providers in North Texas, and among the top 5 ranked hospitals in Texas In addition, a new Masters of Clinical Science degree program has been implemented for M.D. students who wish to increase their knowledge of clinical research, in order to help more quickly translate basic research into more effective patient therapies. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: UT Southwestern will continue to expand and revamp existing clinical programs and develop new clinical programs to sustain the quality of our medical education. Major objectives for the school are the integration and expansion of programs in the basic and clinical neurosciences, including a planned Neurosciences Institute focused on the ever-increasing cognitive diseases of the aging brain, to occupy former university hospital facilities when our new hospital opens in 2014. UT Southwestern will also continue growing its programs in clinical investigation, including epidemiology, Biostatistics, and clinical trials along with the continued development of new programs in international health. While the total extent and costs of these programs continues to be defined, student participation will require additional State support.

An important component of its medical education is accomplished for -450 students in the third and fourth years of medical school when they rotate through the many clinical rotations offered. Medical students participate first hand in patient management, learning how to apply the information they learned in the first two years of medical school, and acquiring new knowledge. The excellence of these clinical programs is one of the reasons UTSW is highly regarded as a medical school, and is sought after by the most qualified medical school applicants from across Texas and beyond. In the past, programs such as oncology and clinical epidemiology have been targets for development to support excellence in medical education. UTSW must remain constantly vigilant to identify new clinical programs that must be developed or expanded to maintain our cutting-edge medical education. However, as all funding sources contract, established primary care programs that are equally essential to medical education, such as Family Practice and Internal Medicine, are now also supported with these funds. Any reduction would thus result in severe deterioration of myriad clinical programs, lowering the standard of excellence and quality of our medical teaching programs, and result in declines in the level of services that we have been able to deliver to students. Page 18 of21 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version I Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Special Item: 9 Center for Obesity, Diabetes, and Metabolism Research (1) Year Special Item: 2008 (2) Mission of Special Item: Since it was founded in 2007, the interdisciplinary Center for Obesity, Diabetes and Metabolism Research has become widely recognized as the top obesity center in the world and uniquely positioned to tackle a medical crisis that costs Texas $10 billion annually and continues to spiral out of control. The trends in obesity and related diseases are frightening, with the percent of overweight Texans increasing from 43% to 63% in just 15 years. What was once unheard of-Type II diabetes occurring in children-is now common, and obesity dramatically increases not only the risk of diabetes but also heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, high blood pressure, respiratory problems and other chronic conditions. UT Southwestern's Obesity Center is committed to developing novel treatments for the prevention and treatment of obesity, to continued outreach to thousands of Dallas ISD elementary students to provide early intervention and an effective model for Texas, and to ensuring significant benefit to Texas from millions in external grant funding secured and eventual cost savings and revenue possible from breakthrough treatments. (3) (a) Major Accomplishments to Date: In the short time since it was funded, dozens of seminal discoveries by Center researchers have changed the way we think about how people become obese, created new paradigms for the development of treatments, and appeared in 200 news outlets worldwide. Below are just 2 examples of over 65 pivotal discoveries: -A novel approach to control Type I Diabetes without insulin for weeks at a time was discovered by a National Academy member. This treatment is now in human trials and has received national acclaim. If effective, it will both greatly enhance quality of life and save Texans millions per year. -Two Nobelists discovered how a hormone tells the brain to be hungry, explaining why some people need more will power than others to remain thin. Drugs to block the mechanism are being pursued by drug companies to effectively curb hunger. In the same way that the discovery of the mechanism behind cholesterol control at UTSW led to statin drugs such as Lipitor, this discovery holds promise as an effective appetite suppressant that can change the course of the obesity epidemic. Center researchers have also secured a remarkable $154 million in external research funds brought to Texas since 2008. Finally, UTSW has also expanded obesity prevention outreach to children. Using a new interactive program, 223 medical and nutrition students visited >60 schools in Dallas ISD, reaching> 7,500 elementary students. (3) (b) Major Accomplishments Expected During the Next 2 Years: Page 19 of21 8/20/2012 5:36:44PM Schedule 9: Special Item Information 83rd Regular Session, Agency Submission, Version 1 Automated Budget and Evaluation System of Texas (ABEST) 729 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center UT Southwestern's Center for Obesity, Diabetes, and Metabolism Research is uniquely positioned, compared to all other medical centers in the country, to tackle this national crisis that promises to cost Texas alone billions per year. With sufficient support, the preeminent team assembled at UTSW can continue its astounding pace of discovery and build on the great strides already made in understanding the fundamental causes and developing treatments. More groundbreaking advances and effective treatments can be expected from continuing research on other recent pivotal findings, including: -Landmark discovery of estrogen's role in metabolism, with promise for a novel way to control weight in postmenopausal women that avoids known risks such as breast cancer and stroke from conventional hormone replacement therapies, -Demonstrated for the first time that the heart can regulate energy balance throughout the body, opening up an entirely novel area of investigation that can lead to more effective treatments for obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The Center also expects to remain highly successful at leveraging State Special Item funds, capitalizing on the remarkable $154 million in outside grants secured since 2008. Additional support would help seed more research from this stellar large team, promising to reduce obesity and its costs and bring even more outside grant dollars into Texas' economy.

Unless it is halted, the epidemic of obesity and its related diseaSes will cost Texas hundreds of billions of dollars in the future, and the preeminent team assembled at UT Southwestern is already making great strides in understanding the fundamental causes and developing highly-effective interventions. This funding has facilitated the recmitrnent and retainment of some of the most prestigious obesity and metabolism experts in the world. Furthermore, the research labs supported by this funding will leverage the funding many-fold in the future. Continuing the stature of this Center as one of world's preeminent research centers in this field will take continued seed funding that this Special Item provides. Not funding this Center would not only cost the state many millions of dollars in grant funding in the near term, it will put at risk a valuable Texas resource. Most importantly, the opportunity cost of not realizing future discoveries may cost the State billions of dollars per year in the future that might otherwise be saved from treatments resulting from Center research.
