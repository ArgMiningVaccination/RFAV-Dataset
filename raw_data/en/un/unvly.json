People have been using plants as medicine for as long as humans have walked the earth. While there's a prescription drug for just about everything nowadays, plants have a lot to offer if you prefer a more natural approach to your health care. You can take medicinal plants and herbs in pill form, cook with them, or apply them to your skin to help treat various conditions. Just be sure to talk to your doctor before starting any new supplements or diet regimen, and make sure you buy your plant-based supplements from reputable stores and manufacturers. Steps Taking Plant-Based Supplements - 1Boost your immune system with echinacea. Echinacea is commonly believed to prevent or treat colds, flu, and upper respiratory infections. If you're already sick, taking a supplement or sipping on echinacea tea can shorten the duration of your illness. Just keep in mind that it's not a cure-all and it's still important to get enough rest and eat nutritious foods to overcome your illness. [[1]](#_note-1)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - Do not take echinacea if you are allergic to plants in the daisy family (like ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, and daisies). - Echinacea is available in a variety of forms, including capsules, tinctures, and teas. - Most echinacea supplements should be taken 3 times daily, and the dosage varies based on the form of the supplement (e.g., .25-1.25 mL of liquid extract per dose, or 1-2 mL of the tincture).

This plant can improve your memory and help prevent dementia and other brain disorders. You can take ginkgo in pill form or drink ginkgo tea. Take anywhere from 120 mg to 160 mg per day, starting at 120 mg and working your way up if you feel the need.

Milk thistle can help ease inflammation of the liver and promote cellular repair. However, studies are mixed as to how effective it is in treating viral or alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Drink milk thistle tea (up to 3 cups per day) or take it as a supplement. The recommended dosage for treating liver disease is 200 to 400 mg per day. [[4]](#_note-4)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - Potential side effects that make it a less-enticing treatment option for liver conditions include nausea, diarrhea, skin reactions, rhinoconjunctivitis, impotence, headaches, insomnia, and anaphylaxis.

Psyllium husk is a form of fiber made from the seeds of the blond plantain plant (plantago ovata).

[[6]](#_note-6)X Research source - Do not take St. John's Wort if you are taking antidepressants because this could lead to a potentially life-threatening condition called \"serotonin syndrome.\" - St. John's Wort can affect the efficacy of birth control pills, certain HIV drugs (like indinavir), some cancer medications (like irinotecan), as well as Oxycodone (pain killer), Digoxin (heart medication), and warfarin (anticoagulant).
