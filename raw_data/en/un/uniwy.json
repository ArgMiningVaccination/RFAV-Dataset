If you test positive, most treatments for COVID must start within 5 days of feeling sick. Glossary Select an entry below to view definition Antigen self-tests, sometimes called a \"rapid test\" or \"home test,\" detect virus proteins in the body. Antigen self-tests use saliva and nasal swab samples. Results take 15-30 minutes. Certain groups of people are considered high risk and are more likely to get seriously ill from COVID-19. People over 60, unvaccinated people, people with underlying health issues, and pregnant people may be at higher risk. People who are at high risk should talk to their health provider right away if they test positive as treatment is most effective when started early. Isolation means staying separate from all people who don't have COVID-19, even within your home. Molecular tests detect if COVID-19 genetic material is in the body. These tests are done on samples collected via a nasal swab (from the nose). These tests include PCR and TMA. Quarantine means staying at home with no visitors, away from people outside your home. Do not go to work, school, or public areas. If possible, stay away from people in your household who are at high risk for COVID-19 (unvaccinated, older people, or those with medical conditions). Testing that is repeated at different points in time is referred to as serial testing. Some self-tests are designed to be used in a series 24 to 48 hours apart. Serial testing may be more likely to detect infection among close contacts of a COVID-19 case than testing done at a single point in time. Guidance - If you have signs or symptoms of COVID-19 get tested as early as possible regardless of vaccination status. Do not go to a hospital emergency room or urgent care center to be tested. - If you are exposed to someone who has COVID-19 (within 6 feet of the person for 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) seek testing 5 days after exposure regardless of vaccination status. If symptoms develop, do not wait 5 days and get tested immediately, or consider retesting if you have already been tested. [See the Isolation & Quarantine page](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/covid-19/care/quarantine.aspx)for detailed guidance. - If asked to by your school, workplace, healthcare provider, state, or local health department. - After travel all travelers should get tested regardless of vaccination status if travel involved situations with greater risk of exposure such as being in crowded places while not wearing a well-fitting mask.
