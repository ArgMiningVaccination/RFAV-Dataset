Sanguinaria Canadensis, commonly known as bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the poppy family (Papaveraceae) and is known for its distinctive white flowers that bloom in early spring. The name \"bloodroot\" comes from the reddish-orange sap that is produced when the stem or root is broken. This sap has been used historically by Native American tribes for various purposes, including as a dye and as a traditional medicine for treating a variety of ailments. However, it is important to note that the sap can be toxic if ingested in large quantities and can cause skin irritation if it comes into contact with the skin.
