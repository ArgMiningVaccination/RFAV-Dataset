We have developed a document that affirms the healing power of language for Aboriginal people and for the people in Canada. We have accomplished this together. This important framework sets us on a path of hope where the Aboriginal languages, once stilled, can now flourish. This document marks a turning point in the life and identity of Aboriginal peoples: it affirms that revitalizing our languages will brighten the hearts of our Elders, ignite the imaginations of our children, and help a new generation find its way to a full, responsible and healthful life once more. We, the Elders who consulted in the development of the Western Canadian Protocol Aboriginal Languages Curriculum Framework , express our gratitude to you and the Ministers for the unfailing support of this work. You stand in the company of our Ancestors where traditional laws and teachings for a wholesome and enduring community life will be heard in the voices of children and seen in their morning faces; yes, even in our time! We ask that you do not stop here. We ask that you work hard to entrench this language curriculum framework in legislation, in policy and in schools. We ask that you accept the responsibility of this document in the spirit in which it was prepared \u2014that of building a bridge of hope between the home and the school. This will mean mounting an awareness campaign, designing a strategy to make the teaching of Aboriginal languages mandatory, establishing language research centres, and teaching teachersAboriginal languages. This will mean working with Aboriginal communities as they use this document to design language-specific guides, programs and materials. This framework also means a time for celebration! For it now seems to us that together we may take out children by the hand to help them find their way to a life of promise, a life of hope. We invite you toshare in our joy!

Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000PREFACE The Common Curriculum Framework for Aboriginal Language and Culture Programs , Kindergarten to Grade 12: Western Canadian Protocol for Collaboration in Basic Education (hereafter called the Framework ) is intended to be a support document for schools or regions within the Western provinces and the territories wishing to develop curricula, learning resources or strategies dealing with Aboriginal languages. It is a framework that reflects the universalvalues and beliefs inherent in Aboriginal cultures. The outcomes provided are to be interpreted and specified by local developers based on the strength of their language, the availability of cultural resources and the expressed language goals of their community. ABORIGINAL EDUCATION INWESTERN AND NORTHERN CANADA: A HISTORICAL CONTEXTThroughout the first half of the twentieth century, federally funded schools, including many mission residential schools in remote areas,were established to provide Aboriginal students with a Western education. By the 1960s, pedagogical issues in Aboriginal education were beginning to be recognized, primarily by the federally administered schools. As more and more Aboriginal status and non-status students enrolled in provincial schools, and as their unique needs came to be acknowledged, the provincial and territorial ministries began to create policies and support programs. Aboriginal language programs were a part of this response, as was the integration of Aboriginal cultural content into mainstream curricula. Early initiatives were tentative and underdeveloped, but with experience and the involvement of Aboriginal people, the programs andpolicies supporting Aboriginal education in the provincial and territorial schools have evolved and continue to evolve positively. Although some provinces and territories have provincial guidelines for language curricula, local curriculum development is the backbone ofprovincial and territorial efforts in Aboriginal language education. Programs are initiated and developed by jurisdictions to meet local needs, and they may require approval by the ministries. In the majority of cases, the programs are designed and implemented as second language courses, receiving the resources and support consistent withsuch programs. In rare exceptions, bilingual or immersion programs are established, usually in schools where the majority of students speak an Aboriginal language as their first language. Largely, in the remote or \"frontier\" schools, the programs are focused on bridging students into instruction in English by the middle years (Burnaby, 1996). A broader and more consistent policy in the provincial and territorial schools has been to encourage the integration of Aboriginal cultural content into subject areas such as social studies, physical education, science and the arts. The aim has been to increase awareness and2 / Preface Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12appreciation of the Aboriginal cultures in the non-Aboriginal population, and also to provide Aboriginal students with content that is more responsive to their needs. To date, British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories have developed Native Studies curricula, programs and learning resources to supportAboriginal cultures. In all the Western provinces and the territories, integration of Aboriginal content across all curricula is encouraged as a means of including the Aboriginal perspectives. These efforts notwithstanding, the number of fluent Aboriginal language speakers has continued to decline. Aboriginal Elders and leaders are voicing concerns about the problems faced by new generations of young people without identity in either Aboriginal or mainstream culture (Burnaby, 1996; Krausse, 1996; Crawford, 1995; Mackay and Myles, of First Nations, 1990). DEVELOPMENT OF THE FRAMEWORKThe Western Canadian Protocol for Collaboration in Basic Education, Kindergarten to Grade 12 was signed in December of 1993 by the ministers of education from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories. Common curriculum frameworks in subject areas such as science,mathematics and English language arts have been and are continuing to be developed through the agreement. This document, The Common Curriculum Framework for Aboriginal Language and Culture Programs, Kindergarten to Grade 12 , is another achievement in this collaborative effort. The Framework had its inception in 1996, when an Aboriginal Languages Working Group of the WCP /G85 put forward a proposal for a project that would directly address the pressing needs of Aboriginal language education: The preservation and enhancement of Aboriginal languages is a matter of national pride and honour. Language retention is also critical to the ongoing existence of the distinct cultures of Aboriginal peoples. In many areas of Western Canada,Aboriginal languages are in danger of being lost. Unlike other languages, the Aboriginal languages cannot be revitalized or supported in other countries. The source of traditional knowledge and teaching is dying with the Elders. These languages belong in Canada. It is imperative that immediate action be taken. /G86 /G85The Western Canadian Protocol Working Group consisted of the principal coordinators of Aboriginal programs in their respective provinces or territories. Participants are listed in the Acknowledgements section of this document. /G86Western Canadian Protocol for Collaboration in Basic Education: Aboriginal Languages Project Proposal (1996, p. 1).Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Preface / 3 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000The Keepers of Knowledge in the oral tradition are the Elders.It was proposed that a framework be designed that would \"support community based [Aboriginal] language revitalization and enhancement. \" It would contain generic language-based outcomes that reflect the \"universal values and beliefs inherent in Aboriginal cultures.\"/G87 The Framework was developed from three primary sources. In the Aboriginal custom it is the oral tradition rather than documentation to which people turn when seeking direction or validation. The Keepers of Knowledge in the oral tradition are the Elders, and so it was fromthem that initial guidance was sought. Next, Aboriginal teachers and linguists were approached for their technical expertise, as well as their cultural knowledge and experience. Finally, a literature review was undertaken to survey recent thinking in Aboriginal language and education. There was a consistency in all of the above sources, which made identification of a set of foundational premises regarding Aboriginal language education a relatively simple task. However, the transformation of those premises into learning benchmarks severely tested the established boundaries of formal language education. The fact that, in many instances, Aboriginal language use is not strong inthe environment of the students presented its own curricular challenge, but the more crucial challenge lay in developing outcomes that would capture the promise the languages and cultures carry in creating identity and self-confidence in Aboriginal students. The collaborative process used in developing the Framework , though difficult, was key to moving beyond existing frameworks. This Framework must be viewed as part of a journey \u2014it is not the beginning; nor is it the end. It represents the sentiments and intuitions of many Aboriginal people. It is the hope of the Aboriginal LanguagesWorking Group that the Framework will be a valuable guide to curriculum developers, teachers and communities in their language education efforts. USE AND RESPECT FOR CULTURAL KNOWLEDGEThe quotations in the following section illustrate the vast wisdom of Aboriginal Elders as \"Keepers of Knowledge \" and as educators within a traditional system of learning. The Aboriginal Language Working Group acknowledges the necessity of guidance from the Elders if this Framework is truly to reflect Aboriginal perspective. Each community wishing to establish a culture and language program must turn to its own Elders for guidance. It is only with Elder support that Aboriginal language and culture programs can succeed in achieving the goal oflanguage revitalization. /G87 op. cit.4 / Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Voices of the Elders / 5 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000VOICES OF THE ELDERS The wisdom of the Elders is central to cultural learning according to Aboriginal perspective. Elders are the \"Keepers of Knowledge, \" and it is their guidance that Aboriginal people seek as they strive for balance in their relationships with the Creator, the natural world, other people and themselves. It is to the Elders that the WCP Working Group turned when seeking guidance on issues of language retention and revitalization, and cultural learning. The following Elders ' comments are excerpted from the many oral and written sources that informed the development of the Framework . LAWS OF RELATIONSHIPSAboriginal cultures share a belief that people must live in respectful, harmonious relationships with nature, with one another and withthemselves. The relationships are governed by what are understood as laws, which are gifts from the Creator. The laws are fundamentally spiritual, imbuing all aspects of life. As fundamental as this perspective may be, each Aboriginal culture expresses it in unique ways, with its own practices, products and knowledge. As real life circumstances shift over time, the challenge for Aboriginal people has been to interpret the laws to enable their continuing survival, not just physically but as a spiritually strong people. This challenge extends to Aboriginal education as well. Life is guided by \"laws\" which are sacred.\"Law\" In the Tlingit language - Shag\u00fbn In the Cree language - Kayas wiyasowewina \u007f\u00ffiisaak is a word with deep meaning. Tim Paul, Hesquiaht, says it could be translated as \"respect with caring.\" Quuas [our people] held respect for life in all things, the spirit in all things. They had respect for self, for other people, forthe land, the ocean and all the resources of food, clothing and shelter. -in Nuu-chah-nulth (1995, p. 21) We use the circle as a means of teaching. It is not a straight line type of teaching that we use. With us, everything is connected and interconnected. -Parent Council member Joe Duquette High School, Saskatoon (Haig-Brown et al., 1997, p. 96) Yamoria travelled around the world helping people who had problems with living, and he also gave them laws to live by at a time when there was muchdanger caused by bad shamans. These old Dene laws are still useful today. They should still be the first things we teach our young people. Even though they were given to us in a period much different from now, they are timeless.They are simple laws and if we follow them, we can still live a good life. -George Blondin, Rae -Edzo, NT (1997, p. 70)6 / Voices of the Elders Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12Our Relationship with the Natural World People are not greater than the things in nature. The natural worldhas its own laws which must be respected if people are going to be sustained by it.The time the Whiteman first came to this country, he saw there was a lot of land. /G7D It was a beautiful land, a land that was here in order for us to make our living from it. This land provided us with things, gave us a good life and we were able to survive by all the resources available to us. /G7D The Creator had placed them on the land for our use, and though they were taken, continues to protect us /G7D which is why we were never completely destroyed and why we are still here today. If the Whiteman had a better understanding of what the land meant to us, he would have thought differently about us. -J.B. Tootoosis, Deceased, Poundmaker First Nation (Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Center, <http://www.sicc.sk.ca/cgi-bin/sicc/epage.pl?1>) Respect for nature came by watching. If my dad killed a beaver or a goose or anything, it was never put on the ground, and everything was kept clean. Theydidn't throw the insides to the dogs, they had a dig-out and that 's where they would bury it. They didn 't just throw it in the garbage. /G7D The pouch in the throat of the moose, they took it and they hung it in a tree. That was respect for the dead moose. And you kept the water clean: you didn 't dump things in the water. -Nellie Munro, Norway House (Frontier School Division No. 48, M\u00e9tis Voices/M\u00e9tis Life , 1995, p. 49) People are identified by the land they have historically inhabited and onwhich they have learned to survive .Our history stretches far back into the silent past. When the great Creator came on earth and walked and talked with our people. One day the great Creator told those he favoured that a great deluge was coming upon the earth. He instructed each family on how to prepare for the coming flood waters. /G7D When the flood waters subsided, the survivors left their place of safety. This place became known as the \"place of descent. \" Every place of descent became sacred ground to the people that are now known as the Kwagu Nation. The place of descent of my ancestors. -Daisy Sewid-Smith, Kwagu Nation (Jensen and Brooks, Eds.,1991, p. 17) The place we lived was nick-named \"Moccasin Flats. \" That's where the M \u00e9tis lived, and it was the way the M \u00e9tis always lived. They called us \"Road allowance Indians. \" We lived on the outskirts of the reserve, or on the outskirts of the dominant white society. The term was derogatory to people who used itthat way, but to us it wasn 't; it was where we chose to live. -Edward Head, M \u00e9tis, Cold Lake, Manitoba (Frontier School Division, M\u00e9tis Voices/ M\u00e9tis Life , 1995, pp. 5 -6) Even today, it is necessary to live with the laws of nature and to feel a part of it.Our spiritual beliefs were stronger in the past. Today, people from the outside mine every little thing. They don 't take care of the land and water /G7D but we still live there. Our future generations have to have a healthy life. When I was young, I learned many stories about safety on the land. When I see non-Natives, I see they don 't know this country. -Roddy Blackjack, Little Salmon/Carmacks Our Relationship with One Another Agreement on rules enables cooperation and group strengthwhich is greater than individual strength.I belong to the Caribou clan. That is how we are. If I insult another, I am insulting the whole clan. My clan would put up a feast and feather ceremony tothe one I insulted. -Mary John, Prince George, BCWestern Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Voices of the Elders / 7 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000How are we going to improve our lives if we are always poking our heads above the crowd, selfish and not respecting other people 's opinions, but wanting to be our own boss? -Jimmy B. Rabesca, Rae -Edzo, NT (GNWT, 1993, p. xxiii) Identity comes from being in respectful relationships with others,particularly in the family/clan community and nation.The freedom and strength of the individual is the strength of the group. /G7D The individual does not form an identity in opposition to the group but recognizes the group as relatives included in his or her own identity. -Eber Hampton, Chicksaw Nation, Oklahoma, Saskatchewan Indian Federated College (1993, p. 279) Some of our family are living in urban areas. That 's no excuse. Families can still keep in touch and they need to. /G7D The responsibility for anyone with any problem lies with the family 'cause that is the way our people were historically, 'cause that 's where the basic help was all the time, whatever you dealt with. If a problem went beyond the control of the family, then it expanded to the largerfamily, you know, discussions of that. Failing that, then there were advisory groups responsible to the Chief who those problems could be placed under and dealt with. -Roy Haiyupis, Ahousat (Nuu-chah-nulth, 1995, p. 172 ) Our Relationship with Ourselves Each person is born sacred and complete.We must redefine and redevelop our profile of what our child is: He is not something to develop the economy. He is a spirit. -Wes Fineday, Regina The Creator has given each person the gift of their body and the choice to care for and use their bodies with respect.Now son, learn to respect your body. Maker gave you a wonderful, wonderful body. You have got to respect it. You 've got to thank the Maker every now and then for giving you such a wonderful gift of your body. /G7D Never, never abuse it, but learn to keep it clean. Learn to get that strength within that body because the body is very weak. You have got an inner self that whispers for you, \"Don't commit wrong, do right. \" -Moses Smith, Ehattesaht (Nuu-chah-nulth, 1995, p. 139) The Creator has given each person the capacity and choice to learn.I had no schooling. When I was a kid, I used to watch people steadily. I would go to my Grandmother and she told me what rules to follow. -Vernon Makokis, Saddle Lake, AB We never force anybody because we are not supposed to do that. We just share and if that person wants to learn more, then that person just keepscoming back to Elder to find out the importance of spiritual identity. We have totry to be good all the time. -Walter Linklater, Anishnabe, Thunderchild First Nation (Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Center, <http://www.sicc.sk.ca/cgi-bin/sicc/epage.pl?161>) In our system of education, knowledge is earned. One learns to listen, like a human being who has the gift to hear what is said. We don 't put knowledge in a person's head or hand. We give directions, not answers. We don 't trap people into thinking answers are given from the outside. Answers come from the inside. -Wes Fineday, Regina, SK8 / Voices of the Elders Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12Here are some things for young people to use: Do what an Elder tells you and at the same time develop your own understanding and follow that. -Maggie Okanee, Born 1876 - Deceased, Cree, Turtle Lake First Nation (Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Center, <http://www.sicc.sk.ca/cgi-bin/sicc/epage.pl?93>) The Creator has given each person talents or strengths to be discovered and the choice to develop and sharethe gifts. The people had carefully organized themselves according to their knowledge, wisdom and abilities. /G7D The men had many abilities; some were canoe builders, carpenters, and weather predictors. Often each man possessed several abilities, which old people call \"gifts.\" -Andrew Evans, Norway House, MB ( Norway House Anthology: Stories of the Elders, Volume 2, Apetagon, 1992, p. 8) COLONIZATION AND RECONSTRUCTIONFrom the perspective of the Aboriginal people, the post-contact period is characterized as a time of great displacement and dislocation.Colonizing forces disrupted the fundamental relationships and ways of being in the world. However, time and experience have shown that Aboriginal people are survivors. Despite the intensity of the assimilative forces, their world view continues to provide meaning, direction and a sense of integrity to those who were given or who hadmade the choice to listen. In the early contact period, the relationship between the European and Aboriginal populations was oneof mutual respect.\"How they understood each other at first, I 'll never know. But because he was a trader, my grandfather was able to give my grandmother silk stockings, \" Beatrice laughs. \"Eventually he could speak Saulteaux as well as she could. \" -Beatrice Bilow, M \u00e9tis, Barrows, MB (Frontier School Division, M\u00e9tis Voices/M \u00e9tis Life, 1995, p. 2) The forces of contact created much dislocation in the lives of theAboriginal people.According to my grandparents, they knew that the Whiteman was going to come. There were lots of changes - diseases and sickness. /G7D When they came, they were only concerned about gold. They didn 't ask the people about the use of the land, or the animals. We had laws that we followed. -Roddy Blackjack, Little Salmon/Carmacks, YT The enforcement of the Indian Act of 1876 and the subsequent amendments had the effect of destroyingAboriginal values and identity.Having outlawed the political institutions and traditional form of Indian government, the federal government proceeded to superimpose its own form of government on Indian nations. The band council system was introduced through the Indian Act and functioned on European perceptions of what constituted proper government. /G7D No substantive powers rested with these councils, and any decisions made were subject to the ultimate approval of theMinister of Indian Affairs. -Chief Joe Mathias, Squamish Nation, BC, and Gary Yabsley (Jensen and Brooks, Eds., 1991, p. 38) The erosion of Aboriginal languages was predictable given the pressures to assimilate.\"I am always hungry, \" said Mary. \"So am I,\" I said. We did not say this in our own language, but in the halting English which we were slowly learning. The nuns and the priest, who was the principal, had warned all of us that it was forbidden to speak the Indian language. /G7D -Mary John (Moran, 1988, p. 53)Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Voices of the Elders / 9 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000Despite the many negative effects of colonialism, the perspectives and values of the Aboriginal people weremaintained.My grandmother was a boarding school product and on my mother 's side, my father went to the same boarding school that I went to. My mother went to the same school that her mother went to. Like it seems that we have lost aboutthree generations of teachings but it was easy for us to go back to our teachings. -Maria Linklater, Cree, Thunderchild First Nation (Saskatchewan Indian Cultural Center, <http://www.sicc.sk.ca/cgi-bin/sicc/epage.pl?162> ) Aboriginal people strive to maintain their identity as nations withinCanada.Our culture is very important to us. I believe that if we lose our language, our dances, our music, our tales handed down from generation to generation by our Elders, we lose what our country is to us. /G7D We must keep our language, our culture, and our land so that, even in Canada, we can still feel that we have ourown country. -Mary John (Moran, 1988, p. 159) My people, the Dene, believe that we have always lived in this place, the North. We don't accept the scientific stories about Aboriginal people coming across the Bering Strait land bridge from Siberia. We believe the Creator put us herewhen the world was new; he put us in this place that Canadians now call the Northwest Territories and the Yukon. It is our place. -George Blondin, Rae -Edzo, NT (1997, p. 18) Today, many First Nations people adopt a strongly non-assimilationist stance through the development of First Nation-oriented curricula. This approach has been greatly influenced by past educational experiences. -Jo-ann Archibald, Sto:lo Nation, UBC House of Learning (1995, p. 310) The mainstream culture has begun to explore, appreciate and apply Aboriginal perspectives for their inherent value./G7D Aboriginal people 's efforts to create parallel institutions, such as an Aboriginal justice system, or a First Nations university, tend to be opposed as separatist or /G7D as \"special status. \" /G7D For the most part, the Euro-Canadian society has not gone over to understand the First Nation population. Fivehundred years of contending with that have left my people very distrustful ofwhites. An optimistic sign, though, is that the corporate world is gradually shifting to a managerial style that is more consistent with Aboriginal culture. -George Calliou, Cree, Sucker Creek, AB (1997, p. 236) In labelling children as \"gifted\" or \"not gifted, \" rather than calling attention to their specific abilities, /G7D we begin thinking that children are naturally clustered into two well-defined groups, \"gifted\" and \"non-gifted. \" Cultural teachers in First Nations communities place a great deal of emphasis on spirituality - not to be confused with forms of organized religion! These teachers stress that each individual human has been designed by the Creator,and each of us has a specific purpose to fulfill on earth. -John W.

They have envisioned an education where the young people of today are helped in creating a peaceful balance within themselves using Aboriginal \"laws\" as a guide. The \"laws\" which govern life, are not laws in the literal and mechanistic sense. They are perspectives that can help young people to orient themselves positively as Aboriginal people while establishing or strengthening their personal identities. They are perspectives that enable Aboriginal people to live with integrity, regardless of the environment or circumstances in which theyfind themselves. Most importantly for Aboriginal educators, these perspectives are supported with an abundance of time-tested learning resources in the form of oral traditions. Though the stories from the oral tradition have been used in formal classrooms in the past, they are only recognized as valuable and integral learning resources when the perspectives that they communicate are understood and recognized as legitimate. Here, in their words, are Aboriginal voices that speak clearly and persuasively about the need for and the right to culture and language programs based on Aboriginal perspectives. Perspectives-based Culture and Language Education The Aboriginal perspective is as useful today as it was in the past in helping people live with integrity, especially as people relocate into urban areas or away from kin.We came from a system of laws and relationships. The laws were the parameters of acceptable behavior within each relationship. Our lifestyles have changed a lot but the necessity to survive with integrity is still with me. Wemust elevate our discussion in a way that we can identify the principles. -Wes Fineday, Regina, SK We need the Elders to provide us with the guiding principles and to interpret for us how the traditional principles are to be translated in the contemporary urbancontext. -George Calliou, Cree, Sucker Creek, AB (1997, p. 224) Business cannot be separated from the environment. The environment cannot be separated from the government. Government cannot be separated from social and economic issues. People cannot be separated from all of the above.Perhaps it is time to recognize this and make efforts to reinstate a whole-life perspective in education. -Patrick Kelly, Sto:lo Nation (Jensen and Brooks, Eds., 1991, p.145) The Aboriginal perspective will guide young people into making choices that will prepare them for their future as capable adults.What will happen a hundred years from now? We depend on the wage economy but nothing much is going on. There are not a lot a jobs for ourpeople. Our trapping is being extinguished slowly. Our young people don't eat wild meat. They want to eat peas and pork chops from Edmonton. It is a mixed up lifestyle. We have to give our kids independence. Something ismissing from the education system. -George Blondin, Rae -Edzo, NTWestern Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Voices of the Elders / 11 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000The Elders presented us with the knowledge, skills and attitudes that Dene should strive toward in order to become \"capable.\" The kind of Dene that we were being asked to help create with this curriculum were capable people, oneswho had integrity in their relationships with the spiritual world, the land, other people and themselves. -Fibbie Tatti, North Slavey, NT (GNWT, 1993, p. xiv) The Aboriginal perspective helps in understanding the value or purposeof things, or in making personal decisions.I could master some of the things that were fed to me, but I didn 't know how to place them internally. Tell me and I will spit it out back to you, but how it fits inmy perspective, it didn 't make sense. -Yaqui voices (Sonnleitner, 1995, p. 329) The Aboriginal perspective helps people to be empowered.Under self-government we are able to bring things back to our people, develop our traditional laws. We are trying to put ourselves back together. We speakwith one voice. We try to bring back as much as we can into our life, into ourown future. When the government paddles the other way, we know why. We make them straighten up the boat so that nothing will go against us no more. -Roddy Blackjack, Little Salmon/Carmacks, YT Language and culture are intertwined. Both are necessary to instill identity in its fullest sense.Language /G7D is not just a neutral instrument [for communication]. Rather, it shapes our very conceptualization of phenomena, such that some phenomena are not translatable into another language and some languages have no word for certain phenomena found in other cultures. /G7D We Aboriginal people are forced to speak the foreign language of the English to convey a lot of ourspirituality, our thoughts, our essence. Unfortunately, it is not adequate to the task. So, if people want to understand us and the things in which we take pride, they should learn our respective languages. I am proud of my Creelanguage and heritage. -George Calliou, Cree, Sucker Creek, AB (1997, pp. 223 -224) Aboriginal Rights There is a need and an inherent right to maintain the Aboriginal languagesand cultures.Our kids are losing their identity. They don 't know their history. My grandparents taught me the dangers, what to respect, etc. They told me tonever forget where I came from. When our kids come out of school, who are they? Who do they belong to? -Roddy Blackjack, Little Salmon/Carmacks, YT First Nation peoples are not \"mere\" ethnic groups \u2014we are, after all, the First Nations and we do have Aboriginal rights not enjoyed by immigrant ethnic groups. /G7D -George Calliou, Cree, Sucker Creek, AB (1997, p. 222) Young people represent the future of our culture.We know that the world will be a much different place when our children become adults and take responsibility for our community.

The WCP acknowledges the necessity of guidancefrom the Alders if this document is truly to reflect Aboriginal perspective. Each community wishing to establish a culture and language program must turn to its own Elders for guidance. It is only with Elder support that Aboriginal language and culture programs can succeed in achieving the goal of language revitalization.Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Introduction / 13 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000INTRODUCTION PURPOSE OF THE FRAMEWORKThe purpose of The Common Curriculum Framework for Aboriginal Language and Culture Programs, Kindergarten to Grade 12 is to support the revitalization and enhancement of Aboriginal languages. The Framework consists of learning outcomes in the areas of culture and language, sequenced in six developmental levels. The cultural content is organized around Aboriginal \"laws of relationships. \" First and second language outcomes are tied to the cultural outcomes invarious implicit and explicit ways. The specified outcomes are an attempt to address the need for cooperation and accountability in Aboriginal language and culture programs. Teachers, schools, administrators and trustees require acommon language to communicate their objectives and goals. The Framework is designed to meet that need. It is also a way of identifying the important elements of Aboriginal education and ensuring that they are included in the planning and preparation of a program. This approach is not meant to contradict the Aboriginalperspective, which is characterized by holism and spiralled learning. AIM AND GOALS OF LANGUAGE AND CULTURE PROGRAMSThe aim and goals of Aboriginal language and culture programs generated by the Framework are outlined in the following chart. Language and Culture Program Aim Language and culture programs developed from the Framework will have the aim of providing students with Aboriginal perspectives and skills (including language) that will help them to: /G78 find balance within themselves to live peacefully and respectfully with themselves, one another and the land /G78 play a role in revitalizing Aboriginal languages and cultures. Program Goals Cultural Students will demonstrate the ability to: /G78 participate in the practices and use of the products of theirAboriginal culture /G78 understand the perspectives and underlying knowledge of theirAboriginal culture /G78 willingly reflect on their relationships with themselves,one another and the naturalworld. First Language Students will demonstrate the abilityto: /G78 use the Aboriginal language to interact with others in order tobuild relationships /G78 learn from the words of their people /G78 research and record cultural knowledge /G78 create and express effective Aboriginal text /G78 explore their changing language. Second Language Students will demonstrate the ability to: /G78 use language in community and school situations requiring interaction,production or interpretation oflanguage /G78 use strategies for learning a language /G78 communicate with degrees of precision, coherency and fluency /G78 use language to give and get information, socialize and celebrate,interpret and produce talk, and research culture.14 / Introduction Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12PHILOSOPHY The education of the young is the primary way in which a culture passes on its accumulated knowledge, skills and attitudes. At the heart of this education is a perspective or set of fundamental assumptions about the relationship of humankind to its cosmos. When the education of Aboriginal children was displaced with education from the Europeancultures, it was not merely the particular knowledge, skill and attitude sets that were supplanted but, more importantly, Aboriginal peoples ' foundational view of the world. Almost from the beginning, Aboriginal people have attempted to communicate their unease with the inherent contradictions they have faced with formal schooling. The Aboriginal voices have been clear and persistent in calling for a respectful recognition of their world view, while acknowledging the value of the skill and knowledge sets required to participate in the new technologies and economies. It is to these voices that the WCP Aboriginal Languages Working Group turned to listen so that they could attempt to address the contradictions. In the spring of 1997, the Working Group brought together a group of Elders and resource people from the six provinces and territories for two purposes: firstly, to ascertain the extent to which they could, for the many Aboriginal nations involved in the project, adopt a commongoal or purpose in Aboriginal language education; and, secondly, to determine what that goal would be. The participants included Mary John from Prince George, British Columbia; Roddy Blackjack from Little Salmon/Carmacks, Yukon Territory; Tsuut 'ina Nation, Alberta; and, Garry Robson from Winnipeg, Manitoba. The meeting served to establish the foundational premises upon which this document would be based. Many of the participants ' comments are recorded in the Voices of the Elders section of this document. Here, in the words of the Working Group, is a synthesis of that meeting and of the philosophy upon which this document is founded: Our Way Is a Valid Way of Seeing the World From the meeting with our Elders we gained new knowledge about some key principles underlying the philosophy and world view inherent in all Aboriginal languages. We learned that fundamental spiritual principles cross all domains of knowledge and are expressed as sacred laws governing our behavior and relationship to the land and its life forms. The basic concepts contained within each language make no separation between the secular and sacred aspects oflanguage and culture; these remain a unified whole. This being the case, there exist implicit as well as explicit laws to regulate daily behavior. Behavioral expectations are defined in relationWestern Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Introduction / 15 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000to such things as the natural environment, the social and moral order, the Elders and their traditional teachings, the rights to specific kinds of knowledge, the individual 's participation in cultural life, and his/her personal growth and well being. Because relationships within the natural and human order, and the concepts embedded in Aboriginal languages, are understood to be based on an immutable foundation of sacredness, what we do and say, by extension, implies a personal commitment to the sacred. Some key concepts defining these relationships arekinship (respect in relationships), protocol (conduct in ceremonies and social interaction), medicine (personal habits and practice in relation to health and spiritual gifts), ceremonies (roles and conduct), copyright (earning the right to knowledge) and oral tradition (expression of knowledge, its forms and ownership). It was emphasized that learning an Aboriginal language, therefore, means absorbing the very foundations ofAboriginal identity. As students begin to learn their language, they acquire basic understandings that shape their attitudes. The Elders tell of the power of the language to generate change and a sense of direction within the learner. Learning the First Language becomes a powerful source of one 's personal commitment to become healthy and to learn the ways of achieving a healthy environment once more. Learning the language engenders respect for the self, for others and for all facets of nature, and this in turn strengthens thehuman capacity to stand together. In reality, the Elders say, the elements of the mainstream and traditional cultures are not transferable. The wage economy and social assistance stand in contradiction to the traditionaluse of the land and the role of the individual as an empowered guardian. There may also be a perceived conflict of religious views where the Aboriginal belief that everything is alive may seem to contravene the concept of the human soul. Similarly, contemporary reliance on technology and fast-food lifestyles, forexample, make it nearly impossible to follow the laws of health that exist for diet. Internal conflicts begin to be felt as the differences between mainstream and traditional First Language cultures and lifestyles become more clearly defined in the mind of the learner. The Elders agree that a rift has been created between traditionalidentity and contemporary identity, but that fundamental values continue to bind the two together. The Elders point out that principles, such as love and sharing, are consistent with the central purpose of teaching: to develop a person who understands why we do what we do. Searching out theseprinciples and applying them in different contexts is an important approach to reconciling the many contradictions the16 / Introduction Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12students are likely to face while learning an Aboriginal language. The Elders stress, \"Our way is a valid way of seeing the world. \" RATIONALE Because language and culture cannot be separated, language is vital to understanding unique cultural perspectives. The wisdom of Aboriginal voices points clearly toward a framework that encourages Aboriginal language instruction through Aboriginal cultures and, more specifically,cultural perspectives. Language is a tool that students can use to explore and experience their cultures and the perspectives imbedded in their cultures. This is the strongest rationale for producing school programs that integrate the teaching of language and culture. The goal is not to learn another language code or to \"study\" Aboriginal cultures. The goal is to have students attain balance in their lives by exploring, in a personal way, the perspectives of their heritage and using the most effective resources possible, those being the language, the oral traditions and the cultural practices of their people. The laws of relationships, using language and culture, are integral to a perpectives-based Aboriginaleducation (see Figure 1). An ongoing debate in Aboriginal language and culture education has focused on whether culture has to be taught together with language, whether the culture can be taught in languages other than the Aboriginalones, and whether culture should be taught at all if it is not taught in the Aboriginal language. Especially in Aboriginal second language programs, there are questions as to how much time and how many resources are available to teach culture as well as language, and further, whether students with limited language proficiency can learn culturalcontent in the second language. This Framework is based on the belief that cultural content must be taught in the Aboriginal language in order for students to develop language skills that are valued by their cultural group. Most of thelanguage outcomes for both first and second language programs focus on the ability of students to use language as they pursue their cultural skills and understandings. If the language programs are taught purely as code or mechanical skills (such as phonics, grammar, vocabulary and spelling), they will not be meeting many of the language outcomes of this Framework . These mechanical skills are the basis of some outcomes, but only as they relate to their use or application in thepursuit of cultural learning.Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Introduction / 17 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000Figure 1 Perspectives-based Aboriginal Education* * Adapted from the work of Garry Robson, Dan Thomas and Juliette Sabot, Native Education Directorate, Manitoba Education and Training, and from Dene Kede education: a Dene perspective.

From generation to generation, the Elders as Keepers of Knowledge have passed on to succeeding generations traditions and knowledge that have sustained Aboriginal people over the centuries.Spiritual, rational and empirical knowledge transmitted through Aboriginal languages and the oral tradition continue to illuminate the path defined by the laws of relationships, which promote growth and health. This knowledge continues to support contemporary developments in medicine, education and ecology. Recognition of thislong, continuous contribution to the well-being of society as a whole is long overdue. Fishman (1991) suggests that if a school program is going to make a difference in terms of language revitalization, it will require very strong community support, including parents and Elders. In a study of Saskatchewan 's Aboriginal language programs in schools, Heather Blair (1997) strongly recommends the need for much greater involvement of all stakeholders, noting that schools or language teachers could not reverse on their own the language loss trends evidenced in the communities she studied. Aboriginal language teachers have often described the responsibility they feel and the tremendous amount of faith that is put in them and their programs by the administration as well as the political leadership. Admirably, most language teachers approach their jobs with zeal, and it would seem that this is indeed what is required. Flores (1993) andCrawford (1996), after observing a number of successful school language programs, made the observation that strong grassroots activity was always present in the communities of those schools. Community members participated in planning and organizing cultural and social contexts for language use and in bringing the remaining languagespeakers into the school community. The Framework proposes outcomes that rely a great deal on such community support, regardless of whether the resulting programs are first or second language programs, or bilingual programs. Theintention of recommending strong community involvement is threefold: to respond to research findings about successful programs; to encourage the community to come forward; and, to suggest that program development not be left to the teacher or the school. The community, in addition to the school and its teachers, must take responsibility for revitalizing a language and its culture. Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Introduction / 19 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000FRAMEWORK ORGANIZATION The Framework has three main organizers that curriculum developers or others using the Framework need to understand. The first stems from Aboriginal perspective, which reflects the view that survival is dependent upon respectful and spiritual relationships with oneself, other people and the natural world (see Voices of the Elders section for Elder comments). The outcomes themselves form the second organizer in the Framework . The outcomes are presented in three sections: Cultural Outcomes, First Language Outcomes and Second Language Outcomes. The intention is that curriculum developers will tailor a language and culture program to their own particular cultural community, based on the appropriateoutcomes and community needs. The student developmental levels, upon which the outcomes are based, form the third organizer. ABORIGINAL PERSPECTIVE Aboriginal perspective is reflected in the Framework through the three \"laws of relationships \"\u2014Laws of Sacred Life (including respect for oneself), Laws of Nature and Laws of Mutual Support \u2014described in the chart below./G85 These laws are grounded in the belief that there is a sacred power greater than us, and in the following related principles: /G78 All parts of creation are interconnected and manifest in the spirit of the Creator. /G78 Humankind must live in respectful relationship with all that has been created. /G78 Spiritual forces are gifts intended to aid survival rather than threaten it. Laws of Relationships Laws of Sacred Life Each person is born sacred and complete. /G78 Each person is given the gift of body with the choice to care forit and use it with respect. /G78 Each person is given the capacity and the choice to learn to live inrespectful relationships. /G78 Each person is given strengths or talents to be discovered, nurtured and shared for the benefit of all. Laws of Nature The natural world provides the gifts of life and place. /G78 A people's sense of place and identity is tied to the land/seawhich has given the people life. /G78 The natural world provides people with the necessities oflife. /G78 People must live in harmony with the laws of nature in orderto be sustained by it.Laws of Mutual Support People in groups of mutual support are strong. Alone, a person will notsurvive. /G78 Identity comes from belonging in respectful relationships withothers. /G78 Agreement on rules enables cooperation and group strength. /G85 This information is adapted from the Dene Kede Curriculum (Government of the Northwest Territories). 20 / Introduction Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12The term \"Aboriginal perspective \" as used in this Framework is generic. Although the laws of relationships are considered common to all Aboriginal cultures, each culture expresses the perspective with its own concepts, practices and products. Furthermore, because cultures are not frozen in time, the concepts, practices and products of theculture will evolve and reflect a changing environment. It is left to each developer to choose the cultural outcomes that are most acceptable to his/her cultural community. The use of Aboriginal perspective as a curriculum organizer does not preclude the incorporation of academic skills and concepts, such as historical sequence, mapping or government. Indeed, they are imbedded within the Framework outcomes. For example, mapping is studied in the contexts of identity and oral histories, rather than in the context of economics or history from a non-Aboriginal perspective. In the Framework , Aboriginal language is considered to be a cultural skill. All languages are used for basic communication, but beyond that, certain skills and gifts within a language enable a person to engage more fully in the culture. Each culture values and emphasizes different language skills. This is apparent when people make what seem to be social blunders in another culture \u2014speaking too loudly, speaking too softly, speaking too much \u2014when really what they are doing is incorporating what is a valued skill in their language into another. Knowing a language is more than knowing vocabulary, grammar and culturally relevant topics. It is using language in ways and for purposes valued by the cultural community. What might these valued language skills be for the Aboriginal languages, and how does a language program help students to achieve such skills? The Framework , based on the Aboriginal perspective, provides the guidelines for language development: the valued languageskills that help people develop respectful relationships with themselves, with one another and with the land. We can be somewhat confident that as long as students are being given authentic and natural experiences with the members of the culturalcommunity as they go about developing these relationships, the students will be learning the Aboriginal language skills that are valued. For example, if students are allowed to participate in activities with the Buffalo Women Society in the Blackfoot culture, they will learn the language skills required for working together, for ceremonies and for self-understanding. It is, therefore, essential that, in order for the students to develop language skills valued by the culture, the cultural content of the programs be taught in the Aboriginal languages.Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Introduction / 21 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE OUTCOMES There are three broad categories of learning outcomes outlined in the Framework . /G78 Cultural Outcomes These include cultural understanding, cultural skill and personal development outcomes. /G78 First Language Outcomes /G78 Second Language Outcomes Figure 2 shows how Aboriginal perspective and the laws of relationships can be used to organize desired outcomes in culture and language programs. Laws of Sacred Life Laws of Nature Laws of Mutual Support Cultural Outcomes Cultural Understandings Students will demonstrate the following culturalunderstandings.Each person is born sacred and complete andcan choose how to use his/her gifts.Nature provides sustenance and a senseof place to those who live in harmony with it.People in groups of mutual support arestrong. Alone, a person will not survive. Cultural Skills Students will demonstrate the following skills, which will enable them toparticipate in cultural practices and in the use of cultural products.Skills that enable one to recognize and respect the sacredness of one 's body.Skills that enable one to be sustained by the resources of nature, to be one with it, and toexpress gratitude for its gifts.Skills that enable one to add strength to a group, and to gain strength from one another. Personal Development Students will demonstrate personal development in thefollowing areas.Development relating to personal health andgrowth, and awareness of one's sacredness.Development relating to one's relationship with nature.Development relating to one's relationship with those around himself/herself. Language Outcomes First Language and Second Language Students will demonstrate thefollowing language skills.Understand and use language required to enable personal health and growth.Understand and use language required to be sustained by nature, physically andspiritually.Understand and use language required to respect one another and to strengthen the group. Figure 222 / Introduction Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 Unlike curriculum outcomes, the outcomes in this Framework cannot be applied directly into lesson planning for the classroom. They areguides that developers can use in identifying outcomes in specificAboriginal language and culture curricula at regional and/or locallevels. A teacher using the Framework will need to go through at least two stages of preparation before it can be translated into classroomlearning activities: firstly, appropriate outcomes will have to beselected in terms of the local culture and language; and, secondly, theoutcomes will require refinement to be meaningful as a yearly planningguide, and even further refinement if they are to be used for shorterterm planning. The primary task of the developer is to select and refine learning outcomes for a specific Aboriginal culture and its language, across thescope and sequence of outcomes detailed in the Framework . Central to this work is his or her cultural community. The term \"cultural community \" is used in the Framework to mean any group of people who communicate with a common Aboriginallanguage, and who associate their culture with specific culturalpractices, such as protocols for interaction, dances, gathering of earthmedicines and ceremonies, and with specific cultural products, such asstories, tools, architectural design and spiritual symbols. Thecommunity can be a Nation, a reserve village, an extended family, afriendship centre, a resource centre or a school. A characteristic of thecultural community is its connection with a traditional territory or land,meaning the geographic origin of the community 's culture. A cultural community can also identify Elders who are accepted as the \"Keepers of Knowledge \"; that is, people who know the oral traditions of their culture and use them to identify and explain the practices and productsof the culture. The Elders may have specialized areas of talent orknowledge; some may be known for their ability to tell stories, some fortheir special cultural skills, and some for their ability to provideguidance in interpreting the perspectives and values of the culture invarying situations. Altogether, the cultural community is the culturalauthority and primary resource base for any Aboriginal language andculture curriculum and subsequent programs. DEVELOPMENTAL LEVELS The outcomes in the Framework are presented in six developmental levels: Level 1: Kindergarten to Grade 1 Level 2: Grade 2 and Grade 3 Level 3: Grades 4 to 6 Level 4: Grade 7 and Grade 8 Level 5: Grade 9 and Grade 10 Level 6: Grade 11 and Grade 12. The levels are only a guide. Developers and teachers will have to select and adjust the outcomes according to their students ' cultural experience and level of language ability. For example, students might have a highlevel of cultural knowledge but require a lower level of languageinstruction. Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Cultural Outcomes / 23 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000CULTURAL OUTCOMES CULTURAL PROGRAM GOALS Students will demonstrate the ability to: /G78 participate in the practices and use of the products of their Aboriginal culture /G78 understand the perspectives and underlying knowledge of their Aboriginal culture /G78 willingly reflect on their relationships with themselves, one another and the natural world. Though the cultural outcomes are separated from the languageoutcomes, they are intended to form the larger part of the culture and language program. In order to suggest that language be taught through culture, it was necessary to specify the cultural outcomes separately. However, they remain an integral part of language instruction. SCOPE OF CULTURAL OUTCOMES As explained earlier, Aboriginal perspective is the primary organizer forthe Framework . The three laws of relationships \u2014Laws of Sacred Life, Laws of Nature and Laws of Mutual Support \u2014define the scope of the cultural content. Within each of the relationship areas, outcomes relating to cultural understandings, cultural skills and personaldevelopment are identified. It should be noted that the full scope of the cultural outcomes is intended for the first language learner. However, students in second language programs can and should experience the cultural content in their Aboriginal language according to their abilities and the level of community support available. Cultural Understandings Each culture engages in practices that are based upon certain beliefs or ways of understanding the world. The outcomes in this section of the Framework relate to how a culture explains itself and its cosmos. The Framework provides foundational guidelines, suggesting that most understandings relate to the respectful and balanced relationships that one must develop in relation to people, animals, the spirit forces andoneself. The Framework also asks each culture to look at its world view throughout history, considering the effects of European fur traders and succeeding generations of colonizers. Each culture should also look at itself in the present and consider how it understands the current realities, especially in relation to basic values and foundationalperspectives. 24 / Cultural Outcomes Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12Cultural Skills Cultural skills are the practices that enable people to live what they believe. Some practices are perceived to come from the Creator; others are time-tested responses to the environment. In different eras, some of the practices have adapted to changing circumstances. Others have remained intact, staying close to the oral traditions that inform them.The developers are asked to identify the practices they feel students should have in order to live the basic values or perspectives of their culture. Most importantly, this includes the language practices: the songs that are believed to come from the Creator, the language of consensus and respect, and the language that carries the oral histories ofthe people. Most of the Aboriginal cultures practice a very strict code withrespect to who should be the carriers of this kind of knowledge. Considering that the cultures have had to survive through intense assimilative pressures and, in many cases, government banning of practices, it is likely that not all cultural practices will be passed down through the school system. Trusting the wisdom of theirKeepers of Knowledge, developers should be sensitive to the balance that needs to be kept between what is public and what is private so that a helpful partnership can be created and maintained between the school and the people it is meant to serve. Personal Development This section of the Framework , more than the others, regards process as outcome. The developer is asked to specify indicators that show the students are indeed trying to use the cultural understandings and skills provided to help them understand the world. The process is intended tobe a self-directed one, where students make personal decisions after reflection with the intent of creating balance and a sense of peace within. The following diagram /G85 illustrates a process sometimes referred to as a thought wheel or medicine wheel. /G85 This diagram is used with permission from Being You Incorporated. Behaviour or what you doWestern Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Cultural Outcomes / 25 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000According to this process, a person first has a thought, which then raises feelings. Once the thinker is aware of these feelings, he or she makes a decision and then goes through deeper feelings. Once the decision is enacted through action or behaviour, more feelings are experienced and the thinker sees the result of his or her thought. Some behaviour ishabitual and based on decisions made in the past, and this is behaviour one can choose to change. The thought wheel or medicine wheel reflects the way of Aboriginal cultures and their philosophy of education: each person is given information, guidance and affirmation but, in the end, must make his or her own choices. Traditionally, it was the extended family that provided the guidance,because the family 's future was represented in the children, not simply in the mother and father. The process is made more difficult today with nuclear families living away from their extended families and with the invasive influence of mass media and popular culture. That is why, perhaps, the Elders and traditional educators are asking for the help ofschools in regaining a place in the lives of their young people. Reflection, the process of examining all aspects of one 's experience and attempting to come to a considered decision, is made more productive if information from the voices of experience and knowledge is a part ofthe consideration. This has been the role that Elders have assumed, and for which they have been called \"teachers.\" It is not simply the stories or the skills they impart that are considered important; Elders play a guiding role in helping the young people to find a balance within themselves. The practices associated with creating balance have often been called \"healing,\" partly because imbalance has been seen to be the cause of so many personal problems. It is important, however, in Aboriginal language and culture programs, that this process not be called healing,but rather \"creating balance. \" Aboriginal students do not necessarily require healing. They may be seeking to balance their time and efforts between their cultural roles and their lives as teenagers with the mainstream. They may be seeking balance between the demands of their studies and the calls of friendship. Healing in this contextdiminishes the meaning it carries in areas where real healing is required. In this era then, where cultures and languages are threatened with extinction and where the young people are separated intellectually if not physically from their cultures, the role of the Aboriginal teacher can bevery significant. The teacher plays the role of \"cultural broker, \" /G86 helping students to understand the cultures they come from. The teachers are often the first generation to have straddled two /G86This term was used by Arlene Stairs (1995) to describe the way in which cultural knowledge is interpreted in the school for you ng people who do not have the cultural experience to understand the \"pure culture. \"26 / Cultural Outcomes Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 cultures and are in a unique position to be able to explain and guide those who have not had the same strong cultural education. The goal of cultural education is not to fill the students with knowledge, but to facilitate their personal growth. SEQUENCE OF CULTURAL OUTCOMES The cultural outcomes in the Framework are specified for six levels. The perspectives, values, practices and products of the culture are studied with a different emphasis at each level. Level 1: Kindergarten (or Early Childhood Services) to Grade 1 The culture of the home, school and immediate natural environment are studied and experienced from the perspective of the three laws of relationships. Level 2: Grade 2 and Grade 3 The cultural values and perspectives of the students ' extended families and their traditional territory are explored and experienced in greater depth. Level 3: Grades 4 to 6 Students examine and experience the culture of the community or Nation to appreciate better the ways in which the perspectives and values of the culture are maintained and strengthened in today 's world. Level 4: Grade 7 and Grade 8 The traditional culture is studied through oral tradition and research in order that students understand how the perspectives were evidenced in precontact times. Levels 5 and 6: Grades 9 to 12 Students study the effect of the forces of history \u2014contact and colonization \u2014upon the lives and perspectives of the Aboriginal people. In addition, current issues affecting Aboriginal people are analyzed from the Aboriginal perspective.

Language retention is also critical to the ongoing existence of the distinctive cultures of Aboriginal peoples. By participating in a First Language Program students are able to maintain and enhance their language and deepen their understanding of Aboriginal cultures. As generations before them have been, these students will be the future Keepers of Knowledge. FIRST LANGUAGE PROGRAM GOALS Students will demonstrate the ability to: /G78 use the Aboriginal language to interact with others in order to build relationships /G78 learn from the words of their people /G78 research and record cultural knowledge /G78 create and express effective Aboriginal text /G78 explore their changing language. The first language outcomes are intended for students who speak an Aboriginal language as their first language. Though the cultural outcomes are seemingly separated from the language outcomes, they are intended to form the larger part of the language outcomes. In order to suggest that language be taught through culture, it was necessary tospecify the cultural outcomes separately. However, they remain, in their intent, an offshoot of the language component. In addition to the outcomes that are to be met through cultural content, the Framework specifies outcomes that are similar to language arts outcomes from the languages of written cultures. The need for such outcomes arises in part from the desire on the part of many communities to develop bilingual programs, but also to acknowledge the evolution of the language into a written language such that it can be recorded as well as become more accessible. The learning outcomes of the First Language Program are modelled on outcomes articulated for English language arts programs; however, certain cautions must be observed. For example, the conventions and stylistic devices in the English language, such as punctuation, do notnecessarily correspond to conventions in the oral tradition \u2014pauses, length of silence.66 / First Language Outcomes Common Curriculum Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs (K -12)Figure 3, which follows, shows how the language outcomes are expected to be drawn from the cultural learning experiences.

The outcomes for Aboriginal as a Second Language are based on the assumption that language will be taught and used while teaching cultural content, just as with Aboriginal First Language. This methodology of teaching language through content is suggested for the spectrum of second language programs, from daily language classes to the immersion programs. PROFICIENCY-BASED OUTCOMESCommunicative proficiency is the goal of Aboriginal Second Language programs. Communicative proficiency is the ability to use a language to function in a variety of basic language use contexts and situations offered by a culture. These functions involve listening, reading, speaking and writing skills. Levels of communicative proficiency canbe described in terms of such characteristics as the degree of accuracy in the communication of meaning, the variety of topics that can be dealt with, and the amount of spontaneity and abstraction involved in various language use situations. In this Framework , these characteristics have been used as a guide in specifying four areas of language outcomesacross six levels of communicative language development as presented on page 91. While these outcomes are based on widely held criteria for second language development, there has been an attempt to adapt the outcomes to incorporate the values that are held toward language by Aboriginalcultures (see following chart). Second Language Outcomes At a particular level of proficiency, students will: In these contexts,using these specific strategies,with this quality of languagebe able to perform these functions. Language Use ContextsStrategies for Language LearningLanguage QualityLanguage Functions90 / Second Language Outcomes Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12AREAS OF LANGUAGE OUTCOMESLanguage Use Contexts At each level, three kinds of language use contexts in which students are expected to perform are identified: Interaction: involves face-to-face communication and the socio- cultural rules for such interaction. Interpretation: requires students to understand and interpret discourse, or a connected set of sentences or ideas. Production: requires students to produce discourse that is understandable to others. Strategies for Language Learning Skills that pertain to becoming more effective as language learners are identified. Language Quality Language quality as a measure of communicative proficiency is not synonymous with meaningful communication. It is possible to communicate meaning with relative degrees of quality. Quality is defined using three criteria: Accuracy: primarily involves the grammatical system of a language. Fluency: involves the ease with which communication is expressed or received. Coherency: relates to the connectness of information, thoughts and ideas within discourse. While the communicative approach to teaching second languages emphasizes the primacy of function over form, the qualitative features of language use must not be dismissed nor delayed during instruction. Ignoring skills in these areas tends to lead to a fossilization of language development regardless of continued instruction or language use.Individuals are able to function relatively well in the second language, understanding and being understood, but are viewed by the language community as having a \"broken\" language or \"pidgin\" language. Language Functions Language functions are those which students are expected to be able to perform in the language use contexts. They include: /G78 Giving and Getting Information /G78 Socializing and Celebrating /G78 Interpreting Discourse /G78 Researching /G78 Producing Discourse.Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Second Language Outcomes / 91 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000INSTRUCTIONAL FOCUSLevel 1 (K-Gr. 1) In the first level of second language development, students learn that the Aboriginal language is for using. The teacher uses pre-talk, concrete and visual aids, gestures and actions to help students understand what is beingsaid. Students find language learning much easier when the activities are action oriented, predictable, repetitious, or familiar and relevant to their interests. Level 2 (Gr. 2-3) Students at this level are tied to familiar and basic situations in terms of language use, and they continue to interact with phrases and memorized expressions. The teacher continues to teach the cultural understandings and skills with active and concrete learning activities. Students continue to learn the language they need to operate in this context. They learn to respond to many more complex commands and concepts, but their spoken language lagsbehind as they lay the foundations for understanding. They hone their listening skills. Level 3 (Gr. 4-6) At this level, the students begin to rely less on memorized expressions and one word answers. They begin to produce sentences appropriate to particular situations. They move into learning more directly from the oral tradition. Level 4 (Gr. 7-8) At this level, the focus is on using the Aboriginal language as the medium of instruction in learning cultural skills from members of the community. The students make many errors as they push themselves to create more complex sentences. It is important in terms of their confidence that the contact theyhave with the community at this time is supportive and encouraging. The teacher uses language to provide constructive feedback and error correction to ensure that the students continue to develop accuracy. Level 5 (Gr. 9-10) At this stage, the students are introduced to learning directly from the oral tradition and the Elders of the community, in a less sheltered way. Language skills focus on strategies for accessing and interpreting the oral tradition. Level 6 (Gr. 11-12) In this final stage of learning before leaving school, students are given opportunities to explore language and culture as career choices. They continue in their study of cultural content but integrate it into projects that they can undertake in cooperation with individuals, businesses and institutions involved in the communication, research and translation oflanguage and culture.92 / Second Language Outcomes Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 121.

A solid school-based language program may seem to provide a solution, but research into threatened languages has shown that a school program is only effective if there is a strong base of community support for the revitalization of its language (Ayoungman,1995; Crawford, 1996; Fishman, 1996; Flores, 1993). A successful school program routinely involves members of the community whose interests are meant to be served by the program. Such a program includes the stakeholders in a collaborative process of decision making so that they can agree on the aims and intended outcomes of a curriculum. For Aboriginal language and cultureprograms this is especially true. Parents and community members of Aboriginal students are particularly aware of the need to maintain local control over programs so that their interests and unique cultural perspectives are reflected in the curricula that serve their children. The Common Curriculum Framework for Aboriginal Language and Culture Programs, Kindergarten to Grade 12: Western Canadian Protocol for Collaboration in Basic Education has been developed in a collaborative and consensual manner. However, beyond this curriculum Framework , there lie many other levels of commitment and collaborative decision making in order for Aboriginal language programs to become a reality in any one school. Regardless of the approach a community chooses, it must plan and develop its program against the backdrop of the threat of language extinction. IDENTIFYING THE CULTURAL AUTHORITY Which cultural community will be used as the cultural authority andresource base is often a political decision, especially in urban schools with increasing mixes of Aboriginal cultures represented in classrooms. Though this decision may be difficult to make, it is essential that eachprogram be supported with a cultural community. Educators and program developers from across the Western provinces and territories have responded to this problem in various ways. The notion of \"host\" culture can be considered; this means that the Aboriginal group native to the land is the group whose protocols, culture and language are used and taught in public institutions. In othercases, the majority culture that is represented in the backgrounds of the students can be used as a basis for the decision. In yet other cases, local Aboriginal advisory groups are asked to make the decision. If cultural and financial resources permit, ideally, there should be provision for all the languages and their cultures.112 / Language and Culture Program Development Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12IDENTIFYING THE CURRENT SITUATION Those few communities that appear strong in their language retentionmay wonder if language revitalization is of concern to them. Given what we know about language loss, it is fair to say that all Aboriginal languages face the threat, however remote it may seem. The degree of language loss can be best described as a continuum, and eachAboriginal community must seriously consider its place on the continuum and take measures to shore up its strength for the future. Fishman (1991) emphasizes that each community and each language situation has its own best strategy and solution based on the degree of language loss. He identified eight levels of language loss in acommunity and what the most effective strategy might be in reversing the language shift. His analysis, which is summarized in the following chart, is accompanied with suggestions for the kinds of strategies or actions that would be most appropriate for varying situations. Fishman's work suggests that identification of the current situation is essential to deciding what action to take. Communities wishing todevelop culture and language programs would be wise to examine carefully the level of language loss in their community and design their programs accordingly. Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Language and Culture Program Development / 113 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000 Levels of Language Loss and Appropriate Strategies Community Profile Appropriate Mix of Program Components Level 8: Worst level of language loss /G78 Only the elderly are able to speak. /G78 The elderly are dispersed throughout the area and not in communication with each other to any significantdegree. /G78 Gather, collect stories, verify or authenticate information. /G78 Collect language samples. /G78 Linguists to establish grammar, phonology and dictionaries. /G78 If resources are limited, they should be used for recording the language rather than for teachinggrammar, literacy and vocabulary to students. Level 7 /G78 Only the older generation is able to speak with fluency. /G78 The older generation forms a community and can be quite active. /G78 The older generation of people enjoy one another 's company because they can communicate with oneanother. They tend not to enjoy communicating withyoung children because of the difficulties making themselves understood. /G78 There is a middle-aged generation of people who can speak at an intermediate level of proficiency but who do not feel comfortable enough to teach or to use thelanguage all the time. /G78 Middle-aged facilitators, language teachers, community leaders take the initiative to organize andcreate conditions where the elder generation isinteracting and communicating with the younger;e.g., day-care, hunts, camps, family gatherings. This strengthens the language of this group that can then begin working with the younger people with thepresence of Elders. /G78 At this stage, resist tendency to ask for political protection of language. Financial support is moreimportant, but local community and people should beinitiating and running programs suggested above. /G78 Elders can be brought together with the young students to teach particular active skills. No oral tradition in First Nations language until students have a good block of time to spend in immersionwith the Elders. Level 6 /G78 There is a sprinkling of young people who can speak the language. /G78 Some families use the community language, most do not. /G78 The goal here is to ensure that the speakers of the language use their language at home, during social/cultural gatherings, and during events created to foster the language. /G78 Fostering greater community language use can be done if a few committed individuals can create a\"movement \" to preserve the language and culture in the community, including the school. /G78 The school has an important role at this level if the families are supporting the language at home and inthe community where students can hear and use the language other than just at school. /G78 Schools should be focusing on second language techniques along with cultural experience. 114 / Language and Culture Program Development Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 Community Profile Appropriate Mix of Program Components Level 5 /G78 There exists a relatively strong endoglossic situation, but it is still not stable with fewer and fewer youngfamilies using the language in their homes. /G78 Similar to level 6, strong community organization and sense of \"missionary zeal \" in consistent use of language in cultural and social situations is required. /G78 Also attempts should be made to increase use of the language by intensifying the cultural activity withinthe community. /G78 Community radio, community papers, community television stations should be established. /G78 Schools should be focusing on second language techniques along with cultural experience. /G78 Literacy should be introduced as part of the movement to strengthen the hold of the language sothat the language can be used for more functions than exist in oral language cultures. Level 4 /G78 Strong endoglossic language presence. People are using only their language for certain basic living andcultural functions. /G78 It is at this point that political work is needed to get recognition for the language so that it can beextended into use in some of the official business ofthe community. /G78 Bilingual education, where academic subjects are taught in the language, is of value at this point. /G78 Work in \"modernizing \" the language is required. Level 3 /G78 Strong endoglossic language in community. /G78 Relatively large concentrations of people who use the language comfortably. /G78 Attempts should be made at the political level to have language accepted in the workplace. Level 2 /G78 Language is accepted in the workplace. /G78 Problem of \"brain drain \" with most talented speakers going to work where economic rewards are greater. /G78 Attempts should be made to get language recognized and offered in all levels and arms of government.

A third alternative, which is more often requested than the first language program, is the bilingual program. First Language Programs Communities that have a number of students speaking an Aboriginal language as their first language could opt for a program of Aboriginal language arts. Because culture is foundational to such a program, it would be more than simply a language program. It would require the time and financial resources to enable cultural content to be included in the entire school program, even when instruction in academic subjects is in English or French. Although instruction of the entire academic program in an Aboriginal language may appear to provide an opportunity to revitalize Aboriginal languages, such programs may actually be putting the languages at risk. Some have noted that the teaching of subjects such as social studies andmathematics drains badly needed energy and resources from true revitalization of the language \u2014that is, the use of the Aboriginal language for local cultural and social activity (Ruiz, 1995; Fishman, 1991). The argument is that Aboriginal languages have not been used for academic purposes and so the resources and teachers needed toprovide academic programs in an Aboriginal language are not available. The Framework identifies six levels of outcomes that are based on cognitive development levels. Because the Framework intends that cultural and language outcomes be integrated, it is possible to offer anAboriginal language arts program that reflects both the students ' chronological ages and their language skill level. For example, students entering the program in the middle years or at the high school level can receive instruction that is more culturally advanced but is still in keeping with the language skill level that bests reflects their abilities. Second Language Programs In a second language program, the Aboriginal language is taught as a separate subject. Successful second language programs in provincial jurisdictions and First Nations ' schools need a support system in terms of financial and human resources. To ensure this support is in place, Aboriginal language policies can be developed that outline such issuesas adequate time allocation. Other areas of support for a second language program are policies dealing with human resources in providing an appropriate pay scale for noncertified Aboriginal language instructors. 116 / Language and Culture Program Development Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 The Framework attempts to conceive second language learning, particularly Aboriginal language learning, in a more integrated and holistic way. Because communities choosing second language programs tend to be communities with a high level of language loss, and because culture and language are so entwined, the Framework encourages language learning within the context of cultural experience that is planned into the program. It is suggested that, rather than skipping the initial levels of culture, second language learners be \"telescoped \" so that they cover several levels within a short period of time until they feel challenged and comfortable. Due partly to limited time, and partly to the inability of second language learners to handle as much content as first language learners, cultural content in second language programs will be limited. The scope of cultural content suggested in the Framework is intended for the first language learner. The depth and scope of content taught in second language programs should be determined by developers who arefamiliar with the existing level of support in each school. The Framework recommends a proficiency-based approach to Aboriginal second language instruction. For more information on this approach, please refer to the Second Language Outcomes section. Although the amount of content that can be covered will be severely hampered at the lower levels of language proficiency, by level 3 or 4 in the second language outcomes the students should be functional enough in the language to handle much more cultural content. The developer isadvised to take this into consideration when planning the program. Bilingual Programs In both the territories and the Western provinces, legislative provisions exist that permit languages other than English to be used aslanguages of instruction in public education. This legislation has led to the emergence of partial immersion programs in various languages. These partial immersion programs are often called bilingual programs. They can be designed to meet the needs of first language speakers or as intensive second language programs, depending on the student clientelethey serve. In a partial immersion or bilingual program in which the language of instruction is an Aboriginal language, that language is used to teach not only language arts but also selected content subjects. As noted above, the benefit of bilingual programs in the revitalization of language has been questioned because of the time and effort that goes into the academic content over the cultural content. In communities that choose bilingual programs, the First Language Outcomes section of this Framework should be used as a basis for developing the academic program \u2014language arts in particular, but other core subjects as well. Because the Framework requires cultural learning to be the context and content for language learning, theAboriginal cultures should still form the basis of the bilingual program, despite its academic nature.Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Language and Culture Program Development / 117 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000Acquiring Resources The Framework is based on the assumption that cultural resources and opportunities for language use exist in the community. Although there is a common perception that appropriate resources are lacking, this may be because resources such as the oral traditions, the wisdom of the Elders and other resources that are central to cultural learning are notconsidered a legitimate part of language education. The cultural content of the Framework is composed of cultural understandings, cultural skills and personal development. An analysis of the resource needs of a program incorporating these componentsleads to a fuller appreciation of resources that exist in all communities and the place they have in the program. Figure 4 on the following page illustrates where many existing cultural resources can be identified and how they can be incorporated into a language and culture program. It is understood that the incorporation of these resources will take time and financial support, but when a program is justified and the need is recognized, such support follows. Integrating Subject Area Content into Language and Culture Programs Most attempts at integrating Aboriginal perspectives and subject area content involve the integration of the Aboriginal content into the academic program. Thus, Aboriginal cultures are examined usinganthropological, political, economic and scientific constructs. It is possible to reverse the direction of integration so that the academic skills and concepts are integrated into an Aboriginal culture and language program. Such a reversal provides a new way of perceiving the understandings and assumptions of the academic disciplines, andallows a more explicit and judicial adoption of their skills and concepts into Aboriginal life. Many academic areas relate somewhat to the relationship areas that comprise the Aboriginal perspective. For example, Laws of SacredLife embody such academic areas as arts education and psychology; Laws of Nature embody geography and economics, among other areas; Laws of Mutual Support embody such areas as social studies and political science. Of course, there is much overlap and it must be understood that, according to Aboriginal perspective, the areas are notseparated into discrete study areas but are part of cultural learning. To some extent, academic content is already integrated into the cultural content of the Framework . Schools may opt to integrate fully the academic subjects, thus bringing all teachers into the language and culture program, or they may wish to leave the extent of integration at the level provided for by the Framework . grammar activitiestechnology, art, craft, instructionart \"how to\" films Cultural ExperienceRelated Traditional Narratives Related Cultural Skills /G78 Creating cultural products /G78 Using natural materials /G78 Land skills /G78 Food preparation /G78 Formal gatherings /G78 Protocol /G78 Storytelling /G78 SingingLanguage and Concept Development Activities Related Contemporary Reflections on Aboriginal Issues /G78 Spiritual elements /G78 Land elements /G78 People relationship elements /G78 Personal development elementsReflections: One's Relationship with the Cultural Experience /G78 Spiritual elements /G78 Land elements /G78 People relationship elements /G78 Personal development elements workplacescommunity servicesspiritual teaching speakers documentariesnovels, songs, poems editorialsmanualsaudio electronic dramatizationin person Concept Development Resources (audio, visual, print, electronic) Language Development Resources (audio, visual, print, electronic)storybooksgamesactivity books vocabulary activities mentorshipinformation texts sentence pattern activities land camps community gatherings dramasstorytellingspecial sites, rites artaudio-visual rituals, ritesResource Needs Assessment demonstrations literacy Creation /G78Personal Spiritual experience /G78 Historical /G78Entertainment /G78 Cultural understanding /G78 Understanding about the language /G78 On the land /G78 In the home /G78 At school /G78 In the community Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Language and Culture Program Development / 119 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000Assessing Student Progress Personal development is the goal of cultural education. This being the case, student assessment of the cultural outcomes is best tied to the personal development outcomes, not the cultural understandings or the cultural skills. This is very much in keeping with the goals and purposes of Aboriginal language education. Though great pains aretaken to teach students the vocabulary and the patterns of the language, the test is in how the students use these in order to communicate and participate in cultural activity. The outcomes provided in this Framework are not based on norm- referenced tests or field-based tests. As such it would be inaccurate and inappropriate to suggest that the Framework be used as a basis for normative testing of students. In addition, empirical and normative testing are inconsistent with the holistic nature of Aboriginal culture and language programs. Much work is currently under way in the area of holistic student assessment. It is suggested that developers and teachers take every opportunity to learn about new methods and tools, and apply them in their language and culture programs. In the meantime, the following suggestions may be of use: /G78 base student assessment on individual progress according to the continuum of learning provided in the outcomes sections of theFramework , particularly in the area of personal development /G78 involve the Elders in developing authentic means of assessing student progress /G78 tie student progress in language ability to their use of language in social and cultural activity /G78 develop descriptive tools, such as rubrics, to provide \"pictures\" of how student integration of culture and language use might look at the different levels /G78 assess student progress continuously, rather than only as the summation of a unit of study /G78 involve students in the assessment of their own learning /G78 share the results of assessments in a holistic manner, rather than as a mark or letter grade alone /G78 use the data from student assessments to continuously evaluate and enhance the program. It is hoped that this Framework will provide an opportunity for dialogue and research in the area of student assessment in culture and language programs. There is no doubt that, in time and with experience, the Framework outcomes will be adjusted to reflect the reality of the classrooms and their communities. 120 / Language and Culture Program Development Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12Identifying Content As stated earlier in this document, the term Aboriginal perspective is a generic term. Developers of each language and culture program need to identify specific cultural content to bring the Framework to life, and to bring language and culture together in the program. The content must come from the cultural community in which the program is beingdeveloped. In any type of culture and language program, the use of themes can be particularly beneficial in planning units of study. Themes allow for the integration of cultural understandings, cultural experiences, culturalskills (including language skills) and student reflection. Articulation between cultural activity and language skill development is not easy, either in planning or in teaching, even once the content has been identified. In situations where programs are not given more time than the usual second language allotments, it will be especially important to plan and use the time well so that maximal languagegrowth occurs while teaching the cultural content. It is hoped that this Framework and the examples provided in the Appendix will assist planners and practitioners in bringing language and culture together in a seamless and authentic manner. Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal Appendix / 121 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12 June 2000APPENDIX: INCORPORATING SPECIFIC CULTURAL CONTENT On the pages that follow are several examples to illustrate how the Framework can be used in planning for a specific cultural community. There are several things to note about the sample plans. Firstly, they are not all the same in terms of how they present a theme or structure the outcomes. However, they have in common a perspective-based identification of cultural outcomes. The plans illustrate how the generic Framework allows for the identification of specific cultural concepts, values, practices and products. They are illustrations of how the local cultural environment acts as a starting point. Secondly, none of the plans includes specified language outcomes or activities. The language use in context is implicit in all of them, and it is possible to see where language is being used and for what cultural purpose. Identifying language outcomes is a necessary next step fordevelopers, and one which involves the more rigorous use of the language outcomes portion of the Framework . Particularly for second language programs, without such specification, there is a probability that lessons will focus on the cultural outcomes without the language skills being addressed. The Appendix represents an attempt by specific cultural communities to take the Framework and develop outlines based on appropriate themes, relevant for the particular culture. The Appendix includes samples only, developed by a limited number of cultural communities. It doesnot represent the full range of Aboriginal cultures in the Western provinces and the territories. The development of the Appendix was, however, a check for the Western Canadian Protocol Working Group to ensure that the Framework is practical and inclusive.122 / Appendix Western Canadian Protocol Framework for Aboriginal June 2000 Language and Culture Programs - Kindergarten to Grade 12From Dene Kede Gr. 7-8-9 Curriculum, Gov.
