Acute skin reaction s were observed in two radiotherapy patients with differing 8 timelines of RT and vaccinations.

The actual incidence of RRP in 14 conjunction with Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine or any other vaccine against Covid -19, is unknown. 15 For cancer patients being treated with radiation with significant dose to skin, consideration 16 should be given to the probability of RRP side -effects from vaccinations against COVID -19. 17 18 Introduction : 19 Radiation Recall Phenomenon (RRP) is a late effect , acute skin reaction associated with 20 therapeutic irradiation , triggered by something other than radiation . It usually appears more than 21 BLINDED Revised Manuscript (Unmarked)one week after the completion of radiation therapy and is typically localized to the radiotherapy 22 field entry points . The RRP is frequently wrongly misinterpreted for radio -sensiti zation if the 23 skin reaction appears within 7 days following radiation treatment (1). 24 The radiation recall syndrome was first described by D'Angio et al in 1959 ( 2). 25 Though oncologists are generally aware of RRP , littl e is known about its pathophysiology. 26 Burris H.A. et al , summarized the theories of RRP (3). The increased sensitivity of the stem cells 27 in the field of radiation may result in an acute reaction to subsequent chemotherapy and 28 idiosyncratic drug hypersensitivity reactions ( 1). The level of inflammation -mediating cytokines 29 induced by radiation may be upregulated by chemotherapeutic agents (4). 30 Although the development of RR P is usually associated with cytotoxic drugs, there are several 31 non-cancer treatment remedies which can evoke this syndr ome ( 5,6,7,8 ,9). 32 Although RRP mostly presents in a mild form, in just under 10% of cases symptoms can be 33 severe , and include moist desquamation in areas other than skin folds, and bleeding can be 34 induced by minor trauma or abrasion (10). 35 The decision to utilize systemic cancer treatment s in conjunction with radiotherapy is frequently 36 limited by the risk for developing devastating skin reaction s. In order to decrease the risk of 37 severe RRP it is usually recommended to increase the time interval between radiation therapy 38 and the start of chemotherapy (11). 39 The regulations imposed for the COVID - 19 pandemic is challenging for a wide community of 40 cancer patients , often requiring isolation and restricted visitation. 41 Clinical oncologists who deal with the administration of multiple systemic treatment s and 42 radiation therapy , must now factor Covid -19 vaccination into their treatment paradigms . 43 The official website of the American Society of Clinical Oncology states , \"At this time, patients 44 undergoing treatment may be offered vaccination against COVID -19 as long as any components 45 of the vaccine are not contraindicated. Strategies such as providing the vaccine in between cycles 46 of therapy and after appropriate waiting periods can be used to reduce the ri sks while 47 maintaining the efficacy of vaccination\" ( 12). The evolving dramatic changes in view of 48 COVID -19 are beyond the discussion of this report. The RRP we observed associated with 49 Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine was reported to the management of the Tel Aviv Medical Center 50 following a process regulat ed by the Israel Ministry of Health . 51 52 Materials and Methods: 53 In our radiotherapy department, w e observed two patients who developed acute skin reaction s in 54 previously irradiated areas after receiving two doses of Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine . The reactions 55 were diagnosed as RRP. 56 Case Presentation -- Patient No. 1: 57 A 68-year-old otherwise healthy male was diagnosed with a metastatic soft tissue sarcoma 58 (unclassified spindle cell sarcoma) involving the soft tissues of the posterior chest wall, and one 59 lesion in the right lung. Preoperative radiation therapy of 50 Gy in 25 fractions with electrons 60 (mixed 9 and 12 MeV) prescribed to 90% isodose level, with 0.5 cm bolus over the entire field 61 was delivered to his back (Fig 1a). 62 Over the last two weeks of the electron course, the patient received SBRT, 50 Gy in 5 fraction s 63 to a lesion in the right lower lobe . Two months after the RT, t he patient underwent a complete 64 resection of the residual disease in the posterior chest wall . This was followed by an additional 65 course of SBRT to two other lesions, 45 Gy in 5 fractions (Fig 2). The patient did not receive 66 any systemic chemotherapy during the observed period , nor any therapeutic drugs known to 67 cause RRP . 68 Six months following the initial RT to the posterior chest wall, the patient received his first 69 Covid -19 vaccination , followed by a second shot 21 days later . This sequence of RT and 70 vaccinations is detailed in the timeline (Fig. 3). 71 Five days after the second shot of the vaccine , an acute skin reaction developed , associated with 72 pain, burning sensation, redness and m ild skin exfoliation in the area of the post erior chest wall 73 electron field (Fig 1 b). It can be seen that the electron port shape closely resembles the 74 erythematic area. 75 The RRP was treated symptomatically with topical steroids and pain killers. The reaction 76 resolved within a few days . No pulmonary symptoms were reported , and no RRP developed in 77 areas other than described. 78 79 Case Presentation -- Patient No. 2: 80 A 64-year-old male , otherwise healthy, suffering from metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (solitary 81 fibrous tumor) received radiation to two treatment sites: lumbar vertebrae after surgery for spinal 82 cord compression , and subsequent palliative radiotherapy to a painful metastatic lesion in the 83 right chest wall . 84 The lumbar spine was treated by two posterior oblique 6 MV photon fields ( Fig. 4) which 85 provided partial skin sparing . 86 The chest wall tumor was treated with two tangential 6 MV photon fields with 0.5 cm bolus 87 cover ing the treatment area resulting in coverage of the target with high but tolerable skin dose 88 (Fig 5a). 89 The first shot of vaccine was administered five days prior to the conclusion of the RT. The 90 second dose of vaccine followed 21 days later, approximately two weeks after cessation of RT . 91 This sequence is detailed in the timeline (Fig 6). 92 Six days following the second vaccination , an acute skin reaction was noted, manifested by skin 93 rednes s and itching sensation . No local therapy nor pain killers were needed. The reaction faded 94 slowly within the following week (Fig 5b). 95 RRP was not observed on the skin covering the lumbar spine . 96 97 Discussion: 98 One of the promising ways to overcome the COVID -19 pandemic is through recently developed 99 vacci nes. For some radiotherapy patients , receiving the high ly effective vaccination will 100 supersede any low risk RRP side-effects that potentially may occur from concurrent or prior 101 radiotherapy . To the best of our knowledge, our clinic al observations are the first RRP reported 102 following administration of the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine for COVID -19. The real incidence of 103 this phenomenon is unknown. We cannot conclude nor predict the elapsed time following 104 radiation therapy that will not induce RRP . Notable, in one of our patients the RRP erythema 105 appeared 6 months after the radiation exposure , the other occurrence only shortly after the 106 cessation of radiotherapy . Similarly, the determination of a radiation dose threshold responsible 107 for RRP cannot be estimated from this small observation . 108 109 Conclusion: 110 For cancer patients, recommendations regarding vaccination are evolving. We observed in our 111 clinic the development of Radiation Recall Phenomenon in two patients with varying courses of 112 radiotherapy , seemingly triggered by a COVID -19 vaccine . Reasonable considerations should 113 be applied to decisions r egarding vaccination of on -treatment radiotherapy patients . Patients and 114 physicians should be aware of the potential for the RRP side -effect following Covid -19 115 vaccination. 116 117 References: 118 1. Camidge R, Price A.
