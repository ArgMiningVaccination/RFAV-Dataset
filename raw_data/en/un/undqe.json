Acupuncture is one of the oldest, most commonly used medical procedures in the world. It is a holistic system of medicine based on an energetic model rather than the biochemical model of Western medicine. To treat or prevent a disease, the holistic approach of acupuncture looks at a person as a whole, analyzes her/his physical, nutritional, environmental, emotional, and social wellbeing. All symptoms are, therefore, diagnosed in relation to the whole body and a customized treatment is provided to target the root cause (s) of the illness. Learn more information about Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine has been one of the cornerstones of Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Herbal medicine has a profound impact on health with minimal side effects in comparison to many Western medications. Chinese herbs are different from pharmaceutical drugs in that they are prescribed for patients on an individual basis. This means that a trained physician will combine a different combination of herbs in varying proportions for each patient, often changing the prescription for the same patient weekly depending upon the patient's progress. What is Homeopathy? How does it help? Homeopathy has been in use worldwide for over 200 years and is the second most practiced form of medicine for primary care in the world today. Homeopathy is a safe, effective, FDA regulated natural medicine that has been used for a wide range of illnesses. Homeopathic remedies act by stimulating the body's own defense mechanism and healing system. They do not have any chemical action, therefore, they do not have the potential to cause any sustained damage, no known side effects and are non-addictive. Tuina Therapy can help with pain Tuina is a hands on form of a manipulative therapy often used in conjunction with acupuncture and herbal formulas. One of Tuina's many advantages over simple massage is its ability to focus on specific problems, especially chronic pain associated with the muscles, joints, and skeletal system. It's especially effective for joint pain (such as arthritis), sciatica, muscle spasms, back, neck, and shoulder pain. It also helps chronic conditions such as insomnia, constipation, headaches (including migraines), and the tension associated with stress. Cupping can help with muscle tension Cupping is a technique usually used in conjunction with acupuncture, but it could also be used as as a stand alone therapy. Cupping involves placing suction cups on the skin and creating a vacuum by suctioning out the air. Putting cups over a region helps the body reverse loss of muscle, adhesions in fascia and the decrease in blood flow due to injury or age. Homeopathic Injection Therapy Homeopathic Injection therapy is an effective and an inexpensive way to promote the natural regulatory processes in the body that reduce inflammation, enhance the body's natural immunity and promote healing and better health. Injection therapy can help with generalized pain, regulate inflammation, reduce muscle pain and increase the range of motion in joints. BOOK AN APPOINTMENT Save time, book your Appointment Online!
