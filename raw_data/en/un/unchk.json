And whether you visit an Eastern or Western practitioner for fatigue, you're likely to receive the same advice: Look for ways to add more balance to your life. Fatigue is a clue that your body is not functioning at its optimum. When our energy levels decline is most often a symptom of a broader health issue. And the best way to increase our energy supply is to address the underlying health issues causing fatigue in the first place. Some of the main reasons for lack of energy can be related to digestion. When you don't get enough nourishment from the food you eat your energy. There are many reasons your food may not provide all the nourishment you need. If something isn't not functioning well with one of your digestive organs, or your sleep quality is not ideal it will impact your digestion. Your energy consumption will suffer if you don't fall asleep easily, you have a difficult time staying asleep, or you don't get enough quality sleep. Another contributor to low energy levels may be a hormonal imbalance or raging inflammation that distracts your body from its daily tasks as it has to work so hard to fight this internal inflammation. 5 Methods to Increase Your Energy 1. Acupuncture [Acupuncture](https://www.healingelephant.com/acupuncture/) is a safe and effective alternative to medication and, in some cases, surgery to help you increase your energy. Acupuncture works by encouraging the release of endorphin hormones naturally. These hormones help relieve pain. Through the insertion of needles into certain acupuncture points, they stimulate the release of these hormones Therapeutic effects include: - Pain relief - Increased energy - Improved mood - Improved body function 2. Diet Changes Diet plays a key role in improving your energy. When you're gut health is out of balance so is everything else in your body. Natural energy boosters to combat fatigue with dietary changes include: abstaining from alcohol, reducing sugar intake, and consuming fewer processed foods. Increase your water intake and eat a balanced diet to begin improving your gut health. 3. Herbal Support Most medicines began as plants, herbs, and natural remedies. Only in the modern age have scientists been able to use chemicals to create what we know as drugs. Traditional Chinese Medicine uses a variety of traditional herbs to help reduce fatigue and boost energy. 4. Get More Sleep In addition to creating an environment that allows for a better night's sleep, it's important to reduce your stress throughout the day. Try incorporating mindful restfulness each day. Meditation, quiet reading, or just sitting still outside to enjoy nature are all forms of mindfulness practices. 5.
