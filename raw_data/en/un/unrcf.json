Garrett, FACHE, CEO Hackensack Meridian HealthThis time of year, many of us make promises to ourselves to live healthier lifestyles in the coming months, whether through exercise or diet. There is no denying the tremendous impact of a healthy diet and regular exercise on our overall health. If you need a little inspiration for setting some unique goals for the new year, turn to the back of this magazine for our ideas. Or, check out tips for a great workout for your heart on page 5 and what you should know about intermittent fasting on page 7. Aside from diet and exercise, an equally important aspect of a healthy lifestyle is getting the right health screenings at the right time. Screenings are medical tests that check for diseases and health conditions, ideally before they become a problem for your health. Your health is unique to you, and many things can influence which screenings you should get and when. Talk to your doctor about which screenings may be right for you and when you should get them. We've also created an at-a-glance guide for screenings that may be right for you: HMHforU.org/Screening . If you delayed or skipped necessary medical care because of fear of COVID-19 exposure and limited access during the pandemic, it's the perfect time to put your health first by getting caught up. If you have a chronic condition and put off care, make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can ( HMHforU.org/FindADoc ). If you need support managing stress, sadness or anxiety; have suicidal thoughts; or are experiencing addiction issues, take advantage of available mental health resources ( HMHforU.org/MentalHealth ). A little effort today can go far to ensure many healthy tomorrows. By making time for our health now, we can help prevent being forced to make time for later as a result of illness.

Finding some form of exercise you actually enjoy can make that easier. You can also break up the sessions to fit your schedule, such as two 15-minute activities per day.iStock.com/Nadzeya_DzivakovaStretching is essential. Your whole body will benefit from regular exercise, but be sure to incorporate stretching, as well, so you don't tear or injure any muscles or joints. The good news is that stretching has benefits beyond the gym. It enhances your whole body's flexibility and range of movement, which can benefit you all day long. Warm up before engaging in strenuous exercise. This allows your heart rate to rise slowly and manageably, and prepares your muscles for the workout ahead, preventing injuries. Two sessions of strength training a week are recom - mended. This could include lifting weights, using resis - tance machines or any form of body-weight exercise. Stronger muscles help you with daily activities and prevent injuries as you continue to exercise. Exercises that help you relax and unwind are also powerful ways to prevent heart disease. Yoga is a great option, training both the body and the mind.

You have to eat healthy foods and meals within your caloric limit.\" 5Intermittent fasting may not be sustainable in the long run. \"There is a higher drop-out rate among intermittent fasters versus those on a calorie-restrictive diet, which suggests that fasting may not be a sustainable approach,\" Dr. Dontineni says. \"It's a quick way to lose weight, but you can't really do this for more than a few weeks.\" If hunger is a concern, don't be afraid to break the fast. \"Listen to your body,\" Dr. Dontineni says. \"If you find yourself getting light-headed, shaky or low-energy from not eating enough, grab some healthy food.\" Nripen Dontineni, M.D. Internal medicine specialist 800-822-8905 South Plainfield Looking to try intermittent fasting? Talk to your primary care doctor first. Find one near you at HMHforU.org/FindADoc .EAT WELLiStock.com/Nadzeya_Dzivakova/ulimiHave you ever had a \"gut feeling\" about a situation? Or maybe you get butterflies in your stomach when you're nervous? You may even feel like you need to run to the restroom when your anxiety kicks in. Our gut has a lot to say when it comes to our mental health, and it plays a key role in our overall well-being. Your intestinal wall stores 70 percent of the cells that make up your immune system. An unwell gut will lead to more health problems down the road. Stress, depression and anxiety can negatively affect our gastrointestinal system. \"Research has found that the gastrointestinal system and central nervous system are in constant communication,\" says Donald J. Parker, LCSW , president, Behavioral Health Care Transformation Services. \"This relationship is referred to as the gut-brain axis. Psychological factors can impact how your GI tract moves and contracts. Vice versa, an unhealthy GI tract can cause you to experience depression, anxiety, brain fog and more.\" Is Your GI Tract Unhealthy? Some signs that your GI tract is unhealthy are: }Rectal bleeding }Chronic abdominal pain }Weight fluctuation }Persistent fatigue }Food intolerance Learn more about behavioral health services at Hackensack Meridian Health at HMHforU.org/MentalHealth .How Gut Health Is Linked to Mental Health How to Keep Your GI Tract in Top Shape It's important to keep your GI tract in tip-top shape. Here are tips for cleaning up your gut and, in turn, supporting your mental health: Improve Your Diet: If you're experiencing a great deal of inflammation and irritation of the gut, consider eliminat - ing dairy and gluten from your diet, as well as eating more organic and colorful fruits and vegetables. These steps may help heal your GI tract. Adding high-fiber and fermented foods to your diet will be useful, too. If you want additional guidance on how you can clean up your diet, consider nutri - tional counseling. Take Time for Self-Care: Stress, depression and anxiety have a huge impact on your gut health. Putting time aside to meditate and journal at some point during your day may help alleviate some of these feelings. Of course, there are times when our mental health may be too much to handle on our own. When additional support is needed, consider making an appointment with a mental health professional.Stormy Weather Chowder Serves 4-6 Ingredients 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 1 \u00bd cups broccoli, chopped 1 large sweet potato, peeled and cubed 1 cup mushrooms, sliced 1 medium onion, chopped 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 cups nonfat milk 1 15-ounce can whole kernel corn, drained 1 cup green beans 1 red bell pepper, chopped 1 tablespoon basil \u00bd teaspoon salt and optional dash black pepper Steps In a large soup pot, bring broth, broccoli and sweet potato to boil.

Jasmine Baez, M.D., weighs in: Getting IV fluids to make your headache, fatigue and nausea disappear may sound more appealing than lying in bed until the unpleasant symptoms pass, but there's no medical evidence to this type of treatment. There's no cure for a hangover, but there are remedies that offer relief:How can I stay regular? Chintan Modi, M.D., weighs in: Normal bowel movement frequency depends on the person, their diet and their upbringing. For some peo - ple, being \"regular\" means having a bowel movement once a week; for others, it's twice a day. Color and consistency are also unique to the individual. What you should be concerned about isn't so much regularity, but a dramatic change in what has been normal for you. When most people ask about staying regular, they really want to know how to avoid constipation. How to avoid constipation:Should I be concerned about secondhand vaping? Kishore Ratkalkar, M.D., weighs in: Vaping and secondhand vaping are just as dangerous as smoking and secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoking is the process whereby a bystander inhales both the smoke that comes from burning either a cigarette or a pipe and the smoke that is exhaled by the smoker into the air. Vaping is a little different given that it doesn't burn and there is no smoke, but the process of inhaling secondhand fumes is essentially the same. Allowing vapor to enter your body\u2014even as a bystander\u2014puts you at risk for health concerns similar to those associated with secondhand smoking. Should I drink apple cider vinegar? Elliot Rudnitzky, M.D., weighs in: Apple cider vinegar hasn't been shown to aid with weight loss, despite what you may have read on social media, and it may be harmful if you ingest it the wrong way or at the wrong time of day. You may know someone who swears that apple cider vinegar has helped them curb their appetite or lose weight, but that information is not research-proven. Because apple cider vinegar is highly acidic, some people experi - ence acid reflux after consuming it. People who are prone to heartburn, acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease should not consume anything acidic 30-60 minutes before bedtime to minimize the chances of experiencing burning and discomfort.

Plus, treatment options can be less aggressive and better tolerated when cancer is detected early, so having regular mammograms is crucial.\" While there is no concrete way to prevent breast cancer, annual mammograms have reduced the mortality rate by 40 percent. Routine breast cancer screening is important for all women because most women who get breast cancer have no family history of breast cancer or significant risk factors. \"In addition to these general guidelines, women of color have the highest breast cancer mortality rate and are more likely to receive an advanced-stage diagnosis,\" Dr. Borofsky says. \"All women should have a risk assessment before age 30, so those at higher risk can be identified\u2014especially women of color and of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.\" Source: American College of Radiology Find a breast imaging location near you at HMHforU.org/BreastScreening .OnlineGoWhat to Know About Surgery to Reduce Risk One in eight American women will develop invasive breast cancer during her lifetime. Certain factors can make someone at higher risk of developing breast cancer\u2014notably, carrying a BRCA gene mutation in one's DNA. Is Genetic Testing Right for You? Genetic testing is encouraged for anyone who is at an increased risk of having inherited a gene mutation. You are more likely to have a BRCA gene mutation and should seek out genetic counseling and testing if you: }Have a relative with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation }Have a personal history of breast cancer and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry }Have or had breast cancer that was diagnosed before age 45 }Have a personal history of two or more types of cancer }Have one or more family members with breast cancer }Have a male relative with breast cancer }Have triple-negative breast cancer diagnosed before age 60 \"Genetic counseling is often recommended for those seeking genetic testing to help people better under - stand what their results mean in regard to their health,\" explains Renee Armour, M.D. , breast surgeon at JFK University Medical Center . \"A positive test result Renee Armour, M.D. Breast surgeon 800-822-8905 Edison and Old Bridge Learn about comprehensive services for women at risk of or diagnosed with breast cancer: HMHforU.org/ BreastCancer .OnlineGomeans you carry the BRCA gene mutation, while a negative result means that no mutation was found.\" When to Consider Surgery If you test positive for a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation, you may want to consider the ways you can reduce the risk of developing cancer in the future. According to the National Cancer Institute, a prophylactic (preventive) mastectomy in women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by 90-95 percent. During a prophylactic mastectomy, surgeons remove one or both breasts before any breast cancer diagnoses to reduce the risk of breast cancer devel - oping in the future. \"The BRCA gene mutations are rare, affecting only 0.2 percent of the U.S. population, but it is always best to identify and reduce any potential risk of cancer as early as possible,\" says Dr. Armour. \"Undergoing a prophylactic mastectomy is a tremen - dous thing to consider, but it could potentially save a life.\" If you are at high risk of breast cancer, talk with your medical team about all of your options, and lean on the support and guidance of a breast surgeon, medical social worker and even mental health profes - sional to help you find the right path for you. \"The decision to have any surgery to reduce the risk of breast cancer is a major one,\" says Dr. Armour. 11 HackensackMeridianHealth.org 10HealthU Winter 2022health topics that matter the most to you Spotlight on U BREAST CANCERORTHOPEDIC HEALTH 12 13 Health U Winter 2022 HackensackMeridianHealth.orgSpotlight on UDo Broken Bones Heal Stronger? You might have heard the often-repeated notion about broken bones healing stronger than before, but it's simply not true. Have you ever heard someone say that when you break a bone, the healing process makes it stronger than it was in the first place? This often-repeated notion may give you the idea that after your broken bone heals, it will be tougher than ever and won't break again. But this isn't actually true. \"Having had a previous break won't protect you from breaking the same bone again if you happen to experience trauma to the same body part,\" says Michael T. Lu, M.D. , orthopedic surgeon at JFK University Medical Center and Raritan Bay Medical Center . \"Once your broken bone heals fully, it should be just as strong as the rest of your bones, so you won't be more or less likely to break it than another bone.\" What Happens When Your Bone Breaks After you break a bone, your body begins the healing process: }At first, a blood clot forms at the site, which protects the injured spot. }Within days, a special callus forms at the break, which gradually helps reconnect the broken edges of bone. }Initially, the callus is soft and made of collagen, but over time, it becomes harder due to calcium deposits that arrive to mend the bone. }New cells form at the fracture site, connecting the broken pieces together again. }Once the bone reconnects, the callus breaks down and the bone retains its original shape. Why the Break Site Is Briefly Stronger Than Surrounding Bone A doctor should put you in a cast to keep you immobilized while your bone is healing. Because you aren't using the injured body part while it's in a cast, the bone becomes weaker. (If you've ever seen someone's arms side by side after one arm was removed from a cast, you know the unused arm temporarily atrophies due to lack of use.) At the same time, the fracture site is being fortified with calcium deposits and building itself back up. For this brief period of time, the calcium-fortified region of bone may be stronger than the surrounding healthy bone, which has weakened due to lack of use. Strengthen Your Bones There are more reliable ways to strengthen your bones than waiting for a broken bone to heal. Try adopting these six healthy habits to help keep your bones healthy: 1Eat calcium-rich foods. Include cheese and other dairy products; green vegetables, such as kale and broccoli; and fortified foods and beverages, such as cereal and orange juice, in your diet. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium is 1,000 mg for women up to age 50 and men up to age 70; then, the RDA increases to 1,200 mg. 2Eat foods rich in vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium. Fish, including salmon and trout, is an excellent source of vitamin D, and some foods and beverages are fortified with the vitamin. The RDA is 15 mcg (600 IU) for adults up to age 70; then, the RDA increases to 20 mcg (800 IU). 3Exercise regularly. Weight-bearing exercise is best if you're able, such as running, walking, stair-climbing, dancing, hiking and lifting weights. 4Quit smoking. Smoking has been associated with weaker bones, and quitting will improve your health in immeasurable ways. 5Limit your alcohol intake. When women have more than one drink per day or men have more than two drinks per day, it increases the risk of osteoporosis. 6Ask your doctor if you need supplements. If your diet isn't rich in calcium and/or vitamin D, your doctor may suggest you take daily supplements to boost your intake of these nutrients.

Lu, M.D. Orthopedic surgeon 800-822-8905 Avenel and Morganville Hole in One For years, Eugene Fioravanti suffered from increasing shoulder pain. Thanks to a new surgery method, he now lives pain-free. Eugene Fioravanti, a 57-year-old teacher from Colonia, New Jersey, lives an active life. He loves to golf, body surf and powerlift. But all of that activity throughout his life took a toll. Over the years, he experienced shoulder pain that eventually became almost unbearable. He was unable to do simple things like household chores or tying his shoes. \"It wasn't one thing,\" says Eugene. \"It was cumulative wear and tear over the years. I used to throw newspapers every day for 23 years. I was diagnosed with a rotator cuff tear back in the early 2000s, and I just never wanted to take the time off to get surgery. So basically I 'grinned and beared it' for 20 years.\" Unexpected Opportunity When COVID-19 hit, Eugene saw it as an opportunity to get the surgery he needed all those years. Eugene's teaching went virtual, and working from home made the recovery process much easier. Eugene connected with Michael T. Lu, M.D. , an orthopedic surgeon at Raritan Bay Medical Center , who offered a relatively new type of surgery to fix Eugene's shoulder. \"For Eugene, we did what's called superior capsular reconstruction, or SCR,\" says Dr. Lu. \"Instead of repairing his rotator cuff tendon to the bone, like we traditionally would do, we arthroscopically implant a piece of tissue into his shoulder to substitute for his rotator cuff.\" Dr. Lu explains the surgery: When you patch a pair of jeans with a hole in the knee, if the hole is small, you can sew it back together, and it will work fine. However, with a larger hole, you need a patch to fill the space. In the case of surgery, a tissue graft plays the role of the patch and fills in the damaged rotator cuff, essentially replicating the missing tissue. \"SCR can be a good option for managing massive rotator cuff tears that cannot be repaired with more traditional techniques,\" Dr. Lu says. \"Studies have shown reliable improvements in pain, function and satisfaction for these difficult problems.\" 'Blown Away by the Results' In Eugene's case, this couldn't have been truer. \"I was blown away by the results,\" he says. He completed eight weeks of physical therapy and improved the entire time. However, it wasn't until a few months later during a vacation that he realized how much the surgery changed his life. \"Six months to the day, I was down in Myrtle Beach on vacation, and I was swimming in the ocean,\" he says. \"I could ride the waves again. That prompted me to call Dr. Lu and say thank you. I have my life back now\u2014it really means that much to me.\"Eugene Fioravanti is happy to be pain- free and back to one of his favorite pastimes: golfing. HEART HEALTH Grateful Heart Thanks to cardiac catheterization, TJ Bellissimo avoided a massive heart attack after a 90-percent blockage was found. At 54 years old, TJ Bellissimo of Manahawkin, New Jersey, felt pretty good. Once in a while he'd get a little discomfort in his chest, but he shrugged it off as a little indigestion. But one day while at work, the discomfort became something he couldn't ignore. \"I felt a lot of discomfort in my chest and started holding my chest,\" he says. TJ visited a nearby walk-in clinic, where the medical team told him he needed to get to a hospital right away. He drove himself to the emergency room at Southern Ocean Medical Center , where he was seen immediately. Searching for Answers Tests, including an electrocardiogram, chest X-rays and bloodwork, showed nothing out of the ordinary. With no indication that he was having a heart attack, TJ expected to be sent on his way, but interventional cardiologist Jasrai Gill, M.D. , insisted he have a cardiac catheterization. When Dr. Gill performed the cardiac catheter - ization, a 90-percent blockage was found in the left anterior descending artery. \"The need for a cardiac catheterization is based on critical aspects: a history and getting a good sense of the patient's story as well as objective evidence that helps you do a baseline risk assess - ment,\" Dr. Gill says. Following the cath - eterization, TJ was transferred to Jersey Shore University Medical Center in order for cardiologist James Orlando, M.D. , to put stents in his blocked arteries. \"If TJ's blockage hadn't been found when it was, he could have had a significant heart attack,\" Dr. Orlando says. An Excellent Prognosis TJ's blockage required two stents. But he didn't have any damage to his heart, which gave him an excellent prognosis following the stenting procedure. TJ will be on blood thinners for about a year, and he is taking part in cardiac rehab three days a week. \"I feel like a million bucks at this point. I'm so happy to be alive. And I'm so happy that I have my hospital and my doctors around me,\" TJ says. \"My care from all my doctors, all the nurses that touched me\u2014it just was a great experience.\" Check your risk for heart disease with a CT calcium scoring scan: HMHforU.org/CalciumScan . 14 15 Health U Winter 2022 HackensackMeridianHealth.orgSpotlight on U 5 64321 6 Ways to Avoid Heart Disease You know how important your heart is. Are you treating it with the care it deserves? Many people don't realize that their daily habits and lifestyles can overwork and damage their hearts. If you are not leading a heart-friendly lifestyle, it's time to take better care of your heart and yourself. Start with these changes.If You Smoke, Stop People who smoke have a greater risk for heart attacks compared to those who don't. \"Nicotine causes blood vessels to tighten and narrow, making it hard for blood to reach your heart muscle, and it temporarily raises blood pressure,\" explains Aaron Van Hise, D.O. , cardiologist at Old Bridge Medical Center . Plus, the carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke lessens the amount of oxygen that gets to the heart. If you smoke, talk with your health care provider about ways to quit. Medicines and nicotine replacements can help. Make Your Diet Heart-healthy Eating fatty foods plays a part in the buildup of fat in your arteries, which can lead to blockages and increase your risk for a heart attack. \"Limit red meats, salt, fried foods, sweets and added sugars,\" suggests Dr. Van Hise. \"Instead, opt for dairy products with 'good fats,' such as feta cheese, as well as other sheep and goat milk cheeses, like pecorino Romano; lean meats and fish; whole grains; and fruits and vegetables.\" Choose cooking oils made with unsaturated fats, such as canola and olive oils. Set Exercise Goals Exercise gets your heart pumping, helping your body use oxygen better and strengthening your heart. It can also decrease your blood pressure and the amount of fat in your blood. \"Talk with your health care provider before starting an exercise program, and begin slowly, especially if you haven't been active for a while,\" Dr. Van Hise recommends. Start with short sessions, such as 10-minute walks, and gradually increase the length of your workouts to at least 30 minutes, five days a week. Track Your Blood Pressure Blood pressure is the force against the walls of your blood vessels as blood flows through them. The harder your heart works, the greater your risk of having a heart attack. \"Make sure your blood pressure is in the healthy range or under control. New guidelines suggest keeping systolic pressure [the first number] less than 130 and diastolic pressure [the second number] less than 80. Making smart choices, like eating a diet low in sodium, exercising regularly, avoiding tobacco, reducing stress and limiting alcohol, will decrease your risk of developing high blood pressure,\" says Dr. Van Hise.Learn more about loving your heart with our informative classes: HMHforU.org/ Events , or learn more about cardiovascular services at Hackensack Meridian Health at HMHforU.org/Heart .OnlineGoAaron Van Hise, D.O. Cardiologist 800-822-8905 Manalapan, Old Bridge and Jackson Watch Your Weight Being overweight and obese are major risk factors for heart disease. If you are over - weight, losing weight can decrease your risk. Reaching or maintaining an ideal weight also helps lower your blood pressure and choles - terol levels. Stress Less \"Continued and elevated stress has been consistently linked to health problems, including an increased risk for heart disease and stroke,\" says Dr. Van Hise. Try to keep your stress level low by exercising, sharing your concerns with friends and family, and making some quiet time for yourself each day. In addition to making these healthy changes, don't forget about screenings. The American Heart Association recommends regular screening for heart disease risk beginning at age 20 and cholesterol tests every four to six years if you're at normal risk. iStock.com/miakievy Jasrai Gill, M.D. Interventional cardiologist 800-822-8905 Manahawkin, Toms River and Neptune James Orlando, M.D. Cardiologist 800-822-8905 Manahawkin, Toms River and NeptuneNEUROSCIENCE When Layla Maloney was born in June 2020, the back of her head was a little flat, a common condition called plagiocephaly. Her mom, Stephanie Maloney, had worked in childcare, so she had seen children with what is sometimes called \"flat head syndrome.\" She knew she'd have to watch it for a few months. When Layla was 4 months old, her pediatri - cian recommended she be fitted for a helmet to help eliminate the flatness and shape her head. But after reviewing Layla's brain scans taken in advance of a helmet fitting, the helmet techni - cian thought Layla may have craniosynostosis and recommended seeing a specialist. Her pediatrician recommended neurosurgeon Thomas Steineke, M.D. , chief of the Division of Neurosurgery and chairman of the Neuroscience Institute at JFK University Medical Center . What Is Craniosynostosis? Craniosynostosis is a congenital anomaly in which the bones of a baby's skull fuse together too early and can lead to major neurological complications, Dr. Steineke says. When the skull bones join together too early, the skull can become misshapen as the soft skull bones shape to the baby's growing brain. The brain can also become compressed by the joined bones, which can restrict brain growth and lead to a build-up of pressure in the skull. The increased pressure results in a risk for blindness, seizures or brain damage. A Rare Diagnosis X-rays showed that Layla had lambdoid synos - tosis, a form of craniosynostosis in which the suture at the back of the skull closes too early, flattening the back side of the head. It is one of the rarest types of craniosynostosis and requires surgery\u2014a surgery in which Dr. Steineke and oral and maxillofacial surgeon Kayvon Haghighi, M.D., DDS , would need to remove the large plate at the back of Layla's skull, reshape it and replace it. It's a six-hour surgery with a risk of life-threatening bleeding. The doctors took the time to explain the procedure, answer questions and build connections with Stephanie and her husband, Shaun, so they felt as comfortable as possible about the care their daughter would receive. Dr. Haghighi even shared a story about his own child's major surgery. Following the successful surgery, Layla stayed at the hospital for three nights. Stephanie says the nurses were \"wonderful,\" taking care not just of Layla, but of her, too. They brought her food and coffee, rubbed her back when she needed comforting and stayed with Layla, so she could grab a quick shower or use the restroom. 'Loving Her Little Life' Layla won't need a medical helmet or therapy, although she will continue to see Dr. Steineke for follow-ups to monitor her brain and skull growth. A toddler now, Layla is completely on schedule developmentally. \"Layla is totally wonderful,\" Stephanie says. \"She's happy and crazy and just loving her little life. It's amazing.\"Head Start At 4 months old, Layla Maloney needed risky surgery to address the rarest type of craniosynostosis, a birth defect of the skull. Today, she is thriving.

Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder in which a person's immune system attacks their own periph - eral nervous system. According to the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, GBS is estimated to affect about one in 100,000 people each year. What causes GBS is not known, says Emad Noor, M.D. , neurologist at JFK University Medical Center . \"It's random,\" he says. How Does It Happen? It's not genetic or contagious. Typically, GBS will start within a few days or weeks of a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, he says. What appears to happen is the immune response to a bacterial or viral infection\u2014or very rarely vaccination\u2014triggers a more aggressive response that causes the immune system to attack the body. One theory is that part of a person's immune system mistakenly perceives the sheathing around nerves\u2014a fatty covering called myelin\u2014as a threat. To counter this \"threat,\" the immune system produces }Weakness on both sides of the body (frequently noticed as having trouble climbing stairs or, especially in children, difficulty walking) }Unsteadiness or coordination problems }Difficulty swallowing, speaking, or chewing }Digestive and/or bladder control problems How Is It Diagnosed? In addition to a physical assessment, which includes testing reflexes in the limbs that are experiencing weakness, key diagnostics are an MRI and a spi - nal tap (also called a lumbar puncture) to get a sample of spinal fluid. Those with GBS tend to have more protein than usual in their spinal fluid and fewer than usual white blood cells. How Is It Treated? Generally, if diagnosed early, GBS is treatable with therapies such as immunoglobulin (IVIg) infusions or plasma exchange, and physical therapy, Dr. Noor says. There is no known cure for GBS. \"The goal of treatment is to prevent things from getting worse,\" he says. \"IVIg has been shown to shorten the length of a period of disability and also may avoid the need for a ventilator.\" Once treatment is started, Dr. Noor says, patients typically get better in a matter of a few weeks to a couple of months and make a full recovery, especially if GBS is diagnosed early. More severe cases of GBS can take longer to heal, with some patients still experiencing varying degrees of weakness years later. iStock.com/VectorMineLearn about our complete lineup of neuroscience services available at Hackensack Meridian Health at HMHforU.org/Neuro .OnlineGo Emad Noor, M.D. Neurologist 800-822-8905 Edison Healthy Nerve Myelin Damaged Myelin Exposed Nerve FiberNerve Fiber Affected Nerve antibodies that attack the myelin, which leads to nerve damage that causes muscle weakness, paralysis and, in some cases, nerve pain, Dr. Noor says. What Are the Signs? \"GBS affects all age groups,\" says Dr. Noor, \"and typically presents as weakness and loss of reflexes in the legs.\" Mild cases may resolve on their own, but severe cases can lead to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, which can be a life-threatening situation.

Depending on your diagnosis and treatment plan, physical therapy can help manage certain arthritis symptoms. While there's no cure for arthritis, physical therapy may help you manage your symptoms related to mobility and activity, depending on your diagnosis and individualized care plan. Though there are more than 100 different types of arthritis with their own causes, symptoms and treatments, the most common types of arthritis include: }Osteoarthritis }Rheumatoid arthritis }Psoriatic arthritisWhat to Expect From Physical Therapy Your physical therapist will work with you to develop a treatment plan based on your history and goals. This is likely to include: }Program of customized exercises }Pain relief, using heat or ice packs, elec - trical stimulation and ultrasound }Hands-on joint and soft tissue massage and mobilization }Assistive devices \"A critical element of physical therapy is education,\" Dr. Luke says. \"Your physical therapist will help you understand, for example, how to reduce stress on your joints, how to do the exercises in your treatment plan and how to manage pain on your own.\" You may need to see your physical therapist weekly to start, or even multiple times a week during a period of acute pain. But as you learn to manage your arthritis, you'll likely see your physical therapist less often, checking in with them every few months to set new goals and update your treatment plan as needed. \"Patients will achieve a better and more sustained outcome when they commit to performing their exercises daily and consistently as part of a home exercise program,\" says Dr. Luke. \"Living with arthritis is not always easy, but certainly incorporating the learned benefits of physical and occupational therapy into one's life is an important part of management.\" Physical and occupational therapy may not always be prescribed for treatment of arthritis, depending on the nature and course of the disease. Always seek guidance from your doctor about the best timing and precautions when receiving a therapy program.

Strengthened muscles If the muscles around your joints are weak, they will be under extra stress and can hurt. \"Strong muscles can help stabilize a weakened joint and decrease pain,\" Dr. Luke adds. Safe and effective use of assistive devices Assistive devices, such as canes, walkers, crutches, braces and splints, take stress off your joints and muscles, and make it easier to perform certain activities. Pain management Physical therapists can teach you the best ways to relieve acute and chronic pain, as well as how to adjust your activities to prevent pain.The Protein- Joint Pain ConnectionTo help support overall health, consider these protein-rich foods: }Fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega 3s have been research-proven to reduce inflammation, so including omega-3-rich fish in your diet may lead to less inflammation-related joint pain over time. Try eating salmon, tuna, sardines, trout or mackerel at least twice a week. }Nuts. Almonds, walnuts and other nuts are high in protein, fiber and healthy fats, and they've also been shown to fight inflammation in the body. Choose unsalted, unsweetened varieties rather than smoked, honey-roasted or chocolate-covered options. }Beans. They're rich in antioxidants, which may help lower inflammation. Beans are also high in fiber, which is helpful if you're trying to lose weight; fiber helps you feel full for longer periods, encouraging you to eat less often. }Dairy products (for some people). There are advan - tages to consuming low-fat dairy products, which are rich in protein, calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients. Some people experience inflammation and joint pain when they eat dairy, while others don't. If you have joint pain, try an elimination diet with your doctor's assistance to see if dairy products are linked to your dis - comfort. If they aren't, you can continue to enjoy them. Consider limiting these protein-rich foods: }Red meat. Foods that are high in saturated fat, such as beef, may cause inflammation in the body, which can lead to joint pain. Consider other options when you're choosing what to eat with your joint pain in mind\u2014 especially if you cook your steak with butter, another food that's high in saturated fat. }Dairy products (for some people). Because dairy products may cause inflammation and joint pain in some people, it's best to limit or avoid them if you've confirmed that they're triggering your discomfort. Don't avoid low-fat dairy products without asking your doctor for help. Try an elimination diet first. }Gluten. The term \"gluten\" may make you think of bread, but it's actually a protein found in wheat, rye and barley. There isn't a direct link between gluten consumption and arthritis, but many people feel better on a gluten-free diet. Ask your doctor if you should try a gluten-elimination diet. Certain foods can help fight inflammation, which can exacerbate joint pain. Here's what you should know. If you experience chronic joint pain from arthritis, different lifestyle habits, like maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly, can help improve your discomfort. \"Patients often ask why they continue to have some joint pain after completing a new exercise program,\" says Anthony Costa, M.D. , hip and knee orthopedic surgeon at Riverview Medical Center . \"I tell them exercise is only half the battle. As someone who specializes in treating joint pain, I've certainly come to recognize how patients can help them - selves by changing their diet.\" Your diet can help minimize joint pain in part because a healthy diet can contribute to weight loss.

This causes a wide variety of symptoms, but most commonly and universally, people with ALS experience progressive muscle weakening and paralysis. As many as 30,000 people in the United States have ALS, and about 5,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. Y ou may have heard of ALS due to the Ice Bucket Challenge, or even as its previously common name, Lou Gehrig's disease. Here are answers to some of the most common questions asked about ALS.Who Is at Risk of ALS? \"Because there is no clear cause for many cases of ALS, it is difficult to pinpoint risk factors,\" says neurologist Florian Thomas, M.D., Ph.D. , co-director of the ALS Center, and professor and founding chair, Department of Neurology, Hackensack University Medical Center and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine. The clearest risk factor is having a family history of ALS. That being said, Dr. Thomas points to some additional factors to consider: }ALS is more common in older people, and your risk of getting ALS increases as you age. It is most common between ages 40 and 70. }ALS is 20 percent more common in men than women. Will ALS Ever Be Cured? It's hard to say. Currently there is no cure for ALS, but that is not due to lack of effort from doctors and researchers. \"Research is ongoing, and treatments and medications that help slow the effects of ALS are continually being discovered,\" says Dr. Thomas. \"Today, ALS treatment is an interprofessional undertaking that includes respiratory sup - port, medication, physical therapy, speech therapy, assistive devices and other forms of treatment and support. And at Hackensack, we are pursuing a small phase 1 study that seeks to show that re-educating the bone marrow to produce less neuro-inflammation may be helpful in treating ALS.\" Can You Prevent ALS? \"Unfortunately there is no way to prevent ALS,\" says Mary Sedarous, M.D. , neuromuscular med - icine specialist and co-director of the ALS Center at Jersey Shore University Medical Center (one of only two centers in New Jersey to become a certified treatment center by the ALS Association), and assistant professor, Department of Neurology, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine. \"For many people with ALS, there is not a clear cause of the disease.\" Researchers have studied numerous potential causes, such as diet, lifestyle and envi - ronment, but no clear reason has been identified. For other patients with ALS, the cause is genetic. For about 5-10 percent of people with ALS, there is a clear genetic line to a family mem - ber with ALS. This is called familial ALS. \"Genetic testing can be done for ALS,\" says Dr. Sedarous. \"I recommend discussing your options with a genetic counselor before undergoing the testing process.\" 20 21 Health U Winter 2022 HackensackMeridianHealth.orgDoctor SpotlightSpotlight on UFor Michelle Lomotan, M.D., health care is a family business. Her mom, a nurse, inspired her to become a doctor. \"I've always wanted to be as caring and wonder - ful as my mom. She's my hero,\" says Dr. Lomotan, an internal medicine doctor at JFK University Medical Center . \"Watching her take care of people and put smiles on their faces made me want to be in a profession where I can help people and make their lives better.\" But medicine isn't just about giving care. It's also about finding solutions. \"The investiga - tive side of medicine really appeals to me,\" Dr. Lomotan says. \"When somebody comes to see you, they have a problem. I like putting the pieces together to figure out what's wrong. It's like being a detective. You don't always get answers, but you can solve a lot of problems, which is really rewarding.\" When she isn't solving problems as a doctor, Dr. Lomotan is solving them in board games, one of her favorite pastimes along with cooking. You're passionate about healthy eating. What's your best diet advice? For a well-balanced diet, people should use the healthy plate method, which is dividing your plate into one big section and two little sections. The big section should be fruits and vegetables. Starches should go in one of the small sections, and protein should go in the other. You're an avid cook. Who's your favorite chef? Julia Child. I got into cooking in college because I didn't have my mom around to cook for me. I wanted to learn how to cook, and Julia Child came up a lot in reruns on the Food Network. I like her style, which is very homey. She's kind of like a grandmother figure. You feel like you've MICHELLE LOMOTAN, M.D. Internal Medicine JFK University Medical Center known her for a long time. I really like her beef bourguignon because it's easy to make and it's always delicious. Why did you choose to specialize in treating geriatric patients and patients with type 2 diabetes? Diabetes affects so many people in the U.S. because of our diet and lifestyle. My father was diagnosed with it when I was in college, so that got me interested in helping people live healthier lives. As for geriatrics, I just really like interact - ing with older people. They have so much history to share and so many lessons to teach us.Where did your interest in board games come from, and what are your favorite games? Board games are another thing I picked up in college. They're a great way to get to know people because everyone goes into games with a different thought process and strategy. I really like games where you can work together, because I think those are more interesting than competitive games. My favorite is Pandemic, which is a team-based game where you're trying to prevent a worldwide pandemic. It's really fun, although it's a little hard to play now because it feels so real.

Now, doctors at Hackensack University Medical Center and Jersey Shore University Medical Center can offer a new procedure to help prevent this disease. Previous Options for Heart Disease Until now, doctors had two ways to open up narrow, hardened arteries supplying blood to the heart: }Angioplasty, where a balloon is inflated to help open a blocked artery }Atherectomy, in which tiny rotating blades open the artery through scraping and drilling After one or both of these procedures are done, a stent\u2014a metal tube that helps keep the vessel open\u2014is usually inserted. Unfortunately for some patients, neither of these methods is ideal. \"Sometimes fatty plaque that has been there for so long goes from being soft and squishy to being hard as a rock,\" says Daniel Kiss, M.D. , a cardiologist at Jersey Shore. \"Because the calcium is hard, plaque can't move back against the arterial wall, the balloon can't expand properly and the blockage remains.\" Atherectomy comes with its own difficulties. \"When you scrape the wall of the artery, the debris that falls out goes downstream into the microcirculation,\" says Haroon Faraz, M.D. , interventional cardiologist at Hackensack. Doctors have to scrape enough calcium to unblock the artery\u2014but not so much that they'll clog the system with the debris.A New Option Emerges \"[Before,] there really wasn't a great treatment to clear the way for the stent in patients whose calcium had gotten hard and built-up,\" Dr. Kiss says. Doctors at Hackensack and Jersey Shore now have intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) as a new tool in their arsenal. IVL uses sonic pressure waves, also known as shockwaves, which create a series of microfractures to break up the calcium without affecting the healthy vessel. \"The beauty of this technology is that it attacks the calcium but leaves the healthy vessel wall alone,\" Dr. Faraz says. It's based on the same technology that has been used for decades to safely break up kidney stones. The minimally invasive procedure, which is done under local anes - thesia, is performed in conjunction with angioplasty and stenting. }First, the doctor introduces the catheter to the heart through a small incision in the patient's arm or leg. }Then, IVL emits pressure waves to break up the calcium deposits. \"One big advantage of the shockwave is that you're not throwing the debris anywhere,\" says Dr. Faraz. After the IVL creates fractures in the calcium, the artery can successfully be expanded at low pressure with the angioplasty balloon. Then the stent can be implanted. \"This procedure allows us to use the biggest stent we can the first time. And that should prevent patients from having to come back to the catheterization lab in the future. It's really about getting the right result in the right patient the first time,\" says Dr. Kiss.

For Point Pleasant, New Jersey, residents Barry and Carol Anne Cawley Weshnak, a casual post-checkup chat with their primary care doctor spurred a generous gift to boost behavioral health and addiction services at Raritan Bay Medical Center . The grandparents of three and trustees of the Morris and Clara Weshnak Family Foundation\u2014named for Barry's late parents\u2014decided their latest pledge should recognize the stellar care they've received from Mayer Ezer, M.D. , the internal medicine program director at Raritan Bay and a steadfast behavioral health advocate. Over three years, the couple's $300,000 donation will fund a nursing position dedicated to substance use disorder services for patients and their families, as well as continuing education for staff on behavioral health and addiction care. \"Like many, our family has had some addiction issues,\" says Barry, a real estate developer whose many charitable and civic affiliations include serving on the K. Hovnanian Children's Hospital Committee and the Corporate Realty Board. \"Dr. Ezer is a part of these clinical efforts for Raritan Bay, and for that reason, we very much wanted to be part of it.\" The Weshnaks' prior gifts to Hackensack Meridian Health have focused on services for youth, including $350,000 toward the Pediatric Palliative Care Program at the Children's Hospital.
