Each day between March 5 and March 8 will have a special presentation . International Women's Day is celebrated all around the world on March 8. It began 65 years ago in 1908 when hundreds of women on the East Side of New York City poured out of the factories and slum tenements to demonstrate in the streets for better living and working conditions. They were demanding a broad range of rights, including decent housing, a minimum wage, protective labor laws, and the right to vote. Two years later, in 1910, the International Socialist Congress adopted a resolution honoring the fighting spirit of the American women by declaring March 8 International Women's Day. Women in China will be the focus on Monday. Jackie Tunberg, a professor at San Diego State University who recently returned from a trip to China, will give a slide show and talk on China and the status of women there. This program will be held on Monday, March 5, at noon in Revelle Formal Lounge. University of California, San Diego Tuesday, March 6, 1973 Graduate' Students and Regulations Greg Hicks There are several matters of extreme importance for graduate students which many of the persons affected are not aware of, according to Mike Eican, a member of the Graduate Student Council. One of these matters is the GPA which is required for appointment or reappointment to a teaching or research assistantship. As things now stand, a 3.25 GPA is required for such an appointment. Previously a 3.0 GPA was sufficient. Although the 3.25 rule was adopted in May of 1972, students were not informed of it until January of 1973. According to Mike Elcan, some students still might not be aware of this rule. Thus a student who has completed his courses with, say, a 3.0 GPA before the time when the rule was enacted or the student became aware of the rule, does not qualify for appointment. It should be noted that Dean o~ <?raduate Studies, Roy Harvey Pearce, has expressed hiS Intent to grant exceptions when the department has presented documentation to justify such an exception. On Tuesday, Mecha and WLF will combine ' efforts to present a program on the United Farm Workers. A women organizer for the Farmworkers will speak about the struggle of the UFW. This struggle is a historic one. The farm workers are now fighting a battle that began in this country over a hundred years ago when in\u00ad dustrial workers started to form unions. Since in this century farming has become a big business , as manufacturing was in the 1800's, the objective of this fight is to force the companie s -in this case, the growers -to recognize and bargain with the Union. In this modern struggle, as in the ones that went before, women are playing a vital role. This program will be held Tuesday noon on Revelle plaza and will be followed by a Chicano guerrilla theater presentation . Rodgers Company Performs Here Another decision which students might not be aware of is the 20 registered quarter limit for completion of a Ph.D. degree. This rule was adopted on Feb. 1, 1973 by the Graduate Council, and department heads were notified Feb. 8. Again, a student who is already over the limit, or who has not geared the pace of his studies in the light of this limit, is barred from continuing his studies unless he is granted an exception. There appear to be two sides to this question. On the one hand, the rule is deSigned to keep students from taking up time, space, and money by taking more time than is necessary to compl te their courses. On the other hand, some persons say that it is not possible to get through in 20 quarters, because of the magnitude of work professors require of students working for their degree. Then there is the ex po t facto nature of the rule, which has already been mentioned . However , Dean Pearce has again stated that he will make excep\u00ad tions. Wednesday evening the film Salt of the Earth will be shown. This movie deals with the struggles against sexism and racism which went on during a mine strike in the Southwest a number of years ago. Following the movie, Clint Jencks, a former labor organizer who was part of the strike and who appears in the movie, will lead a discussion. The film will be shown Wednesday evening at 7 p.m. in Conference Room A, Chancellor's Complex. Thursday is Internationa I Women's Day. At noon there will be a rally with music and speeches about feminist struggles of the present as well as the past. The rally will be in the Muir 'Free Speech Area.' . Thursday evening Joyce Maupin, a representative from Union Wage -which is an organization of working women in San Francisco, will talk about the work going on to win rights and protection for working women in the San Francis.co area and about the problems of working women in general. This program will be at 7:30 p.m. in 20 2250. WLF urges everyone, but especially women, to participate in all these events and to join with us in celebrating International Women's Day. C~IPirg Elections Rick Drom Concerned about the environment, about consumer fraud and discrimination? Are you interested in what Cal-Pirg is doing to work on these problems? Will you be at UCSD next year? If the answer to all of these questions is yes, Cal-Pirg urges you to run for a seat on the Cal-Pirg Board of Directors. Because Cal-Pirg is totally student-run, each Spring there are elections for the local governing board at UCSD. Since all students belong to Cal-Pirg, each one will receive a ballot and be eligible to vote. The UCSD Board of Directors will consist of 5 students. These five will make policy decisions and s nd representatives to Cal-Pirg executive m~ting~ in San Diego. They will be responsible for deciding which projects UCSD students wish to support. Members of the board will receive no fees of any kind. They must be students dedicated to Cal-Pirg and its ideals. Continued on pale 2 Hannah Cohen Last Friday night, the UCSD Program Board spon\u00ad sored a performance by the Rod Rogers Dance Com\u00ad pany befor~ a crowd of about 550 people in the UCSD gymnasium . The performance consisted of seven ballet numbers and lasted almost two hours. The first number danced was \"Tangents\" and was performed by Rod Rogers, Ellen Robbins and Barbara Roan. Modern dance movements coupled with the clicking of sticks together accompanied by music by L. Harrison and H_ COWE!II composed \"Tangents.\" Next Rod Rodgers and Thomas Pinnock performed \"Box.\" This dance ritual was danced to music by Sidney Smart, and was a study of confinement which the company dedicated to Soledad BrothE!r George Jackson \"and the men who were massacred at Attica.\" The two characters that were portrayed in this dance were Black; one on a platform faced with bars, in the uniform of a prisoner and an another man in front of the bars on a white surface wearing the uniform (a suit) of bourgeosi s Negroes. The third number danced by Shirley Rushing and Noel Hall was \"To Say Goodbye \". The music was a tune written by Leonard Cohen and sung by. Roberta Flack. This dance was done in the classical ballet style. The fourth dance was \"Need No Help\" performed by Shirley Rushing, Armide Smci, Noel Hall and Rael Lamb. The music was composed by Valerie Simpson. The next dance was entitled \"Mudbird \" and was danced and choreographed by Rael Lamb. This dance ~as a memorial to both Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. \"Mudbird\" was conceived by Rael Lamb in 1965, after he worked with Dr. King in an Atlanta, Georgia voter registration drive .... and the assasination Malcom X. The last two numbers were \"Intervention\" and \"Rhythm Ritual Intervention\" was performed in silence and was danced to music of percussion instruments played by dancers while dancing and to percussion instruments played by Rod Rodgers who sat off to the side. The entire ballet group performed in \"Rhythm Ritual.\" All of the dances performed except \"Mudbird\" were choreographed by Rod Rogers. ROd Roge~ has ~en interested in the dance as a form of expresSion since he was a child and is delighted to be able to work with dance to portray different aspects of Black culture. The company originates in New York with their studios on the West Side of Manhattan . They are currently on a nationwide tour. The companies reper\u00ad toire contains a wide variety of works so it i possible for them to move easily from one type of audience to another and to perform in places not originally in\u00ad teneded to accomodate theat r production . A third matter of importance is the in-candidacy fee, which would establish a given amount of money that every student who has been admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree would be required to pay per quarter (in lieu of registration fees). The fee would be man\u00ad datory for a definite period of time (which has not yet been established) or until completion of the degree, whichever is shorter. Some people say that this would not allow anyone to take a legitimate leave of absence. The rule is designed to eliminate the practice of saving money by taking advantage of the leave of absence privilege, but it also requires payment from those wishing to take a legitimate leave of absence (say for sickness in the family). The matter will come up for a vote this fall. Students who wish to have an effective voice in these matters should make their views known to their Graduate Student Council representatives . Grad Students Barred from Open Files Tim O'Neil Should a graduate student see his files? This que tion has been rai d by many people at various times in the past, yet the question still remains unanswered .

Coffee and tea will be served. Cape of Good Hope Many people have used CAPE this year and hope\u00ad fully it's been useful. We hope to pu~lish this year's evaluations in the spring quarter, uSing an altered format from what was used this past fall. Most of the feedback we've gotten has been. a~out the help of the written comments and the limited value of the numbers analysis. The numbers can pr~ba?~y be best used to check the conformity and relrabllrty ~f the written comments. So this spring's publication Will rely mostly on the written comments . There are a number of students at the Ce~ter ~ho are interested in the designing of better questro~nalres and response systems for this spring's :valuatrons; If you are interested in improving the design or adding questions to the surveys, call the Center or Billie Jo at 583-5816. '. a This quarter the questionnaire has been redeslgne and three new formats introduced in efforts to ,make the surveys applicable specifically to lectures, ?'scu~. sion seminars, labs and studio courses. Aga.rn thiS quarter the evaluations will be handed out durrng the ninth and tenth weeks of the quarter on the dates requested by each instructor .. . Distributio n of the questionnaires and respo~se cards will be to each department or professor during the early office hours of each day, with the instructors taking the surveys to their classes.. . If you could spare a few minutes rn the morning during the next weeks, drop by the Center for some free donuts and coffee. You could find out how a fifteen minute investment of a walk would provide a class with the opportunity to tell other students and instructors what they feel about their classes. Drop by the Students' Educational Change and Development Center any time, but pr:ferably betwe~n 8 and 10 a.m. if you can spare your mind .... We are In the lower Muir Commons, next to the North Star office. Our telephone is 453-2000, X2516. . Malicious Mischief Early Sunday morning a firecracker e~ploded in a dormitory suite on campus and th~e~ ple~es of glass throughout the suite. No one was InJu.red In the .blast because all had left the suite a few mrnutes earlrer. According to campus P?lice reports, ~n unknow.n person threw a firecracker Into the 200 sUite of AtlantiS at 1 :50 a.m. on Sunday. An ashtray sitting on a coffe~ table was shattered by the explosion and glass from It covered the suite. The coffee table which it 'was resting on was also damaged . Ik' Residents of the suite said that they had been ta Ing in the suite only 10 minutes before the blast had occurred. The firecracker was apparently thrown thloug~ an open balcony door minutes after they had gone Into their bedrooms. . . The campus police regard it as an act of maliCIOUS mischief and have not yet found any suspects. classes. - The deadline to submit an application for the Board is March 14th, only a little over a week away. Each applicant will be asked to apply in writing to Cal-Pirg giving his or her name, address and a brief summary of their qualifications . You may turn in this information on any piece of paper or you may pick up an applica\u00ad tion form at the fishbowl on Muir campus. Everyone who submits and application to Cal~Pir~ by March 14th will be listed on the ballot. Applications should be submitted to Cal-Pirg, Urey Hall, UCSD, La Jolla, Calif. 92037. All the names and a short list of their qualifications will be printed on the ballot. These ballots, as well as information about Cal-Pirg, will be mailed to each student on April 9th. Enclosed in the envelope will be a postcard where students can vote for five of the candidates listed. The reults of the returned postcards will be tabulated on a computer program . The top five students who receive the most votes will be elected to the governing Board of Directors at UCSD. Results will be published in the Triton Times on April 20th. These five students will serve a one year term until the Spring of 1974 when elections will be held once again. Financial Aids What does the financial aids picture for next fall look like/ Will work study money be available? Will it be harder to get student loans next year? Questions like these will be answered Wednesday at a special \"Financial Aids Picture for 1973-1974\" meeting. Larry Dreyer, financial aids counselor at UCSD, or a representative from his office, will give a short talk on next year's opportunities for financial aid. The nieeti~g will be held in the HL Auditorium , below the Cluster I library. The meeting will run from 8 p.m. until about 9:30, on Wednesday, March 7th. Conlinued on page 7 Arms Control FRONTIERS OF SCIENCE 104. Dr. Herbert York, former UCSD Chancellor and Director of Defense Research and Engineering under Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy will teach a course entieled \"Arms and Arms Control\" (Fr of Sci 104) in the Spring Qaurter Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2:00 in UCB 2622. The course will describe the major arms developments since the discovery of fission and the major attempts and successes in arms control up to the signing of the SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty) agreements in Moscow last Spring. . The class is design~d primarily for non-science ma\u00ad jors, although it is desirable for those enrolling to. have had some lower division science. Revelle sCIence majors who wish to use this course as part ?f ~ ~ocial science minor may do so by makrng IndiVidual arrangements with Dr. York and the Provost's Office. New Women's Course A new course offered for the Spring Quarter, Literature of the American Women's Movement, proposes to combine both theory and activism. The course offered by the Philosophy, Sociology and General Literature departments will be taught jointly by Drs. Helen Longino, Susan Kirkpatrik and Gail Omvedt. The course will meet twice weekly for the first three weeks and will involve lectures and discussion on the theme of the women's movement. Emphasis will be on relating the readings to the womens' experience. After three weeks the students will divide into research teams to choose and define projects that deal with tangible issues central to the women's movement . The reading-s will include an antholog.y of I~terature of the women's liberation movement, Llberallon Now . and Introduction to Socialism by Huberman and Sweezy. - In addition to the two required readings a supplemental reading list will be issued to majors in each of the three departments . UCSD Women and Extensions UCSD Extension functions as a con\u00ad tinuing educatio n wing for women according to Mary Lindenstein Walshok, Direc or of Womens' Studies at the University Extension . At the February 28 meeting of UCSD Women Dr. Walshok described the Spring Quarter Womens ' Studies Ex\u00ad tension courses as an attempt to meet the \"objective needs of women toward prestige and influence .\" The courses reach beyond the preoccupation with personal identity and department majors of un\u00ad dergraduate students to those \"women who have developed conciousness and want to find solutions to their problems,\" Dr. Walsh ok said. The Women's Studies Program in\u00ad volves training for women at all job levels. A class in Business Administra \u00ad tion, \"How To Stop Discriminating Against Yourself\" offered for the Spring Quarter focuses on the early socialization of women, vocational development, career goals and strategies that help women. get closer to center of power in the working world. The interests of the undergraduates are not bypassed as three courses offered for the Spring Quarter delve into the implications of social theory for the image of women and the capitalist basis of the role of women. In meeting the problems of the broader adult community Dr. Walshok plans a community based center for the counseling of women. The certer would provide a transitional education experience for women at home or work who desire to return to school on a professional level. Dr. Walshok said the counseling centers would offer educational programs not available at the Com\u00ad munity College level. Former centers according to Walshok have not been successful because they were \"connected with the womens' move\u00ad ment and not efficient in matching women with their needs.\" The center will offer programs to counteract the isolation of suburban women. Professional women counselors representing the San Diego Counties would be in contact with women through an \"employment mobile.\" As women have special problems and a need for sensitive instructors refresher courses in Math, Statistics, Biological Sciences, Reading Interpretations and Writing would be offered for women to get \"comfor\u00ad table in their prospective role.\" ~ -- j Make your world Dr. Marvin Weitzman OPTOMETRIST Everything covering the tennis body from head to toe.

Also programmed for the 8:30 p.m. concerts, to be held in La Jolla's Sherwood Hall, are Haydn's Symphony No. 100 (\"Military\") and St. Paul's Suite by Gustav Holst. Best known for \"The Planets\", Holst has used English folk dance melodies in St. Paul's Suite, a composition for string orchestra. The performances mark a return engagement for Miss Schiff, who opened the orchestra's 71-72 Concert Series in September 1971. Since that time she has made debuts in two of the music capitals of the world -New. York and London. After her Carnegie Recital Hall debut in April, 1972, the New York Times wrote: \"An excellent reflection of her background and training, Miss Schiff plays in the grand romantic style with a luscious, firmly centered tone, generous yet tasteful portamento and in an expansive, outgoing manner -even her highvoltage program was vintage Heifetz.\" The 21-year-old artist, who made her solo debut with orchestra at the age of 11, has won many coveted . awards and has appeared with leading orchestras throughout the United States. She also recorded the score for the sound track of MGM's THE FIXER. Tickets are available at THE TURNTABLE, 459-4421, or by writing THE LA JOLLA CHAMBER ORCHESTRA, P.O.

Chicano Professor Denied Tenure MECHA Third College Reply to Carrie Rickey Artiel TRITON TIMES and LA JOLLA LIG A series of articles ar being publish d by Ms. Carrie Rickey in the TRITON TIMES and the LA JOLLA LIGHT. The Light has published the articles under the provocative titles of \"Short End of the Stick for UCSD's Third College\" and \"Third College's Target Students: They're Flunking Out.\" Although these titles may be eye catching, .they do not correctly describe the effectiveness of Third College. Joseph W. Watson Provost, Third College exceptionally high rate of attrition following this Fall Quarter? Is the number of students in academic difficulty excessive, as stated in the articles. Non-Returning Students in.the mple, in a r cent report rd of Dire tors of the atiokn of the City New York, in which ation \"reaffirmed its open enrollment\" it is that \"the attrition rat for rollment students was 25% for regular ad\u00ad at the City University .\" in comparison to Revelle Colleges and to other ns nationally, Third providing not only a also an effective op\u00ad for a university educa\u00ad overwhelming majority College students are Two Professors Comment on Dr. Watson's Letter Editor: A few omm nts should be made on Dr. Watson's letter. Firstly ~ there is a mis-attribution to Dr. Wright on th~ ~Igures . Ited. A mom nt's checking will reveal they onglnated In th Third College administration itself. Further, Dr. Watson's choice of final registration fig\u00ad ures as a bas line greatly minimizes the attrition rate. If one uses the original Fall 1972 enrollm nt figures (released by Third College 10/23/72) of 638 students as a. b~se subtracting Dr. Watson's figure of 500 con\u00ad tinuing enrollees for the Winter quarter gives an attrition of 138. With regard to the probation/dismissal statistics choic~ of numbers again obscures the problem: The Hobbit's House announces a Grand Opening Sale MEXICAN ~LOUSES, SHIRT AND DRESSES $250 and up IMPORTED RUGS . $19\u00b00 and up Also have Navajo & Hopi Jewelry Arturo Madrid, Assi tant Prof ssor of Literature in Third Col leg and one of the most important people for our a ademic community, has just be n denied tenure by the UCSD administration. On the trength of a tenure offer from the University of Minnesota, Professor Madrid was recommended for tenure by the Spanish ection of the Literature Deparl\u00ad ment and by th Literature Department as a whole. This recommendation was strongly supported by Third College Provost )0 eph Watson and is supported by his colleagues in th College and by the student body. It is stated in cine of the articles that the College is admitting special action students under the false pretense of providing to minority students a unique oppor\u00ad tunity for a university education and then cruelly flunking them out in excessive number. The arti\u00ad cle buttresses its incorrect con\u00ad elusions and implications by quoting Mr. Will Wright of UCSD's Sociology Department /Third College by statem nts of figures, e.g. \"over 100 students are either on academic probation or subject to dismissaL\" The official Fall Quarter enroll\u00ad ment of Third College was 556, for the Winter Quarter 534 with 34 new students enrolled in the Winter Quarter. This gives a loss of 56 students who were enrolled in the Fall Quarter and did not return for the Winter Quarter for a varie\u00ad ty of reasons ranging from gradua\u00ad tion, transfer to oth r colleges, personal reasons, etc. The com\u00ad parible figures for all three colleges at UCSD are' Fall Quarter enrollment ,)f 5348, a Winter Quarter enrollment of 5210 with 264 new students enrolled for the Winter Quarter. This gives a loss of 402 students who were enrolled in the Fall Quarter for a variety of reasons. Thus the rate of non-returning students for Third College is not excessive compared to Revelle and Muir Colleges and in fa t is about the same, 10 per\u00ad cent versus 8 percent, seniors) of whom approximately 50% were admitted by special ac\u00ad tion. At the end of the Fall Quarter the percentage of students on probation or subject to dismissal in the three colleges' were Revelle 8%, Muir 10% and Third College 21%. Qualitatively this is what should be expected if Third College admits a considerably higher percentage of special ac\u00ad tion students while seeking to maintain the rigorous academic standards whish a Bachelor' s degree from UC5D represents. Another important contribution to the relatively higher rate of a ademic difficulty in Third College is its youth -two and one half years -which results in its having a greater percentage of students in the period of greatest academic difficulty and trauma - the freshman and sophomore years -than Revelle and Muir Colleges. ng academically at UCSD retention rate of the typical for UCSD in spite pressures which im\u00ad heavily on Third students, e.g. insufficient financial aids. Although 1II101l1~ge is still in the most of any new college four years -and is still Work.lng from the college's official figures (1/22/73) one finds 83 of 222 sp cial action students or over 37% are either on probation or subject to dismissal (with the majority in the latter category). This is well in excess even of the figures which Dr. Watson cites in his apples and orang s comparison with CUNY. Apples and oranges because Third has never had open admissions . Each special action student was selected and recruited for promise and should have passed at least three screen.ing procedures. ~dd the fad that there are only 12 whites on the 1/22 Itst and at any other institution these figures would constitute a strong presumption of institutional racism. W,e e~p c!, however, that Dr. Watson will respond again With hiS best southern voter registrar's logic that whateve~ th~ figures, it is merely what is expected when mlnonty students meet the \"rigorous academic standards which a Bachelor's degree from UCSD represent s.\" We can't cdunt the times such logic has been used to deny minorities equal opportunity in the name of academi excellence. Prices are flexible, so we'll bargain if you want an item badly enough! The Hobbit's House A Unique Shop Canterbury Corner Camino DelMar at 10th SI. 755-3396 The University of California policy on recruitment and advancement of faculty is officially based on the balanced consideration of the faculty member's teaching ability, creative scholarship and community services, in that order, as p r President Hitch's directives . The proper balance is hardly ever kept on this campus. Bad teachers and people who serve neither the community nor the ~tudents are constantly bing hired and promo.ted. The balance is never broken in the other direction . And yet minority faculty efforts are by n cessity directed towards the a tivities to which the University gives practically no credit. Arturo Madrid has taught successfully Literature cla~ses, Third World Studie and Cultural Traditions, thus working not only in th fields of his direct competence, but having to force the limits of hi~ talent and capacity for r search in order to make ur Third World Studies could be taught at all and on one particular occasion in order to avoid the di appearance of the Cultural Traditions course. When the correct Third College figures are compared with those of Revelle and Muir Colleges and with other institutions seeking goals similar to those of Third College, it becomes quite clear that Third College quite effectively educates its sp cial action students and has made creditable progress toward accomplsihing its objec\u00ad tives. Students in Academic Difficulty We are of course not satisfied with the rate of Third College students in academic difficulty and are working hard to reduce it. However, we firmly believe that the facts indicate that 80% of the Third College students are succeedi.ng in' the rigorous academic environment of UCSD. Further the Third Coil ege rate of students in academic difficulty compares quite favorably with those of other universities seeking to xpand educational oppor\u00ad tunities to minority students. What are the facts? Was there an In the Fall Quarter 1972, Third College had an enrollment of 556 students (217 freshmen, 168 sophomores, 135 juniors and 36 But t('aching is only one aspect of th relationship with ~tud nts that is r quired of a conscient ious minority faculty m mber: there is the creation of programs, the ~trugg le against stablished department, the assistance of ~tudents in all kinds of way, the unavoidable attendance of stat -wide and national meetings concerned with Chicano questions and minority questions. Arturo Madrid has done this and more as head of Third World Studies and a a Chicano. Where are the University policies that consider these activities m ritorious? How can secret committees without minority representation or arbitrary Chanccllorian decisions ever allow Chicano students on this campus to have th opportunity to educate themselves or Third College to meet its educatiunal obj clives? The case of Arturo Macrirl is clear. No young Chicano faculty will ever be promot' d 'Jnless he or she withdraws to hi res arch and by so dOing becomes the enemy of his own people. We now know th an wer. UCSD has not responded and do s not intend to respond to the needs of Chi ano students or of any oth r minority stud nts. We shall fight then to g t what we need. VENCEREMOS . Revelle Ripoff Mark Robertson Want to know where your college government funds go, Revelle?; funds that were allotted on a per capita basis to be spent in th interests of Revelle college students. An estimated $8,500 is projected to come to Revelle college government from vending machines. Do you ever wonder why you never hear about this? It's because the money is sp nt on special interest projects instead of for the people. It wasn't always this way, in the beginning the college governme nt had noble thoughts, noble enough at least to set up ,ome reasonable sp nding guidelines such as 1) the largest number of Revelle students are served 2) current Revelle students are aided as opposed to past, futur and possihle student ~, 3) the cause is endorsed by a majority of the Revelle students, 4) and it does not alleviate the responsibilities of another group that should fund it. There is even a guideline requiring the funding proposal to be submitted a week ahead to allow time for discussion. Each and every on of these guidelines have been successfully broken as the government be ame in\u00ad creasingly alien to you, the Revelle college students, the group it should be responsible to!

There were 70 other students so the government subsidized the other colleges with your money. They have funded $165 to bring possible Revelle students here to see the school. This money was allotted per capita on our heads, not theirs. You ask, but isn't this a good cause? Sure it is, but your money isn't for that purpose! They have funded $300 in the fall and promised $250 in the winter and spring, to a tutorial group which goes to an off campus high school to teach minority students. 1) Budget Proposal RCCA 2) Proposed Guidelines for -allocation of RCCA funds Again a great cause but how are Revelle students served when only about 4 or 5 students from Revelle are involved in the program. As you can see from these examples and this is only a partial listing, Revelle College Gov't has failed in its responsibility to the Revelle College Communit y. All of these guidelines have been sent to the va student organizations so there is really no reason to overlook them -they are not a secret. But they have all been consecutively broken. Because of this I submit you a n w set of guidelines; guidelines to provide you projed with successful fu nding, 1) start a sp cial in group (religion, ethnic, social, educational etc.) and not rep res nt the Revelle community as a whole in planned activity and 2) deliver your funding request few days before you need it so th re is not time to wait them to think about it. This will bring an automatic breach of the rules and provide you with funds. Of course I this sarcastically but only to show the hypocri cies of present system.

Their game is about as consistent as the fabled los Angeles Rams. Take the recent Orange Coast College Volleyball Tournament, which the Tritons obviously didn/t. They won the first two matches by grace of forfeit. They then played close to their potential by beating SOKOl2 games in a row. This same team had split two games with the Tritons in an earlier tournament at UC Irvine eating them up with round house serves. This time UCSD played a consis\u00ad tent/ if not overpowering , game with accurate passing, setting and hitting. At this point the team found itself in the unlikely position of tied for the lead with a shot at the tourney finals. Their op-ponents were Homeboys, the other leading team of the pool. The first match found the goody guys playing we\", but frustrated by some insecure officiating which was just enough to dishearten a 'somewhat unstable team. It was downhill from there as the Tritons couldn/t put up much of a struggle. All was not lost, as the Tritons still had a shot at the finals, all they had to do was beat the worst team in the pool twice. Well, suffice it to say, UCSD did not make it to the finals as they played possibly the worst that they are capable of playing. . Actually , the squad is pointing to the NAIA finals in Spring Quarter for which they hope to reach a peak. The potential rises to the surface now and then, but unfortunately, sometimes it is buried pretty deep. A Little Respect For The Stars In Stripes . Pat Stacy Finals are near and playoffs are here: intramural basketball at its most artistic, if not best play of the year. Who/s got the toughest job ahead of them? Maybe Jim Sheffield trying to take on Bob lennon and the Butfakes with the help of some Dorcy friends? How about trying to guard Cheryl Elliot as she fast breaks you to exhaustion( Or anybody trying to stop Clown Clain, Rugger Dugger, and the rest of Mizer's Rejects when they decide to stop screwing around and really play some ball? Got to be one of the above choices you say? Not likely ... you know those guys with the black and white striped shirts that run around whistling like maniacs and making gestures with their bodies that even Rus Meyer would think twice about before putting them on film. Now they are the ones who are going to have a rough set of playoffsl When you/re a ref (affectionately known as a zebra; not so affectionately known as several other things, all un\u00ad printable) , you really never win. You may call a great gamer but on every call at least half the players will think you blew it. It/s no easier when you have to call a game against your friends (or maybe even a TA who flunked you on your last quiz) because the first rule in refereeing is impartiality . All of our intramural zebras are students who, although they do get paid, are out there because they love the game and want to learn more of its intricacies . Of all the sports, basketball may be the most difficult in which to to do well. Besides having to run just as hard as the. teams that are playing (no mean feat in a fast breaking game) and make instan\u00ad taneous decisions on close calls, even the \"normal\" situations are next to im\u00ad possible. Say Head Faker John Miller is playing low post .against Mauler Mark liska. John gets the ball in the lane, dribbles, makes two miraculous moves and goes up for a shot. Teracious Mark blocks the ball. Or did he get John/s arm? Did Mark bump him with his body, or did John charge into him? Is there enough contact to warrant a call? Did John travel before the shot? Was he in the lane too long? All this must be decided in a split second by our alert zebra (assuming he has \"perfect\" posi\u00ad tion on the play) plus, what about the other eight guys on the COUIt? I think you get the picture ... it/s toughter then it looks. Maybe next time Guy, Ben, Rabe, J.P. Gideon, Shaner Rath or any other ref is hustling his fanny off trying to do a good job in your game, you/II think twice before bitching about a close call. You might even compliment the ref on a good game ... it could make his day. UCSD Sports Calendar This week is a big one in a big month for sports at UCSD. I ntercollegiately , the month only last until March 17/ the last day before finals begin. Nevertheless, there are a lot of things happening in a short time and many of these things are happening at home. This week runs through almost the entire gamut of season sports. Tuesday, the men/s tennis team swings into action with a match against Cal State Fullerton . They will be trying to even up their record at 4-4 for the season. The match is at the home courts at 3 p.m. Tuesday afternoon. The home courts, for those of you whom are interested, happen to be the Courts commonly known 3S the Muir Courts located between the intramural fi Id and the Muir apartments . Th women/s basketball t am composed of those stars we/ve heard so much about, open their home season Wednesda y against Southwetern College. The game is scheduled to start at 5 in the gym and should be a good one.

See you there I Tritons Finish With Big Victory If any of the avid readers of this column noticed the paucity of \"tall ones\" roaming the campus last week, it was because the Triton basketball team was sunning and funning in beautiful Hawaii. One .'!ould expect that it would be very easy to forget about studying or playing serious basketball in such a distracting environ\u00ad ment, and judging by the scores of the games over there, this was indeed the case. But it seemed like the week was over almost before it had begun, and the Tritons were back once again in their home gym for the final game of the year against Pasadena College. Although the score (a 97-83 victory) was impressive, the style of play led to the thought that many of the Tritons left their game at the Point after and on Waikiki Beach . .Both teams were running and gunning, but unfortunately, for the basketball purists, were guilty of much errant passing and ball handling. On the bright side were Paul Trainer's 25 points, Gie Simpson/s 19/ Pete Henderson's 16, and ace bowler Steve Higgins/s 10 from off the bench. Frenchy lelevier also had 9 assists but he made up for it with his gagging on easy layins. It was the Triton/s highest point output of the season and the wide open style of play allowed for some sparkling passes and scintillating moves. Pasadena did not play their best game, but the Tritons were not about to lose their last game of the season and finish below.500. As in any season this one had its highs and losw and in betweens. None of the players will forget the eight game winning streak, the Hawaii trip, Gie Simpson/s 30 points, the Cal State Bakersfield gamer Chjirlie and the taxi driver, Boom Boom/s and Herb/s jive after practice and on the road, the Cal Weatern win, and last but not least, Paul Trainer, (!o which he would reply, \"False\"). Thus the year climaxed with a win and the Tritons finished with a 13-13 record. The graduating seniors would like to wish Coach Reeves and Coach Buchanan and returnees Paul Trainer, Steve Higgins, Dave Moragne, Ron Werft, and Geoff Kostyshak the best of luck for the upcoming season. Trainer All District Our sources have revealed that Paul Trainer was selected to the NAIA '-'II-District Basketball Team and will participate in an All-Star game in the near future. Paul was the Triton/s leading scorer and rebounder all year and is well deserving of the honor. The wholesome type (when angered he has been known to utter such vituperative comments as \"darn\" and \"shoot\") Paul will be an invaluble asset to Triton basketball fortunes in the next two years. cobwebs out of their cleats.

The logic behind the en\u00ad tire thing is that if men can do it, women can do it better. The women's tennis team, not related to the men/s tennis team in any way, but doing their thing anyway, will be packing the rackets .up for a quick trip a nd match up at Southwestern Thursday . The match starts at 3 p.m. and Cheryl, Judy, Maria et al. are looking forward to another smashing victory. Some things coming up on the weekend include a baseball doubleheader against Southern California College, a track and field meet and these will all be at home. The most exciting event will probably be the UCSD Invitational Men's swim meet featuring the unknown talent of the La Jolla Irregulars . Whooping Coughs Calpirg ... Continued from page 2 Immunization against Whooping cough as an infant doesn/t assure immunity as an adult, or even beyond the age of twelve. In fact its effectiveness is severely diminished by twelve years of age and some children may never even develop immunity after vaccination . Research directed by Dr. James Connor, Associate Professor of Pediatrics at UCSD School of Medicine may reverse some of this though, Dr. Connor and Dr. Rouben Aftandelians , Assistant Research Microbiologist , are identifying the means by which children, and adults, develop an immunity to whooping cough. As part of their investigation they are also perfecting a new method for quickly and easily diagnosing the disease. Whooping cough, known clinically as pertussis, is still a big problem, according to Dr. Connor. \"There have been 75 cases in the last 2V2 years in San Diego\", he notes. \"Among children who have recently received the vaccination, 10 to 25 percent develop typical cases of the disease. Therefore current means of immunizing are not totally effl~ctive.\" Medical research so far has indicated that immuniza\u00ad tion/ el'en when successful, last a relatively short period of time in most people. According to Dr. Connor, in the period three to five years after the series of baby shots 15 to 20 percent of vaccinated children may develop whooping cough. This figure increases to about 35 percent after five to seven years, and to about 75 percent in those 12 years or more after full im\u00ad munization or a booster. While whooping cough is usually considered a disease of small infants, it's also one of the more commonly unrecognized diseases among adults with bronchitis and a severe cough. In adults, however, the symptoms are usually less severe. \"It is known that whooping cough is caused by a bacteria which grows in the respiratory tract/\" says Dr. Connor. \"Unfortunately our knowledge of how the disease is caused by the bacteria living there is very limited; so is our knowledge about how immunity works.\" . In their research Drs. Connor and Aftandelians will be looking very closely at these antibodies . They want to know exactly how they react with whooping cough bacteria as well as where they react. . \"Our ultimate aim/\" says Dr. Connor, \"is to develop more efficient means of immunizing people or to apply the standard method in a different way so that protec\u00ad tion might come earlier and last longer\". At present infants receive their first vaccination when they are about three months old. The positions are very important to the success of Cal-Pirg. That is why it is important that concerned students make the effort of sending an application before March 14th. Any questions about the election or Cal-Pirg can be answered in the Cal-Pirg headquarters at UCSD, the Muir fishbowl at X1030. In addition questions can be answered by the executive director of Cal-Pirg, Dan Franklin, at 236-1509. Files ...

Professor David Crowne of the literature Department indicated \"that some of the departments were strongly opposed to open files while others were in agreement with this principle.\" After discussion, the Graduate Council authorized Professor Crowne to draft a letter to the Chancellor recommen\u00ad ding/ \"The need for confident iality of letters of recommendation, but that generally, open files should be maintained -in particular, those referring to evaluations of students on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\" It seems in the future that graduate students may be allowed more access to their files, but still this is only a small step to open files. Under-graduate students on all 3 campuses have total access to their own files, while some of the graduate students are still fighting to get partially open files. Revelle Ripoff ...
