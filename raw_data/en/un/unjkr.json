Minnesota reported five Hib cases with one death. Pennsylvania reported four Hib cases and has isolates from three additional cases of Haemophilus influenzae invasive disease that have not yet been serotyped. Three of the seven PA cases died. The increase in Hib cases may be due to a nationwide shortage of Hib vaccine that began in December 2007 and is ongoing. Problems with production of Hib-containing vaccine by Merck (PedvaxHIB) has left Sanofi Pasteur (ActHIB, Pentacel) the only manufacturer of Hib-containing vaccine approved for use in the U.S. Until the supplies are restored, CDC issued a recommendation to defer the Hib booster (routinely administered at 12-15 months) for children who are not at high risk of Hib infection. This recommendation is still in effect. There is currently enough Hib-containing vaccine for all U.S. children to complete the three-dose primary series at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. The CT Immunization program is providing Pentacel (DTaP/IPV/Hib combination) and limited quantities of ActHib for all children in your practice. However, preliminary national information from sentinel immunization registries indicate up to 10% lower coverage for the third Hib dose compared with other vaccines (DTaP, PCV7) commonly administered at the same visit. Some of the challenges in usi ng the currently available Hib- (Continued on page 5) April 25 through May 2, 2009 N ational Infant Immunization Week is an annual observance to highlight the importance of protecting infants from vaccine-preventable diseases and to celebrate the achievements of immunization programs and their partners in promoting healthy communities. What better time to make sure your patients are up-to-date with their immunizations? Here's an idea... When you receive your monthly colored report from CIRTS, and you pull the immunization history, take five minutes to look at the record and see if the child is up-to-date or not. If the child is missing an immunization, put the record aside and make a call to the family to come back in to finish up. If you don't have the time, call your local IAP Coordinator and ask them to follow up with those children. It's everyone's job to ma ke sure our children are protected. Let's try this week to work as a team to make this happen. If you are doing something special in your office to bring awareness to the importance of immunizing children, please call Carolann Kapur, Connecticut Immunization Program at (860) 509-7732 and she will post your event on the Department of Public Health website and publish a printed list of events going on around the state that will go out statewide.

Providers were asked how they managed to achieve such good immunization levels. Here are some of the se-crets to their success: 1. Set up the next appointment before the patient leaves the office. 2. Make reminder calls the day before the appointment. 3. At every opportunity (including sick visits) look at the child's shot record to make sure the child is up- to-date. 4. Educate parents about the impor- tance of immunizations. 5. Post the immunization schedule in a place where all staff can see it. 6. Complete the CIRTS compliancy report right away . CIRTS Success Stories We all know that having a statewide immunization registry is a value to all of us, namely having a permanent re-cord of our child's or patient's shot history at our fingertips whenever and wherever we need it regardless of where the child goes for care. Read these real-life stories about how CIRTS has proved to be a treasure to all of us- provider, parent, and the community alike. CIRTS receives a call from a pediat-ric office looking for shot records on a child coming to their practice for the first time, without a shot record. The practice calls CIRTS and within minutes a complete record is faxed to the new practice regardless of where the child has been seen before. A doctor sees a newborn baby for their first well-child checkup. The doctor isn't sure if the child re- ceived their first Hep B shot at birth. The doctor calls CIRTS, and the first Hep B date is faxed to the office while the baby is in the waiting room. A family needs to get their toddler into daycare but their doctor retired and left no information as to where to obtain their medical information. The mom calls CIRTS and we immedi-ately send the immunization record so the child can attend day care without the mom missing any work. A family relocates to CT from New Orleans after Katrina hit. Because the state of LA has a registry, the immu- nization record was saved. By coordi- nating with the LA registry we were able to get access to the child's im-munization record to avoid having the child repeat all their shots. \"I'm so glad CT has a registry. I wouldn't have been able to get my child into day care.\" Local IAP Coordinators Bridgeport Joan Lane 203-372-5503 Danbury 203-730-5240 East Hartford Marie Tish Sandra Abella Guajardo 203-630-4251 Elizabeth Green 203-881-3255 New Britain Ramona Anderson 860-612-2777 New Haven Jennifer Hall 203-946-7097 Norwalk Pam Bates 203-854-7728 Stamford Cinthia Vera 203-977-5098 Torrington Sue Sawula 860-489-0436 West Haven Betty Murphy 203-937-3665 Windham Vacant 860-423-4534 Other areas Johanna Castaneda 860-509-7241 Volume 13.2 Spring 2009 Page 3 Court Says \"Measles Vaccine Not to Blame for Autism \" Three rulings related to autism and vaccine injury compensation cases were issued on February 12th by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The rulings were part of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding created by the National Vac-cine Injury Compensation Program to handle the large volume of claims that vaccines induce autism. In each of the rulings the Court held that the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, whether administered alone or in conjunction with thimerosal-containing vaccines, were not causal factors in the development of autism or autism spectrum disorders. In a statement the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said: \"The medical and scientific communities have carefully and thoroughly reviewed the evidence con-cerning the vaccine-autism theory and have found no association between vaccines and autism. If parents have questions or conc erns about childhood vaccines, they should talk with their child's health care provider.\" Hopefully, the determination by the Court will help reassure parents th at vaccines do not cause autism. Vaccine-Preventable Disease Reporting Systematic reporting of various diseases in the United States began in 1874 when the State Board of Health of Massachusetts in augurated a plan for the weekly voluntary reporting of prevalent diseases by physicians. Today, all states and territories of the United States participate in a national morbidity reporting system and regularly report aggregate or case-specific data for over 50 infectious diseases and related conditions to the Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC). Surveillance data provide the basis for determining public health priorities and for planning and implementing pre-vention and control programs. Policymak-ers use these data to determine overall pri-orities for resources for public health pro- grams and, in certain instances, these data may be the basis for geographic distribu-tion of funds for treat-ment. Infectious disease sur- veillance systems rely primarily on receipt of case reports from ph ysicians and other health care providers. Infectious diseases are grouped into 2 categories: Category 1 Disease which must be reported immediately by telephone on the da y of recognition or strong suspicion of (Continued on page 5) Reported Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, CT 2004-2008 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Measles 0 0 0 0 0 Mumps 0 0 0 2 0 Rubella 0 0 1 0 1 Pertussis 67 69 126 89 54 Tetanus 0 0 0 0 0 Hib 1 0 0 0 0 Varicella 1910 1710 1725 1439 857 2009 CME Teleconference by: DPH & CT-AAP April 21 Adolescent Confidentiality: Balancing Provider Responsi- bilities and Patient Rights Speakers: Dr. Sheryl Ryan, Yale Univer- sity Jennifer Cox, JD, Cox & LLC April For update 2009 Teleconferences visit the Immunizations website at www.ct.gov/dph/ immunizations Vote and Vax On No- vember 4, 2008, cities and towns in Connecti- cut participated in an historic election day. While many people contributed to the overall democratic process of electing our leaders, several cities and towns participated in another exciting event that also contributed to the health of our nation. Vote and Vax clinics, providing influenza and pneu- mococcal vaccinations in polling places, took place in nine communi-ties. In 2006, the original Vote and Vax projects were piloted through funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-dation. The efforts were also sup-ported by SPARC (Sickness Preven-tion Achieved through Regional Col- laboration) a tri-state (NY, CT, MA) agency. 1 The goal of the 25 participat- ing public health agencies was to de-termine if it was possible to deliver flu shots in voting locations. The idea sprang from the notion that people who were at the location to vote might take the opportunity to get vac- cinated because it was easy and read-ily available. Historically, the popula-tion that votes is similar to the popu-lation that is recommended for vacci-nation. In addition, voting locations must meet accessibility requirements thus opening an opportunity for all people to participate. That year, close to 14,000 people were vaccinated, 80% in the CDC priority groups and 28% first- time flu vaccinees. Fast forward to 2008 and the potential for a massive anticipated voter turn-out in the election. With the success of the earlier efforts and funding from the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield Foundation, several Connecti-cut cities and towns worked together to implement a Vote and Vax project. Planning began in late spring for the November election. The statewide Influenza and Pneumococcal Coali-tion was the focal point of the project. The Connecticut Public Health Re-search and Education Fund Inc. for the Connecticut Public Health Asso-ciation acted as fiduciary. Local Health Departments and Visiting Nurse Associations provided the vac- cinators. The results of the project are encouraging. Over 1200 people were vaccinated in 9 cities: Bridgeport, Danbury, East Hartland, Hartford, Milford, New Milford, North Haven, Plainfield and Ridge- field. Of the population vaccinated, 70% were in the CDC priority groups, 30% were not vaccinated last year, and 27% said they were not likely to have been vaccinated if the Vote and Vax clinics were not available. In ad-dition, Milford used the clinic to do a preparedness drill and Plainfield used the clinic to give residents other pub- lic health messages. Most of the par- ticipating cities will consider spon-soring a Vote and Vax clinic again for this year.

Volume 13.2 Spring 2009 Page 4 VFC Program Vaccine Storage and Handling Procedures Proper storage and handling of vaccines should be a part of each provider's standard operating procedure. Improperly stored vaccines may not protect patients and could result in provid- ers having to privately purchase replacement vaccines. Here are a few helpful Vaccine Handling Tips: Store Vaccine Correctly a nd Monitor Temperatures Be sure that thermometers are placed in both the refrigerator and freezer. Monitor and record refrigerator and freezer tem-peratures twice daily-at the beginning and end of each day. Maintain refrigerator temperature at 35\u00ba\u2014 46\u00ba F (2\u00ba\u20148\u00baC), and freezer temperature at 5\u00ba F (-15\u00ba C) or colder. Safeguard Electrical Supply Make sure the refrigerator is plugged into an outlet in a pro- tected area where it cannot be accidentally disconnected. Label the refrigerator, electrical outlets, fuses, and breakers on the power circuit with information that clearly identifies the perishable nature of vaccines and the immediate steps to be taken in case of interruption of power. Use \"DO NOT UNPLUG\" stickers. New Vaccine Order Forms (VOF) Our new, letter-size vaccine order forms were mailed to all providers in February. Please discard all older forms and only use the letter size form. The revised vaccine form is copy-friendly and will save the state on printing and mailing costs. Providers will be responsible for copying their own vaccine forms. If a provider changes addresses, please con-tact the Immunization Program so we can send out a new master copy of the VOF for your office. Note: If the main office contact person is not on site when vaccines are delivered, alternate staff must be responsible for unpacking, checking over ship- ment, and properly storing vaccines. containing vaccine, reluctance to switch inventory and schedules, misunderstanding about what constitutes primary versus booster doses, concerns about \"over- vaccination\" resulting from switching to the Sanofi Hib-containing vaccine, may explain the drop-off of the third Hib dose. However, it is imperative that providers ensure that all children are appropriately immunized with the primary series, especially given the current deferral of the booster dose. Recommendations for children NOT at high-risk to receive the primary Hib series, until the Hib vaccine shortage resolves, are outlined in the table at right. Children at increased risk of Hib disease should continue to receive the full series of Hib vaccine (including the booster dose) for whichever product they receive. Children at increased risk of Hib disease include those with asplenia, sickle cell disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection and certain other immunodeficiency syndromes, and malignant neoplasms, as well as children who are American Indian/Alaska Native. (Continued from Hib page 1) Volume 13.2 Spring 2009 page 5 If the child is at least 6 weeks but less than 12 months of age and has received zero, one, or two Hib doses, schedule him/her for the first or next dose(s) immediately with a minimum of four weeks between the doses for a to tal of three doses. These chil- dren will need a booster dose when the Hib vaccine shortage is over. If the child is between 12 and 14 months of age and has not had any doses of Hib vaccine, schedule appointments for two doses, eight weeks apart. If the child is between 12 and 14 months old and has received Hib vaccine but did not complete the primary series before they turned 1 year old (i.e. had 1 dose of PedvaxHIB\u00ae (Merck prod-uct) OR 1-2 doses of ActHIB\u00ae or Pentacel\u00ae (Sanofi product), schedule an appointment for 1 additional dose, a minimum of eight weeks from the last dose. If the child is at least 15 months of age but less than 5 years of age and has not received any doses of Hib vaccine OR has not completed the primary series (i.e., had 1 dose of PedvaxHIB\u00ae OR 1-2 doses of ActHIB\u00ae or Pentacel\u00ae), schedule an appoint- ment for one dose. If the child is 5 years old or older and hasn't received any Hib vaccine, Hib vaccine is not necessary. disease and then have a report mailed within 12 hours, a nd Category 2 Disease which requires a report by mail within 12 hours of recognition or strong suspicion of disease. Every hea lth care provider who treats or examines any person who has or is suspected to have a reportable disease shall report the case to the local director of health and to the Department of Public Health. A complete list of reportable diseases can be found on the State of Connecticut Case Report Form PD-23. This form can be obtained by calling (8 60)509-7994 or visiting the Connecticut De partment of Public Health website http://www.ct.gov/dph/epidemiology and clicking on the reportable diseases link. The Immunization Program investigates the disease, Poliomyelitis and Tetanus. The first step in reporting strong suspicion of one of the diseases listed above is to call ( 860)509-7929. Upon receipt of the report, an Epidemiologist will initiate a case investigation. The purpose of the investigation is to collect the required demographic and clinical infor- mation, investigate contacts, and to recommend control measures to reduce further transmission of the disease. Effective infectious disease control requires a collaborative effo rt between all the parties involved. Please help to do your part in fulfilling the department's mission of reducing disabilit y and death which result from diseases that can be prevented through vaccination. Feel free to call the Immunization Pr ogram with any questions you may have about the reporting process.
