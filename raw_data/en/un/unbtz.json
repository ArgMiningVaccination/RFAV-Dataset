The outer layer of the tooth needs to be strong because of the acidic foods and drinks that we consume. However, the tooth enamel wears down if you do not protect your teeth with good oral care and hygiene habits. You need to floss and brush your teeth twice a day otherwise the enamel may deteriorate, which results in the following dental problems: - Tooth decay: The layers of enamel may erode and can cause tooth decay in previously healthy teeth. Symptoms of tooth decay include greater sensitivity, pain and aching or bad breath. Treatments include fillings, root canals and tooth extraction. - Cracked teeth: As enamel wears down you may develop a small crack in the tooth. You can also experience scratches or a chipped tooth if part of the enamel breaks off. A cracked or broken tooth may require glueing with special adhesives or a root canal. - Discolouration: Enamel is important to the colour of your teeth. Improper care and ageing mean teeth do not maintain their white or off-white shade but become yellow and dark brown - even black. Tooth discolouration may respond to home remedies. Many kinds of toothpaste offer enamel strengthening benefits and there are several other ways you can strengthen the tooth. The good news is that early-stage enamel erosion is reversible. Here, we will explore some natural treatments and home remedies to strengthen tooth enamel. To make sure you have strong, healthy tooth enamel and to monitor for signs of decay, you should attend a regular dental check-up.

The main mineral is hydroxyapatite. Other minerals in tooth enamel include the following: - Carbonate - Fluoride - Magnesium - Sodium Tooth enamel's main mineral, hydroxyapatite, is a type of calcium phosphate in a crystal form. Strengthening tooth enamel involves a process dentists refer to as remineralisation of the teeth. How to Naturally Restore and Strengthen Tooth Enamel The best natural and home remedies for strengthening your tooth enamel revolve around better tooth care and certain hygiene or lifestyle habits. Natural tooth enamel remedies that will help to strengthen and protect your teeth include the following: - Try non-acidic foods: Certain foods are good for your enamel. Many types of fruits and vegetables, dairy products such as milk, and foods or drinks containing fluoride - notably spinach, grapes and black tea - will be useful to naturally restore enamel. - Choose non-sugar alternatives: Sugar will wear down the enamel, so opting for a sugar-free alternative to your favourite chewing gum, soft drink or other high-sugar indulgence is a good habit to start. Most soft drinks have diet or sugar-free varieties. - Use fluoride toothpaste: Good oral care is the most significant thing you can do to prevent enamel erosion. However, a pronamel fluoride toothpaste will give you a better chance of maximising how effective your brushing routine is for your teeth. - Drink water: Hydration is important for many functions in the body and most people do not get enough. Try increasing your water intake to rinse saliva and bacteria from your teeth after eating. Water is completely harmless to the teeth, so it is a perfect drink. - Take supplements: If you are not getting enough calcium from your diet, trying a supplementation program may work. Simple vitamin supplements that contain all of your recommended daily allowance (RDA) can ensure you are never vitamin-deficient. The above simple habits and natural home remedies are how to fix early-stage tooth enamel erosion. The tips can strengthen tooth enamel and protect tooth enamel from forming yellow colours, but you will need to see a dentist to confirm you do not require further treatment. Does Tooth Enamel Grow Back? You cannot 'regrow' tooth enamel either naturally or artificially. However, through the process of remineralisation, it is possible to improve tooth enamel using natural strengthening methods. Enamel erosion is an inevitable part of ageing, so you can only preserve what you have left. However, if your teeth are in bad condition due to cavities and decay, dentists can sometimes preserve enamel using the following methods: - Adding sealants and bonding over the enamel - Wrapping special films around the teeth, which are pronamel - Removing a broken or dead tooth and adding an artificial dental implant Enamel can never 'regrow' per se because there are no living cells in the tooth enamel. Your best bet is to treat any existing problems from tooth decay and focus on better oral care and hygiene habits, which will preserve the enamel you have and prevent further deterioration. What Colour is Tooth Enamel? The colour of tooth enamel varies a lot. Many people look at the colour of their teeth and might presume they have problems with their enamel. However, human teeth are not meant to be bright white so this is not necessarily any cause of concern. Healthy teeth can be bright white, off-white or light shades of yellow and most people have discolouration to some degree. If you have concerns about the colour of your tooth enamel you can use a teeth whitening product, which may not affect the enamel in terms of strength or protection but can improve the appearance of the teeth. How to Fix Cracked or Scratched Tooth Enamel There are a few treatments a dentist can offer for a cracked tooth or scratches on the enamel due to wear, such as the following: - Crowns and veneers - Fillings - Glueing and sealants for chipped teeth - Root canals - Tooth extraction and dental implants Cracked or scratched tooth enamel will not strengthen using natural or home remedies. If you have cracked tooth enamel you need to repair it through a suitable dental treatment - then preserve the remaining enamel with good habits and lifestyle changes. Keeping Your Tooth Enamel Healthy It is important to have a good diet and hygiene routine to strengthen tooth enamel. If you are wondering how to fix issues with enamel naturally, lifestyle changes are the best option if you have early-stage enamel erosion. If you have an underlying issue, such as scratched tooth enamel, you will need further treatment - otherwise, you cannot preserve the existing enamel.
