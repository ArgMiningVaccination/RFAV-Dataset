In the Non-Toxic-Tumor-Therapy (NTTT), vitamin C plays an important role as an antioxidant. In addition to the water soluble vitamin C, fat soluble vitamin C (ascorbylpalmitate) is often prescribed, particularly in brain tumors. Vitamin C also seems to play an essential role in protecting children against the adverse effects of vaccinations or other stress inducing events. The Australian doctor Dr. Archie Kalokerinos witnessed a double increase in child mortality among Aboriginals after vaccination campaigns. Human beings are unable to produce vitamin C themselves like other mammals do and therefore completely depend on vitamin C intake. In stress situations such as vaccinations, infections or other diseases, emotional stress etc., extra vitamin is used and needed. For this reason Dr. Kalokerinos advises against vaccinating sick or not yet fully recovered children. In the Netherlands, the government has grossly overlooked this aspect for years now with all sorts of consequences. When Dr. Kalokerinos started giving vitamin C to Aboriginal children, he was able to reduce child mortality, at the time at about 50%, to practically zero. This has led me to prescribe vitamin C as a preventive measure. When I witnessed that autism often improved by detoxifying the vaccines, the thought soon came to my mind that vitamin C could not only be useful in preventing autism in vaccinations, but that it could possibly play an important part in curing it as well. When I first prescribed the fat soluble vitamin C for a 4 year old autistic child, both speech and comprehension improved dramatically. His mother was deeply impressed by the significant improvement. Since then, ascorbyl palmitate plays an essential part in my treatment protocol for autistic children. It fully meets it's expectations. Vitamin C is known to have the following effects on the human body, which could be very relevant for autistic children: "}
