He vehemently refused treatment in hospital. Instead, he insisted on treating himself - and tragically, he is not an isolated case. \" [Miracle Mineral Solution](https://edzardernst.com/2019/04/beware-of-the-bleach-boys-hydrogen-peroxide-and-chlorine-dioxide/)\" (MMS) is being promoted as a treatment for all kinds of diseases - including, of course, the coronavirus. But MMS is nothing more than the bleach and disinfectant chlorine dioxide, or CDL for short. It made headlines when Donald Trump suggested it as a remedy against Covid-19. Subsequently, CDL became highly popular amongst the anti-vax brigade. Johann Biacsics was one of the leading figures of the anti-vaccination scene in Austria. On 11 November, he was seen in a Vienna hospital with an acute corona infection. At this stage, he had already taken chlorine dioxide because of fever complaints. Biacsics was, of course, not vaccinated and refused treatment. He was firmly convinced that he had already overcome the infection thanks to his treatment with chlorine dioxide. The senior physician at the Vienna hospital saw things differently. His condition was \"life-threatening\", she said. But instead of accepting treatment in hospital, Biacsics discharged himself and said he would rather treat himself. Once home, Biacsics put in an IV line with chlorine dioxide and sodium chloride. Two days later he was dead. Only two weeks before his death, Biacsics had demonstrated in Vienna against the Austrian Corona measures. In a television interview from September, he can be seen in front of the parliament. \"There are mainly vaccinated people in the intensive care units. 67 percent of them are vaccinated,\" he said on camera at the time. When the reporter corrected him, he only replied that he had \"inside information\". His followers are now suggesting that he was poisoned. And for once they are, of course, correct. He basically poisoned himself with MMS. His family, meanwhile, blames the hospital and claim that he did not die of COVID, nor that Biacsics' death is the result of treatment with chlorine dioxide. Biacsics is [not the first Austrian Covid patient](https://koenigszeitung.com/post/todliches-wundermittel-357) who has refused treatment or used \"alternative remedies\". And he is not the first who has died as a result. Self-treatment is booming among vaccination opponents and Corona deniers. It was even propagated in the Austrian parliament. For weeks, FP\u00d6 leader [Herbert Kickl](https://www.oe24.at/oesterreich/politik/so-geht-es-kickl-nach-der-corona-erkrankung/499173307) (who also is COVID-positive) and his party colleagues have been promoting the deworming drug ivermectin - despite warnings from doctors, scientists, and the manufacturer. All too often, the consequences are fatal: In Styria, two patients died from poisoning with ivermectin, in the district of Rohrbach in Upper Austria, a Corona patient left the intensive care unit in critical condition and died. He had also relied on ivermectin and refused other treatments. "}
