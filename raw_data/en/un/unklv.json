After completing his doctoral work in Cardiovascular Physiology (1999) David undertook post-doctoral work in sensory physiology under the direction of Professor Mark Rowe as a NHMRC research officer. In 2003 he was appointed as Lecturer & Course coordinator (2003-2006). In 2007 David was appointed as a senior lecturer in Integrative Physiology at the University of Western Sydney. David specializes in quantifying the contribution of sensory nerves arising from skin and deep structures such as muscle and bone to perception. Recent work has focused on defining how we distinguish between non-painful (eg innocuous touch) and painful stimuli. These questions are addressed using psychophysical observations and detailed electrophysiological recording. In collaboration with Professor Macefield we are examining the contribution of different sensory nerves to the abnormal condition of allodynia where gentle touch is perceived painful.
