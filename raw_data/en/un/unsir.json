Aromatherapy is one of an alternative medicine, also referred to as Essential Oil therapy, that National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy defined it as the art and science of utilizing naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to balance, harmonize and promote the health of body, mind and spirit. It seeks to unify physiological, psychological and spiritual processes to enhance an individual's innate healing process.

Psychological treatment Aromatherapy in the modern era began in the early 20th century, as Mark Borigini (2012) believed when the effects of a variety of so-called essential oils (distilled from a variety of plants) began to be studied in the setting of a variety of clinical conditions. There are a variety of theories as to the mechanism of action of aromatherapy; one theory is that the limbic system of the brain is positively stimulated by these soothing smells, easing anxiety and chronic pain. As founded by Itai et.al (2000), the effects of aromatherapy (odorless condition, lavender, and hiba oil) on mood and anxiety were investigated in 14 female patients who were being treated with chronic hemodialysis at hospital. These results indicated that in chronic hemodialysis patients hiba oil is an effective, non-invasive means for the treatment of depression and anxiety, and that lavender alleviates anxiety. This is proven with physiological interaction between scent of aromatherapy which triggers the limbic system in the brain. Anxious people who experienced problem with sleeping, heart palpitations and inability to be still and calm will ultimately be affected by this positive stimulation in reducing the level of anxiety.
