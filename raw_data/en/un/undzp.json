Most authors love to think that readers start their books at the beginning and read them to the end, but as an avid reader and researcher myself, I know this is not the case. If I don't read a book all the way through, then why should you? With this in mind, I have added a chapter overview at the beginning of each chapter so that you can get a clear idea of what is there. Additionally, similar to how some restaurants add one, two, or three chilli icons to show how spicy the dishes are, each chapter starts with an Ontake rating icon to show my perspective on the content. One Ontake means interesting, two Ontake means very useful, and three Ontake means essential. Thus, there are several ways to get what you want from this book. You can: Skip to the practical bits Check the chapter headings and read what feels relevant to you Follow the Ontake ratings Read the book from cover to cover For many reasons, I'd love you to take the fourth option and read this book from start to finish. Doing so will immerse you in Ontake and teach you a coherent approach to applying it. On the surface, this book is all about the many ways you can use Ontake to get amazing results in your clinical practice, but my ultimate intention is something more. I hope that by reading enough of the book, you become immersed in the Japanese way of approaching treatment and recognise that you can get dynamic results by being economical, what Dr Manaka described as achieving maximum result with minimum intervention. As will be seen in the chapters on holographic systems, the body is in constant communication with itself in sometimes surprising ways. The discussions on palpation, dosage and the dynamic changes that can come about as a result of very subtle stimulation are relevant to the overall practice of acupuncture and moxibustion, even if you don't know much about Japanese acupuncture or Ontake. Finally, Ontake changed my practice and changed my life! From the first day, I started using it, patients loved it. Ontake was not only a new clinical tool that enabled better results, but it also became a new way for me to help my patients relax. The warmth of the bamboo, the smell of the burning moxa, and the gentle ticking of the metronome all combine hypnotically to bring people into a deeply relaxed state. It is in that relaxed state that healing takes place. I suspect adopting this practice is why my patient numbers started to grow. Patients know Ontake is good for them! Whichever way you approach this book, I hope the Ontake Method can change your practice in the same way it changed mine, leading you into a deeper understanding of palpation, moxibustion, and unspoken communication with your patients. \u2014Oran Kivity Kuala Lumpur 2019 THE MAGICIAN AND THE APPRENTICE When I begin to lecture an audience, regardless of who they are, I often begin by saying, Don't believe what I'm going to tell you. \u2014Yoshio Manaka \u00b9 This book was inspired by the work of two people: the Japanese medical doctor and acupuncturist Dr Yoshio Manaka (1911-1989) and my teacher, British acupuncturist, author, and trainer Stephen Birch. Dr Manaka was a medical doctor who combined scientific research skills with a fascination for traditional methods of healing. He was renowned in Japan during his life, working in his clinic with a team of practitioners and achieving an exceptional level of effectiveness. Always open to new concepts and ideas, he assimilated new methods into his practice\u2014constantly researching, taking home what he found useful, and adding his own innovations and adaptations along the way. One example of this is his integration of the Sotai bodywork method, which uses a number of muscle stretches against resistance. Dr Manaka studied the methodology, followed it, and then added direct moxibustion to the procedure, simultaneously stretching the patient's limb with one hand and burning moxa cones with the other\u2014a unique application of moxibustion into physical therapy. Don't believe what I tell you! was Dr Manaka's catchphrase. Instead, he wanted you to believe the research. Dr Manaka placed great emphasis on researching acupuncture phenomena in experiments that could be repeated and corroborated by others. His legacy was a massive body of books and published papers in Japanese about the channel system and a coherent, methodical, and effective system of acupuncture brought to the West by Stephen Birch and Junko Ida. Dr Manaka was fluent in ancient and modern Chinese and Japanese, French, German, and English, along with smatterings of other languages.\u00b2 Outside of his passion for medicine, he was a sculptor, a poet, and a painter. Thus, he was a true polymath, a medical Leonardo Da Vinci. Stephen Birch, one of the brightest lights in the Western acupuncture world, described Dr Manaka to me as the only genius he had ever met. Dr Manaka taught Birch and corresponded with him in a process Birch described as mind-expanding and exposing oneself to a kind of knowledge and curiosity virus.\u00b3 This infection of ideas and thinking led to the English publication of Chasing the Dragon's Tail, written by Birch with Manaka's input and guidance. It was a seminal book on acupuncture and acupuncture research, so much so that when I came across it in a bookshop in 1989, I quickly placed it back on the shelf, thinking all those graphs and formulae were too scientific for me. But Birch has continued to spread the Manaka Meme, challenging students to look at acupuncture rationally and pragmatically, testing and adapting what works, and rejecting assumptions and dogma if they don't make sense. With a doctorate in acupuncture research, Birch has been a conduit for information from Japan to the West, writing many important books about acupuncture and pushing the debate forwards about how we should study acupuncture's effects and the questions we should ask. This book is a product of my own infection with the Manaka Meme. Without the knowledge of Manaka's meridian frequencies and the pragmatic intellectual framework for cautious experimentation and validation that Stephen Birch instilled in me, I would never have developed the Ontake Method in this form. CHAPTER 1 ONTAKE ORIGINS The history of warm bamboo, an introduction to meridian frequencies and a personal story of inspiration and discovery. I would like to introduce another rare technique, Bamboo Ring Moxibustion (Takenowa Kyu ). Make a long bamboo tube about 4 cm long, without a joint. The thickness of the bamboo tube wall should be about 3-4 mm. Fill it with semi-pure moxa, leaving a space at both ends of the bamboo. Compress the moxa tightly so that it can't fall out, then light it. After the bamboo gets warm, stroke the skin with it lightly and rapidly, or roll it on the affected area. ... The duration of treatment should be adjusted to the patient's condition. ... The technique can be used for supplementing and draining, just like cone moxa, so if applied correctly, it can be extremely effective for many conditions. \u2014Makoto Yamashita Definition Meridian frequency moxibustion with Ontake is a moxibustion technique with two additional components: pressure and rhythm. A short piece of bamboo is filled with moxa wool. When the moxa is ignited, the bamboo gets hot and can be applied to the skin. The bamboo can be held, tapped, pressed, or rolled rhythmically along the acupuncture channels and on specific points. Additionally, with the use of a metronome, these techniques can be applied rhythmically at a specific number of beats per minute based on Dr Manaka's meridian frequencies. This chapter explores the origins of this treatment. History In 2010, I was introduced to a new moxibustion tool by Hiroshi Enomoto from Sankei acupuncture suppliers in Tokyo\u2014a short tube of bamboo filled with moxa. It was called short bamboo and not commonly used, even in Japan. Its origins are not well documented, but it seems to be a modern development. In his recent book, moxibustion practitioner Hideo Shinma, the son of the renowned specialist of moxibustion Izaburo Fukaya, states that Zuiho Ito was the first to use it. Ito was one of the students of Sorei Yanagiya, an acupuncture master in the early Showa era (1906-1959). This implies that this moxibustion tool has been in use for less than a century. In 2010, nothing had been published on bamboo ring moxibustion in English, but Mr Enomoto translated a passage for me from Shinkyuchiryogaku (Acupuncture and Moxibustion Therapy), written by Makoto Yamashita in 1992. Yamashita may have been using this technique as early as the 1960s. Given how long moxibustion has existed, bamboo ring moxibustion is like a newborn baby, arriving sometime around the later part of the twentieth century. Yet, Yamashita considered it to be beneficial: \"It works for pain relief and relieves inflammation. Bamboo Ring Moxibustion can also work for pain relief of all joint rheumatism, frozen shoulder, broken bones, and sprains. It can be applied for inflammation conditions.\" The treatment is extremely soothing when received. In fact, the bamboo ring moxibustion instrument quickly revolutionized my practice, fast becoming my primary approach for treating broad areas of the body and for working along the channels. Importantly, the feeling it creates delights patients, and they frequently ask for it, impressed not just by its efficacy as a clinical tool, but also by the physical comfort and relaxation it induces. Nomenclature Yamashita named his treatment bamboo ring moxibustion ( takenowa kyu). In his 2012 book, Shinma Sensei called his bamboo treatment bamboo tube moxibustion ( take zutsu kyu). In the early years of selling the tool, Sankei marketed this product with yet another name, short bamboo moxibustion ( tan take kyu). This is because Sankei was already selling a longer bamboo moxibustion tool known as the moxa heat reduction tool ( kyu netsu kanwa ki), better known in the West as Fukaya bamboo. This relatively long bamboo tube is used to reduce the pain from the heat of direct moxibustion by pressing on the surrounding skin as the moxa cone burns down. As the Fukaya bamboo was long and the newcomer was short, to distinguish one from the other, they called it short bamboo ( tan take). Short bamboo is not a very enticing name, however\u2014certainly not evocative at all of the warmth and relaxation induced by the therapy. So, with the help of a Japanese patient, in my own practice, I rebranded it as warm bamboo ( ontake). On is the same character found in onsen, hot spring. As I started to write about Ontake, the new name stuck, and now Sankei enthusiastically promotes its Ontake range. When writing about techniques developed by Yamashita Sensei or Shinma Sensei, I will refer to them as bamboo ring or bamboo tube moxibustion. In most contexts, however\u2014particularly those concerned with meridian frequency moxibustion\u2014I will refer to Ontake, or more simply, bamboo. Cycles and Frequencies Long ago, in an era far, far away, I lay on a treatment table in front of a class during the second part of my training in Manaka Style Acupuncture (MSA) with Junko Ida. Junko was demonstrating okyu (small cone moxibustion), and I was the model. With a speed and fluidity that I still cannot match, she applied small cones of moxa on one point on my leg. I could feel pulses of warmth that came and went, surging and receding at regular intervals. It felt fantastic, and it was at this moment that I realized the application of heat is only one component of effective moxibustion, the other being cyclical rhythm. I learnt a wordless lesson that day and rooted in the memory of my muscles, one that I never forgot. In fact, no matter the method of application, moxibustion is by nature both cyclical and rhythmic. When burning small cones, there is a short cycle between lighting the cone, the moment when the heat peaks, and the moment when you extinguish the cone and start over. With larger cones, the cycle is longer, but when the heat peaks, the cone is still removed and replaced. With warm needle technique, the cones are burnt on the needle, and the cycle is even slower. With this kind of technique, the frequency is lower. All moxibustion is cyclical. On the other end of the spectrum, in Chinese therapy, moxa sticks are applied with a relatively high-frequency, rhythmic, sparrow-pecking motion. Warmth is applied and removed rhythmically. Given that we are dealing with the application of heat, it makes total sense to remove the heat periodically. The skin cannot take a heat source indefinitely without pain or injury. It needs periods of rest, so the heat must be applied and removed. These cycles can be short or "}
