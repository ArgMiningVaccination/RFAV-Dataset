Criminal organizations are becoming stronger and more diverse. They are engaging more and more frequently in systematic forms of cooperation designed to further their criminal activities. In the inves-tigation and prosecution of crime, particularly the more serious and complex forms oforganized crime, it is essential that witnesses, the cornerstones for successful investiga-tion and prosecution, have trust in criminal justice systems. Witnesses need to have the confidence to come forward to assist law enforcement and prosecutorial authorities. They need to be assured that they will receive support and pro-tection from intimidation and the harm that criminal groups may seek to inflict upon themin attempts to discourage or punish them from cooperating. The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocols call upon State Parties to introduce appropriate measures to prevent witness intimidation, coer-cion, corruption or bodily injury, and to strengthen international cooperation in this regard.Often though, even where such measures have been legislated, implementation remains lessthan satisfactory and further progress is needed particularly with regard to cross-bordercooperation especially regarding the change of identity and relocation of at-risk witnesses. Experience has shown that in witness protection there are no easy solutions. However this publication, developed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime following a seriesof regional meetings with expert representatives from law enforcement, prosecutorial andjudicial authorities, has been designed to assist and support Member States in the estab-lishment and operation of effective witness protection programs. It provides a usefulaccount of available measures and offers practical options suitable for adaptation andincorporation in the legal system, operational procedures and particular social, politicaland economic circumstances of Member States. I am confident that the publication should serve as a useful and valuable tool for policy- makers, legislators, legal practitioners, senior law enforcement and justice officialsinvolved in the protection of witnesses.

Their participation in the meetings of the UNODC expert groups and their thoughtful commen- tary during the drafting process were a source of inspiration and served to create a text that goesbeyond the usual general theoretical approaches to witness protection and addresses the opera-tional aspects of setting up and implementing witness protection programmes. For security reasons,it is not possible to publish the names of the contributing subject matter experts but UNODC extendsto them its appreciation and gratitude. The Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings involving Organized Crime were produced by the Anti-Trafficking Section of UNODC under the supervision of Brian Taylor. The text was prepared by Ilias Chatzis and revised by Karin Kramer.

Implications of relocation and identity change for the I. Consulted national authorities of Member States of the United Nations legal instruments and resolutions on standards and norms related to the protection of is witness protection? What are its main elements? How is it used to strengthen criminal investigations and prosecutions? Are there any universally applicable lessonsthat are the secret to successful witness protection programmes? Can countries with lim-ited human and financial resources afford programmes like the ones operated and prizedby well-funded and well-resourced legal systems? These are some of the questions that thepresent publication seeks to answer. Some answers will come easily. In most cases, how-ever, experience has shown that, in actuality, practice is complicated. A. The core issue The ability of a witness to give testimony in a judicial setting or to cooperate with lawenforcement investigations without fear of intimidation or reprisal is essential to main-taining the rule of law. Increasingly, countries are enacting legislation or adopting policiesto protect witnesses whose cooperation with law enforcement authorities or testimony ina court of law would endanger their lives or those of their families. Protection may be as simple as providing a police escort to the courtroom, offering tempo- rary residence in a safe house or using modern communications technology (such asvideoconferencing) for testimony. There are other cases, though, where cooperation by awitness is critical to successful prosecution but the reach and strength of the threateningcriminal group is so powerful that extraordinary measures are required to ensure the witness's safety. In such cases, resettlement of the witness under a new identity in a new, undisclosed place of residence in the same country or even abroad may be the onlyviable alternative. B. Mandate of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Under article 24 of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime(General Assembly resolution 55/25, annex I), States parties are to take appropriate meas-ures to provide effective protection from retaliation or intimidation for witnesses who givetestimony in cases involving transnational organized crime. The measures envisagedinclude physical protection, the relocation and non-disclosure or limitations on the disclo-sure of the identity and whereabouts of the witness and the introduction of evidentiaryrules to permit testimony to be given in a manner that ensures the witness's safety. Statesparties are to consider entering into agreements or arrangements with other States for therelocation of witnesses (para. 3). The provisions of the article apply also to victims insofaras they are witnesses (para. 4). 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 1Under article 26 of the Organized Crime Convention, States parties are required to take appropriate measures to encourage persons who participate or have participated inorganized criminal groups to cooperate with law enforcement authorities for investigativeand evidentiary purposes. Pursuant to paragraph 4 of that article, such persons are to beafforded protection in accordance with the provisions of article 24. The protection of victims and/or witnesses is also explicitly addressed in the protocols to the Organized Crime Convention, specifically in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress andPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the UnitedNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (General Assembly resolution55/25, annex II, articles 6 and 7) and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants byLand, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against TransnationalOrganized Crime (Assembly resolution 55/25, annex III, articles 5 and 16). The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, at its second session, held in Vienna from 10 to 21 October 2005, iden-tified witness protection as one of the areas that would be used to periodically review thestatus of implementation of the Convention and its related Protocols (CTOC/COP/2005/8,para. 1, decisions 2/1, 2/3 and 2/4). An overview of the responses of States parties isincluded in the analytical reports submitted to the Conference at its third session, held inVienna from 9 to 18 October 12-38; and CTOC/COP/2006/7, paras. 11-18). At its third session, the Conference requested its secretariat to collect and make available to States parties successful practices in the investigation of offences covered by theProtocols and in the protection and assistance measures offered to victims of trafficking inpersons and smuggled migrants. It also identified witness protection as an area in whichtechnical assistance could be provided to support the implementation of the two Protocolsand as a cross-cutting issue for both the Organized Crime Convention and the Protocolsthereto (CTOC/COP/2006/14, para. 1, decisions 3/3 and 3/4). In addition, in the Bangkok Declaration on Synergies and Responses: Strategic Alliances in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (General Assembly resolution 60/177, annex),adopted by the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and CriminalJustice, Member States recognized the importance of giving special attention to the need to protect witnesses and victims of crime and terrorism and committed themselves tostrengthening, where needed, the legal and financial framework for providing support to such victims, taking into account, inter alia, the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justicefor Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power (Assembly resolution 40/34, annex). On the recommendation of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 2005/16, encouraged Member States toexchange their experiences with and information on action taken to provide effective pro-tection for witnesses in criminal proceedings involving transnational and national organ-ized crime and for their relatives and all other persons close to them. 2Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 23Introduction C. The process Moving to implement those mandates, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) commenced a series of regional workshops in 2005 with the active participa-tion of expert representatives from law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial author-ities of Member States to develop a set of internationally recognized good practices inthe establishment and operation of witness protection programmes. The workshopswere attended by officials from different geographical regions with varying degrees ofexposure to organized crime and from different socio-political circumstances and legalsystems. International organizations and agencies with an active engagement in thefield of witness protection also made valuable contributions. Authorities from more than40 countries, 8 international organizations and 3 legal institutes participated in the con-sultation process (see annex I). Existing literature was also taken into account (seeannex II) Of the 43 systems examined in the consultation process for the development of theGood Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings involvingOrganized Crime: 14 jurisdictions had full-fledged witness protection programmes thatwere able to relocate and change the identity of threatened witnesses; 4 jurisdictionshad enacted new legislation providing for the establishment of witness protection pro-grammes but the programmes were not yet operational; 18 jurisdictions had no estab-lished programmes but had provided for some form of security measures, such aspolice measures or procedural in-court protection; and 7 jurisdictions had no witnessprotection measures at all.Witness protection Full-fledged programmesNo security measures Other security measures Programmes under establishment07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 34D. Objectives of the good practices This compendium of good practices is intended as a useful reference tool that draws upon the experience of Member States in setting up effective and sustainable programmes forthe protection of witnesses. As experience varies from one country to the next, the goodpractices presented here do not advocate for any particular model of witness protection.Instead, they aspire: (a) To enhance understanding of the issues surrounding this sensitive field; (b) To provide an account of the challenges that countries face in their efforts to address the threat posed to witnesses by criminal groups, the measures and practices thathave produced positive results and those that have proved ineffective, and the con-ditions and criteria for the establishment of covert programmes the sole purpose ofwhich is to ensure the safety of threatened witnesses, mostly through relocation andchange of identity; (c) To facilitate the gradual emergence of a common international approach to witness protection. The good practices are directed at policymakers, legislators, legal practitioners and senior law enforcement and justice officials. The intention is to provide those professionals witha comprehensive picture of the measures and options available for incorporation into theirlegal systems and operational procedures, subject to the specific social, political and eco-nomic circumstances of their countries. E. Scope of the good practices The good practices that follow take a holistic approach to witness protection. They identifya series of measures that may be adopted to safeguard from intimidation and threatsagainst their lives the physical integrity of people who give testimony in criminal proceed-ings. These measures provide for a continuum of protection that starts with the early iden-tification of vulnerable or intimidated witnesses, continues with the management ofwitnesses by the police and the enactment of measures to protect the witness's identityduring courtroom testimony, and culminates with the adoption - in extreme cases - ofmeasures for permanent change of identity and relocation. F. Definitions For purposes of the Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedingsinvolving Organized Crime, the following definitions apply: (a) \" Witness \" or \" participant \": any person, irrespective of his or her legal status (informant, witness, judicial official, undercover agent or other), who is eligible,under the legislation or policy of the country involved, to be considered for admis-sion to a witness protection programme; Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 4(b) \" Procedural measures \": action taken by the court during testimony to ensure that witnesses may testify free of intimidation or fear for their life; such measuresinclude, but are not limited to, videoconferencing, voice and face distortion tech-niques and the withholding of details of a witness's identity; (c) \" Witness protection programme \": a formally established covert programme subject to strict admission criteria that provides for the relocation and change of identity ofwitnesses whose lives are threatened by a criminal group because of their coopera-tion with law enforcement authorities; (d) \" Witness protection authority \": a government, police, prosecutorial or judicial authority overseeing and coordinating implementation of the witness protectionprogramme and making decisions on such matters as admittance, duration of pro-tection, measures to be applied, operational policies and procedures; (e) \" Witness protection unit \": a covert unit authorized to implement a witness protec- tion programme and responsible for the physical security, relocation to a new placeof residence and change of identity of programme participants. 5Introduction07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 507-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 6A. Origins: United States of America Witness protection first came into prominence in the United States of America, in the 1970s, as a legally sanctioned procedure to be used in conjunction with a programme fordismantling Mafia-style criminal organizations. Until that time, the unwritten \"code ofsilence\" among members of the Mafia - known as omert\u00e0 - held unchallenged sway,threatening death to anyone who broke ranks and cooperated with the police. Importantwitnesses could not be persuaded to testify for the state and key witnesses were lost to theconcerted efforts of crime bosses targeted for prosecution. That early experience con-vinced the United States Department of Justice that a programme for the protection of wit-nesses had to be instituted. 1II. Witness protection: origins and selected approaches 1Fred Montanino, \"Unintended victims of organized crime witness protection\", Criminal Justice Policy Review , vol. 2, No. 4 (1987), pp. 392-408.Joseph Valachi was the first member of the Italian-American Mafia to break with omert\u00e0, the code of silence. In 1963, he testified before a United States congres-sional committee about the inner structure of the Mafia and organized crime. Hiscooperation was driven by the fear that he would be murdered by Vito Genovese,a powerful Mafia family boss. When Valachi appeared before the committee, he wasguarded by 200 United States marshals. There were rumours that the Mafia hadplaced on his head a price tag of US$ 100,000. He was the first person in the UnitedStates to be offered protection for testimony prior to the establishment of a formalwitness protection programme. Valachi entered protective custody and remained inprison until the end of his natural life. He was kept isolated from other inmates andhis contacts were limited to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and staffof the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Valachi was so terrified of the Mafia's revengethat he insisted on preparing his own food in prison, out of fear that they wouldtry to poison him. He died of a heart attack in 1971, having outlived Vito Genoveseby two years. 707-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 7In 1970, the Organized Crime Control Act empowered the United States Attorney General to provide for the security of witnesses who had agreed to testify truthfully in cases involv-ing organized crime and other forms of serious crime. Under the Attorney General'sauthority, the Witness Security (WITSEC) Program of the United States ensures the physi-cal security of at-risk witnesses predominantly through their resettlement to a new, undis-closed place of residence under a changed name and new identity details. In 1984, after more than a decade of operations, a number of shortcomings that the WITSEC Program had experienced were addressed by the Witness Security Reform Act.The issues dealt with under the Act are still considered to lie at the heart of all witness pro-tection programmes, namely: (a) Strict admission criteria, including an assessment of the risks that relocated former criminals may pose to the public; (b) Creation of a fund to compensate victims of crimes committed by participants after their admission to the programme; (c) Signature of a memorandum of understanding outlining the witness's obligations upon admission to the programme; (d) Development of procedures to be followed in case the memorandum is breached by the participant; (e) Establishment of procedures for the disclosure of information regarding programme participants and penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of suchinformation; (f) Protection of the rights of third parties, especially the honouring of the witness's debts and any non-relocated parent's custody or visitation rights. For a witness to qualify for the WITSEC Program, the case in question must be extremely significant, the witness's testimony must be crucial to the success of the prosecution andthere must be no alternative way of securing the witness's physical safety. There are alsoother conditions, such as the witness's psychological profile and ability to abide by therules and restrictions imposed by the programme. Over the years, eligibility for coverageunder the WITSEC Program has been extended from witnesses to Mafia-style crimes toinclude witnesses to other types of organized crime, such as those perpetrated by drugcartels, motorcycle gangs, prison gangs and violent street gangs. B. Witness protection in various countries Today, witness protection is viewed as a crucial tool in combating organized crime, and alarge number of countries around the world have established such specialized pro-grammes or have legislated their creation. Examples from different jurisdictions that have decided to establish witness protection programmes and their main elements are provided below. 8Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 81. Australia In 1983, a royal commission highlighted the need in Australia for better use to be made of informers in the fight against organized crime and, accordingly, for lower-level players tobe given an incentive to inform on organizers. At that time, arrangements for witness pro-tection were a matter for individual police forces and approaches differed, with some plac-ing emphasis on 24-hour protection and others preferring relocation of witnesses undernew identities. In 1988, a joint parliamentary committee conducted a comprehensiveinquiry into the issue of witness protection and its report 2led directly to the introduction at the Commonwealth level of the Witness Protection Act 1994 and the enactment of mirrorlegislation in several states and the Australian Capital Territory. The Act: (a) Establishes the National Witness Protection Program (NWPP) and sets threshold cri- teria for a person to be considered a witness eligible for inclusion in NWPP. A wit-ness becomes a \"participant\" once accepted into the programme; (b) Vests the Australian Federal Police with the authority to govern the placement of witnesses under and their removal from NWPP, including the signing of memoran-dums of understanding, the creation of new identities and the restoration of formeridentities; (c) Mandates the establishment of a register of participants currently or previously under NWPP, which must contain information such as the person's name and newidentity and details of offences of which the participant has been convicted; (d) Safeguards the integrity of Commonwealth identity documents (tax file numbers, passports) by providing that identity documents for participants in subnational wit-ness protection programmes may not be issued unless complementary legislationand ministerial arrangements are in place in the state or territory relating to theissue of identity documents; (e) Provides mechanisms to ensure that participants do not use their new identity to evade civil or criminal liability and stipulates that witnesses may not be included inNWPP as a means of encouraging or rewarding them for giving evidence or makinga statement; (f) Creates offences relating to the unlawful divulging of information about participants and creates offences for participants who disclose information related to NWPP. In 1997, the Act was amended to allow NWPP participants to make disclosures for the pur- pose of filing a complaint or providing information to the Commonwealth Ombudsman. In2002, the Act was further amended to permit the inclusion of persons in NWPP at therequest of the International Criminal Court. The process for considering a person nomi-nated by the Court for admission to NWPP is similar to the process for the inclusion of for-eign nationals or residents in NWPP. 9Witness protection: origins and selected approaches 2Australia Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, Witness Protection: Report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority , Parliamentary paper No. 193/88 (Canberra, Australian Government Publishing Service, 1988).07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 9As of this writing, the following states and territories of Australia had enacted regional witness protection schemes complementary to NWPP: Australian Capital Territory: Witness Protection Act 1996 New South Wales: Witness Protection Act 1995 Northern Territory: Witness Protection (Northern Territory) Act 2002 Queensland: Witness Protection Act 2000 South Australia: Witness Protection Act 1996 Tasmania: Witness Protection Act 2000 Victoria: Witness Protection Act 1999 Western Australia: Witness Protection (Western Australia) Act 1996 2. China: Hong Kong Special Administrative Region In response to a call from the police for reform in 1994, the Hong Kong Police Force set up an ad hoc witness protection programme. A similar programme was set up in 1998 underthe Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC). In 2000, the Witness ProtectionOrdinance was enacted to provide the basis for protection and other assistance to wit-nesses and persons associated with witnesses. This single piece of legislation providesuniform criteria for the operation of the witness protection programmes established by theHong Kong Police Force and ICAC. The Ordinance: (a) Establishes a witness protection programme to provide protection and other assis- tance to persons whose personal safety or well-being may be at risk as a result of their being witnesses. The programme is implemented, at the Police Force, by the Witness Protection Unit and, at ICAC, by the Witness Protection and FirearmsSection. A third unit is currently being established by the Customs and ExciseDepartment; (b) Stipulates that the person authorized to make decisions on the management of the programme and the inclusion or removal of witnesses is to be designated in writing by the Police Commissioner and the ICAC Commissioner. As of this writing, that authority lay with the Director of Crime and Security at the Police Force and with theDirector of Investigation (Government Sector) at ICAC; (c) Defines the criteria for admission to the programme and the grounds for early termination, outlining the obligations of witnesses ; (d) Authorizes the officer with approval authority to take necessary and reasonable action to protect the safety and welfare of witnesses who have been assessed or are being assessed for admission to the programme, including changing their iden- tity details ; (e) Establishes an appeals procedure against decisions that disallow inclusion of a wit- ness in the programme, terminate protection or determine that a change of identity would not be among the applicable measures. The appeal is reviewed by a special 10Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 10board having the power to confirm or reverse the original decision. Nothing in the legislation prevents a witness from challenging further a decision of the originalauthority or the review board by means of judicial review; (f) Penalizes the disclosure of information about the identity and location of a witness who is or has been a participant in the programme or information that may compro- mise the security of a witness. 3. Colombia Colombia's witness protection programme has its origins in the Constitution of 1991,which listed among the main functions of the Office of the Attorney General the obligationto provide protection for witnesses, victims and other parties to criminal proceedings. LawNo. 418 of 1997 established three distinct witness protection programmes accessible uponapplication to the Office of the Attorney General. The first provides witnesses with infor-mation and recommendations for their own safety; the second provides limited monitor-ing of witnesses situations; and the third involves a change of identity and covers victims,witnesses, parties to proceedings and officials of the Office of the Attorney General. The third programme is managed by a special directorate headquartered in Bogot\u00e1 and with regional offices in Barranquilla, Cali, C\u00facuta and Medell\u00edn. There are two divisions:one for operations and one for administrative matters. A special team of investigators isresponsible for evaluating criminal investigations, studying witness participation in proceedings and ultimately assessing the level of risk and threat that arises as a directconsequence of such participation. In addition, there is an assistance group (made up ofphysicians and dentists), a support network with administrative responsibility for persons already covered by the programme, and a security group responsible for implementing all the protection measures ordered by the Directorate following the threat assessment. The third programme is open only to witnesses in cases involving kidnapping, terrorism and drug trafficking and provides for the permanent relocation inside Colombia andchange of identity for witnesses at risk. Witnesses receive financial assistance to start anew life, together with psychological support, medical care, counselling and assistancewith resettlement and the issuance of new personal documents. Under the law, participants may be removed from the protection programme for any of the following reasons: (a) Unjustified refusal to submit to judicial procedure; (b) Refusal to accept plans or programmes for their resettlement;(c) Commission of wrongful acts that seriously affect the protection procedure;(d) Voluntary withdrawal. 11Witness protection: origins and selected approaches07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 114. Germany Witness protection programmes have been in place in Germany since the mid-1980s. They were first used in Hamburg in connection with crimes related to motorcycle gangs. Inthe following years, they were systematically implemented by other German states and theFederal Criminal Police Office. In 1998, the Witness Protection Act was promulgated. The Act included provisions that regulated criminal proceedings, with a focus on: (a) Use of video technology for interviewing at-risk witnesses (especially children testi- fying as victims); (b) Improved possibilities for ensuring the confidentiality of personal data of witnesses at all stages of criminal proceedings; (c) Provision of legal assistance for victims and witnesses.Also in 1998, the Criminal Police Task Force developed a witness protection concept out- lining for the first time the objectives and measures to be implemented by agenciesinvolved in witness protection. That led to the issuance of general guidelines for the pro-tection of at-risk witnesses by the federal and state ministries of the interior and justice.Until the adoption in 2001 of the Act to Harmonize the Protection of Witnesses at Risk, theguidelines served as the main basis for Germany's witness protection programme. In May2003, the guidelines were aligned with the legal provisions of that act and now serve as theimplementing provisions of the Act for all witness protection offices in Germany. The 2001 Act was introduced to harmonize legal conditions and criteria for witness protection at the federal and state levels. Its main provisions cover the following areas: (a) Categories of witnesses entitled to be considered for inclusion in the programme and the respective admission and removal criteria. Under the Act, admission may be granted to persons who are in danger because of their willingness to testify incases involving serious crime or organized crime. Participants must be both suitedand willing to enter the programme; (b) Decision-making and implementing authority. While the Act provides that the pro- tection unit and public prosecutor should take decisions on admission jointly, it alsorecognizes that witness protection units should hold decision-making authority onmeasures to be applied independently, using for that purpose such criteria as thegravity of the offence, the extent of the risk, the rights of the accused and the impactof the measures; (c) Confidentiality of information relating to the personal data of protected witnesses within witness protection units and other government and non-state agencies. The files on protected witnesses are maintained by the protection units and are not included in the investigation files, but they are made available to the prosecutionon request; 12Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 12(d) Conditions for the issuance of a cover identity and supporting personal documenta- tion and the allowances to be provided for the duration of protection. Germany's witness protection programme consists of witness protection offices estab-lished at the federal level and in each state. The Federal Criminal Police Office is responsi-ble for the protection of witnesses in federal cases and for coordinating functions at thenational and international levels, including: (a) Preparation of an annual report on the witness protection programme; (b) Organization and conduct of training and continuing education; (c) Organization of regular conferences involving the directors of federal and state wit- ness protection offices; (d) Cooperation between states, federal agencies and offices located abroad;(e) International cooperation. In addition, the Federal State Project Group on Quality Assurance in the Field of Witness Protection - comprised of the directors of seven state witness protection offices andchaired by the Federal Criminal Police Office - ensures effective cooperation through thedevelopment of a uniform nationwide procedure for admission to the programme, cre-ation of a standardized catalogue of requirements for witness protection caseworkers andcommon concepts for training and continuing education. 5. Italy As far back as 1930, the Italian Criminal Code provided for partial or total immunity frompunishment if the offender made reparations for criminal damage or cooperated withauthorities in cases of political conspiracy or gang-related activities. In the 1970s, the violent rise of the Red Brigades, a Marxist-Leninist terrorist group, pro- pelled the enactment of a series of laws to encourage dissociation from terrorist groupsand collaboration with the authorities. Although those measures are considered to havebeen instrumental in the dismantling of the Red Brigades, none of those laws provided col-laborators with formal witness protection per se. It was not until 1984, when the Sicilian Mafioso Tommaso Buscetta turned against the Mafia and started his career as a justice collaborator, that witness protection became for-malized. Buscetta was the star witness in the so-called Maxi-Trial, which led to almost 350 Mafia members being sent to prison. In exchange for his help, he was relocated undera new identity. Those events spurred more Mafia members to cooperate, with the resultthat by the end of the 1990s the Italian authorities had benefited from the services of morethan 1,000 justice collaborators. At the same time, the Italian process was increasingly being criticized for the questionable credibility of witnesses and their motivations, and there were allegations of disorganization 13Witness protection: origins and selected approaches07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 13and mismanagement of the witness protection programme. In response, a comprehensive revision to Decree-Law No. 82 of 15 March 1991 was undertaken and entered into force inJanuary 2001. One of the main components of the revised legislation was to create withinthe witness protection programme a separate structure for justice collaborators. The main provisions of Decree-Law No. 82, as amended in 2001, are as follows:(a) Persons eligible for protection: (i) Witnesses and informants in drug-related, Mafia or murder cases; (ii) Witnesses to any offence carrying a sentence of between 5 and 20 years;(iii) Individuals close to collaborators who are in danger; (b) Types of protection: (i) A \"temporary plan\" involving relocation and subsistence for 180 days;(ii) \"Special measures\" involving protection and social reintegration plans for relocated individuals; (iii) A \"special protection programme\" which provides relocation, provisional identity documentation, financial assistance and (as a last resort) new legal identities; (c) Justice collaborators who receive prison sentences must serve at least a quarter of their sentence or, if they have a life sentence, 10 years in prison before they areadmitted into the protection programme; (d) Decisions on admission are taken by a central commission comprised of: (i) The Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of the Interior;(ii) Two judges or prosecutors;(iii) Five experts in the field of organized crime; (e) Changes in identity must be authorized by the Central Protection Service, which is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of protection measures. 6. South Africa Prior to the adoption of the 1996 National Crime Prevention Strategy, witness protectionin South Africa was governed by section 185A of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977. Therelevant provisions were repressive in nature and were used during the apartheid regimeas a means to coerce witnesses to give evidence. The 1996 strategy recognized witnessprotection as a key tool in securing evidence from vulnerable and intimidated witnesses injudicial proceedings and acknowledged that witness protection was, at the time, a weaklink in the criminal justice system. 14Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 14In 2000, Witness Protection Act 112 of 1998 was promulgated, replacing the old system. The new law: (a) Established the national Office for Witness Protection under the authority of the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development. The Office is headed by a national director at the country level and has branch offices in South Africa's nineprovinces. Although legislative amendments have yet to be made, in 2001 the Officewas provisionally reorganized as part of the National Prosecuting Authority and hassince been known as the Witness Protection Unit; (b) Regulates the functions and duties of the Director, including the power to decide on admission to the programme. The Director's decision is based on the recommenda- tions of the branch office head and the relevant officials from law enforcement agen-cies and the National Prosecuting Authority. The Director's decision to refuse anapplication or to discharge a person from protection may be reviewed by theMinister of Justice and Constitutional Development; (c) Defines the types of crimes for which witnesses may request protection, the proce- dure to be followed and the persons eligible to apply. The list of offences is not exclu- sive as the Director has the discretion to approve protection for a witness in respectof any other proceedings if satisfied that the safety of the witness warrants it; (d) Provides that civil proceedings pending against a protected witness may be sus- pended by a judge in chambers, under an ex parte application, to prevent disclosure of the identity or whereabouts of the witness or to achieve the objectives of the Act. The Office for Witness Protection is the address at which legal proceedings may beinstituted with regard to such a witness; (e) Defines offences and severe penalties for any disclosure or publication of informa- tion regarding persons admitted to the programme or officials of the Office for Witness Protection so as to ensure the safety of protected witnesses and programme officials. The decision whether any information is to be disclosed lies with the Director, after consideration of representations and without prejudice to any otherapplicable law; (f) Provides that the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development may enter into agreements with other countries or international organizations regulating the con- ditions and criteria for the relocation of foreign witnesses to South Africa and their admission to South Africa's witness protection programme. Any such relocation requires ministerial approval. C. Witness protection at the permanent and ad hoc international criminal courts The establishment by the Security Council in the 1990s of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other SeriousViolations of International Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan 15Witness protection: origins and selected approaches07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 15Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 19943and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations ofInternational Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslaviasince 1991 4was a major step towards ensuring that serious violations of international humanitarian law, such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, would notgo unpunished. The organization, practice and jurisprudence of those courts in the protec-tion of the victims and witnesses of such horrific crimes have been ground-breaking andare largely reflected in the witness protection provisions of the Rome Statute establishingthe International Criminal Court. 5They have also influenced similar tribunals established in agreement with the United Nations, such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone6and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia for the Prosecution of CrimesCommitted during the Period of Democratic Kampuchea. The main elements of the protection programmes of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International CriminalTribunal for Rwanda are similar and can be summarized as follows: (a) Special units are established under the authority of the court registrar to provide support and protection services to witnesses. The units are not only responsible forphysical protection and security arrangements but are required to provide coun-selling, medical and psychosocial care and other appropriate assistance to victimsand witnesses who appear before the court and to others who are at risk because oftestimony given by such witnesses. At the International Criminal Court, the Victimand Witness Unit is mandated to provide certain services to victims who do not havethe status of witness but present their views and observations to the Court and areentitled, where appropriate, to some form of reparation; (b) The units are responsible for the effective implementation of witness protection measures under the authority of the registrar (non-procedural measures) or the chambers (procedural measures). At the International Criminal Tribunal forthe Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda theunits are neutral, independent bodies that autonomously decide on the needs of witnesses and on the measures to be applied, while at the International Criminal Court, the unit provides its services in consultation with the Office of the Prosecutor; (c) Because of the unique character of the crimes covered by the statutes of the courts, protection measures are equally available to prosecution and defence witnessesalike. To ensure impartiality, the unit at the International Criminal Tribunal forRwanda is subdivided into two distinct teams: one for prosecution witnesses andone for defence witnesses; 16Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime 3Security Council resolutions 955 (1994) and 1717 (2006). 4Security Council resolutions 827 (1993) and 1660 (2006). 5United Nations, Treaty Series , 12:11 pm Page 16(d) In the course of judicial proceedings, a judge or a chamber can grant special proce- dural measures before, during or after the trial, such as temporary disclosurerestrictions, redaction of identifying information from materials disclosed to theopposing party, pseudonyms, facial and voice distortion, closed session testimonyor testimony via video link, to protect witnesses who are at risk because of their tes-timony. The special measures ordered by the court usually involve concealing thewitness's identity from the public or the media; (e) As the tribunals do not have territorial jurisdiction or their own law enforcement capacity, the units rely on the cooperation of States, including their host countries,to ensure close protection measures in out-of-court situations. If the registrardecides that a witness's concerns about his or her safety after testifying are founded,then the unit arranges for the witness's resettlement within the country of residenceor relocation to a third country. The tribunals seek to create a network of countrieswilling to consider accepting witnesses through the conclusion of framework agree-ments. The agreements outline the procedure to be followed when relocation isrequested and the benefits that the receiving State will offer to the witness. As ininter-State cooperation though, the final decision on whether to accept the witnesslies with the receiving State. 17Witness protection: origins 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 18A. Participants 1. The witness The definition of \"witness\" may differ according to the legal system under review. For pro- tection purposes, it is the function of the witness - as a person in possession of informationimportant to the judicial or criminal proceedings - that is relevant rather than his or herstatus or the form of testimony. With regard to the procedural moment at which a personis considered to be a witness, the judge or prosecutor does not need to formally declaresuch status in order for protection measures to apply. Witnesses can be classified into three main categories: (a) Justice collaborators; (b) Victim-witnesses;(c) Other types of witness (innocent bystanders, expert witnesses and others). (a) Justice collaborators A person who has taken part in an offence connected with a criminal organization pos- sesses important knowledge about the organization's structure, method of operation,activities and links with other local or foreign groups. An increasing number of countrieshave introduced legislation or policies to facilitate cooperation by such people in the inves-tigation of cases involving organized crime. These individuals are known by a variety ofnames, including cooperating witnesses, crown witnesses, witness collaborators, justicecollaborators, state witnesses, \"supergrasses\" and pentiti (Italian for \"those who have repented\"). There is no moral element involved in their motivation to cooperate. Many ofthem cooperate with the expectation of receiving immunity or at least a reduced prisonsentence and physical protection for themselves and their families. They are among themain participants in witness protection programmes. The combination of lenience in (or even immunity from) prosecution with witness protec- tion is considered a powerful tool in the successful prosecution of organized crime 19III. Key elements 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 19cases.7However, the practice can raise ethical issues as it may be perceived as rewarding criminals with impunity for their crimes.8To address those concerns, a growing number of legal systems provide that the \"benefit\" to collaborators is not complete immunity fortheir involvement in criminal activities but rather a sentence reduction that may begranted only at the end of their full cooperation in the trial process. Legislation and policy in a number of countries clearly separate admission to a witness protection programme from any benefits that participants may be granted by the prosecu-tion or court with respect to past criminal behaviour, and they provide that justice collab-orators must serve some prison time for their crimes. Within the penitentiary system, special measures are required to protect the life of justice collaborators. A special branch of the prison administration usually administers them incoordination with the protection unit. They include: (a) Separation from the general prison population; (b) Use of a different name for the prisoner-witness;(c) Special transportation arrangements for in-court testimony;(d) Isolation in separate detention units at the prison or even in special prisons.Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime 7The United States Department of Justice claims a successful conviction rate of 89 per cent when a protected witness testifies (\"U.S. Marshals Service talks WitSec to the world\", America's Star: FYi , vol. 1 at http://www.usdoj.gov/marshals/witsec/americas_star.pdf). 8Nicholas Fyfe and James Sheptycki, \"International trends in the facilitation of witness co-operation in organized crime cases\", European Journal of Criminology , vol. 3, No. 3 (2006), pp. 347-349.In Italy, a legislative amendment was introduced in 2001 whereby justice collabora- tors would be eligible for witness protection upon meeting specific criteria, such asa deadline (180 days) to give full testimony that cannot be subsequently altered.Advantages (not immunity, but parole, leave or home imprisonment) may also begranted on the condition that the witness has served a significant part of the sen-tence, cooperates fully, does not pose any danger to the public and has demonstrat-ed good behaviour and signs of reform. In the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and the Netherlands, toensure the safety of high-risk witnesses who are serving prisoners or are beingremanded to prison, special security units have been created in the prison system.Incarceration is usually in isolation from other prisoners, especially from those whowill testify as witnesses in the same case. 2007-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 20Following their release from prison, justice collaborators may be resettled to a new, secret location under a different identity if the threat to their life persists and other conditions arealso fulfilled. Family members of justice collaborators, however, may be admitted to theprogramme while the witness is still in custody. Sometimes prisoner-witnesses commit new crimes after their release from prison and admission to the programme and are subsequently terminated from witness protection.To ensure that their return to prison would not endanger their lives because of their previ-ous cooperation, the prison administration may place them in an inmate monitoring pro-gramme and house them separately from other prisoners who are known to pose a dangerto them. (b) Victim-witnesses In accordance with the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime andAbuse of Power (General Assembly resolution 40/34, annex), \"victims\" means personswho, individually or collectively, have suffered harm, including physical or mental injury,emotional suffering, economic loss or substantial impairment of their fundamental rights,through acts or omissions that are in violation of criminal laws operative in MemberStates, including those laws proscribing the criminal abuse of power. Victims play a central role in the criminal process. They may be the complainant initiat- ing the proceedings or they may be witnesses for the prosecution. Because of the victims'vulnerability, there is general agreement that they should receive assistance before, dur-ing and after their participation in a trial. To ensure their physical safety, general policeand in-court protection measures may be applied (for instance, testimony via videocon-ferencing, safe houses, use of shields). Victim-witnesses may also be included in a wit-ness protection programme if all other conditions are fulfilled (value of testimony,absence of other effective means of protection, existence of serious threat, personality ofthe witness). Recognizing the need to provide for the well-being of victim-witnesses and aware that the admission criteria of witness protection programmes are overly rigid, a number of coun-tries have introduced special witness assistance or support schemes that are distinct fromwitness protection. Implemented in close cooperation with law enforcement, judiciary andimmigration authorities and civil society, such schemes aim to create the conditions thatwould allow vulnerable witnesses not only to testify in physical security but to avoid revic-timization as well. They include: (a) Police protection; (b) Temporary relocation in safe areas;(c) Evidentiary rules of protection measures when testifying in court (anonymity, shielding, videoconferencing); (d) Moderate financial assistance. 21Key elements 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 212. Other participants Some countries consider for inclusion in witness protection programmes not only witnesses but also other categories of people whose relation to a criminal case may puttheir lives in danger, such as judges, prosecutors, undercover agents, interpreters andinformants. The use of informants and intelligence providers by the police is an important element in the investigation and prevention of crimes. Their role is different from that of witnesses,however, as they are not called to testify in court and, in some countries, it is not necessaryto disclose the assistance they provide. In Australia, Austria, Canada, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, informants can be admitted to witness protection pro-grammes. The situation is different in Germany, Slovakia and the United States, whereonly those witnesses who enter the criminal procedure and testify may be eligible for wit-ness protection. Police officers who use informants as sources keep their names and iden-tification details confidential and, under certain conditions, provide them with physicalprotection on an ad hoc basis. Informants admitted to a protection programme should dis-continue their relationship with investigation and intelligence agencies. In most countries, it is only in exceptional circumstances that judges, prosecutors, under- cover agents, expert witnesses and interpreters are included in witness protection pro-grammes. Intimidation or threats against their lives are considered to relate to their postsand the performance of their duties. They can qualify for special police protection, jobtransfers or early retirement, but their protection differs in nature from the protectionmeasures intended for at-risk witnesses. B. The crime 1. Organized crime Witness intimidation has become such a common feature of criminal investigations and prosecution that protection measures for witnesses are considered an essential element ofa country's arsenal against organized crime. The growing tendency of inquisitorial legal 22Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime Pursuant to section 208 of the Criminal Procedure Act of Namibia, the Prosecutor- General is authorized to apply to the judge in chambers to remove the witness to aplace of safety if, in the opinion of the Prosecutor-General, the personal safety of thewitness is in danger or the witness may be intimidated or prevented from giving evidence. A witness placed under protection pursuant to section 208 is entitled to aprescribed allowance by the State for the duration of that protection.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 22systems to adopt elements once exclusive to adversarial systems - such as the greater value given to oral testimony and lesser weight to pretrial statements - has increased theimportance of witnesses in criminal proceedings involving serious crimes and, accord-ingly, the obligation to preserve their evidence. The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime provides that States parties should take appropriate measures to protect witnesses in criminal pro-ceedings related to crimes covered by the Convention and its Protocols. Those crimesinclude: (a) Participation in an organized criminal group; (b) Money-laundering;(c) Corruption in the public sector; 9 (d) Obstruction of justice;(e) Trafficking in persons (see below);(f) Illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition; (g) Smuggling of migrants (see below);(h) Other serious crimes as defined in the Convention, encompassing the elements of transnationality and involvement of an organized criminal group. (a) Trafficking in persons The Trafficking in Persons Protocol includes a specific provision (article 6) that stipulatesa series of protective measures for victims of trafficking and has to be interpreted andapplied in conjunction with the aforementioned provisions of the Organized CrimeConvention on the protection of victim-witnesses. In addition, article 7 of the Protocol -which addresses the status of victims of trafficking in receiving States - enables the grant-ing of residence status to victims of trafficking as a means of encouraging them to comeforward and cooperate with authorities in the prosecution of traffickers by testifying aswitnesses. Thus, States parties to the Protocol are called upon to consider adopting legisla-tive or other measures that would permit victims of trafficking to remain in their territo-ries, either temporarily or permanently, in appropriate cases. Key elements 9During the negotiation of the Organized Crime Convention, the provision on establishing corruption as an offence was the subject of extensive debate, mainly because it was deemed a limited effort against amuch broader phenomenon. As corruption is one of the methods and activities that organized criminalgroups engaged in, the approach finally selected was to include a provision in the Convention targeting cor-ruption in the public sector. That was done on the understanding that, to cover corruption in a compre-hensive manner, a separate instrument would be needed. Subsequent negotiations among Member Statesled to the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (Assemblyresolution 58/4, annex). 2307-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 23(b) Smuggling of migrants The Migrants Protocol stipulates that migrants shall not become liable to criminal prose- cution under the Protocol for the fact of having been smuggled (article 5). That basic pro-vision offers guarantees encouraging such persons to testify and provide evidence againsttheir smugglers in related proceedings in the receiving State. Furthermore, article 16 ofthe Protocol lays down specific obligations for States parties to take all appropriate meas-ures with a view to, among other things: (a) Protecting the internationally recognized rights of smuggled immigrants, in particu- lar the right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhu-man or degrading treatment or punishment (para. 1); (b) Affording migrants appropriate protection against violence that may be inflicted upon them, whether by individuals or groups (para. 2); (c) Offering assistance to those whose life or safety is endangered by reason of having been smuggled (para. 3). 2. Terrorism Witness protection has been particularly important in combating terrorism. The closednature of terrorist groups makes it difficult to use traditional investigative methods withany degree of success and often requires exceptional measures. In some countries, 24Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime UNODC has prepared the Legislative Guides for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols Thereto(United Nations publication, Sales No. E.05.V.2). The Guides aim to assist Member States in seeking the ratification and implementation of the Organized CrimeConvention and its Protocols. They are available in all six official languages of theUnited Nations on the UNODC website (www.unodc.org). In Germany, the use of witness protection and justice collaborators evolved out ofexperience with the prosecution of terrorist groups in the early 1970s. One particu-larly well-known case was the prosecution of members of Baader-Meinhof, a Germanterrorist group founded on Marxist ideology. Gerhard M\u00fcller, associated with thegroup, was arrested on 15 June 1972 for the murder of a police officer. Following hisarrest, M\u00fcller started cooperating with the prosecution and, in 1975, he turned statewitness. He testified about the operational structure of the group and was instrumen-tal in the prosecution of many of his former comrades. Although he was originallysentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, M\u00fcller was released after six and a half yearsand given a new identity.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 24counter-terrorism rather than organized crime was the primary consideration in intro- ducing witness protection measures. The resurgence of international terrorism at the beginning of the new millennium has changed the environment of witness protection, especially with regard to the protection ofpersonal data. An uncomfortable relationship has developed between witness protectionauthorities and counter-terrorism agencies, as the former have come under increasedpressure to share information relating to protected witnesses. Experience has been mixed.In some countries, for instance the Philippines, a large percentage of witnesses under pro-tection are involved in terrorism-related cases. Elsewhere, the use of witness protection interrorism cases has not been the rule. Terrorism investigations are generally handled byspecial counter-terrorism or intelligence agencies and their objective is most often preven-tion rather than prosecution. 3. Corruption In the United Nations Convention against Corruption (General Assembly resolution58/4, annex), States parties are called upon to take appropriate measures for the protection of witnesses against retaliation or intimidation for their testimony (articles32, 33 and 37, para. 4). Under the Convention, protection should be granted not just to witness collaborators but also to victims who become witnesses, and it canextend to family members or persons close to the witness. The measures envisagedinclude: (a) Physical security procedures, such as relocation and non-disclosure of information about the witness's identity details and whereabouts; (b) Evidentiary rules to ensure the witness's safety during courtroom testimony;(c) Signing of agreements among States parties to facilitate the international relocation of witnesses. A number of countries include corruption among the crimes to be covered by witness protection programmes. Under that approach, the same criteria are used for the con-sideration of witnesses in cases involving corruption or organized crime. Althoughwitnesses in serious corruption cases may occasionally face a threat to their lives,they are more often subjected to harassment at work, covert threats of retaliation,demotion or similar action. As a result, the criteria used for assessing the level ofthreat against witnesses in the majority of corruption cases are less exclusive than inorganized crime cases, where the threat to the witness's life that would give cause forinclusion in the witness protection programme is likely to be much higher. To addressthose problems and ensure that corruption is tackled effectively, a number of countries have chosen to establish separate protection programmes for witnesses incorruption cases. 25Key elements 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 254. Other crimes Certain criminal offences that cannot be classified as serious crimes under article 2, paragraph (b), of the Organized Crime Convention (in other words, offences punishableby a maximum deprivation of liberty of a least four years or a more serious penalty) maystill have considerable social impact, or they may be of such a violent nature as to neces-sitate protection measures for witnesses. That is the case, for example, in crimes withinthe family, where vulnerable witnesses (children, women, the elderly) are often sub-jected to intimidation or threats not to report abuse against them by other members ofthe family. 10Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In Thailand, the Witness Protection Act B.E. 2546/2003 provides that special protec-tion measures such as close protection, relocation and change of identity can beapplied in the following categories of serious criminal offences: (a) Drug trafficking; (b) Threats to national security; (c) Organized crime; (d) Corruption; (e) Money-laundering; (f) Customs violations; (g) Trafficking in humans;(h) Offences subject to a minimum term of imprisonment of 10 years. In Guatemala, violence against women is a growing social problem. More than 1,200 women were murdered in that country between 2001 and 2004. Protection measuresthere are mostly applied to victim-witnesses in cases of domestic violence. In South Africa, dealing with violence against women and children is regarded as anational priority. Victims and witnesses in such cases are eligible to apply for admis-sion to the witness protection programme. 10See in this regard the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime (Economic and Social Council resolution 2005/20, annex). 2607-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 26Experience has shown that assistance and protection measures yield positive results, instilling confidence in witnesses to come forward and testify. In many cases, concernsabout a witness's security may be efficiently addressed through: (a) Assistance before and during the trial, which enables them to cope with the psycho- logical and practical implications of testifying in a court of law; (b) Police measures to enhance physical security;(c) Court procedures to ensure the witness's safety during the giving of testimony. As inclusion in a witness protection programme is the solution of last resort of a protection service, it is essential that - in conjunction with the development of (or in the absence of)such a programme - due consideration be given to developing a plan for undertaking risktreatments of witnesses, especially for those who do not meet the predetermined selectioncriteria for admission to the programme. A. Witness assistance Participation in a trial as a witness can be a source of great anxiety for many people andmay seriously affect the quality of their deposition. In a number of countries, police, pros-ecutors and justice authorities have institutionalized regular, early meetings with prosecu-tion witnesses to determine their psychological well-being. Such meetings are particularlyhelpful in the case of child or juvenile witnesses and when witnesses suffer from signifi-cant impairment of intelligence, social functioning or a physical disability or disorderaffecting the quality of the delivery of their evidence. The first task is the identification of vulnerable witnesses and any adults who need special consideration during their contact with the criminal justice process. It is usually the policewho first come in contact with these individuals. The focus should be on interviewing tech-niques, discussion about court arrangements and familiarization with trial procedures. If the case goes ahead, support will also be required during the court hearing and in theperiod immediately afterwards. In a typical criminal case, those activities would probablyspan many months. Witness assistance should be distinguished from witness protection, as the purpose of the former is not to protect the physical security of people but to achieve efficient prosecutionIV. Meeting the threat 2707-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 27and avoid secondary victimization or revictimization of the witness in the trial process (in other words, victimization that occurs not as a direct result of the criminal act but throughthe response of institutions and individuals to the victim). Witness assistance includesmeasures ranging from briefing witnesses on what to expect and the basic aspects of acriminal trial to psychological support to minimize the stress from participating in a trialand financial assistance for transportation, accommodation and childcare, among others.Support is appropriate at all stages of a case but should not involve discussing or rehears-ing witnesses' evidence or otherwise coaching witnesses before trial. Assistance services should be administered and delivered by professionals who are inde- pendent from the investigation and prosecution services. Their competencies and func-tions should be clearly defined and integrated within State welfare support networks,paying special attention to such aspects as confidentiality of shared information and suitability of persons directly or indirectly involved in the case. Personnel engaged in pro-viding assistance to witnesses should be trained and acquire skills in: (a) Knowledge and skills for working with witnesses who may be vulnerable but with- out discussing the case or coaching them in any way; (b) Knowledge and understanding of criminal legislation, police procedures and court rules; (c) Ability to liaise with family members and agencies likely to be associated with the judicial process (for instance, social welfare agencies, non-governmental organiza-tions and others). Non-governmental organizations can prove valuable partners in this process, as they pos- sess wide experience in dealing with vulnerable categories of the population (such as vic-tims, young people and children). To ensure the quality of services provided in thissensitive field, it is important that non-governmental organizations participating in anyassistance scheme are recognized, assessed and approved by the government. 28Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In the United Kingdom, the national charity Victim Support has established the Witness Service, which is available to witnesses in Crown centres and magistratecourts in England and Wales. The Service offers: (a) General information on criminal proceedings;(b) Psychological support;(c) Accompanying the witness to court and the use of a side entrance to enter and leave the court building; (d) Arrangements for appropriate waiting facilities separating witnesses for the prosecution from defence witnesses and the public; (e) Parking and drop-off arrangements;(f) Communicating additional witness requirements on the day of the trial.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 28B. Alternative measures Even though all witnesses should receive assistance and support, witness protection pro- grammes are essentially reserved for those extraordinarily important cases where thethreat against the witness is so serious that protection and support cannot be ensured byother means. To bridge this gap, a number of countries have developed schemes that aredistinct from witness protection programmes but are still based on the principle of makingit more difficult to trace at-risk and intimidated witnesses. Those schemes apply to casesthat do not warrant the permanent relocation and change of identity of the witness. Theymay be ordered in the pretrial or trial phase and provide either for a series of physicalsecurity measures implemented by the regular police or for evidentiary rules enacted bythe courts. Such schemes are often referred to as \"alternative measures\" to witness pro-tection programmes. 1. Target hardening Security measures should be considered in all instances where witnesses genuinelybelieve that there is an imminent threat or danger against their lives as a result of theirinvolvement in assisting the police in investigating a criminal case. In the majority of cases, witnesses do not face a life-threatening situation. Instead, they suffer verbal threats, intimidation, harassment, assault, property damage or simply fear ofreprisal as a result of their cooperation with the police. To provide support and security tosuch witnesses, the police may put a security programme in place. Depending on the legalsystem of the country involved, the programme may be established either by law or as apolicy. It would generally provide for a series of \"enhanced\" police measures to discouragecriminals wanting to harm the witness. The measures taken would be proportional to thethreat and of limited duration. They could include: (a) Temporary change of residence to a relative's house or a nearby town; (b) Close protection, regular patrolling around the witness's house, escort to and from the court and provision of emergency contacts; (c) Arrangement with the telephone company to change the witness's telephone num- ber or assign him or her an unlisted telephone number; 29Meeting the threat In South Africa, the National Prosecuting Authority has a special unit - the Sexual Offences and Community Affairs Unit - that provides assistance to victims and witnesses of crime in coordination with a number of stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations. The Department of Justice and ConstitutionalDevelopment has also enacted the Victim Charter to ensure access to justice forvictim-witnesses.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 29(d) Monitoring of mail and telephone calls; (e) Installation of security devices in the witness's home (such as security doors, alarms or fencing); (f) Provision of electronic warning devices and mobile telephones with emergency numbers; (g) Minimizing of public contacts with uniformed police;(h) Use of discreet premises to interview and brief the witness.The arrangement of temporary accommodation in safe houses for victim-witnesses is among the measures widely used. In some cases the accommodation is located in specifi-cally designated housing units where witnesses can recover and where access is allowedonly to support groups (such as non-governmental organizations, social workers and med-ical staff). Some countries have even constructed top-security facilities for the short-termprotection of witnesses until they testify or are permanently relocated. Such designatedunits for the protection of witnesses under threat may be of limited usefulness since theyare in locations known to the community and easily disclosed. For protection purposes, asafe house may not always be a static point (in other words, in a designated location) butany location not generally known as the usual residence of the individual under protection,where the police can monitor and control all access and communication. It can be as sim-ple as an apartment or hotel room. Police investigators should be trained to assess - when interviewing at the pretrial phase - whether witnesses are subject to intimidation or threats and they should make recom-mendations to the designated authority on proposed action. As under witness protectionprogrammes, those actions would require a high degree of confidentiality and the wit-ness's consent. The obligations of the parties could be outlined in a memorandum ofunderstanding and any breach by the witness could be made grounds for the terminationof protection. Court proceedings potentially expose the witness and the programme to risk. Not only is the witness likely to be vulnerable to intimidation and threats while physically present inthe courtroom to give testimony, but sensitive information regarding the programme isliable to be exposed and tested by the parties (such as the identity and whereabouts of thewitness or the security measures implemented). It is critical that any such risks be identi-fied and addressed at the earliest opportunity through timely and appropriate consulta-tion and liaison with the prosecution. Additional procedural protection measures maythen be requested from the court for the duration of the testimony, such as the use of pseu-donyms in witness statements or suppression of the identity of the witness if permissibleunder applicable law and if that does not so undermine the weight of the witness's testi-mony as to be counterproductive. Schemes such as those described above could be complementary to witness protection programmes and could be used to provide initial support to persons who may later beadmitted to a protection programme. It may also be advisable to have the two pro- 30Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 30grammes administered by different authorities in order to avoid confusion and because the funding, personnel (including that of non-governmental organizations), standardoperating procedures (including security and weapons training) and risks at issuebetween the two are very different. 2. Procedural protection In a number of countries, the court may decide to apply specific measures during the hearing of testimony to ensure that witnesses testify free of intimidation and fear for theirlives. These measures can also be applied in sensitive cases (trafficking in persons, sexcrimes, child witnesses and family crimes, among others) to prevent the revictimization ofvictim-witnesses by limiting their exposure to the public and the media during the trial.They include: (a) Use of a witness's pretrial statement instead of in-court testimony; (b) Presence of an accompanying person for psychological support; (c) Testimony via closed-circuit television or videoconferencing; (d) Voice and face distortion; (e) Removal of the defendant or the public from the courtroom; (f) Anonymous testimony. 31Meeting the threat The Australian Federal Police is considering the development of a witness manage- ment plan in addition to the National Witness Protection Program. The plan wouldapply to cases where the level of threat or intimidation and the options to providesufficient protection do not warrant relocating or changing the identity of the witness.Its aim would be to support those witnesses who do not qualify for formal witnessprotection. Unlike the National Witness Protection Program, which is based on legis-lation (Witness Protection Act 1994), the witness management plan has developed asa policy and would be applied by the regular police. In Chile, there are distinct sets of protection measures for felony and non-felony cases.The first category includes measures such as shielding the identity of witnesses, pro-tective incarceration, relocation and change of identity. The second category includessofter remedies, such as police patrols, changing of telephone numbers and othercommon measures. The police, at the request of the prosecutor or the court, applyboth sets of measures.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 31There are usually no statutory restrictions as to the types of crime or witness for which such measures can be allowed. Their application may be requested by the prosecutor anddecided by the court after it has heard the opinion of the defence. The court's decision isusually open to appeal. The elements typically taken into account by courts when ordering the application of pro- cedural measures are: (a) Nature of the crime (organized crime, sexual crime, family crime etc.); (b) Type of victim (child, victim of sexual assault, co-defendant etc.); (c) Relationship with the defendant (relative, defendant's subordinate in a criminal organization etc.); (d) Degree of fear and stress of the witness; (e) Importance of the testimony.Procedural measures can be grouped into three general categories depending on their purpose: (a) Measures to reduce fear through avoidance of face-to-face confrontation with the defendant, including the following measures: (i) Use of pretrial statements (either written or recorded audio or audio-visual statements) as an alternative to in-court testimony; (ii) Removal of the defendant from the courtroom;(iii) Testimony via closed-circuit television or audio-visual links, such as video- conferencing; (b) Measures to make it difficult or impossible for the defendant or organized criminal group to trace the identity of the witness, including the following measures: (i) Shielded testimony through the use of a screen, curtain or two-way mirror;(ii) Anonymous testimony; 32Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime Gang members gatecrashed a party and in the ensuing fight a partygoer was killed. An innocent onlooker who observed the murder gave a statement to the police, which wascorroborated by other evidence. The witness received threats of reprisals by the gangif he testified in court. The level of threat did not warrant placing the witness in a pro-tection programme. Instead, the witness protection authority decided that keeping thewitness anonymous was possible and would provide sufficient protection and, accord-ingly, it filed a request with the court. The request was granted based on the fact thatthe witness would be exposed to danger if his identity became known. Voice distortionand a screen were used during the trial to conceal the identity of the witness.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 32(c) Measures to limit the witness's exposure to the public and psychological stress: (i) Change of the trial venue or hearing date; (ii) Removal of the public from the courtroom (in camera session); (iii) Presence of an accompanying person as support for the witness. Those measures may be used alone or in combination to produce a greater effect (for example, videoconferencing with shielding or anonymity with face distortion). In the application of procedural measures, due consideration should be given to balancing the witness's legitimate expectation of physical safety against the defendant's basic rightto a fair trial. In jury trials, any restriction of a defendant's right to confront his or her accuser potentially introduces a bias in the trial. Any implying of the defendant's dangerousness may unfairlyprejudice the jury, thereby undermining the presumption of innocence and giving dispro-portionate value to the protected witness's testimony. Trial courts must instruct jurors thatthe use of protective measures should not bias their decision on guilt or innocence. In addi-tion, trial court judges should give general instructions as to the weighing of witness testi-mony to prevent the jury from overvaluing evidence given by a protected witness. Despitesuch cautionary instructions, when procedural measures are applied to reduce the wit-ness's fear of a face-to-face confrontation with the defendant, they impose an additionalburden on the accused to prove his or her innocence, or at least the absence of threat. 11 (a) Pretrial statements In some countries, written or recorded audio or audio-visual statements given by a wit-ness before an investigator, prosecutor, investigative judge or judge during the pretrialphase may be admissible as evidence in court in exceptional cases, for example, if the witness dies before the trial date.Meeting the threat In the Republic of Korea, protective measures used during the investigation stage include: (a) Appointing assistants and trustees to accompany the witness and offer support; (b) Expunging the personal information of the witness; (c) Using video links or two-way mirrors. The protective measures used during testimony include in camera sessions, witness anonymity and testimony by video link. 11Nora V. Demleitner, \"Witness protection in criminal cases: anonymity, disguise or other options?\", American Journal of Comparative Law , vol. 46, 1998, pp. 660-661. 3307-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 33Allowing pretrial statements as evidence in court when the witness is available to testify could be used as a protective measure insofar as it does not expose the witness to potentialintimidation by the defendant. Conversely, doing so could affect the defendant's right to afair trial, preventing him or her from directly challenging the witness's testimony and rais-ing additional points other than those recorded during the taking of the statement. As aresult, pretrial statements could be allowed on the condition that the defence (counsel/defendant) has the chance to examine and challenge the credibility of the statement andthe granting of its admissibility. Those standards are easier to maintain when the state-ment is taken with the exclusive purpose of being used in court in the place of live witnesstestimony. In such cases, at the request of the prosecutor, the pretrial hearing of a witnesscan be conducted as an alternative to in-court witness testimony. (b) Accompanying persons The court may allow a witness to be accompanied by another person during testimony ifthe witness is likely to feel considerable anxiety or tension (see figure I). The presence of accompanying persons is particularly common with vulnerable witnesses, especiallyvictims of sexual crimes or child witnesses. As with all support functions, the accompanying person must be someone who has only basic information about the witness's evidence and is not a party to the case. Typically, anaccompanying person is a parent, teacher, police officer or therapist. Accompanying persons may not: (a) Disturb, hinder or unduly influence the cross-examination and testimony; (b) Object to particular questions;(c) Offer advice to the witness.Accompanying persons may: (a) Be in close physical proximity to or in contact with the witness during testimony; (b) Inform the court of the witness's condition; (c) Recommend a recess, for example, if the witness is too distressed to continue. 34Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime Under the Criminal Procedure Code of Japan, pretrial statements may be used instead of witness testimony only with the consent of the defence. If consent is withheld, thewitness has to testify in court. However, the court may, under certain conditions anddespite objections from the defence, decide to use the pretrial statement of the wit-ness, for instance, if it deems that the witness is in a pronounced state of fear or anx-iety that makes his or her testimony different from the pretrial statement made beforea prosecutor. 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 34The presence of accompanying persons can sometimes be challenged by the defence on the grounds that they strengthen the impression of the defendant as a dangerous individ-ual because of the fear caused to the witness. In such cases, the court may order accompa-nying persons - especially if they are uniformed police officers - to sit with the public butin close proximity to the witness. (c) Shielding of the witness The use of screens, curtains or two-way mirrors may be ordered by the court to shield wit-nesses and their identity from the defendant and from the public and the media as ameans to reduce potential intimidation. Screens should not prevent the judge, magis-trates, jury and at least one legal representative of each party to the case (prosecution anddefence) from seeing the witness and the witness from seeing them. Their use affects theright to face-to-face confrontation, with no opportunity for the defendant to see the expres-sion or attitude of the witness and to challenge the latter's credibility on the basis of suchappearance (see figure II). The right to cross-examination is not affected. 35Meeting the threat Figure I Sample courtroom arrangement when an accompanying person is present Source: Ministry of Justice of Japan. In Japan, screening is done in such a way that the defence counsel can still see the witness, so the right to face-to-face examination is not greatly affected. The exclusionof the defendant from the courtroom is done only in exceptional circumstances. Eventhen, the defendant has to be informed of the content of the witness's testimony andbe given the opportunity to challenge it. PublicWitnessAccompanying personCourt DefendantDefence counsel Prosecutor Court clerk07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 35(d) Removal of the defendant from the courtroom and in camera sessions In exceptional cases, the court may order the removal of the defendant from the courtroom as a precautionary measure to prevent intimidation of the witness during the taking of tes-timony or as a punitive measure in response to intimidation attempts by the defendant,such as verbal threats or threatening gestures made towards the witness. That measurehas serious implications for the defendant's right to confrontation. To compensate, afterthe completion of testimony, the defendant may be allowed back in the courtroom to readthe transcript of the testimony and dictate questions to the witness. The defendant wouldthen be removed again from the courtroom to allow the witness to respond. 12 When the threat against the witness does not come from the defendant but from peoplewho are not parties to the criminal proceedings but are related to the case, the courtmay exclude the public from the courtroom. That measure does not apply to the partiesto the case. (e) Use of modern communications technology In article 18, paragraph 18, of the Organized Crime Convention, States parties are calledupon to introduce domestic legislation allowing testimony by videoconference or throughother technological means, such as devices and software for image and voice distortion, toprevent the revealing of a witness's identity to the defendant and the public. Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime Figure II Sample courtroom arrangement when a screen is used Source: Ministry of Justice of Japan. 1Stjepan Glu scic and others, Protecting Witnesses of Serious Crime: Training Manual for Law Enforcement and Judiciary (Strasbourg, Council of Europe Publishing, 2006) p. 331.PublicWitness ScreenCourt DefendantDefence counsel Prosecutor Court clerk 3607-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 36(a) Image and voice distortion techniques can be used to keep the witness's identity secret in situations where the defendant and the witness know each other. Whenthe witness is present in the courtroom, the techniques may involve the use ofsimple means, such as a theatrical disguise to hide or alter the witness's facialcharacteristics (wigs, make-up, large sunglasses). Image distortion can also be combined with evidence via closed-circuit television, altering or blurring byelectronic means the witness's face to prevent recognition. If the witness couldbe recognized merely by the sound of his or her voice, special electronic equipment can be used to distort the witness's voice while testifying behind ascreen or via videoconference. Where the audio recording of court proceedings ismandatory, the voice-distorted testimony should be maintained in the officialrecords. However, if the defendant knows the witness, the validity of such measures is limited as the defendant would be able to identify the witness fromthe substance of the testimony and describe to others the person against whomto retaliate; (b) Videoconferencing refers to the use of interactive telecommunications technologies for witness testimony via simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. It allows the options of the witness testifying from a room adjoining the courtroomvia closed-circuit television or from a distant or undisclosed location through anaudio-visual link. Videoconferencing offers the benefit of enabling the witness to beabsent from the place where the proceedings are being held but at the same time tosee and hear - and be seen and heard by - the judge, magistrates or jury and theother parties. The testimony is broadcast to the courtroom where the prosecutor,defendant and public are present. As a protective measure, it reduces the threat tothe witness's security and the danger of intimidation by the defendant in the court-room. Where total anonymity is required, videoconferencing may be used in 37Meeting the threat In January 2003, four people were arrested in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and charged with trafficking in humans. A 23-year-old woman fromMoldova was among the victims and also a key witness. After the arrest of the defen-dants, she was repatriated to Moldova. When the trial opened, the SoutheastEuropean Cooperative Initiative (SECI) Regional Center for Combating TransborderCrime in Southeast Europe facilitated the transportation of the victim to the formerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia to testify. The court however dismissed the case. Onappeal by the prosecutor, the court ordered the case to be tried. Disappointed bydevelopments and fearing for her safety, the witness refused to travel and appear incourt again. The criminal procedure codes in both countries allowed testimony viavideoconference. On 28 April 2005, the witness testified in the trial held in the for-mer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia through a videoconferencing link from a courtin Moldova. It was the first time such testimony had taken place between two coun-tries in that region.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 37conjunction with screens or image distortion. Questions by the prosecutor or the defence counsel are relayed by microphone to the witness, who usually answersthrough voice distortion. 13 A number of countries have designated special courtrooms in the regular court systemfor the holding of trials of cases involving organized crime and have equipped them withthe latest communications technology. In the Republic of Korea, a special, new court-house is being built specifically to accommodate the taking of remotely given evidencevia video link. Although the use of modern communications technology, especiallyvideoconferencing, depends upon the financial resources available, it is not prohibi-tively expensive. There are countries where the use of electronic means to hide the witness's facial or other characteristics is not allowed because they are considered to limit the right of face-to-faceconfrontation and to prevent the jury or magistrates from gaining an impression of thewitness's relevant physical attributes, for example in cases where it is claimed that thedefendant used force to restrain the witness. 14 (f) Anonymous witnesses Keeping some or all of a witness's identity details hidden from the defence and the publiccan be an effective means of protection in the rare cases where the substance of the testi-mony itself does not identify the witness to the defence and the testimony is corroboratedby other evidence. The measure is usually granted by the court at the request of the wit-ness, and the ruling can usually be appealed and is revocable. Countries where anonymous testimony is allowed:(a) Keep records of the witness's identity separately from the transcript of the trial and in a secure location; (b) Sanction or prosecute in accordance with the law any attempt to reveal an anony- mous witness's identity. Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime 13In article 18, paragraph 18, of the Organized Crime Convention States parties are called upon to make use of videoconferencing as a means of facilitating the taking of testimony from witnesses residing ina different State party's jurisdiction. An interpretative note included in the Travaux Pr\u00e9paratoires of the Negotiations for the Elaboration of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols Thereto (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.06.V.5, p. 199) reflects a proposal sub- mitted by the Italian delegation during the negotiations and recommends its use as a guideline for imple-menting the above provision. According to that proposal, the judicial authority of the requested State wouldbe responsible for identifying the witness and, on the hearing's conclusion, for drawing up minutes indi-cating the date and place and any oath taken. The hearing would be conducted without any physical ormental pressure on the witness. Other safeguards provided are the right of the requested State to interruptthe videoconference if it infringes on fundamental principles of its domestic law and the right of the wit-ness to have an interpreter or not to testify, if that is provided for by the national law of either the request-ing or the requested State. Moreover, the law of the latter shall apply in case of perjury. Finally, the costsof the videoconference would be borne by the requesting State. 14Council of Europe, European Committee on Crime Problems, Committee of Experts on Criminal Law and Criminological Aspects of Organised Crime, Report on Witness Protection (Best Practice Survey) , Best Practice Survey No. 1, document PC-CO (1999) 8 REV (Strasbourg, Council of Europe Publishing, 1999). 3807-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 38(i) Partial or limited anonymity Where partial or limited anonymity is granted, the witness may be cross-examined in court by the defence but is not obliged to state his or her true name or other personaldetails, such as address, occupation or place of work. That measure is particularly usefulwhen hearing the testimony of undercover agents and members of surveillance teams whowould be in danger if their real identities became known to the public. Such a witness usu-ally testifies in court under the assumed name that he or she was known by during theoperation but states his or her true function (police officer, investigator etc.). (ii) Total or complete anonymity When total or complete anonymity is granted by the court, all information relating to theidentity of the witness remains secret. The witness appears in court but testifies behind ashield, disguised or through voice distortion. In practice, that measure is useful only incases where witnesses were innocent bystanders of the crime, and therefore such casesrarely involve prosecutions of gang leaders, who typically order others to carry out theirviolent schemes. If the defendant knows the witness, then maintaining completeanonymity would be unrealistic, as the defendant can readily identify the witness throughhis or her testimony or the context of the information provided. 39Meeting the threat The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on implementation of article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and FundamentalFreedoms (United Nations, Treaty Series , vol. 213, No. 2889) has created a set of condi- tions for the use of anonymous witnesses that are incorporated in the respective legisla-tion and court practices of the 46 States parties to the Convention and that limit the weightor probative value that may be placed on such evidence (see European Court of HumanRights, Kostovski v. The Netherlands , Judgement of 20 November 1989, Application No. 11451/85, Series A, No. 166; Windisch v. Austria , Judgement of 27 September 1990, Application No. 12489/86, Series A, No. 186; L\u00fcdi v. Switzerland , Judgement of 15 June 1992, Application No. 12433/86, Series A, No. 238; and Doorson v. The Netherlands , Judgement of 26 March 1996, Application No. 20524/92, Reports 1996-II). In Germany, when total anonymity is granted, a law enforcement officer gives the evi- dence in court in place of the witness, stating what the witness saw. With the exceptionof information relating to the identification details of the witness, there are no limitationsto the right of the defence to challenge the testimony as relayed by the law enforcementofficer. Additionally, the defence has the right to submit in writing questions to be putto the anonymous witness by the reporting officer, who will subsequently report theanswers to the court. The Federal Court of Justice has ruled that, because of its largelyhearsay character, such testimony has limited value unless otherwise corroborated byother material evidence (Council of Europe. Terrorism: Protection of Witnesses and Collaborators of Justice (Strasbourg, Council of Europe Publishing, 2006)).07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 39Total anonymity is an exceptional measure and may have serious implications for the defendant's right to a fair and open trial, face-to-face confrontation and right to cross-examine a witness. It places limitations on the right to challenge the genuineness, accu-racy and sincerity of the testimony. The defence in such cases may not be able to verify: (a) Any relationship with the defendant that may be the cause of a prejudiced attitude; (b) The origin of the knowledge; (c) Any personal history that may affect the witness's credibility (mental condition, criminal record, habitual lying etc.). In view of the impact that the use of anonymous testimony has on the rights of the defen- dant, its application should be established statutorily with strictly defined conditions thatbalance the need for protection with the defendant's right to a fair trial. 15In countries where total anonymity is used: Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime An example of the serious legal issues raised by the use of anonymous witnesses isthe criticism that the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia received for allow-ing for the first time a totally anonymous witness to testify in the Tadic case (Prosecutor v. Dusko Tadic , Case No. IT-94-1-T). Tadic was arrested in Germany on 12 February 1994, and charged in connection with crimes committed in 1992 in the Omarska prisoncamp in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Pursuant to a request by the International Tribunalfor the Former Yugoslavia, Germany transferred custody of Tadic to the Tribunal in April1995. The Tribunal indicted Tadic on 132 counts of crimes against humanity and warcrimes. During the trial, the prosecutor filed a motion requesting protective measuresfor seven witnesses, including total anonymity for some of them (testimony via one-way closed-circuit television, voice and image distortion, non-disclosure of identifyingdata, sealing and removal from court records of such data, testimony during in cam-era sessions of the chambers). The trial chamber's decision by majority vote (2 to 1)to grant the prosecution's motion was severely criticized as limiting the right of thedefendant to a fair trial (see http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/index-e.htm, which alsocontains the separate opinion of Judge Stephen on the prosecutor's motion request-ing protective measures for victims and witnesses). No trial chamber of theInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia or the International Criminal Tribunalfor Rwanda has allowed an anonymous witness since then. On 26 January 2000, DuskoTadic was convicted and sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. 15Of relevance here is the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, according to which the maintenance of the anonymity of the witness does not entail infringement of article 6 (Right to a fairtrial) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms if the handicapsunder which the defence laboured were sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judi-cial authorities (e.g. questioning the anonymous witness in the presence of counsel by an investigating judgewho was aware of the witness's identity, even if the defence was not) (see Doorson v. The Netherlands , Judgement of 26 March 1996, No. 20524/92, paras. 72-73). 4007-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 A conviction needs to be corroborated by other material evidence and cannot be based solely or to a decisive extent on the anonymous testimony; (b) The defendant should be allowed to put questions directly to the witness during tes- timony or through the defence counsel, in written form or otherwise; (c) The reasons for maintaining the secrecy of the witness's identity should be revisited at different stages of the criminal proceedings and after their completion; (d) The decision-making authority (investigative judge, court, other) should verify that there is a witness and should clarify circumstances that may affect the witness's reli-ability (mental illness, bias against the witness etc.). The handling by court staff of anonymous witnesses' data is of particular importance. Court proceedings, evidence and information related to the case are typically handled by anumber of people. Court staff responsible for the safekeeping of such information and forentering such information into the record must be carefully selected. 3. Self-protection There are occasions where, because of the lack of an established witness protection pro-gramme, refusal of the witness to enter witness protection where such programmes exist orlack of eligibility criteria, witnesses may be offered support to look after their own protection. In cases of low threat, a lump-sum payment may be offered to witnesses to assist them in their own resettlement. That will likely be within their own country and offers a viable alter-native to admission to a protection programme. Such is often the case in large or heavilypopulated countries where people can easily resettle without raising undue interest in theirnew environment. The respective police or witness protection unit may facilitate and assistwith the move but does not assume any responsibility, and there is no formal agreement ormemorandum of understanding between the parties. The problem is that such an arrange-ment may result in an entire lack of control over the choice of the new location and nomeans to manage the risk that the witness may pose to the new community. Law enforcement authorities in some countries focus on instilling in witnesses what may be termed a feeling of security. They work with witnesses in analysing risky situations anddevelop self-protection measures to enable witnesses to take more effective control of theirpersonal lives and to behave in a way that supports other measures implemented by theprotection unit. 41Meeting the threat In New Zealand, the identification data of anonymous witnesses are produced by the protection unit on police letterhead and given directly to the judge, who reads themand stores the document in the court's safe. That information is then kept secure butit can be retrieved if it becomes necessary to trace the witness or if new evidence isuncovered leading to an appeal or review of the case.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 4107-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 42A. Need versus want A State's decision to set up a witness protection programme should be reached on the basis of a thorough analysis of factors relating to the level and types of criminality within its soci-ety, frequency of violence against participants in criminal proceedings, demonstrated abilityand will to prosecute high-profile crimes and availability of resources. For example, the exis-tence of powerful criminal syndicates willing to go to any length to protect their criminaloperations and their rich lifestyles (paid for using the proceeds of those criminal operations)may leave little doubt about the need for a witness protection programme to aid prosecutors. B. Legislation versus policy basis Using protection measures affects the rights of the defendant and potentially influencesthe right to a fair and unbiased hearing. It also leads to serious disruption of the life of thewitness and any persons accompanying the witness in the programme. It may even haveimplications for third parties. Because of those serious implications, protection pro-grammes should be well grounded in either legislation or policy. 43V. Setting up a witness protection programme Zahaira Habibulla H. Sheikh and Another v. State of Gujarat and Others (2004) 4 SCALE 375 (the Best Bakery case) was a case involving the killing of 14 persons in a com-munal riot in Gujarat, India. Thirty-seven of the prosecution witnesses, including sev-eral eyewitnesses (some of them relatives of the deceased), turned hostile at the trial,which resulted in the acquittal by the court of all 21 accused persons. When revers-ing the acquittal and ordering a retrial outside Gujarat, the Supreme Court of Indiamade several observations on the question of witness protection, stating that legisla-tive measures to emphasize prohibition against tampering with witnesses, victims orinformants had become the inevitable need of the day and that witness protectionprogrammes were imperative in the context of the alarming rate of \"somersaults\" bywitnesses. In fact, the Supreme Court has since sought responses from various coun-tries on the question of witness protection, and the Law Commission of India has sub-mitted an extensive report on the subject and a draft bill to the Parliament for adoption(India, Law Commission of India, Consultation Paper on Witness Identity Protection and Witness Protection Programmes (New Delhi, August 2004)).07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 43In the majority of cases, witness protection is based on statute in the form of the criminal procedure code, police law, special legislation or even the constitution. Legislation should be sufficiently flexible to allow the application of measures to meet the needs of any particular case, its significance within the community and the interests of theparties. If the statute contains an exhaustive list of offences for which protection can beprovided, it may be appropriate to have an omnibus clause, enabling the relevant author-ity to exercise discretion in determining witnesses associated with crimes that ought tocome under the protection scheme. Legislation should specify at a minimum: (a) Protection measures that may be adopted; (b) Conditions for their application and criteria for admission of witnesses; (c) Procedure to be followed; (d) Authority responsible for the programme's implementation; (e) Reason for the programme's termination; (f) Rights and obligations of the parties;(g) Confidentiality of the programme's operations. The existence of legislation is the most common scenario but may not always be required. There are examples of countries with established programmes where witness protectionis not based on a law, such as New Zealand. In those countries, witness protection wasdeveloped as a regular police function deriving directly from the responsibility of thepolice to protect the life and safety of people. Policy, coupled with the agreements signedwith witnesses admitted to the programme, provide a sufficient and adequate frameworkfor the programme's operations. The difference between the groups of countries that base witness protection on legislation and those that base it on policy does not always follow the traditional civil law-commonlaw divide. In Austria, the Netherlands and Norway, which are civil law countries, witnessprotection has not been legislated. At most there are mandating provisions in the law gov-erning the police force. The absence of a detailed legal framework, however, does not pre-vent the application of a full range of protection measures (change of identity, resettlementand financial support, among others). 44Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime Section 80A of the Constitution of Chile provides that protective measures for witnesses and victims are among the main functions of the Office of the Public Prosecutor. The pro-tective function is thus a duty of the Office of the Public Prosecutor by constitutionalmandate, which gives it a place of note in the hierarchy of the national legislation.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 44In the United Kingdom (a common law country), the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act of 2005 placed on a statutory footing the arrangements for the protection of witnesses.That was deemed necessary after a steady rise in witness protection cases in recent years(55 per cent from 2001 to 2003) 16had highlighted the need to help providers secure assis- tance from Government agencies in setting up protection arrangements and to offer addi-tional safeguards through the introduction of offences for disclosing information relatingto those arrangements. Even though the Act does not create a national programme in theUnited Kingdom, it: (a) Creates uniform criteria for admission and eligibility; (b) Penalizes the disclosure of information about protection arrangements or about the identity or location of a protected witness; (c) Establishes the duty of public authorities to render assistance to protection units;(d) Allows the transfer of responsibility for witnesses between police forces (reloca- tion). C. Programme location Once it has been decided that there is a need for a witness protection programme, policy-makers need to determine where to place the programme within the broader structure ofthe government or the judiciary. Linked to this decision is the funding source and exerciseof oversight over the activities of the programme. One of the decisions to be made is whether the programme should be located within or outside the police force. For some countries, the police force is the programme's naturalenvironment, as out-of-court protection of witnesses is seen primarily as a police function.For others, separating protection from the investigation is of higher value in order toensure objectivity and minimize the risk that admission to the programme unwittinglymay become an incentive for witnesses to give false testimony that they believe the policeor prosecution wants or needs. Where witness protection is essentially a police function, as is the case in Australia, Austria, Canada, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, New Zealand,Norway, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, programmes are located within the policeforce. Responsibility for management of the programmes (decisions on admission, fund-ing, recruitment and other matters) is vested in the chief executive of the police force(the police commissioner) and is associated with the position (ex officio). Cohabitation ofwitness protection agencies with the police may lead to an uneasy relationship. Policeofficers are inquisitive by nature and the security of the information may be compro-mised. In cases where the programme is located within the police force, the isolationSetting up a witness protection programme 16United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Home Office, \"Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005: guidance notes\", 2005, p. 3. 4507-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 45and autonomy (organizational, administrative and operational) of the covert unit responsible for the implementation of the programme from the rest of the police force isof paramount importance. A balance is required between the need to operate in extreme confidentiality and the need to maintain an adequate level of cooperation with the police, for example in conductingthreat assessments or moving witnesses at times of greatest risk from their place of domi-cile to new locations. In Colombia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, South Africa and the United States, pro- grammes are separated organizationally from the police force and placed under the equiv-alent of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior or the State Prosecutor's Office.Here it is the chief executive of the respective institution (Secretary or Minister of Justice,Attorney General, State Prosecutor) who holds decision-making power over admission tothe programme and oversight of activities. Finally, in a third group of countries (which includes Italy), the programme is imple- mented by a multidisciplinary body consisting of high-level representatives of the lawenforcement, prosecutorial, judicial and Government authorities. That body takes deci-sions on such matters as admission to the programme and termination of witness protec-tion. It also exercises oversight over implementation of the programme and makesbudgetary submissions to the Government. Whether the programme should be located within the police or not seems to lose impor- tance in the light of the fact that all three groups include countries with successful and long-standing witness protection programmes. More so than the location of the programme, the following issues seem to be key to the success of witness protection programmes: (a) Separation from the investigation; (b) Confidentiality of procedure and operations; (c) Organizational autonomy from the regular police. D. Organizational structure From a structural point of view, witness protection programmes may exist at the national or regional level or both. Where national and regional programmes coexistwithin the same country, the responsibilities of the respective protection agencies needto be clearly delineated but, ideally, their decision-making process should be central-ized at the national level to ensure consistency of admittance criteria and appliedmeasures. 46Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 46E. Personnel Staffing is a crucial element for the success of any protection programme. Witness protec- tion officers need to possess a particular set of qualities and skills. They are required to bevigilant protectors, interrogators and undercover agents, as well as innovative thinkers,social workers, negotiators and even counsellors. One of the first tasks when establishinga programme is to decide where to find people with such qualifications. 47Setting up a witness protection programme In parallel with the National Witness Protection Program (NWPP) run by the Australian Federal Police, there are seven programmes at the state or territory level. NWPP dealsonly with cases of organized or other serious crimes in which there is a very realthreat against the witness's life. The subnational programmes have a broader scopeand cover lower-level cases, including domestic violence. The Australian FederalPolice accepts referrals from state jurisdictions and crime commissions; liaises reg-ularly through the Australasian Heads of Witness Protection Forum; and maintains agood working relationship with each state jurisdiction. However, information aboutwitnesses or methodology is not shared, and cases are kept confidential and private.State agencies and the Australian Federal Police can relocate witnesses to anotherpart of the state or to another state. Protocols are currently being developed toenable any witness protection authority to seek the transnational relocation of pro-tected witnesses. The United Kingdom has no national police force. Instead, there are 43 regionalpolice forces in England and Wales, 8 in Scotland and 1 in Northern Ireland. As faras witness protection is concerned, the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agencyprovides witness protection for all eight police forces in Scotland. In England,Northern Ireland and Wales, witness protection is implemented at the local leveland dedicated programmes have been established in, among others, the LondonMetropolitan area, Greater Manchester area, Northumbria, West Yorkshire,Hampshire and Merseyside. The forces that do not have their own witness protec-tion programmes outsource that function to neighbouring forces. At the nationallevel, the Serious Organised Crime Agency established under the Serious OrganisedCrime and Police Act of 2005 has a witness protection unit. The Witness ProtectionBureau established within the Home Office of the United Kingdom has no opera-tional capacity but provides support and central services to witness protection units, such as access to social housing, benefits and medical care for protected wit-nesses. The Bureau is also the single point of contact for international relocationsand operations.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 47To ensure the confidentiality and security of information, protection agencies need to establish strict recruitment criteria and vetting procedures. The following are commonelements of the recruitment and training of programme personnel: (a) Qualifications. Protection is a complex task requiring experience in a variety of fields, ranging from close personal protection and handling of weapons to law andpsychology. A minimum of five years of service and adequate security clearanceaccording to applicable laws and regulations are among the basic conditions; (b) Integrity. Officers and administrative staff employed by witness protection units should be of high moral standards and have among their personality traits bothintegrity and the ability to maintain confidentiality. Those qualities create the necessary conditions for witness protection programmes to operate with the utmostconfidentiality; (c) Psychological profile. Witness protection is an arduous task. Personnel need to rec- oncile themselves with the fact that in most cases they will have to protect formercriminals. Irrespective of how good they may be as police officers, some of themcould find it impossible to switch roles, going from pursuers of criminals to becom-ing their protectors. In addition, as witnesses are isolated from their social sur-rounding and lose their normal support network, protection officers become almostsurrogate families to them. Despite professional distancing, that relation could havea severe psychological impact on handlers. Recruitment needs to be based on a psy-chological assessment of candidates, and counselling should be available to person-nel for the duration of their service; (d) Full-time force. Employment within the unit may be either full-time or part-time. The core staff of the unit should be a full-time force in order to reduce the risk ofcompromise and ensure high-level protection services through constant training.Part-time personnel could be available and used on a call-up basis for physical pro-tection against lower threats at the regional or local level; (e) Volunteer force. Because of the nature of protection services and the effect they may have on a handler's life (long absences from home, increased danger, need to main-tain secrecy, among others), employment with the unit is in most cases voluntary.Officers need to apply and go through a vetting procedure that includes interviewsand physical and psychological tests. Ideally, a mix of genders, ages and personali-ties should be aimed for in an endeavour to reflect society at large and acquire thecombination of personal qualities and skill sets required (young go-getters, cautioustypes etc.); 48Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In New Zealand, the witness protection unit has its origins in the country's VIP Protection Team, which was well trained and centralized. The team members had the cover of theirduties of protecting public figures so were reasonably able to work in a semi-covertcapacity and had a plausible reason for prolonged absences from their stations.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 48(f) Tenure. Most agencies have a policy of rotating staff every 3-5 years. The reasons are career development, prevention of corruption and the demanding nature of thejob. Often, those factors have to be balanced against the need to retain qualified stafffor longer periods of time in service with the unit; (g) Salaries and benefits. Service with the witness protection programme implies hav- ing long working hours and being on call almost continuously to respond to emer-gency situations. The benefits offered to officers, however, vary. Some programmespay only police salaries linked to rank and years of service, while others offer specialbenefits, such as overtime or additional compensation; (h) Training. Ongoing skills maintenance and development is the key to the effective- ness of a witness protection programme. Protection officers perform a number offunctions that require aptitudes that are different and perhaps broader than normalpolice functions. As a result, training must be multidisciplinary in nature and coverdiverse fields. Coordinated and standardized training in national witness protectionprogrammes could increase the confidence of the authorities in the capacity of othercountries to protect witnesses and lead to the strengthening of international cooper-ation on witness relocation; (i) Outsourcing. Protection programmes provide specialized services to their clients. If no specific arrangements are in place, events such as an accident or illness may compro-mise the programme, as hospitals require the patient's medical history and personaldetails. Even though insourcing has the advantage of providing services to both wit-nesses and officers of the protection unit alike, it is costly. Some programmes choose tooutsource particular support services, especially medical care. In-house doctors can beused for the initial check-up or treatment, with specialized or prolonged medical assis-tance being offered by physicians and hospitals from an approved roster. Psychologicalsupport, however, is in most cases provided by internal psychologists. For outsourcedservices, especially from the private sector (private hospitals, physicians etc.), strictselection and confidentiality criteria need to be applied. The following examples showhow different witness protection programmes outsource certain services: (i) In Australia, NWPP has recruited its own psychologist, who can be called upon at any time. If a witness needs ongoing psychological or medical assis-tance, an arrangement is in place with a national health-care providerwhereby the person can seek assistance. Records are controlled centrally bythe health-care provider in order to protect the identity of the witness; 49Setting up a witness protection programme In South Africa, the strategy of the Witness Protection Unit to improve the manage- ment of witnesses is based on the development of a diverse staff working on a full-time basis. According to the National Prosecuting Authority 2004-2005 Annual Reporton the Witness Protection Program Unit, 41 per cent of the staff are male and 59 percent are female. As for diversity, 41 per cent are black, 29 per cent are white and 12 per cent are Indian.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 49(ii) The programme in New Zealand uses police-approved physicians in the initial stages and a psychologist from a police-approved list for ongoingtrauma counselling in case of witness relocation. As for medical care, a policephysician is used for initial check-ups, and then a new national health indexnumber is used. If the witness has a medical history that needs to be includedin the new records, it is sanitized and added to them; (iii) In South Africa, psychologists have been recruited in the head office and each of the nine branch offices of the Witness Protection Unit to offer supportto both witnesses and programme officials; (iv) ICC uses private health insurance, with health-care providers being given no factual information but only a code. In-house psychological assessmentsare also available. The aim is to get people out in 4-5 months, during whichtime a social worker looks after individuals through an \"induction\" pro-gramme with no access to their actual identity details. F. Funding The cost associated with setting up and operating witness protection programmes can bea reason why countries hesitate to establish them. Expenses differ from country to coun-try, depending on living costs, population size, crime rates and other factors, and must beweighed against the return: dismantling of organized criminal networks, shorter investi-gations, more efficient prosecutions, integrity of the criminal justice system. Even inabsolute figures, witness protection is usually a small percentage of the total police budgetin countries where such programmes exist. Basic costing includes: (a) One-time expenses to set up the programme (equipment for the unit, premises); (b) Relocation costs; (c) Staff salaries and overtime; (d) Travel; (e) Allowances for witnesses; (f) Psychological assessments and counselling.The majority of the expenses are accounted for by staff salaries, overtime and travel. Relocation expenses can be considerable but vary depending on the benefits that wit-nesses are entitled to in each particular programme. In New Zealand, for example, wit-nesses as a rule go onto social security and the programme only occasionally tops up theirentitlements. Adequate and regular funding should be appropriated by government budgets to ensure the programme's sustainability and the availability of resources for the duration of protec-tion. Budget forecasting should make allowances on a number of variable and interrelatedfactors, such as: 50Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 50(a) Existence of alternative police arrangements for emergency and temporary security provisions; (b) Success of procedural protection measures in reducing the number of witnesses that need to enter protection programmes; (c) Strictness of criteria for admission to witness protection programmes; (d) Sociocultural environment, which determines the number of family members who need to accompany the witness in the programme; (e) Average number and duration of stay of witnesses and family members in the pro- gramme; (f) Efficiency of the criminal justice system;(g) Witness's living standards based on average standards in relocation communities or, if imprisoned, any special added prison costs; (h) Reach of organized criminal networks in the country; (i) Inflation, which has a direct impact on operational costs.The complexity of the operations involved in each case depends largely on whether wit- nesses need to be relocated alone or together with persons close to them. The concept ofsustainability must be recognized. Funds need to be adequate to sustain the new identityand location of witnesses into the future. As protection is a lifelong commitment, expensesare cumulative and increase the overall budget each year. Even after the end of the initialresource-intensive period of relocation under the programme, some ongoing support isoften provided in the form of occasional threat assessments and an emergency responsemechanism to counter any unexpected resurgence of the threat. In some cases, government budgets make fixed yearly allocations to protection pro- grammes. An unexpected increase in the number of witnesses entering a programme canbe addressed by special funds earmarked for use in urgent cases. Governments could also enact statutory provisions allowing the programme to be funded through the use of proceeds from property seized or confiscated for having been acquiredthrough activity involving drug trafficking or organized crime. Such provisions could alsoallow the use of proceeds from illegally acquired assets that witnesses entering the pro-gramme are obliged to hand over to the protection unit. However, funding witness protec-tion solely through sources that could vary substantially from year to year depending on thesuccess of seizure operations could compromise the effectiveness of protection services. At the regional level, the establishment of joint funds to help finance witness protection programmes and promote cross-border cooperation could be considered. For security reasons, programmes do not publish details regarding budget allocations, oper- ational costs and benefits. Only general information is available. The budgetary proceduresand the financial cost of witness protection are different in the various parts of the world: 51Setting up a witness protection programme 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 51Country Procedures and cost Australia The Australian Federal Police submits budget bids to the Government each year. Some of the funds are tied and can only be used for definedactivities. The budget is divided among broad functions. For witnessprotection, staff salary costs per financial year are about 4.5 per cent ofthe \"Protection\" staffing budget and operating costs are about 9 percent of the \"Protection\" operating budget. The programme has about20-30 active cases per year. In accordance with the Australian FederalPolice report for the period 2005-2006 on witness protection to theParliament, the programme's annual cost was 1 million Australian dol-lars (approximately 775,000 United States dollars). a Canada In the period 2005-2006, the Witness Protection Program of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police dealt with 53 new cases involving 66 persons.The total cost of the Program for the same period was 1,933,000Canadian dollars (approximately US$ 1,823,000), not including wages,expenses and administrative costs. b Italy In 2004, the budget was close to 65 million euros (approximately US$ 84 million) for 4,000 witnesses and family members. Philippines The yearly budget of the programme is 30 million Philippine pesos (approximately US$ 614,000). Extra money may be available fromemergency funds. Funds are channelled from the Budget Departmentto the Justice Department. From there, the portion for the witness pro-tection authority is drawn. The programme has under its protectivecustody some 500 witnesses nationwide. The duration of custody isusually two years but may extend to 6-8 years for cases going to thehigh court. South Africa The programme is registered as a subprogramme in the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and was allocated a fixedannual budget of 55 million rand (approximately US$ 7.5 million) forthe period 2006-2007 by the National Treasury. About 80 per cent ofthe programme's budget goes to operational expenses. On average,there are 250 witnesses and 300 related persons in the programme. Inthe period 2001-2002, witnesses were under the programme for aboutfive years. In 2006, the cycle was reduced to 2.5 years through the fast-tracking of witness protection cases in the criminal justice system. cGood Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime aAustralia, Australian Federal Police, Witness Protection: Annual Report 2005-06 (Canberra, Team Leader Publications, 2006), p. 9. bCanada, Public Safety Canada, \"Witness Protection Program Act: annual report 2005-6\", available at www.publicsafety.gc.ca/abt/dpr/le/wppa2005-6-en.asp. cSouth Africa, National Prosecuting Authority, Witness Protection Programme Unit: Annual Report 2004-2005 (Pretoria, 2006). 5207-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 52Country Procedures and cost Thailand Around 100 persons are reportedly admitted to the programme every year. That figure includes people protected in safe houses and by thepolice. The yearly budget for the programme is close to US$ 500,000,divided into three areas: (a) General protection measures, such as police protection, safe houses and removal of the witness's personal data from the court records; (b) Special measures to be applied in serious crimes, including change of name and place of residence, financial support and physical security; (c) Compensation for the families of witnesses who are killed. United States Between 1970, when it was created, and 2005, the WITSEC Program handled more than 7,500 witnesses and 9,600 family members or asso-ciates. In the fiscal year 2003, the United States marshals devoted US$59.7 million to the Program. d United Kingdom Overall budget details are not available for the United Kingdom. However, in the period 2006-2007, the budget for the witness protec-tion programme of the Merseyside police force, which covers theLiverpool area (population: 1.5 million), was 550,000 British pounds(approximately US$ 1,080,000). The budget for the witness protection programme of the International Criminal Court accounts for less than 2 per cent of the entire budget of the Court. G. Principles of operation 1. Confidentiality Organizational autonomy is a fundamental principle for the successful implementation of a witness protection programme. The protection unit should be separate from investiga-tion agencies and the prosecuting authority and it should enjoy operational \"isolation\"from police services. Only in exceptional circumstances - and at the initiative of the unit -should information be shared with other police units. That may happen, for example, in acase where the police are requested to provide logistical support in operations of the unitor to contribute to the assessment of the seriousness of the threat against a witness's life.Setting up a witness protection programme dUnited States of America, Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Audit Division, United States Marshals Service: Administration of the Witness Protection Security Program: Executive Summary (March 2005), p. 1. 5307-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 53All proceedings involving the admission of witnesses to the programme and actions taken should be kept strictly confidential. No document given or submitted in support thereofshould be released except upon order of the protection authority or, in exceptional circum-stances, of the competent court. Administrative procedures within the programme oftenmake it difficult to meet acceptable standards of oversight of expenditure while at thesame time protecting confidentiality so as not to compromise any of its operations. Theunit should have a stand-alone database for its operations in order to provide the highestlevels of security and confidentiality. An important aspect of such a system is the ability totrack and identify any unauthorized attempt to extract information from the system. Regardless of the quality of the data protection system put in place, the greatest risk of compromise comes from the human element within the process. It is imperative that allstaff, both handlers and administrators, be vetted to ensure the highest possible level ofsecurity. Only by setting the highest professional standards can those responsible for theprogramme meet its demanding requirements. To ensure confidentiality, the disclosing of sensitive information relating to the standard operating procedures, programme staff or the whereabouts or new identity of witnesses isoften criminalized. 2. Partnerships Even though confidentiality and operational autonomy are the guiding principles, success-ful witness protection programmes are based on building partnerships with governmentagencies and the private sector to provide witnesses with the wide range of servicesrequired (new identification documents, housing, financial support, medical care, educa-tion for children etc.). 54Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime Under section 17, paragraph 1, of the Witness Protection Ordinance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, disclosing without lawful authority or reason-able excuse the identity or location of a person who is or has been a participant orwho has been considered for inclusion in the witness protection programme is a seri-ous offence. The maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment. In a recent court caseof the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC), a solicitor, a barrister, abusinessman and the latter's girlfriend were charged with conspiracy to pervert thecourse of public justice and attempting to disclose the identity of an ICAC-protectedwitness. It was a well-organized plot aiming to threaten or dissuade the protected wit-ness from cooperating with ICAC during the course of the investigation. On 12 June2006, the solicitor, the businessman and the girlfriend were found guilty of conspiracyto pervert the course of public justice. The businessman's girlfriend was further con-victed of attempted perjury. The barrister was found guilty on two counts of attempt-ing to disclose the identity of the protected witness (http://legalref.judiciary.gov.hk).07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 54Protection programmes need to establish a close working relationship with agencies deal- ing with: (a) Personal identification (passport agency, driver's licence); (b) Public housing; (c) Social security; (d) Prisons (in the case of incarcerated witnesses);(e) Rehabilitation of formerly convicted offenders; (f) Education;(g) Health, dental and psychological care;(h) Banks and other financial institutions. Coordination requires the establishment of secure channels of communication between the witness protection unit and all those agencies. The identification of contacts after strictvetting, in each of the bodies and organizations outlined above to act as liaison officerswith the unit greatly assists with the smooth running of the programme and enhances thelevel of security. In the initial stages of programme implementation, it is essential that sen-ior staff in the unit meet with appointed liaison officers in other government departmentsand private institutions to draw up protocols under which they will cooperate in the run-ning of the programme. The protocols should detail provisions on security of informationand secrecy and restrict access to documentation on identity changes to persons withsecurity clearance and a legitimate need to know. It is at that point that training needs forsupport and ancillary staff should be identified. 3. Neutrality If potential witnesses meet the criteria previously noted, then admission to a protectionprogramme should be available to them irrespective of whether they testify in a caseinvolving organized crime or other crime or whether they are victim-witnesses, inno-cent bystanders to crimes or justice collaborators. In practice though, members of thelatter group are the most common participants in witness protection programmes.Their cooperation is often linked to the expectation of leniency in sentencing (to avoid along term of imprisonment), the need for protection from enemies already trying to killthem or even the desire to retaliate against former associates by testifying against them.It is not surprising therefore that admission to a programme may sometimes be por-trayed as an easy \"way out\" for criminals or as a way for them to avoid prosecution byimplicating others. Witness protection programmes, especially when they are part of the police, go to great lengths to ensure that admittance to the programme is not seen as a reward for coopera-tion and that there is a clear separation between protection services and investigativeagencies. In Australia and the United Kingdom, the memorandum of understanding 55Setting up a witness protection programme 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 55signed with participants includes a provision on the dissociation of protection from inves- tigation. In New Zealand, interviews of witnesses considered for the programme arerecorded on videotape as evidence that such aspects have been discussed. Given that financial support during participation in the programme may be construed as compensation for cooperation, most countries support participants financially only for alimited period of time (1-2 years), offering them at the same time assistance to find newjobs. After that period has elapsed, witnesses are usually entered into the broader socialsecurity system. The instability associated with conflict and post-conflict situations may give rise to the need to extend protection services to defence witnesses. To safeguard their neutrality, witness protection programmes endeavour: (a) To admit people according to a set of predetermined criteria among which the level of threat is a key determinant; (b) To maintain separation from investigation agencies; (c) To make objective decisions independently from the prosecution after obtaining and evaluating the prosecution's input about the importance of the case and the evi-dence offered by the witness; 56Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In 2005, Saddam Hussein, the former President of Iraq, and seven of his aides were tried by the Iraqi High Tribunal. They were charged with crimes against humanity fol-lowing the killing of 148 people in the wake of a failed assassination attempt againstSaddam Hussein in the town of Dujail in 1982. The rules of the High Tribunal provid-ed for the creation of a victims and witnesses unit, but that was not established untilwell into the trial. The defence complained about the assassination of a defence wit-ness and regular intimidation attempts, raising serious concerns about the fairnessof the proceedings. The only means of providing effective protection was to initiallybase some witnesses outside Iraq and fly them to Baghdad only for testimony. Otherswere allowed to testify behind a curtain and their names were not revealed to thepublic. Furthermore, between the opening of the trial in October 2005 and July 2006,three defence attorneys were assassinated and a fourth one was forced to leave thecountry after he was wounded in an ambush. Replacement attorneys reached anarrangement with the Government whereby they would be allowed to carry personalfirearms and the Government would pay the salaries for three armed guards for eachdefence lawyer. In practice, the majority of attorneys chose to resettle with their fam-ilies, at their own expense, outside the country and travelled to Baghdad only forscheduled court hearings. (\"Judging Dujail: the first trial before the Iraqi HighTribunal\", Human Rights Watch , vol. 18, No. 8 (E) (November 2006), available at www.hrw.org/doc/?t=pubs).07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 56(d) During the assessment process, to make the witness clearly aware that admission is not a reward for cooperation and to provide an accurate picture of the nature andimplications of the programme; (e) To provide for the witnesses' welfare ensuring that benefits would be no greater than their legal earnings before admission to the programme. 4. Transparency and accountability Transparency is a basic principle of good governance and witness protection programmesshould similarly be held accountable for money dispensed. To perform that task and ver-ify the need and procedures followed, auditors must have access to all information relatedto expenditure. However, simple things like a hotel receipt or aeroplane ticket may revealthe witness's true identity or location. To maintain confidentiality, witness protection pro-grammes are usually subject to special procedures for auditing and reporting. The following are some examples of how auditing is performed in different jurisdictions: Australia NWPP is audited twice a year by: (a) A team delegated by the Police Commissioner. Records are main- tained in such a way that details of the operations (locales, names and so on) are not revealed. For example, hotel receipts are provided in sealed envelopes and not reviewed by the auditor. The audit team also reviews procedures and methodology; (b) The Australian National Audit Office, as a Government requirement. The Office is not given access to the records and engages an official from the Australian Federal Police team to audit on its behalf. The Australian Federal Police is required to submit an annual report to the Parliament on NWPP performance and operations. The reports areprepared in such a way as to provide as much detail as possible withoutprejudicing the effectiveness of the programme. China At the Hong Kong Police Witness Protection Unit, receipts are cross- referenced to secret file numbers, while the audit is internally vetted tomaintain confidentiality. At the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC), expendi- ture of the witness protection programme is not open to outside checks.The Director of Investigation of the Private Sector is authorized to per-form audits. New Zealand Two special police auditors are authorized to check accounts. Auditors need security clearance. Receipts are sanitized and operational namesare given with no reference to the clients' original or new names. 57Setting up a witness protection programme Hong Kong SpecialAdministrativeRegion 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 57Philippines A special disbursing officer is appointed.

Application The initiative to include an individual in a protection programme could originate from a number of sources, including: (a) The witness. In South Africa, witnesses may apply for protection to the investigating officer, prosecutor or other public functionary concerned, police chief, prison direc-tor (if the witness is incarcerated) or any officer of the witness protection unit. Thereceiving authority is obligated to forward the request to the relevant branch officeof the witness protection unit with a recommendation on whether to admit the wit-ness to the programme or not. The director of the programme makes the final deci-sion on admission; (b) The police. In countries such as the United Kingdom, where witness protection has developed informally as a police function, applications can be made by investigatorsdirectly to the protection authority, which then determines whether to admit thewitness to the programme; (c) The prosecutor. In Italy, the request for protection must be made by either the pub- lic prosecutor or the anti-Mafia prosecutor in charge of prosecuting the offences insupport of which the protected witness will testify. In cases where more than oneoffice is conducting related enquiries, the proposal can be made by any of the officesby mutual agreement. In organized crime cases, the proposal should be transmittedto the national anti-Mafia prosecutor. For terrorist offences, the proposal should bemade in agreement with the relevant public prosecutor; (d) The police or prosecutor or judge. In Slovakia, the law distinguishes between the investigation phase and the trial. During the investigation, a written proposal for including a person in the witness protection programme and implementingurgent measures may be elaborated and submitted to the unit by the criminalinvestigator or the prosecutor. Once the trial begins, the presiding judge may alsotake the initiative. In some countries, an additional procedural stage is introduced between the applicant and the witness protection authority responsible for admissions to the programme,apparently to streamline the procedure and ensure that the application criteria areapplied uniformly. For example, in the Netherlands, an application for protection may besubmitted to the national public prosecutor by the prosecutor who is investigating the 59VI. Entering witness protection07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 59case. The latter then forwards the request to the decision-making authority, together with a recommendation on whether or not the request should be accepted. That processensures that sponsorship from non-prosecution sources includes a knowledgeable analy-sis of the potential value to the prosecutor of the admissible evidence elicited from theproposed programme candidate. B. Decision-making authority The power to admit witnesses to or remove them from a witness protection programme isusually vested in an authority outside the witness protection unit. That authority, alsoknown as the witness protection authority, is mandated to oversee the implementation ofthe programme, decide on budget allocations and provide policy guidance. The witness protection authority may be:(a) A single official , such as the Minister or Secretary of Justice, the Attorney General, the public prosecutor or the police commissioner; (b) A multidisciplinary body consisting of representatives from the relevant ministries, the prosecutor's office, the courts or the police force. Decisions can be based oneither a unanimous or majority vote. However, there are variations to the general rules mentioned above: (a) In Austria and South Africa, only the head of the witness protection unit can make decisions regarding admission to or removal from the witness protection programme; (b) In Germany, at the federal and state levels, the decision to admit witnesses to or remove them from the programme is made jointly by the witness protection unit andthe public prosecutor. Careful consideration should be given to how the witness protection authority exercises its discretionary powers and which measures it can apply. In most cases, decisions are notsubject to any kind of external review because, for security and confidentiality reasons, noother authority has access to the information available to the witness protection authority.However, in some instances, the decisions made by the witness protection authority aresubject to internal or judicial review. 60Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In Slovakia, Witness Protection Act No. 256/1989 allows the witness protection author- ity to reconsider its own decisions regarding admission to or rejection from the wit-ness protection programme. The process is seen as a compromise between a totalabsence of legal remedies and a formal appeal and may be initiated at the requestof the criminal investigator, prosecutor or judge.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 60C. Criteria for admission Before admitting a witness to a protection programme, an assessment needs to be conducted to provide the witness protection authority with all the information it requires to make avalid and informed decision. Some of the most important elements of that assessment are: (a) The level of threat to the person's life; (b) The witness's personality and psychological fitness. Witnesses must be able to adjust to and follow a stressful programme that isolates them from the places andpersons they know; (c) The danger that the witness, typically a former collaborator of the defendant, may pose to the public if relocated under a new identity; (d) The critical value of the witness's trial testimony for the prosecution and the impos- sibility of gaining such knowledge elsewhere; (e) The importance of the case in dismantling criminal organizations. Such an assessment may also consider other aspects, such as the witness's family situa-tion (marital status, number of children or other protected family members, criminalrecord of spouse). The assessment process is an unsettling period for the applicant. If necessary, interim pro- tection may be offered until a final decision is reached. 1. The threat Witnesses must be under serious threat to be admitted to a witness protection pro-gramme. It is less important what type of witness they are (whether victim, justice collab-orator etc.) or what type of crime they have observed. In general, the threat must beagainst the witness's life; it does not extend to his or her well-being or property. A threat assessment can be defined as the investigative and operational techniques used by law enforcement authorities to identify, assess and manage the risk and potential perpetrators of targeted violence against a witness. In the majority of programmes, the 61Entering witness protection In the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, the Witness Protection Ordinance of 2000 providing for the creation of the witness protection programme stipu-lates that the approving authority should provide witnesses with protection and otherassistance when, due to their status as witnesses, their personal safety or well-being isat risk. That provision differs from provisions of witness protection legislation in othercountries in that it allows a witness to be included in the programme on the basis of theexistence of a serious threat against his or her well-being, not only against his or her life.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 61threat assessment is performed by the witness protection unit alone or in cooperation with the regular police. In some programmes, such as those of Austria and the United States,the assessment is performed by regular police officers or an investigative agency in orderto maintain separation from the protection unit, especially when the unit lacks relevantinformation. In the case of international relocation, the witness protection units of thecountries involved would, as a rule, have to cooperate in evaluating the threat. A distinction between \"threat\" and \"risk\" should be made. A threat assessment looks at whether the life of the witness is in serious danger, and should address issues such as: (a) The origin of the threat (group or person); (b) The patterns of violence;(c) The level of organization and culture of the threatening group (for example, street gang, Mafia-type group, terrorist cell); (d) The group's capacity, knowledge and available means to carry out threats.A risk assessment examines the chances of the threat materializing and assesses how it can be mitigated. The assessment is conducted according to set standards and using a matrix.Action is taken to reduce the probability of the threat being carried out, for example byusing unmarked cars to transport witnesses, resettling witnesses temporarily or providingthem with new identities. The assessment is conducted by the witness protection unit andis a key factor in providing tailor-made protection to suit the needs of the witnesses. In the case of emergency measures taken before the start of a formal protection pro- gramme or during the course of the programme, threat assessments are often undertakenfor particular operations, such as transportation to court and family reunions, and providethe basis for allocating resources and identifying appropriate protection arrangements. Throughout the programme and even after its termination, it may be necessary to carry out periodic threat evaluations in order to decide whether to continue, upgrade, discon-tinue or reinstate protection measures. 2. Suitability of a witness Profiling a witness assists the protection authority in making an informed decision aboutthe measures to be taken, the methods to be implemented and the contingency plans to beintroduced should the programme be compromised. The assessment is a managementtool that provides authorities with information on the kind of protection and support serv-ices that witnesses require and how they are to be managed. It is often stated that ideal witnesses do not exist, just witnesses who need to be managed differently. Reportedly, the most demanding group is composed of teenage members ofstreet gangs, especially females, who are attracted to the gang subculture, have a \"live fastand die young\" attitude, do not follow rules and possess no life skills. 62Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 62In deciding whether to admit someone to a witness protection programme, the competent authority must balance the threat to the life of the witness against: (a) The character of the witness and his or her ability to maintain secrecy. Almost invariably, the failure of an operation is due to the intentional or unintentional dis-closure of information by the protected person. If the disclosure is significant, thewitness's identity and place of residence needs to be changed a second time, puttingthe programme under severe strain. It is generally accepted that certain categoriesof witness cannot qualify for any protection programme because they are careless orirresponsible; (b) The likelihood of relapse into criminal activity and the associated risk to persons in the witness's new and unsuspecting social environment. Most protected witnesses are career criminals. Some try to hide behind their new identities to perpetrate newcrimes. Witness protection programmes go to great lengths to ensure that relocatedwitnesses do not go on to victimize others with impunity; (c) The witness's willingness to abide by the strict limitations imposed by the pro- gramme on his or her personal life. Entering a witness protection programme 63Entering witness protection Brenda Paz was born in Honduras and grew up in Los Angeles, United States. At the age of 12 she dropped out of school and became a member of the Mara Salvatruchastreet gang, better known as MS-13, which is one of the most violent street gangs inthe United States. For the next five years, she moved with MS-13 members from stateto state. Then, in 2002, she was arrested for stealing a car. In exchange for leniency,Brenda gave prosecutors first-hand information about MS-13 armed robberies, stab-bings and shootings stretching from California to Texas to North Carolina. She gavevaluable information on the gang's history, structure and operations. That knowledgemade her the key witness in a federal murder trial in which the defendant was herboyfriend and an MS-13 leader in northern Virginia. To keep her safe from retributionfrom the gang, Brenda was admitted to the WITSEC Program. She was relocated toanother state and furnished with a new name and social security number. She waswarned to be inconspicuous and to avoid any contact with gang members, but the stric-tures and isolation became too much for Brenda. She made contact with her formergang and its members convinced her to come back, assuring her that she was forgiv-en. She left the WITSEC Program and rejoined the gang. Within days she was dead.Her body was found in a river with a rope around her neck, 16 stab wounds to thechest and arms and three deep cuts across the neck.

Kash, \"Hiding in plain sight: a peek into the Witness Protection Program\",FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin , vol. 73, No. 5 (May 2004), pp. 25-32).07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 63requires severe personal sacrifices. Participants are removed from their family and social environment and must break with friends and life as they know it. Evidencehas shown that during the application period, when witnesses are still in seriousdanger and the threat is fresh, they are willing to follow any measure that guaran-tees their safety. As time passes, however, some gain a sense of confidence andrefuse to resign themselves to imposed restrictions and, within a few years, mostdecide to leave the programme or are removed. 3. Value and relevance of the testimony The testimony given by the witness must be crucial to the prosecution. In that respect, it isvital that before an assessment takes place and before an individual is admitted to the pro-gramme, the witness provides as full and comprehensive a statement as possible. That isto ensure that the protection programme or the assessment process will not be called intoquestion in a court of law as inducement for witness cooperation. 4. Voluntary participation Entering a protection programme requires the informed consent of the witness. Witnessprotection authorities should clearly and realistically explain to witnesses the measuresto be taken and the limitations to their personal life that participants in the programmeneed to accept. Voluntary participation in the programme on the basis of complete andinformed consent is ensured by the signing of a memorandum of understandingbetween the witness and the protection unit. Participation entails the obligation toactively support all protection measures undertaken and to abstain from compromisingthe security of the programme by, for example, discussing related matters with thirdpersons or the media. D. Memorandum of understanding Upon admission to the programme, witnesses are required to conclude with the witnessprotection unit a memorandum of understanding, which, in most cases, is understood to 64Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime The protection of witnesses in South Africa used to be governed by section 185A of the 1977 Criminal Procedure Act (Act 51/1977). The section provided that witnessescould, for protection purposes, be held in custody involuntarily. That repressive andrestrictive measure was used to coerce witnesses to give evidence and became a toolof the apartheid regime in political trials. In 2000, a new law on witness protectionrepealed section 185A by providing that witnesses must voluntarily agree to enter awitness protection programme and may not be held, not even as a protection meas-ure, in a prison or police cell.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 64be a document that defines the actions of the witness protection authority on the one hand and of the witness on the other, in detail and in advance. It is not considered anagreement or contract and cannot be challenged before a court of law. However, thememorandum of understanding is, in some countries, legally binding and its method ofimplementation, or the lack thereof, by the protection unit can be subject to judicialreview (for example, in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and inSouth Africa). Whether a memorandum of understanding is to be considered a contractor not also depends on whether witness protection units are liable for damages or harmcaused to protected witnesses because of weak or ineffective measures. In the UnitedStates, the statutory authority establishing the protection programme relieves all stafffrom any liability for acts taken or harm caused when those acts are taken in connectionwith the programme. Regardless of whether the memorandum of understanding is legally binding or not, pro- tection units still need to establish procedures for handling complaints by witnessesregarding the implementation of the memorandum of understanding, especially the typeof measure applied and the abuse or misuse of power by the witness protection unit. Anykind of investigation into such complaints or allegations should be conducted outside thepublic domain in order to ensure both that the individual or systemic problem can be corrected and that sensitive information about the witness is not divulged. A memorandum of understanding usually includes: (a) A declaration by the witness that his or her admission to the protection programme is entirely voluntary and that any assistance must not be construed as a reward for testifying; (b) The scope and character of the protection and assistance to be provided;(c) A list of measures that could be taken by the protection unit to ensure the physical security of the witness; (d) The obligations of the witness under the programme and possible sanctions for vio- lations, including removal from the programme; (e) The conditions governing the programme's termination. Both the witness and the persons accompanying the witness in the programme are required to conclude a memorandum of understanding with the protection unit. For secu-rity reasons, they are not usually provided with copies of the signed document, which is kept safe by the protection unit so that it cannot be found by someone searching for the witness. In urgent cases, warranted by the level and immediacy of threat, witnesses may be placed provisionally under protection before a memorandum of understanding is signed andwhile their admission to the programme is still under consideration. The length of thisperiod ranges from several days (10 days in Latvia) to much longer periods (three monthsin Slovakia, and as long as it takes for the witness protection authority to gather sufficient 65Entering witness protection07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 65information to reach a decision on the matter in Italy). Such temporary urgent measures can often be expensive and require coordination with special police units. They usuallyconsist of: (a) Regular surveillance; (b) Close protection;(c) Temporary resettlement to a secure area in another part of the country;(d) Protective incarceration;(e) Transfer to a special unit within the same prison, if the witness is serving a prison sentence; (f) Financial support.Provisional protection does not necessarily lead to inclusion in a witness protection pro- gramme. If the witness is not regarded as essential to the prosecution or if the level ofthreat is not significant enough to warrant relocation and a change of identity, witnesseswill not be offered the possibility of participating in such a programme. Final acceptanceto the programme is conditional upon signature of a memorandum of understanding. 66Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 66Admission to a witness protection programme results in a new start in life and creates a protector-protectee relationship between the protection authority and the witness basedon a series of agreed actions that may vary from country to country, but that, at a mini-mum, include: (a) For the protection authority: (i) Making arrangements to protect the lives of the witness;(ii) Relocating participants and issuing new personal documentation;(iii) Providing financial support for a finite period of time;(iv) Providing initial assistance with job training and finding new employment; (v) Providing counselling and other social services, including appropriate educa- tion (for example, in cases involving international relocation or children); (vi) Extending protection and benefits to persons accompanying the witness in the programme; (b) For the witness: (i) The obligation not to compromise, directly or indirectly, any protection or assistance provided; (ii) Complying with the protection authority's instructions regarding the assis- tance provided; (iii) The obligation not to commit any crimes; (iv) Fully disclosing information on his or her past criminal history and on all financial and other legal obligations; (v) The obligation to provide true testimony; (vi) Complying with restrictions on disclosure of information related to the inves- tigation of the crimes concerned. There are examples of witness protection authorities assuming additional obligations. For example, in the Republic of Korea, authorities compensate the witness for any financialloss sustained as a result of participating in the programme. 67VII. Responsibilities of the parties07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 67A. The protection authority 1. Protecting the life of the witness Witness protection programmes focus on ensuring the physical security of witnesses. They revolve around keeping witnesses safe by giving them new names and keeping them inundisclosed and secure locations. As a general rule, persons in the programme who mayknow each other should not be kept close to each other. When necessary (for example, incases that take place in a small geographical area or when the witness is publicly known),providing protection may mean repeatedly moving the witness and his or her close familymembers to different locations (such as hotels, state institutions, public housing units,houses or apartments) to ensure their safety. The particular programme of each witness commences when the memorandum of understanding is signed. The threat level determines which protection measures will beapplied. Inasmuch as a protection programme is only employed as a measure of lastresort, it normally includes relocation and the provision of a new identity. Steps to resettle the witness should be taken as soon as possible. In fact, the question of resettle-ment should be discussed with the witness even before he or she is admitted to the programme. The memorandum of understanding establishes and informs programme participants about the good security practices they must abide by for the duration of the protectionprogramme. Those practices include having no contact, other than through the protec-tion unit's secure procedures, with individuals from their original area and not travellingoutside the area of relocation without the knowledge and approval of the unit. A partici-pant in a witness protection programme usually goes through an initiation and inductioncourse that includes familiarization with the details of his or her new identity and train-ing in basic self-defence techniques or the use of firearms. For the duration of the pro-gramme, any contact with the witness, whether initiated by law enforcement,prosecutorial or judicial authorities, must be arranged through the protection unit.Contact with family members not included in the programme or with former friends isdiscouraged, although the unit may occasionally facilitate reunions or secure telephoneor video communication. In that respect, witnesses can initiate but cannot receive tele-phone calls and can stay in written contact with certain members of their past throughsecure mail, forwarding channels. When witnesses are called to testify, they occasionally must return to the area of primary danger. That is the time when they are most at risk and a special security plan needs to bedeveloped with the cooperation of the police. Measures are taken to ensure the witness'ssafe transportation to and from the court and his or her safety during testimony. Investigators and prosecutors may sometimes request to debrief or question a protected witness regarding his or her knowledge of facts other than those related to the primarycase. They may also seek knowledge or clarification of the structure and methods of 68Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 68operation of criminal networks known to the witness. In such cases, a meeting with investigators and prosecutors is organized at a neutral place outside the area to whichthe witness has been relocated. Special security measures are again taken by the protec-tion unit. If necessary, witnesses should be moved more than once. In exceptional circumstances, they may be relocated to another country. 2. Financial support Admission to a witness protection programme often puts a strain on the witness's finan-cial situation. Participants are uprooted from their working and living environment andresettled in a new place where, for security reasons, they cannot practice their originalprofessions and must be directed towards a new job. This is particularly true for witnessesexercising licensed professions in fields such as medicine, law and accounting, for whomopening a practice where they have been relocated may provide a lead to their where-abouts. At least initially, witnesses need financial support while in the programme to helpthem adapt to their new circumstances. Financial support may be temporary or last forthe duration of the programme. Witnesses should also be provided with assistance in find-ing a new job. The ability of a participant to quickly become financially independentthrough the provision of education, professional training, skills development and workexperience is an important factor in alleviating programme stress and helping witnessesto follow programme rules and remain in good standing. Depending on the circumstances,assistance in the form of a low-interest or interest-free loan to start a new business mayalso be provided. Understandably, witness protection authorities are reluctant to release information about the amount of money that witnesses receive. The level of financial assistance isusually at the relevant authority's discretion and should, in principle, aim at ensuring anadequate income that is no greater than the witness's legal earnings before entering theprogramme. Each case should be considered on its own merits, based on the principles ofreasonableness and necessity. The authority has a duty to the public to ensure that gov-ernment funds are spent prudently. Taxation regimes governing benefits differ: in somecountries, allowances are exempt from taxation while in others they are taxed. The harshest criticism made of witness protection programmes is that subsistence pay- ments to protected witnesses can be construed as a reward for assisting the investigationand giving evidence. To address that issue, programmes operate on the principle that themain aim of granting admission to a witness protection programme is to save a witness'slife, not to substantially enhance his or her living standard. Furthermore, the financialbenefits granted by a witness protection programme are not meant to maintain a crimi-nal's standard of living if his or her lifestyle was financed by illegal activities. In Australia,legislation requires that all benefits given to the witness, including financial assistance,must be revealed to the defence. In New Zealand, the benefits granted by the witness pro-tection authority rarely exceed a witness's social security benefits. 69Responsibilities of the parties07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 69In countries with developed economies, subsistence payments are often unattractive. In some circumstances, inclusion in the national welfare system works as an incentive for wit-nesses to become financially independent as soon as possible. But in developing economies,social security benefits (a regular salary, medical care, education etc.) may be attractive. 3. Persons close to the witness Witnesses cannot be separated from their family members forever. In the early years ofwitness protection, little attention was given to the maintenance of relations between wit-nesses and the persons close to them. As a result, participants would often walk out of theprogramme or compromise security by trying to contact relatives or partners. Witness protection programmes have adapted to meet that need by extending protection to the witness's family members, cohabitants and other persons close to him or her. Thenumber of persons that may accompany a witness in the programme depends, in part, onfactors such as family traditions and social culture. Witnesses with strong social and fam-ily links pose a range of additional difficulties that must be considered during the assess-ment process. Ultimately, other measures may have to be taken to ensure protection.Alternatively, the decision may be taken to exclude that person as a witness. One keygroup that must be considered when relocating persons close to the witness is young chil-dren, who may compromise the programme by revealing confidential details to outsiders. The memorandum of understanding signed by the witness and the witness protection authority usually sets out clearly that the protection programme prohibits all direct con-tact between the witness and relatives and friends who are not included in the pro-gramme. All communication with those persons must pass through the protection unit.The almost total break in family and social bonds often creates serious psychological prob-lems for witnesses. One way of maintaining those links, for example between a protectedchild and a biological parent who did not enter the programme as a result of divorce, is toorganize reunions in a place away from the area where the witness has resettled, or toarrange for shielded electronic communication. When the witness has relocated to a dif-ferent country, reunions must, for security reasons, take place in a third country andrequire the cooperation of law enforcement authorities in that country. Creating directcommunication networks among specialized witness protection units can prove useful infacilitating such operations. 70Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In 2005, in country A, where family ties tend to be strong, for every witness admit- ted to the protection programme, an average of more than three family members hadto be included as well (3.2 family members per witness). In country B, slightly overone family member per witness (1.2) was admitted to the programme, and in countryC the average was 1.1 family members per witness. In both countries B and C, socialties are weaker than in country A.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 70Most witness protection units prefer telephone or video communication to family reunions. The latter option is labour- and money-intensive, as secure environments mustbe created and sustained for periods ranging from a few hours to several days. 4. Liability There are different experiences regarding protection unit liability in cases of failed oper-ations or weak protection measures. Despite the best of efforts, programme security isoccasionally compromised by inadvertent disclosures or by accident, as, for example,when a witness bumps into a former colleague in his or her new workplace.Theoretically, it is possible for the next of kin of someone under protection to take legalaction for harm caused (death, serious injury, incapacitation etc.) as a result of carelesslyapplied measures. In some jurisdictions, such as Australia 17and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China,18legislation provides that the approving authority, officers and all other people involved in the witness protection programme are not liable to any action,suit or proceedings (including criminal proceedings) when the act or omission occurredin good faith in the exercise or purported exercise of powers conferred on them by thelaw. In the Philippines 19and Thailand,20however, the law provides that in failed opera- tions that have resulted in harm, incapacity or death, the witness's family is entitled tocompensation. B. The witness 1. Cooperation Upon entering the programme, the witness is required to cooperate fully with law enforce- ment and judicial authorities and to strictly observe all rules imposed by the protectionauthority. Cooperation can be in the form of positive obligations, such as compliance withinstructions, full disclosure of personal history and true testimony, or abstention from cer-tain actions, such as acknowledging participation in the programme, disclosing informa-tion on how the programme operates or making unauthorized contact with people fromthe witness's past. The memorandum of understanding usually provides that witnessesmay be expelled from the programme if they fail to comply with any of the obligations con-tained in the memorandum of understanding. In practice, since participants know impor-tant details and may become a threat to the integrity of the programme even after it hasterminated, expulsion is exercised judiciously as a last resort in response to serious secu-rity breaches or continuous refusal to cooperate. Responsibilities of the parties 17Australia, Witness Protection Act 1994 (Act No. 124 of 1994 as amended), sect. 21. 18Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Witness Protection Ordinance (2000), chap. 564, sect. 16. 19Philippines, Witness Protection, Security and Benefit Act No. 6891 (1991), sect. 8 (g). 20Thailand, Witness Protection Act B.E. 2546 (2003), sects. 15 and 16. 7107-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 712. Conduct The large majority of witnesses in a protection programme have criminal records and have been involved extensively in some form of criminal activity. Their value to lawenforcement in combating criminal networks is usually proportional to how deeply theyhave been immersed in crime. Thus, it is not surprising that some witnesses return tocommitting crime. Witness protection programmes have also been criticized for providinga clean bill of health to offenders with extensive criminal records, who can use their newidentities to escape debtor obligations, child custody and visitation arrangements or evento return to committing crime. In response to such criticism, programmes have tried to be proactive in monitoring participants by, for example, conducting periodical checks of their environment and theiractivities. Furthermore, authorities threaten those who commit offences while under pro-tection with removal from the programme without further notification. That is usuallystated clearly in the memorandum of understanding to avoid giving false expectations ofimmunity from prosecution for future offences. 3. True testimony Witnesses who participate in a protection programme do so to testify free of intimidationin a court of law. Thus, witnesses should continue to be protected regardless of the qualityof the evidence provided and of whether the testimony results in a conviction or not.However, if a witness changes his or her original testimony and turns hostile during trial,there should be no reason for him or her to continue to be in the programme since thethreat against his or her life no longer exists. In such cases, the witness may be prosecutedfor perjury. 4. Discharge of debts and other legal obligations Admission to a witness protection programme may seriously affect the rights of third par-ties who are left behind by the relocated witness and have little recourse for collectingtheir debts or securing the fulfilment of the witness's civil, administrative or other out-standing legal obligations (payment of alimony, visitation rights for the children ofdivorced parents etc.). To address that problem, witnesses are usually required, to the 72Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In the United States, the Witness Security Reform Act of 1984 led to the creation of the Victim Compensation Fund for making restitution to victims or their families forcrimes that caused or threatened death or serious bodily injury and were committedby programme participants. In general, the Fund will, up to a statutory limit of US$ 50,000 per case, cover expenses for medical and funeral costs and lost wagesthat are not reimbursable from any other source.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 72fullest extent possible, to fulfil their legal obligations to third parties prior to entering the programme. That may mean selling their goods and effects with the assistance of the pro-gramme authorities. Recurring financial obligations, such as alimony or other monthlypayments, can continue to be fulfilled following admission to the programme through anintermediary, usually the protection unit. Special provisions are made to protect creditors and others holding civil judgements against the witness in case of refusal to comply or insufficient cooperation. Those provi-sions may include the right of the witness protection authority: (a) To reveal to creditors seeking to enforce judgements the details of any real or per- sonal property owned by the witness (as in Australia); (b) To assist the witness in disposing of his or her property, or dispose of the property on the witness's behalf (as in Austria); (c) To take measures to ensure that the ability to reach the witness for the purpose of legal transactions is not obstructed by the witness protection measures (as in Germany); (d) To receive court summons and notifications on behalf of the witness (as in South Africa); (e) In extreme cases, to disclose to the plaintiff the name and location of the witness (as in the United States). C. Termination of the programme There is no set period during which a witness needs to remain financially dependent on a protection programme. The duration depends on a number of variables, including thewitness's personality and the extent of the power exercised by the criminal syndicate. On average, witnesses are assisted financially for 1-2 years. Financial assistance may beterminated for any of the following reasons: (a) Security is compromised by the actions of the witness or his or her inability to hon- our obligations; (b) The witness violates the rules laid down in the memorandum of understanding;(c) The witness refuses to give evidence in court; (d) The seriousness of the threat against the witness's life has lessened. 73Responsibilities of the parties To maintain operational security, the Australian Federal Police may elect to provide witnesses with funds to enable them to settle their financial obligations. Those fundsare paid back by the witness over time from the regular subsistence allowancereceived or from money obtained through employment.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 73Irrespective of the time that witnesses formally remain under protection, the commitment to their security, with its central elements of due diligence and risk management, is life-long. Experience has shown that even after the end of formal protection programmes,some form of care must still be provided (contact numbers, periodical threat assessment,police protection etc.). That is because the threat against a protected witness's life neverfully disappears. Even after a conviction is secured, a person in custody may still be able toharm the witness. Witnesses may become vulnerable again and may need further assis-tance after the termination of the programme, as technology develops and makes the tech-niques and methodologies used obsolete. 1. Removal from the programme Severe violations of the conditions on which the witness entered the programme may leadto sanctions and ultimately to the early termination of the programme. Witnesses arewarned at the outset about how they should behave, and all relevant facts are carefullyconsidered. In the majority of cases, warnings have the desired effect, but if the advice isnot taken, consideration may be given to terminating the programme. In cases of interna-tional relocation, the agency in the receiving country may consider not only ending protec-tion but also returning the witness to the agency in the sending country. The decision toremove a witness from the programme does not usually have immediate effect, as author-ities allow the witness time to prepare for life outside the witness protection programme.An appeal or revision process against such a decision may also be instituted. The most serious violation that could lead to early termination of the programme is a relapse into criminal activity. Experience has shown that criminals turned justice collabo-rators find it difficult to change their lifestyle and to break the links with their criminalpast. Whether witnesses remain in the protection programme or not, cases of recidivismare prosecuted and the criminal background of perpetrators is revealed to the prosecutingauthority. Should witnesses remain in the programme, either because the crime was notserious or because they continue to be of great value to the prosecution, they should still bemade accountable but in secure ways. For example, a witness can be prosecuted under thenew name given to him or her by the protection unit and then relocated and renamed to ensure his or her safety. A new criminal record will then be created for his or her newpersonality that mirrors the convictions and criminal history acquired under both previ-ous identities. 74Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In the United Kingdom, the witness protection policy of the Association of Chief Police Officers recommends that decisions to terminate the witness protection programmebe communicated to the witness, in writing, with at least 21 days' advance notice. Thewitness then has the opportunity to prepare for life outside the programme or toappeal the decision. Notifications should indicate the method and procedure forappealing the decision. 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 742. Voluntary exit One of the most difficult situations to manage is when witnesses decide, against the advice of the protection unit and because they find the isolating hardships associated withremaining in the programme no longer essential to keep them safe, to voluntarily with-draw from or abandon the programme. Even in such cases, the need to provide aftercarehas been recognized and certain countries provide some form of protection in coordina-tion with the local police (for example, regular patrolling of the witness's residence, instal-lation of alarms and exchange of contact numbers). However, it not possible to provideeffective security to persons who are not willing to cooperate. In cases of voluntary withdrawal, witnesses may be asked to sign a termination paper or pro- tocol to officially end protection. As former participants are just as capable of compromisingthe programme as ongoing participants are, they are asked not to keep any documentationor other proof (copies of the memorandum of understanding, other agreements or records ofmeetings with members of the protection unit etc.) of their involvement in the programme. 75Responsibilities of the parties Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano was born in 1945 in New York City. Originally a soldier for the Brooklyn sector of the Gambino family, one of the five Mafia familiesthat controlled organized crime in the United States at that time, Gravano rose quick-ly through the ranks. He became associated with John Gotti, who, in 1985, murderedPaul Castellano, the head of the Gambino family, to become the new Gambino boss.Gravano's position in the family rose. In 1991, after he was arrested in a major oper-ation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Gravano turned state's evidence and tes-tified against Gotti in exchange for a reduced sentence. Gotti received a sentence oflife imprisonment. Gravano, who confessed to taking part in 19 murders, was convict-ed of a token racketeering charge and received a minimal sentence. Upon his releasein 1995, Gravano entered a witness protection programme and was relocated with hisfamily to Arizona. In February 2000, he was arrested and charged as the ringleaderof an Arizona-based organization trafficking in \"ecstasy\". Gravano pleaded guilty andis currently serving a 19-year sentence in Colorado at a maximum security prison. \"ZV\" was a member of a criminal gang. When arrested by the police, he turned state'sevidence and became a key witness for the prosecution in a major case involvingorganized crime. He was offered admission to a witness protection programme butdeclined, claiming that life in the programme was too restrictive. A few days afterleaving witness protection, ZV was found dead along a highway, his upper body com-pletely burned. Preliminary autopsy results indicated that he was first killed and thenset on fire. According to the police, the victim was handcuffed and probably thrownout of a moving car. 07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 7507-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 76A. A new identity Identity change is an exceptional measure applied only when the threat against the witness's life cannot be averted through temporary relocation or other measures. It consists of the cre-ation of a new personal profile for the witness, hiding his or her original identity by issuingpersonal documents under a new name, resettling him or her in a new area and creating asubstitute life history. The witness's previous status (age, marital status, profession, religionetc.) is mirrored, to the fullest extent possible, in his or her new identity. The fundamentalprinciple is that the witness protection programme should be neither of benefit nor detrimen-tal to the witness. The extra effort to mirror the witness's original particulars is made to min-imize the risk of exposure inherent in providing a new personal history and to facilitateownership of the new identity by the witness. Furthermore, it provides a safeguard againstrecidivism. The witness's criminal record is transferred to the new name but in a manner thatmakes it impossible for third parties to trace the original conviction or identity of the witness. The number of personal details altered varies in different countries. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, the authorities do notcompletely reinvent the witness's life but only change what is necessary. In other coun-tries, such as Italy, New Zealand and Norway, additional items are changed. In all cases,however, there must be no connection between the old and new identities so that, no mat-ter what resources are at the disposal of a criminal group, it is impossible for it to trace thewitness. In that respect, a series of measures should be taken to resolve practical prob-lems, such as leaving as a forwarding address a post office box number belonging to thewitness protection unit for any correspondence related to the witness's old identity andaddress. The unit could also seek a court order prohibiting the publication of the witness'sold photographs to further lessen the chance of identification. Despite advances in biometric identification, ordinary physical characteristics are those most used to identify people. In some countries, the law allows plastic surgery to be usedas a means of giving a witness a new identity by altering his or her facial features. Suchprovisions usually refer to the removal of distinguishing marks on the face or body such astattoos, moles and birthmarks. The witness protection unit can decide when to issue a new identity, but in most cases that is done after the trial has ended. Until the new identity emerges, there should be no inter-ruption of the security and support services provided to the endangered witness. 77VIII. Relocation and identity change07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 771. Personal documentation During the identity change process, all documentation relating to the old identity must be removed from the witness's possession. That is done not only for security reasons, in otherwords to prevent them from being found and used as a lead to the witness's real identity,but also to prevent protected witnesses from possessing and utilizing multiple identities.Witnesses are then provided with new documents to support the recently established pro-file. The documents should be originals bearing all the regular security features (photo-graph, signature, fingerprints, biometric data etc.) and should be issued in accordancewith the law. The type and number of documents provided to witnesses vary from country to country and may include: (a) Passport; (b) Identification card;(c) Medicare or health insurance card; (d) Tax number;(e) Citizenship certificate; (f) Driver's licence;(g) Birth certificate;(h) Trade and professional qualifications;(i) Educational qualifications. In some countries, all personal documents need to be changed to the new name; in other countries, only those documents essential to the new identity have to be reproduced oraltered. It has been noted that in both cases it might not be administratively feasible toprovide all required documentation at the same time. Some documents take only days toproduce while others may take months. Priority is given to documents essential to thesecurity of the witness, while the remaining documents are supplied at a later stage.Records of the new identity and its holder should be securely stored by the witness protec-tion unit. (a) Replicating personal history For security reasons, it may not be advisable for witnesses to retain certain elements intheir personal history, such as their work experience or educational background, that others could easily research. Witnesses often need to change careers, as practising theirformer professions could provide a clue to their new location. It is not uncommon for peo-ple in the programme who used to practise as licensed professionals (doctors, lawyers,engineers etc.) to have to be retrained or even to take on jobs as unskilled workers. 78Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 78When records were kept manually, it was relatively easy to enter new data in record books and to create new profiles for witnesses. Computerization has made the process morecomplicated, as new entries and changes to electronic databases may not always be possi-ble or may leave traceable records. Replicating a witness's personal history may prove particularly challenging when his or her country of origin has ceased to exist (the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia etc.), the country'slegal system does not allow the altering of certain personal data (as in the Netherlands) orcooperation from some institutions, especially in the private sector, is not forthcoming. (b) Sociocultural context If a protected witness is placed in a new community, the assumed identity must be able tostand up to scrutiny. Understanding the sociocultural context and the potential existenceof strong family ties in a society are crucial for ensuring the success of the operation. Inclosed societies outsiders stand out, making integration difficult. Even in multicultural andmultinational environments, informal ties exist among the various ethnic groups and peo-ple tend to gravitate towards their kin, making an information leak likely. Again, diligenceis the key factor. The challenge is greater in smaller countries, where tracing a person's movements is particularly easy. In such cases, creating a new identity for a protected witness may be 79Relocation and identity change Person A was an internationally renowned financial expert. He agreed to cooperate with the police and testify in court for the prosecution in a major case involving organizedcrime in which he too was implicated. Because of his cooperation, his life came underthreat and he was obliged to enter a witness protection programme and to adopt anew identity. Allowing him to keep his impressive qualifications in his specialized fieldwould enable him to obtain a similar job in the financial sector, but it could also pro-vide his pursuers with a lead to his whereabouts. As a result, he had to accept a rel-atively low-paid job, as well as financial support from the authorities, until he was ableto re-establish himself professionally in an unrelated field where he was unknown. In the Netherlands, a person who changes his or her name permanently cannot changehis or her place or date of birth, because of associated civil and political rights, suchas pension and voting rights. As a result, persons who enter the witness protectionprogramme in the Netherlands are usually given temporary identities, which mayinclude different places and dates of birth. When the witness protection programmeends, the temporary identity also expires.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 79technically possible but impractical as an effective means of protection. In those situa- tions, some witness protection units have shifted their emphasis from permanent reloca-tion and identity change to physical protection and continuous moving of the protectedwitness. Participants are accommodated in secure areas under close protection for peri-ods ranging from a few weeks to several months, after which time they are moved again.Obviously, such practices are resource-intensive and have severe implications for thewitness's psychological status. Relocation overseas may be the only long-term optionavailable. (c) Inter-agency cooperation Changing a person's identity is a long process that requires coordination between the wit-ness protection unit and the government agencies responsible for making changes to thepublic records and issuing personal documents. Government agencies must be obligatedto render assistance whenever requested to do so by the witness protection unit and musthave the capacity to provide covert documents whose details are known only to a limitednumber of authorized officials. The law should grant the officials immunity from criminalprosecution for forgery as they would be required to issue personal documents under fictitious data. (d) Court hearings On occasion, protected witnesses who have already been given new names need to appearin public under their original identity, for example, when they must testify in court ordefend charges of criminal acts committed before entering the programme. To establishtheir relation to the case, they must appear under their old identity. If the relation betweenthe defendant and the witness is well known, the court hearing could be closed to the pub-lic and the media so that justice may be administered in a secure environment. However,the use of the Internet to publicize a witness's identity is an emerging trend that should betaken into consideration. 80Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia issued an order prohibiting publi- cation of any photographs or information identifying a protected witness in a terrorism-related trial. Such a witness was testifying at the trial of those accused of two separatebombings in 1985 that resulted in the deaths of 329 aeroplane passengers and 2 bag-gage handlers at an airport in Tokyo on the same day. The attack had been orderedby a militant Sikh group in retaliation for the Indian army's raid on the holiest shrineof the Sikh religion, the Golden Temple at Amritsar, in 1984. Despite the court's order,a website based in the United States and reportedly operated by a Sikh group pub-lished the witness's real name in what seemed to be a deliberate attempt to jeopard-ize the security of the witness (\"U.S. website identifies key Air India witness\", CTV News , 18 November 2003).07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 80The witness protection unit should ensure the witness's safe transportation to and from the courthouse as well as his or her security during the trial. In legal systems that call forthe trial of serious crimes by a jury, the defence may object to the presence in the court-room of visibly armed officers from the witness protection unit, claiming that the jury maybe negatively influenced by seeing the witness under guard. Officers may then need to sitamong the public during the giving of testimony while remaining close to the witness. (e) High-profile cases The impact that media coverage of a court case has on witness protection programmesneeds to be given serious consideration. Criminal cases that are widely reported with pic-tures and stories of witnesses published in popular magazines and newspapers may ren-der ineffective a witness's admission to the programme and even his or her relocation toanother country. The same is true for witnesses who are public figures, such as politi-cians, artists or media personalities. Their regular exposure to the public makes themeasily recognizable. Thus, other means of protection should be devised for that categoryof witness. 2. Reverting to the former identity Admission to a protection programme does not mean that a witness does away with his orher former identity and all related legal obligations forever. Instead, the old identity con-tinues to exist in parallel with the new profile. Protected witnesses can reassume their former identity once the programme has ended and once all identity documents provided under the programme are returned. However,that is optional; in most cases, the witness chooses to retain his or her new identitybecause, although the threat usually diminishes, it never completely disappears.Furthermore, as protection may last for years, the participants and persons accompany-ing them in the programme may establish themselves professionally, socially and person-ally under their new names. Any witness who reverts to a former identity must rebuild hisor her life for a third time. The longer a witness must function under an assumed identity,the more difficult it becomes to return to the old identity and to reintegrate into society.For the same reasons, most protected witnesses (and those accompanying them) whohave been relocated choose not to return to their place of origin after the end of the witnessprotection programme. 81Relocation and identity change In the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, a well-known talk show host was targeted in an attack. Because of his testimony, his life came under serious threat.His fame, however, meant that a change of identity was not a viable option. The onlyfeasible way to protect him was to provide him with a bodyguard until the perpetra-tors had been convicted and the threat had diminished.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 81Restoring a witness's original identity can be one of the sanctions applied when a witness breaches the terms of the memorandum of understanding. However, witness protectionunits are cognizant of the danger that such people face when expelled from the pro-gramme, and they may allow them to keep their new identification documents and to con-tinue living under their assumed names. B. International relocation International relocation is situated at the top end of witness protection services owing notonly to the significant costs, resources and impact it implies for the witness and his or herclose family members, but also to the complicated nature of international relations.Nonetheless, for many small countries, the international relocation of threatened wit-nesses is sometimes the only means of guaranteeing effective protection. Generally, it is sufficient to resettle a witness to another country. If the level of the threat is high though, the witness may need to enter the protection programme of the receivingcountry, where he or she will be provided with a new identity and personal documentation. In principle, the choice of receiving country depends on the threat level and where the wit- ness would fit in best. In practice, that choice largely depends on which country is willingto accept the witness. The witnesses themselves are rarely given a choice, even thoughthey often try to make their cooperation and testimony conditional on relocation to a par-ticular country or group of countries. Pursuant to article 24, paragraph 3, of the Organized Crime Convention, States parties are authorized to enter into agreements or arrangements with other States for the interna-tional relocation of protected witnesses. In practice, cooperation is based on the followingtypes of agreements: (a) Regional or bilateral agreements on cooperation in witness protection or in combat- ing specific crimes such as organized crime, drug trafficking and terrorism: such agreements establish a formal mechanism for cooperation between States partiesand usually require ratification by the national legislature; (b) Special agreements or memorandums of understanding concluded directly between police forces, prosecutors' offices or other judicial and law enforcement authorities of the respective countries: such agreements provide the basis for direct assistance and do not require ratification by the national legislature. 82Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime An agreement on cooperation in the protection of witnesses and victims signed by the Governments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in March 2000 provides for a wit-ness or victim of crime from any of these countries to be relocated to any of the otherBaltic States for a limited period or, if the person's security can no longer be ensuredby the sending State, permanently.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 821. Conditions International engagement procedures and measures are often included in national legisla- tion or policies with the specific purpose of facilitating cross-border cooperation in witnessrelocation. The most common conditions include the following: (a) Contacts between authorized agencies. Confidentiality is of paramount importance. When preparing a formal relocation request, communication regarding the caseshould be limited to the authorized agencies of the countries involved. Requests areforwarded for approval to the minister-level official responsible for justice, lawenforcement or immigration matters in the receiving country. Currently, the speedytransfer of witnesses directly between law enforcement agencies without furtherapproval is uncommon; (b) Disclosure. Before the relocation application is even considered, the sending authority needs to divulge to the receiving authority all information relating to thewitness, including criminal record, financial situation and civil liabilities.Withholding information may lead to the rejection of the relocation request. Even inhighly sensitive cases, full disclosure is a prerequisite for making an informed deci-sion. The sending authority is not obliged to (and often does not) provide detailsregarding the principal case that led to the witness's relocation. If a witness who hasbeen given a new identity and who has been relocated overseas commits a crime,details of any criminal history under his or her original identity should be madeavailable to the court by the witness protection unit; (c) Reciprocity. Some countries require a reciprocal arrangement with the sending country in order to accept the international relocation of protected witnesses.Whether reciprocity is a requirement or not, the sending authority should be able toprovide the receiving authority with detailed reports on: (i) The threat level;(ii) The status and needs of the witness, in other words whether he or she is a career criminal or has been traumatized, his or her professional qualifications, psy-chological profile, capacity to adapt etc.; (iii) The number of persons that need to be relocated with the witness; (iv) The witness's financial capabilities; (d) Compliance with immigration laws. Although relocation to another country is intended in principle as a short-term measure, it normally continues indefinitely.Upon entering the country of destination, national legislation for the naturalizationof foreign citizens applies, thus allowing relocated witnesses and those accompany-ing them to potentially apply for citizenship once all other criteria have been met; (e) Criminal record. The kind of criminal record deemed acceptable for protecting a witness varies from one country to another. To some extent, the acceptability of acriminal record depends on a particular society's values. For example, in somecountries it would not be a major problem to accept a protected witness from 83Relocation and identity change07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 83another country with a minor criminal record resulting from the use of \"soft\" drugs, such as cannabis. In countries with different drug policies, however, the reactioncould be totally different. A waiver must be sought from countries whose immigra-tion laws prevent the granting of sanctuary to persons with criminal records orrequire the prosecution of such persons by the authorities (the \"dirty hands\" con-cept). Without such waivers, the most common category of witness in need of inter-national relocation, justice collaborators, would have to be excluded. 2. Obligations Following the decision to relocate a foreign witness, the terms and conditions are open tonegotiation between the respective agencies. A detailed agreement is subsequently signedproviding for the mutual rights and obligations. The agreement usually covers the follow-ing matters: (a) Responsibility: The sending authority hands over responsibility for the safety of the witnesses to the receiving authority and is obliged to go through the receivingauthority for any future contact with the witness; (b) Financial cost: The receiving country usually assumes all costs related to protection measures, but practices differ regarding the provision of financial support to wit-nesses. Some receiving countries assume all related obligations; others negotiate acost-sharing agreement with the sending country; yet others require full reimburse-ment from the sending country; (c) Integration: The receiving country assists witnesses in finding employment and pro- vides them with training programmes, language courses, health care and socialbenefits. Depending on the immigration laws of each country, witnesses are eitherautomatically entitled to work or are issued temporary work permits that are thenrenewed on the basis of regular threat assessments made by the sending agencies.After a certain period of time, renewals can lead to permanent residence. 84Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime The European Police Office (Europol) has created an informal network of witness pro- tection agencies from European Union member States and accession countries. Thegroup meets on a regular basis to discuss the status of witness protection, toexchange information and good practices, to make recommendations for the harmo-nization of national legislation and to develop good practice policies for the witnessprotection agencies of member States. The network, which originally included theauthorized representatives of 8 States not yet members of the European Union and12 international organizations operating in the region, has gradually expanded toinclude representatives from other countries with extensive experience in witness pro-tection, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. Similar efforts have been initiated in other regions. For example, the Australasian Heads of Witness Protection Forum has been established in Asia and the Pacific.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 84Protected witnesses are usually offered work opportunities and a standard of living in the receiving country that are comparable to their financial situation before entering the wit-ness protection programme. Only legally obtained assets are taken into account in assess-ing that financial situation. Still, social and economic circumstances (for example,inflation, currency rates, unemployment, minimum wages and taxation rules) differbetween countries, occasionally making it difficult to collect accurate information regard-ing living standards. The calculation of pension rights is another challenging issue, as witnesses and relocated family members may have worked in several countries before reaching retirement age. 3. Other forms of international cooperation (a) Third-country cooperation Recently, the need for a new form of international cooperation for the relocation of wit-nesses has emerged, one in which a range of support services are offered by the witnessprotection unit of a third country to its counterparts in the sending and receiving coun-tries. The support may be as simple as facilitating the transit of witnesses through the ter-ritory or through the ports and airports of the third country to prevent a securitycompromise during passport, customs or immigration control. It may also involve morecomplicated operations, such as providing a safe haven for reunions between protectedpersons and family members who have not been relocated or providing assistance in giv-ing court testimony by videoconference. Even though in both cases the identity of the thirdcountry could become known, those measures are considered safer than risking the iden-tification of the country of relocation. (b) Imprisoned witnesses A large percentage of witnesses under protection serve prison terms. Their security is usu-ally entrusted to special departments of the correctional system and is based on keepingthem isolated from other prisoners. Only under special circumstances may they be housedin facilities with other prisoners who are also under protection. Prolonged isolation creates what has been described as the \"golden cage problem\", the development of serious psychological disorders. To alleviate that problem, some countriesare introducing a system for the exchange of protected prisoners. 85Relocation and identity change In an amendment to the Witness Protection Act (No. 256/1988) of Slovakia, the wit- ness protection unit was empowered to confirm that a person with a changed identi-ty is identical to the person prior to the change with respect to civil lawsuits andrecognition of other entitlements arising from a person's admittance to the witnessprotection programme.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 85Two main obstacles, one practical and one legal, have been identified in such types of cross- border cooperation. First, very few countries have established the specialized type of facili-ties required for the protection of imprisoned witnesses and, second, receiving countriesusually need a decision from a domestic or international court to imprison a person. C. Implications of relocation and identity change for the witness For witnesses, relocation and identity change mean getting the opportunity for a newstart; they also mean that witnesses must change their lives and be subjected to severerestrictions in their fundamental personal freedoms and individual rights in terms ofmovement, communication and work. Occasionally, witnesses may need to go through theprocess more than once to ensure effective protection. That can happen, for example,when a family member who has been relocated with the witness decides to leave the pro-gramme, forcing the remaining members to resettle and change identities again. It is difficult enough for a witness to be relocated to a different part of the country and to sever all communication and links with his or her past, extended family members andfriends, but moving abroad creates additional problems. Protected witnesses who havebeen relocated internationally must often overcome a language barrier, as well as culturaland social barriers, in order to fit in. In those cases, factors such as geography, local cus-toms and even climate become important and are sometimes the reason why witnessesare unable to adapt to the new environment. The most common elements for the successful integration of relocated witnesses in their new environment are: (a) Compatibility of ethnic and cultural background, not only to allow the witness to fit in physically, but also to help moderate any psychological stress resulting from afeeling of isolation; (b) Language;(c) Living standards;(d) Physical well-being;(e) Ability to become self-sufficient, in terms of gaining and maintaining employment within a reasonable period. 86Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In the United Kingdom, protected witnesses and their accompanying family members are provided with \"schooling\" to facilitate their transition to a new life. The processlasts 3-4 months and success depends on the ability of protected persons, especial-ly young children, to take in the changes. Thus, agencies are careful to avoid com-pletely reinventing the witness's life and focus on changing only what is necessary.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 86While in the programme, the witness must sever all ties with his or her past life. That includes getting rid of any property, including registered electronic appliances and soft-ware, that could potentially be traced to the owner through their serial numbers. Beforeentering a witness protection programme, it is therefore necessary for participants todeclare all their possessions (property, money, equities etc.) to the witness protection unit,which then advises them on which items to dispose of. The unit should take market valuesinto consideration when selling goods or property, so that witnesses do not suffer anunreasonable financial loss. It is important to note that if the protected witness is a former criminal, some of the assets may have been obtained illegally. Most countries insist that the witness should not beallowed to keep such property or money, irrespective of whether they are actually or con-structively owned by the witness. Part of the forfeited property may subsequently be usedto fund the witness protection programme or related programmes, such as a victims' com-pensation fund. 87Relocation and identity change In Latvia, the legislation governing witness protection programmes originally required the police to ensure the security of not only the witness but his or her property aswell. The law proved difficult to implement and was amended: property now has tobe disposed of before the person enters the witness protection programme. If that isnot possible, the Government must insure the property of the protected person.07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 8707-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 88Since their initial establishment in the 1970s, witness protection programmes have under- gone several changes, mostly as a result of experience gained, to make the systems moreeffective. The changes have included tightening the admission criteria, allowing personsclose to the witness to participate and making the conditions for leniency stricter. After more than 30 years of operations, witness protection programmes now face a new set of external challenges. Drastic changes are required in the light of emerging areas ofconcern: new forms of crime, the effects of globalization and advances in biometrics. A. New forms of crime Organized crime and Mafia-type crimes have given rise to the need for special pro-grammes to protect witnesses. Recent years have seen an increase in a new type of crime:gang crime. Street gangs, motorcycle gangs (such as Hells Angels) and racist skinheadgroups were once primarily a concern in large urban areas. Today, gang problems havespread to previously unaffected communities and can now be found even in suburban andrural areas. Offences are more violent and frequent, injuries are more serious and thetypes of firearm used are more lethal. The significant increase in the number of potentialwitnesses in need of protection has put witness protection programmes under severestrain. In some countries, such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States, gang-related crimes have become the main focus of witness protection programmes. To addressthe problem, some countries, realizing that gangs tend to operate on a territorial basis, arelooking into establishing short-term protection schemes that are separate from witnessprotection programmes and that provide for a series of temporary measures, includingprovisional resettlement. B. A global village The technological advances of the past 20 years and, in particular, the rapid expansion ofthe Internet in all aspects of peoples' lives have placed increased demands on efforts toprotect witnesses. Electronic devices of all sorts and sizes, including mobile telephones,laptops and even software, are registered to a user and can easily be traced. Witnessesentering a protection programme are usually required to declare ownership of such goodsto the protection unit and to dispose of them in order to break that link to their past. As faras the Internet is concerned, it is universally recognized as offering tremendous possibili-IX. Future challenges 8907-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 89ties in the fields of education, information, communication and commerce. Unfortunately, it has also unleashed previously unknown dangers for law enforcement professionals.Besides its potential abuse for criminal purposes (cybercrime), the simple posting of per-sonal information in a number of public databases creates a problem for witness protec-tion authorities. The growing number of directories, addresses and customer profilesavailable online increases the risk that a programme will be compromised by the inadver-tent posting of the details of a witness who has been relocated and given a new identity.The Internet is also an easy way of distributing compromising publications aimed atrevealing the identity of a witness. C. Biometrics Biometrics refers to the use of digital technology to record and recognize a person's phys-ical or behavioural traits. Although personal documentation containing biometrical datawas introduced for law enforcement and counter-terrorism purposes, its use is problem-atic from a witness protection perspective. The increased use of biometrical identificationdocuments, with features such as iris or facial scans, can limit the possibilities for personswith new identities to travel. For example, in some countries all foreign nationals enteringor passing through the national territory are fingerprinted. As fingerprints are linked to aperson's identity, a witness who has visited one of those countries under his or her origi-nal identity may not be able to travel there again after receiving a new identity. As moreand more countries introduce biometrics to verify the identity of individuals, the ability ofprotected witnesses to move around will become more restricted. The problems posed by using biometrical data are not limited to the public sector. In fact, there is an increasing number of privately run databases containing biometrical informa-tion, such as those operated by financial institutions. Those institutions are increasingly 90Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime In the United States, a defendant on trial in Boston for marijuana charges based on information from an informant started a website in 2004 called \"Who's A Rat?\". Thewebsite (www.whosarat.com) includes the names and photographs of undercoverpolice officers and recipients of plea agreements who have cooperated with prosecu-tors. It also includes court documents detailing what the informers have agreed to doin exchange for lenient sentences. The website claims to have identified 4,300 inform-ers and 400 undercover agents, mainly from documents available on the Internet. Thewebsite states that it is designed to assist attorneys and criminal defendants havinglimited resources and that it does not promote or condone violence or illegal activi-ty against informants or law enforcement officers. However, federal prosecutors andlaw enforcement officials believe that it poses a grave danger to cooperating witness-es and defendants because broad dissemination of their identities may subject themto retribution from friends and associates of the defendant. (Adam Liptak, \"Web sitesexpose informants, and Justice Dept. raises flag\", New York Times, 22 May 2007).07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 90requiring biometrical measurements in order to verify the identity of customers, a practice that could pose enormous problems in cases of identity change. That has become all themore important since some insurance companies now refuse to make payouts unless DNAsamples are provided as evidence of a person's identity. Discussions involving biometricworking groups are currently under way and there is a great need for coordination on thisissue among a wide range of associations and experts in the field. 21While legislation puts forward methodologies, tangible cooperation is required. In the meantime, authorities aretrying to trace all places where applicants for witness protection may have left their finger-prints or other forms of biometric data.Future challenges 21A recently released study commissioned by UNODC on fraud and the criminal misuse and falsifica- tion of identity emphasized the need for cooperation between criminal justice systems and the private sec-tor in the investigation and prosecution of related crimes. Such cooperation is perceived as an importantelement in enhancing the effectiveness of law enforcement measures against, among other things, identity-related crime, but it can also be considered from the re-identification perspective under discussion here (see\"Results of the second meeting of the Intergovernmental Expert Group to Prepare a Study on Fraud andthe Criminal Misuse and Falsification of Identity\" pm Page 92It is generally recognized that the State has an obligation to provide assistance and protec- tion to persons who are likely to be harmed because of their collaboration with the crimi-nal justice system. There are different means of protection. The kind chosen in each casedepends to a large degree on the type of witness (victim, vulnerable witness, justice collab-orator etc.), the type of crime (crime within the family, sex crime, organized crime etc.)and the level of threat or intimidation. Witness protection programmes are considered to be a last-resort response in providing security to threatened witnesses. They were established to address the inability of regularpolice protection measures to provide a secure environment for witnesses willing to testifyagainst powerful criminal defendants, such as members of the Mafia. Over the years, wit-ness protection programmes have developed sophisticated practices allowing the changeof identity of threatened witnesses and their relocation to a safe place as the only effectivemeans of protection. The success of those operations has had a positive impact on secur-ing crucial evidence and has made witness protection a key element in efforts to effectivelyfight organized crime. A. Main elements Significant differences exist among the legal traditions, political environment, stage ofdevelopment, society and culture, and levels and types of criminality in different countries.Those differences reflect the type and extent of protection that each country is able to pro-vide. In most jurisdictions, witness protection is associated with simple police measures,such as the temporary placement of witnesses in safe houses or the provision of psycho-logical support. Before the early 1990s, only a handful of countries had established programmes to provide the extraordinary protection measures required for criminals who decided tocooperate with the prosecution by providing critical and otherwise unavailable evi-dence in cases of national significance. However, as the threat of organized crime hasgrown, more and more countries have sought to enhance their arsenal of protectionmeasures and establish special units to assist threatened witnesses in resettling undera new identity. The paths that have led to the development of witness protection programmes through- out the world differ. Despite those differences, once established, those programmes are 93X. Conclusion07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 93very similar irrespective of the geographical area, legal system, size or stage of social and economic development of the particular country. The similarities can be summa-rized as follows: (a) There is a combination of witness protection, plea-bargaining and accomplice testimony; (b) There is an almost exclusive focus on the small number of critical witnesses who offer to change sides and cooperate with the prosecution but demand protection tostay alive; (c) The use of relocation and re-identification - based on almost the same criteria (type of crime, threat, suitability, voluntary participation) - as a last resort in ensuringwitness security. B. Alternative measures The effects of witness protection programmes are maximized when there is a multi-pronged approach, starting with the application of temporary police measures, continuingwith the use of evidentiary rules during court testimony and culminating, when all othermeasures are deemed to have proved insufficient, in identity change and relocation proce-dures. C. Requirements Some of the most important elements for the establishment and operation of witness pro-tection programmes are: (a) A clear legal or policy basis for designing a methodology and carrying out opera- tions; (b) Adequate financing that is stable and continues for several years;(c) Strict personnel qualifications and vetting procedures;(d) Protection of the programme's integrity; (e) Close coordination with judicial and other Government authorities engaged in law enforcement and intelligence, prison administration, public housing, health andsocial security services, among others; (f) Accountability and transparency that conform with the programme's special secu- rity needs; (g) Obligation of government authorities to provide appropriate assistance, safeguard- ing the information disclosed to them; (h) Ability to offer assistance to national and international law enforcement agencies. 94Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 94D. Admission criteria The severity of the threat to the witness and the seriousness of the crime in respect of which the witness testifies are among the main elements to be considered in the determi-nation of admission to the programme. Other criteria depend mostly on the witness andinclude: (a) The importance of the testimony in a significant case; (b) The witness's willingness to cooperate;(c) The witness's suitability for being included in the programme in terms of psycholog- ical, mental and medical conditions. E. Costs Even though witness protection programmes are expensive, the costs prove minorwhen compared with the programme's contribution to the effectiveness of prosecu-tions in cases involving serious crime. The costs are directly related to, among otherthings, the number of witnesses approved for inclusion and the financial benefitsgranted to the participants. It is interesting to note that in the initial phase, witnessprotection programmes are usually overambitious in that they seek to cover a widerange of witnesses and crimes. With the passage of time, however, the serious strainthey come under as a result of the large number of participants and the increasingcosts leads to the application of stricter conditions for admission to ensure the pro-gramme's efficiency and viability. F. Programme administration Practical issues such as which body should be responsible for the programme (the policeor some other authority), organizational structure (national or local) and decision-makingauthority (single official or collective body) are of secondary importance to the pro-gramme's success as long as the following principles are upheld: (a) Separation from the investigation; (b) Operational autonomy from the regular police; (c) Secrecy and security of information;(d) Shielding from political and other influences in the work of the programme. G. International relocation The ability of countries to exchange protected witnesses in times of increased threat or to relocate them under a new identity in another country are important means of enhancingthe capacity of national witness protection programmes. With few exceptions, however, 95Conclusion07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 95actual cross-border cooperation continues to be at a low level. To improve the situation, Member States should: (a) Develop agreed minimum standards warranting international relocation; (b) Simplify application and admission procedures;(c) Harmonize, where reasonable, national legislation and policies, including the ter- minology used therein; (d) Create networks of witness protection agencies to establish direct contact among relevant officials; (e) Coordinate recruitment, vetting and training standards for personnel;(f) Develop common criteria for the determination of living standards and benefits received by witnesses who are relocated to other countries. 96Good Practices for the Protection of Witnesses in Criminal Proceedings Involving Organized Crime07-85835_cb.qxp 17/1/08 12:11 pm Page 96AArrggeennttiinnaa Ministry of Justice and Human
