The Phoenix Process: Feel Reborn with Our Proven Methodology Step 1: Initial Consultation At Phoenix Rehab, we firmly believe in creating a low-stress, patient-centric environment. We will work with you to address your symptoms and concerns, ensuring that you understand your condition before proceeding with treatment so you can make an informed decision. Our consultations aim to create an atmosphere of trust and open communication so that you can feel secure with your TCM practitioner. Step 2: In-depth Review Next, your TCM practitioner will begin an in-depth review of your medical history to understand your symptoms, lifestyle and health goals. Beyond answering our questions, you may be required to bring medical reports, MRI results or referral forms. This is an important step in traditional medicine because not all treatments are appropriate for everyone, and many treatments interact with each other. Step 3: Assessment Based on your review, clinical tests and physical assessments will be conducted where appropriate to assess the severity of your health issues. This will allow us to rule out possible underlying causes, injuries or safety concerns and obtain an accurate diagnosis. After all, we want to provide our patients with safe and effective treatments that address health problems without causing adverse side effects. Step 4: Treatment Based on the findings, a customised plan of action will be discussed with you to help you reach your treatment goals. Most patients are able to receive treatment within the same session. Our TCM practitioners will carry out ongoing observation each time you return for your follow-up sessions. This allows us to determine your progress and adjust the intensity of our treatment to support you along your health journey.
