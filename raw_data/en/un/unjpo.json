This office Rocks! I was having some issues that my doctor couldn't help me with, she sent me to a specialist (Dermatologist) who had given me a couple prescriptions that just covered up the issue. I heard of this office from a friend and decided to go. The first time I saw Aileen for acupuncture, my issue was 80% gone and not only that it also helped my hot flashes! I have gone to Aileen several times now and we are now at the point where I will make appointments as needed. Aileen is the BEST! I have also seen Dr. Doug, and that chiropractor appointment was by far the most thorough one I have ever had! Excellent people on staff here, from the front desk to the professionals. I could hardly walk when I arrived And Dr. deVries took me in without an appointment. (not recommended) He made sure what and where my pain was coming from, let me relax with a heated blanket on the area in question, and gave me a massage before putting everything back in place. I highly recommend them. Dr. Doug is absolutely wonderful! He is knowledgeable and approachable- he doesn't rush you and really spends time making sure you are feeling so much better than when you walked in! He's helped me tremendously with several issues and I highly recommend him. As for the office itself, everyone has been so welcoming and kind, and their business practices are fair and straightforward. Definitely check them out for all things wellness, they are a gem in our community! I have been seeing Aileen for acupuncture and Kayla for massage. Both are very talented and knowledgeable in their fields. The swelling and pain in my joints has significantly decreased after starting my sessions with these ladies. I highly recommend them. Doug and Kristen are awesome! Both have helped me tremendously with many discomforts I have experienced. They are both skilled in their crafts and no matter what you need...with these two...you will be in great hands! Grand Rapids Wellness treats the mind, body, and spirit.
