UMP Plus is offered through the Washington State Health Care Authority's School Employees Benefits Board ( SEBB) Program . UMP Plus is administered by Regence BlueShield and Washington State Rx Services (WSRxS). All prescription drugs, services, or other benefit changes may require approval by the SEB Board . Approval takes place when benefits are procured for the next calendar year. This plan is available only to people eligible for coverage through the SEBB Program. Only people who live in the following Washington State counties are eligible to enroll in UMP Plus -UW Medicine Accountable Care Network (UW Medicine ACN): Kin g, Kitsap, Pierce, Skagit, Snohomish, Spokane, and Thurston. UMP Plus covers health care services delivered through a specific network of providers. UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN delivers these services through their network of primary care providers, specialty providers, facilities, clinics, and hospitals. This plan is designed to keep you and your enrolled dependents healthy and provide benefits in case of injury or illness. R eview this certificate of coverage (COC) carefully so you may get the most from your health care benefits. 14 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage UMP Plus: High -quality care at a lower cost Accountable Care Networks, like UMP Plus, promote high- quality care at a lower cost. The Health Care Authority designed UMP Plus to help providers achieve these goals while allowing members to choose their own providers within their UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN network. Providers who join UMP Plus agree to deliver and evaluate the quality of your care. When you receive covered preventive care and coordinated care, the overall cost of providing ca re is lower. These cost savings help keep your premium and deductible lower without limiting necessary care. Accumulators Insurance accumulators may transfer when a subscriber changes their enrollment from one UMP plan to another UMP plan mid -year during a special open enrollment (SOE). When a subscriber enrolled in a SEBB Program UMP plan changes their own enrollment to another SEBB Program UMP plan (meaning the subscriber continues to be the subscriber on the new SEBB Program UMP Plan) during an SOE, the amounts already accrued toward medical and pharmacy deductibles, out - of-pocket limits, and benefit limits (see definition of \"Limited benefit\") will transfer to the new SEBB Program UMP plan. These accumulators will also transfer for any member on the sub scriber's account who changes UMP plans with the subscriber. When a subscriber enrolled in a PEBB Program UMP plan changes their enrollment to a SEBB Program UMP plan (meaning the subscriber continues to be the subscriber on the new SEBB Program UMP Plan ) during an SOE, the amounts already accrued toward the medical and pharmacy deductibles and the out - of-pocket limits for themselves and their enrolled dependents will transfer to the new SEBB Program UMP plan. These accumulators will also transfer for any member on the subscriber's account who changes UMP plans with the subscriber. If you have questions, call UMP Customer Service. Finding a health care provider ALERT! Understanding the different provider networks can help you save money. See below for a description of the networks. Visit the UMP provider search to find UMP Plus- UW Medicine ACN providers. You can also visit your UMP Plus network website to find core network providers (see the definition of \"Core network providers\" ). See the Directory pages at the beg inning of this booklet for links and contact information. You can search for network providers by signing in to your Regence account and selecting Find a Doctor. Network providers will display as \"In your network\" and out- of-network providers will display as \"Out of network.\" If you use Find a Doctor by searching as a guest, you must choose UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN as your network. This will ensure your search results only return network providers. You can confirm a provider's network status before your visit by using the provider search or calling UMP Customer Service. When you see a network provider at a facility such as a hospital, also confirm that the facility is part of the network (see page 20). 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 15 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN ALERT! Some providers are network providers at one location but not another (example: urgent care clinics). Call UMP Customer Service if you have any questions about the network status of a provider at a specific location. As a UMP Plus member, you may see a pro vider from one of the networks listed below. The amount you pay for services will depend on the network status of the provider. To find your provider's network status, visit the UMP Provider search or call UMP Customer Service (see Directory for links and contact information ). Core network \u2014 contains primary care providers (PCP) and specialty providers contracted with UMP Plus-UW Medicine ACN . You pay $0 for most covered services when you see your PCP, and the plan pays 100 per cent of the allowed amount. Note: When you see a PCP in your network for primary care services, you pay $0 for office visits. However, related services, like x -rays or labs that you may receive during a primary care visit, may be subject to the medical de ductible and coinsurance. You pay 15 percent of the allowed amount for most covered services by all providers other than your PCP, after you meet your medical deductible. You pay nothing for covered preventive care services and covered immunizations as de scribed in the \"Preventive care\" benefit. These providers cannot bill you for more than the plan's allowed amount. You will not have to file a claim if the plan is your primary coverage. When you receive nonemergency services at a network hospital , networ k hospital outpatient department, network critical access hospital, or network ambulatory surgical center in Washington State , you pay the network rate and cannot be balance billed regardless of the network status of the provider. For nonemergency services performed at one of these facilities outside of Washington State, you still pay the network rate, but in some states, an out- of-network provider may be allowed to ask you to waive some of your balance billing protections. Health plans are required to have enough providers in their network to ensure that members have access to network providers. To ensure there are enough provider types in UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN network, UW Medici ne ACN uses certain, but not all, providers contracted with Regence BlueShield. This is called the support network. Support network \u2014 the support network includes certain providers contracted with Regence to supplement the c ore network and ensure network adequacy. Most of the providers in this network are specialty providers (see the \"Support providers\" section for examples of support providers). Naturopaths are considered PCPs. You pay 15 percent for most covered services. These providers cannot bill yo u for charges above the allowed amount. If you select a naturopath as your PCP, you pay $0 for most covered services. The plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount. 16 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage When you receive nonemergency services at a network hospital, network hospital outpatient department, network critical access hospital, or network ambulatory surgical center in Washington State, you pay the network rate and cannot be balance billed regardless of the network status of the provider. For nonemergency services performed at one of these facilities outside of Washington State, you still pay the network rate, but in some states, an out- of-network provider may be allowed to ask you to waive some of your balance billing protections. ALERT! Not all providers contracted with Regence are included in the core or support network. If you see a contracted provider with Regence who is not in the UMP Plus core or support network, those providers are considered out -of-network. Regence contracted providers cannot balance bill you. The UMP provider search includes the network status of all providers, including out -of-network providers. Be sure to confirm that your provider is in the core or support network to have the highest level of coverage. Out- of-network providers \u2014are any providers who are not in the core or support network. Out -of- network providers may include providers who have a contract with Regence, but are not included in the core or support network. If you see one of these providers, they are considered out -of-network. The UMP Plus-UW Med icine ACN provider search directory includes core, support , and out -of-network providers.

If the network approves a network consent, the plan pays at the network rate (85 percent of the allowed amount) for services received from an out -of-network provider. An out -of-netw ork consent must be submitted and approved prior to the service being performed. When and how to request a network consent ALERT! If the network approves a network consent, you must still pay your cost -share for most medical services. Services provided und er an approved network consent apply to your medical deductible and out- of-pocket limit. Network consent for ongoing services may require periodic review. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 23 When your network provider affiliated with UMP Plus- UW Medicine ACN determines you need covered medic ally necessary services not available within your UMP Plus- UW Medicine ACN network, that provider submits a network consent request to the network for consideration by calling UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN Customer Service a t 1-888-402-4238 (TRS: 711) or UMP Cu stomer Service. If they approve the network consent, the network will fax it to the plan before the services are provided. The fact that a provider may prescribe or provide a service or supply does not, by itself, make it a medically necessary covered service or supply . The network consent must include the following: Information about the out -of-network provider and/or facility, such as name, address, and Tax ID number (TIN). The dates of service for which your UMP Plus- UW Medicine ACN network provider is requesting network consent. When preauthorization is required with network consent The services you receive through network consent may also require UMP preauthorization. In that case, your network provider affiliated with UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN must include information relevant to both the network consent and the UMP preauthorization request: The information about the out- of-network provider and/or facility listed in the previous section; and Clinical documentation needed for the plan to review servic es for medical necessity. For the plan to pay for out- of-network services at the network rate, the plan must approve a network consent before you receive services. A network consent is not guaranteed. Services received outside the service area UMP members have access to Regence BlueShield network providers and Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan providers worldwide through the BlueCard\u00ae and Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core programs. Coverage available by region The table below shows the medical coverage avai lable to you outside the UMP Plus service area in Washington State, in the rest of the U.S., and worldwide.

For nonemergency services performed at one of these facilities outside of Washington State, you still pay the network rate, but in some states, an out- of-network provider may be allowed to ask you to waive some of your balance billing protections. Out-of-area services Any area outside of Washington State is considered outside of the Regence BlueShield service area , as defined on page 158. Regence BlueShield has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"BlueCard\u00ae Programs.\" Whenever you obtain health care services outside of Regence's service area, the claims for these services may be processed through one of these BlueCard\u00ae Programs, and may include negotiated National Account arrangements available between Regence and other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Licensees. Typically, when accessing care outside of Regence's service area, you will obtain care from health care providers that have a contractual agreement with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (as Host Blue). In some inst ances, you may obtain care from out- of-network providers. Regence's payment practices in both instances are described on page 25. BlueCard\u00ae Program Under the BlueCar d\u00ae Program, when you access covered services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, Regence will remain responsible for fulfilling contractual obligations. However, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all int eractions with its network providers. Whenever you access covered services outside Regence's service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard\u00ae Program, the amount you pay for covered services is calculated based on the lower of: The billed cove red charges for your covered services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Regence. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your health care provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that considers special arrangements with your health care provider or provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of health care providers after considering the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to your calculation. If any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, Regence would then calculate your liability for any covered services according to applicable law. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 25 Inter -Plan Programs: Federal or state taxes, surcharge s, or fees Federal law or state law may require a surcharge, tax or other fee that applies to self -insured accounts. If applicable, any such surcharge, tax or other fee will be included as part of the claim fee passed on to the claimant. Negotiated Nationa l Account arrangements As an alternative to the BlueCard\u00ae Program, your claims for covered services may be processed through a negotiated National Account arrangement with a Host Blue. The amount you pay for covered services under this arrangement will be calculated based on the lower of either billed covered charges or a negotiated price (refer to the description of negotiated price above) made available to Regence by the Host Blue. Out-of-network providers outside Regence's service area Member l iability When covered services are provided outside of Regence's service area by out -of-network providers, the amount you pay for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's out- of-network provider local payment or the pricing arrangements requir ed by applicable state law. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the out -of-network provider bills and the payment Regence will make for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. Exceptions In certain situations, Regence may use other payment bases. such as billed covered charges, the payment Regence would make if the health care services had been obtained within Regence's service area, or a special negotiated payment, as permitted under Inter -Plan Pro grams Policies, to determine the amount Regence will pay for services rendered by out -of-network providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the out -of-network provider bills and the payment Regence will mak e for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. Services received outside the United States ALERT! The plan does not cover prescription drugs ordered through mail -order pharmacies located outside the U.S. See \"Prescription drugs purchased outsid e the U.S.\" on page 86 to learn more. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core If you are outside the U.S., you may be able to take advantage of Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core when accessing covered health services. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core is unlike the BlueCard\u00ae Program available in the U.S. in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core assists you with accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient, and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host Blue. As such, when you receive care from providers outside the U.S., you will typically have to pay the providers and submit the claims yourself to obtain reimbursement for these services. If you need medical services (including locating a doctor or hospital) outside the U.S., you should call the service center at 1 -800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 1 -804-673-1177, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 26 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage An assistance coordinator, working with a medical professional, will arrange a physician appointment or hospitalization, if necessary. Inpatient services In most cases, if you contact the service center for assistance, hospitals will not require you to pay upfront for covered inpatient services, except for your applicable deductible, and copays. In such cases, the hospital will submit your claims to the service center to begin claims processing. However, if you paid in full at the time of services, you must submit a claim to receive reimbursement for covered health care services. Outpatient services Physicians, urgent care centers, and other outpatient providers located outside the U.S. will typically require you to pay in full at the time of services. You must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for covered health care services. Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core claim When you pay for covered health care services outside the BlueCard\u00ae service area, you must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, complete a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core claim form and send the claim form with the provider's itemized bill(s) to the service center (the address is on the form) to initiate claims processing. Following the instructions on the claim form will help ensure timely processing of your claim. The claim form is available from the claims administrator, the service center, or online at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core\u00ae website at bcbsglobalcore.com . If you need assistance with your claim submission, you should call the service center at 1-800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 1 -804-673-1177, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What you pay for medical services Deductible A deductible is a fixed dollar amount you pay each calendar year before the plan begins paying for covered services. The medical deductible amount is $125 per member, with a maximum of $375 per family. When you first get services, you pay the first $125 in c harges. After you pay that first $125, the plan begins to pay for covered services. This applies to each covered member, up to the $375 maximum. The medical deductible applies to all services unless otherwise stated in this COC. See below for services that are exempt from the medical deductible. Services apply to the UMP medical deductible in the order claims are received, not necessarily in the order the member receives the services. ALERT! If you receive services with a benefit limit (such as physical th erapy) before meeting your medical deductible, those visits still apply to the benefit limit. For example, if you pay out of pocket for a physical therapy visit because you have not met your medical deductible, that visit will apply to the maximum of 60 visits per calendar year. See definition of \"Limited benefit\" for more information. If you earned the SmartHealth wellness incentive Eligible subscribers can qualify for a $125 reduction in their 202 3 SEBB medical plan deductible. If you qualified in 202 2 and you are still eligible to participate in the wellness incentive program, your medical deductible will be reduced by $125 in January 2023 . More details on eligibility and program requirements are on HCA's SmartHealth webpage at hca.wa.gov/sebb- smarthealth. What does not count toward your medical deductible The following out -of-pocket expenses do not count toward your $125 medical deductible: Charges for service visits over benefit limits. For example, the annual benefit limit for physical therapy is 60 visits. Costs for more than 60 visits are not covered by the plan, and do not count toward your medical deductible. Charges for services over benefit maximums. Charges over this amount do not app ly to your medical deductible.

How the medical deductible works with dependents If your family has three or fewer members enrolled, the medical deductible amount is $125 per member, with a maximum of $375. Once a member pays their $125 deductible, the plan begins paying for covered services for that member. Because the plan is now paying for this member's covered services, they are no longer contributing toward the family deductible. Once the family deductible has been met, the plan begins paying for all covered services. If your family has four or more members enrolled, each member has a medical deductible of $125 and the maximum the family pays toward medical deductibles is $375. Once a me mber pays their $125 deductible, the plan begins paying for covered services for that member. Because the plan is now paying for this member's covered services, they are no longer contributing toward the family deductible. Once the family deductible has been met, the plan begins paying for all covered services for all enrolled family members, even if some have not met their own deductible. If the subscriber earned the SmartHealth wellness incentive for the 202 3 plan year, the subscriber's medical deductible is reduced. See the \"If you earned the SmartHealth wellness incentive\" section above to learn more. Note: Only services that are covered and are subject to the medical deductible count toward the deductible. See page 27 for a list of services that do not count toward the medical deductible. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 29 Coinsurance TIP: Allowed amount is the most the plan pays for a specific covered service or supply. Out- of- network providers m ay charge more than this amount, and you are responsible for paying the difference between the billed amount and the allowed amount. This is called balance billing. Coinsurance is the percentage of the allowed amount you pay for most medical services and for prescription drugs when the plan pays less than 100 percent. After you meet your medical deductible, you pay the percentages described below for most covered medical services. See the following sections for more information on how much you pay for presc ription drugs: \"What you pay for cost -limit works,\" \"Your prescription drug out -of-pocket limit.\" For primary care providers in the core network: You pay nothing for office visits. You may pay 15 percent of the allowed amount for other services not considered preventive (see the \"Preventive care\" benefit ) that you may receive (like labs and x -rays) during a primary care office visit after you meet your medical deductible. For specialty providers in the core or support network: You pay 15 percent of the allowed amount after you meet your medical deductible. For out -of-network providers: You pay 50 percent of the allowed amount after you meet your medical deductible and the provider may balance bill you, which means you will pay any amount an out-of-network provider bills that is above the allowed amount. Professional charges, such as for physician services while you are in the hospital or lab work, may be billed separately. Note: When you receive nonemergency services at a network hospital , network hospital outpatient department, network critical access hospital, or network ambulatory surgical center in Washington State , you pay the network rate and ca nnot be balance billed regardless of the network status of the provider. For nonemergency services performed at one of these facilities outside of Washington State, you still pay the network rate, but in some states, an out- of-network provider may be allow ed to ask you to waive some of your balance billing protections. At an out -of-network facility, w hen you receive emergency services you pay the network cost -sharing amount regardless of the network status of the provider or facility and cannot be balance b illed. See descriptions of these provider types beginning on page 18. Visit the UMP Provider search to search a complete list of UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN providers, including out- of-network providers. You can also confirm a provider's network status by calling UMP Customer Service. See the Directory for link and contact information. Copay A copay is a set dollar amount you pay when you receive services, treatments, or supplies, including, but not limited to: Emergency room copay: $75 per visit. See the \"Emergency room\" benefit for details. Facility charges for services received while an inpatient at a hospital, or mental health, skilled nursing, or substance use disorder facility: $200 per day (see \"Inpatient copay\" below). Covered chiropractic, acupuncture , and massage services when you see a network provider will have a $15 copay per visit. The copay for these services will ap ply toward the annual out -of-pocket maximums. 30 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage See the extremity manipulations\" benefit, \"Acupuncture\" benefit, and Inpatient copay The inpatient copay of $200 per day is what you pay for inpatient services at a network facility, such as a hospital, or mental health, skilled nursing, or substance use disorder facility. You and your enrolled dependents pay up to $600 maximum per enrolle d member per calendar year. The inpatient copay does not apply to your medical deductible but does apply to your medical out- of- pocket limit. Note: Professional charges, such as lab work or provider services, while you are in the hospital may be billed separately and are not included in this copay. When you pay Most of the time, you pay after your claim is processed. You will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the plan that explains how much the plan paid the provider. The Member Responsibility section of your EOB tells you how much you owe the provider. The provider sends you a bill. You pay the provider. Note: A provider may ask you to pay your deductible and copay, when applicable, at the time of service. When this happens, check your EOB to make sure the amount you paid is accurately reflected in the Member Responsibility section. Call UMP Customer Service with questions. Medical out- of-pocket limit ALERT! Prescription drug costs do not apply to your medical out- of-pocket limit (see below ). The medical out -of-pocket limit is the most you pay during a calendar year for covered services from network providers. After you meet your medical out -of-pocket limit for the year, the plan pays for covered services by network providers at 100 percent of the allowed amount. The plan will not pay more than the allowed amount. Expenses are counted from January 1, 202 3, or your first day of enrollment (whichever is later) through December 31, 202 3, or your last day of enrollment (whichever is earlier). Your m edical out -of-pocket limit is $2,000 per member and $4,000 per family. What counts toward this limit Inpatient and emergency room copays Your coinsurance paid to core network, support network, and other providers approved by your plan for certain services Your coinsurance paid to out- of-network providers for emergency room services, air ambulance, and nonemergency services furnished during a visit or stay at a network hospital, hospital outpatient department, critical access hospital, or ambulatory surgical center.

Any amount you pay over the allowed amount does not count toward the medical out -of-pocket limit. H. Amounts paid for services over a benefit limit. For example, the benefit limit for acupuncture is 24 visits. If you have more than 24 acupuncture visits in one year, you will pay in full for those visits, and what you pay will not count toward this limit. What you pay after reaching this limit You are still responsible for paying C through H (above) after you meet your medical out- of-pocket limit. See the \"Your prescription drug out -of-pocket limit\" section for more information. You still pay for out- of-network provider services Even after you meet your medical out- of-pocket limit, you still pay 50 percent coinsurance for out- of- network provider services. Out -of-network providers may balance bill you. Note: The 50 percent coinsurance you pay to an out -of-network provider, and any balance billed amounts, do not count toward your medical out -of-pocket limit. Balance billed amounts never ap ply toward your medical deductible or out -of-pocket limit. Additional exception for approved network consent services In addition to the services listed in the \"What does not count toward this limit\" section above , your coinsurance for out- of-network provi der services related to an approved network consent (see page 22) will apply to your medical out -of-pocket limit, and the plan will pay 100 percent of the allowed am ount for these services after you meet your medical out -of-pocket limit.

This plan will cover a service or supply if it meets all of the following conditions. The service or supply must: Be listed as covered; and Be medically necessary; and Be received by a member on a day between the date coverage begins (but no sooner than January 1, 202 3) and the date coverage ends (but no later than December 31, 202 3); and Have been determined to be a covered benefit by the Health Technology Clinical Committee (HTCC), if reviewed by the HTCC, and, if determined to be covered with conditions, meet the co nditions of coverage established by the HTCC ; and Meet the plan's coverage policies and preauthorization requirements. Limits and exclusions may apply to plan benefits. See both the benefit description and the \"What the plan does not cover\" section. Some services require preauthorization and/or notice before you receive treatment. Visit the UMP Policies that affect your care webpage for a list of these services, or call UMP Customer Service to ask if a certain service is covered, requires preauthorization, or requires notice. See Directory for link and contact information . The following sections describe the benefits provided by this plan. Be sure to read them carefully for important information that may help y ou get the most from your health coverage. If you do not understand the benefits, it is your responsibility to ask for help before receiving services by calling UMP Customer Service. UMP Plus is a self -insured ACP. UMP is offered through the Washington State Health Care Authority's School Employees Benefits Board ( SEBB) Program . UMP is administered by Regence BlueShield, and Washington State Rx Services (WSRxS). All prescription drugs, services, or other benefit changes may require approval by the SEB Board . Approval takes place when benefits are procured for the next calendar year. For example, prescription drugs newly approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may require approval by the SEB Board before the plan will cover them. Health Techno logy Clinical Committee (HTCC) ALERT! HTCC determinations may be implemented by the plan at any time during the calendar year, but are often implemented the January following the HTCC's decision. HTCC decisions are posted on the HCA website at hca.wa.gov/h ta. Contact UMP Customer Service if you have questions about specific services that the HTCC has reviewed. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 37 Created by chapter 70.14 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW ), the HTCC is a committee of 11 independent health care professionals that reviews selected health technologies (services) to determine appropriate coverage, if any, for the services. These may include medical o r surgical devices and procedures, medical equipment, and diagnostic tests. In public meetings, the HTCC considers public comments and scientific evidence regarding the safety, medical effectiveness, and cost -effectiveness of the services when making its determination. How HTCC decisions affect UMP benefits Under state law, the plan must comply with HTCC decisions , RCW 70.14.120 (1)(a), unless such determination conflicts with federal or state law . Services reviewed by the HTCC are either covered, covered with conditions, or not covered. The HTCC determines the conditions, if any, under which the service will be included as a covered benefit and, if covered, the criteria the plan must use to decide whether the service is medically necessary. Criteria established by the HTCC take precedence over Regence's medical policies. When the HTCC determines that a service is not covered, then the service is not covered by the plan. Some HTCC decisions include a requirement to follow FDA or Centers for Medicare and Med icaid Services (CMS) guidelines. You may review these guidelines on the FDA website at fda.gov or CMS website at cms.gov . Where to find HTCC decisions You may view the list of servic es that the HTCC has reviewed or currently has under review on the HCA website at hca.wa.gov/hta. The website includes: Evidence reports Instructions on providing public comments on pending reviews or re -reviews Public comments The decisions and criteria for coverage The public meeting schedule You may also call UMP Customer Service with questions about coverage of conditions for HTCC technologies.

Providers of ABA Therapy services must be appropriately credentialed and qualified to prescribe or perform ABA Therapy services. The plan must preauthorize ABA Therapy services for members ages 18 years old and older before services are performed. No preauthorization is required for members under the age of 18 years old. Like other preauthorized services, approved ABA preauthorization is specific to the provider who made the ABA preauthorization request. ABA Therapy hours preauthorized for one provider are not automatically transferable to another provider. A change in the provider requires a new ABA preauthorization. The initial assessment and ABA therapy treatment order or prescription do not require preauthorization for members of any age. As for other covered services, you receive the highest -level benefit by using network providers. See the \"Types of services \" section for differences in your cost for core, support, and out -of-network providers. To find a network pr ovider, visit the UMP Provider search or call UMP Customer Service. You can also find more information on ABA Therapy by viewing the ABA policy on the UMP Policies that affect your care webpage . See the Directory pages at the beginning of this booklet for links and contact information. Autism treatment To determine how a service, supply, or intervention is covered, see that specific benefit. For example, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy is addressed on page 41; speech or occupational therapy is addressed on page 69 under the \"Therapy: Habilitative and Rehabilitative\" benefit ; and mental health coverage is found under \"Beh avioral health\" on page 42 . If a specific benefit is subject to limits, such as number of visits, these limits do not apply when the services, supplies, or interventions are for an autism diagnosis. Bariatric surgery TIP: Call UMP Customer Service to locate a provider. For the plan to cover bariatric surgery, you must get preauthorization from the plan and follow all your chosen facility's bariatric surgery requirements. This includes working with a multidisciplinary bariatric surgery team and ensuring your surgery and postsurgical treatment meet all plan medical policies. The plan covers only certain types of bariatric surgery procedures. If you meet the pla n's clinical criteria, non- Medicare adults ages 18 and over will be eligible for covered bariatric procedures. Related care following bariatric surgery Panniculectomy (removal of loose skin) is covered following bariatric surgery only when specific medical criteria are met. Most panniculectomies are considered cosmetic and are not covered. 42 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage UMP will cover medically necessary surgical follow -up care related to a covered bariatric procedure, such as care for complications and needed revisions. The follow -up su rgery must be appropriate and essential to the long -term success of the initial bariatric surgery and must be preauthorized. Members who had a bariatric procedure before coverage under a UMP plan and have complications or need medically necessary revision are not required to verify prior coverage or that they met the plan's medical policy criteria for the initial bariatric procedure. However, you must follow plan requirements for follow -up care, including requesting preauthorization. Behavioral health Support provider type: You must use a UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN provider or a covered provider within the support network to receive network level benefits (see description in the \"Support providers\" section ). The plan covers behavioral health services includin g care for mental health and substance use disorder. You pay the inpatient rate when admitted to an inpatient facility, and the standard rate for all other care and services. When you receive nonemergency services from an out -of-network provider at a netwo rk hospital, network hospital outpatient department, network critical access hospital, or network ambulatory surgical center, you pay the network rate and cannot be balance billed for services performed in Washington State or without your informed consent in states that allow you to waive the federal balance billing protections. When you receive emergency services you pay the network cost -sharing amount regardless of the network status of the provider or facility and cannot be balance billed. Mental health The plan covers mental health services for members with neuropsychiatric and mental health conditions. Marriage or family counseling is not covered. The amount the plan pays depends on the provider's network status (see the \" Finding a health care provider \" section and page 34). See below for details about coverage for substance use disorder treatment. Inpatient ALERT!

Make sure that UMP's network mail- order pharmacies have your information for both plans and know which plan is primary. However, if your primary plan uses a different mail -order pharmacy, you will have to use your primary plan's mail -order pharma cy, then submit a paper claim for payment by UMP. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for how to do this. 84 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Where to buy your prescription drugs ALERT!

If you use a non -network pharmacy or do not show your UMP member ID card at a network pharmacy, and the amount charged is more than the UMP discounted allowed amount, you will pay the difference in addition to your coinsu rance. If UMP is your primary insurance coverage, always show your UMP member ID card at the pharmacy to make sure you pay the right amount for your prescription. If UMP is your secondary insurance coverage, show both plan member ID cards at the pharmacy and make sure they know which plan pays first so the pharmacy may bill the plans in the correct order. Non-network pharmacies: Retail You will save money when you buy your prescriptions at network retail pharmacies and network mail - order pharmacies . You ma y buy your prescriptions (except specialty drugs) at a non -network retail 86 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage pharmacy, but you will pay more if you do. If you get your prescriptions filled at a non- network retail pharmacy, the following applies: You need to submit your claim to WSRxS for reimbursement (see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section ). You do not get the plan discount. You will pay the difference between the allowed amount and what the pharmacy charges, and it will not apply to your prescription drug out -of-pock et limit. The plan pays the allowed amount for prescription drugs covered by the plan, whether from a network or non -network retail pharmacy, under the coinsurance percentages as shown in the \"What you pay for prescription drugs\" section . The prescriptio n cost -limit (see the \"What you pay for prescription drugs\" section) does not apply. Non-network pharmacies will not know if a prescription drug must be preauthorized, has a quantity limit, or has other coverage limits. If you purchase a drug from a non -network pharmacy and limits apply, the plan may not cover or reimburse it. Prescriptions purchased from an excluded pharmacy will not be covered. See the definition of \"Excluded pharmacy.\" Specialty drugs must be purchased from the plan's network specialty d rug pharmacy . See the \"Specialty drug\" section on page 89. TIP: To submit claims for prescriptions purchased from non -network pharmacies (U.S. retail or internatio nal retail pharmacies), see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section. Prescription drugs purchased outside the U.S. If you purchase prescription drugs outside the U.S. for any reason, the following rules apply: If the prescription drug is available only by prescription in the U.S. but does not require one outside the U.S., the drug is covered only if prescribed by a provider practicing within their scope of practice. If you get a prescription drug that is approved for use in another country b ut not in the U.S., the plan will not cover it. If you get a prescription drug that is available over the counter in the U.S., the plan will not cover the drug, even if you have a prescription from a provider prescribing within their scope of practice. The plan does not cover most over-the-counter drugs . If you get a prescription drug that is not covered by UMP, the plan will not pay any amount of the cost of the drug. You will be responsible for the full cost of the drug. To submit a claim for a prescription drug purchased at retail pharmacies outside the U.S., see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section . All necessary information must be included on the prescription drug claim form with drugs and dosage documented. Limits on y our prescription drug coverage WSRxS may exclude, not cover, discontinue, or limit coverage for any prescription drug or manufacturer's version of a drug \u2014 or shift a drug to a different tier, or to noncovered or excluded status \u2014 for any of the following reasons: 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 87 A more cost -effective alternative is available to treat the same condition. A nonprescription alternative, including an over -the-counter alternative, becomes available. A prescription drug receives FDA approval for a new use. A prescription drug is purchased from an excluded pharmacy . Generic, biosimilar, interchangeable biosimilar, or follow -on biologic prescription drugs become available. New prescription drugs are developed. The FDA denies, withdraws, or limits the approval of a prescription drug. The FDA's Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) classifications finds a prescription drug to be less than effective. The Washington State P&T Committee or WSRxS recommends a change (see the \"How UMP decides which prescription drug s are preferred\" section ). There is a sound medical reason. There is lack of scientific evidence that a prescription drug is as safe and effective as existing drugs used to treat the same or similar conditions. There is new scientific evidence demonstrati ng a prescription drug has been found to be less safe or effective than existing drugs to treat the same or similar conditions. Using free prescription drug samples does not guarantee coverage or waive requirements for preauthorization, step therapy, quantity limits, day supply limits, or other limitations. Prescription drugs will only be covered if they are not excluded by the plan, are a covered prescription drug on the UMP Preferred Drug List, and are medically necessary for your health condition. Your provider may prescribe a prescription drug or drug dose that is not medically necessary. The plan excludes experimental or investigational prescription drugs. You may be liable for all charges if you receive prescription drugs or products that are determined to be experimental or investigational (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section). If you disagree with the plan's determination, you have the right to an appeal (see the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for that process). The limits and restrictions described in the \"Limits on your prescription drug coverage\" section help WSRxS monitor drug usage, safety, and costs. These limits and restrictions may be added or removed from prescription drugs at any time. You may find out if your prescription drug falls under any of these limits and restrictions by checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage or calling WSRxS Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information ). Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is a drug safety program that the FDA can require for certain prescription drugs with serious safety concerns to help make sure the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. REMS are designed to reinforce prescription drug use behaviors and actions that support the safe use of that drug. While all drugs have labeling that describe possible risks, only a few prescription drugs require a REMS. REMS are not designed to mitigate all the adverse events of a prescription drug. These are communicated to health care providers in the drug's prescribing information. Rather, REMS focuses on preventing, monitoring, and/or managing a specific serious risk by informing, educating, and/or reinforcing actions to reduce the frequency and/or severity of the event. If the REMS program is not followed, the plan may not cover the restricted drug. 88 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Preauthorizing prescription drugs Preauthorization is a process that helps make sure that prescription drug benefits are administered as designed and that plan members receive a drug therapy that is safe and effective for their conditions, and provides the greatest value. Some prescription drugs require preauthorization to determine wheth er they are medically necessary and meet all applicable coverage criteria, or the plan will not cover them. You may find out if your prescription drug requires preauthorization by calling WSRxS Customer Service or checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on th e UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage (see the Directory pages at the beginning of this booklet for links and contact information ). You and your prescribing provider may also find the coverage criteria for your prescription drug by referring to the Washington State Rx Services (Moda) preauthorization (UMP [SEBB] Plans) preauthorization requirements on forms and publications at hca.wa.gov/ump- forms -pubs . If your prescription drug requires preauthorization, your pharmacist or prescribing provider may initiate a request through CoverMyMeds, a free online platform that accepts requests from electronic health records, or directly through the CoverMyMeds Portal. To ge t started, your pharmacist or prescribing provider can go to the CoverMyMeds website. They may also call WSRxS Customer Service to request it. If you have an existing authorization from UMP for a brand -name drug, and a generic drug becomes available, you may need to renew your authorization to continue filling the brand -name drug. However, if you switch to the generic drug, a new preauthorization is not required until the existing authorization expires. Note: Prescription drugs covered under the medical be nefit rather than the prescription drug benefit have different rules for preauthorization. Call UMP Customer Service for details. Emergency fill Emergency fill lets you get a limited quantity of certain prescription drugs while the plan processes your preauthorization request. This option is only available when a delay could result in emergency care, hospital admission, or a serious threat to your health or others in contact with you. Call WSRxS Customer Service for questions about which prescriptions drugs may qualify for emergency fills. You must bring your prescription to a network pharmacy and state that you need an emergency fill while the plan processes your preauthorization request. You pay your coinsurance under the prescription drug's tier. The pla n will cover an emergency fill of up to a seven -day prescription drug supply. If your preauthorization request is denied, you will pay the full cost of the prescription drug for any quantity you receive after the emergency fill. Emergency fill limits The following limits still apply to emergency fill prescription drugs: Quantity limits: You cannot get more than the stated quantity limit under an emergency fill. If you have a current filled prescription for a prescription drug (or its therapeutic equivalent) and it was filled to the quantity limit, you cannot get an emergency fill until you have used 84 percent or more of the filled prescription. Refill too soon: If you have a filled prescription for a prescription drug (or its therapeutic equivalent), you cannot get an emergency fill until you have used 84 percent or more of the filled prescription. Quantity limits Certain prescription drugs have a per prescription limit on how much you get for each fill. If you need more than this limit allows, your pharmacist or prescribing provider may initiate a request through 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 89 CoverMyMeds on the CoverMyMeds website or call WSRxS Customer Service . See the Directory pages at the beginning of this booklet for links and contact information. If WSRxS denies your request or your provider or pharmacist does not get preauthorization, the plan will cover the prescription drug only up to the quantity limit amount. You will pay for any extra amount. Specialty drugs ALERT! Specialty drugs can be expensive. If you are not able to be home to receive the drug in the mail, it may be a good idea to request that it be sent with a requirement for a signature, or find an alternate point of delivery to ensure the package is not stole n. Specialty drugs are high -cost injectable, infused, oral, or inhaled prescription drugs or products that require special handling and storage and are subject to additional rules. You may find out if a drug is a specialty drug by checking the UMP Preferr ed Drug List on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage, or by calling WSRxS Customer Service. Specialty drugs are covered under the cost -share tier listed on the UMP Preferred Drug List. Specialty drugs are covered only when purchased through the plan's network specialty drug pharmacy. If that pharmacy does not have access to a specialty drug, you will be notified to fill your prescription at another specialty drug pharmacy. If the network specialty drug pharmacy gains access to the specialty drug, you will receive notification to transfer your prescription to that pharmacy. You may receive up to a 30 -day supply for most specialty prescription drugs per prescription or refill. However, some may be limited to a 15 -day supply due to high discontinuation ra te, short duration of use, or to make sure that the prescription drug is not causing harmful side effects. Specialty drugs require preauthorization. See \"Preauthorizing prescription drugs\" on page 88 for how to request preauthorization. A patient care coordinator will work with you to schedule a delivery time for the prescription drug. The specialty drug pharmacy will deliver your prescription drugs anywhere in the U .S. that you choose, such as to your workplace or to a neighbor if you cannot be home for the delivery. Specialty prescription drugs often require special handling and storage. The plan is not responsible for replacement of lost, stolen, expired, or damage d prescription drugs or products (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section ). If your provider will be administering the prescription drug, you may have it shipped to the provider's office. However, once the provider's office receives the prescription drug, the provider takes responsibility for it. The plan's network specialty drug pharmacy cannot ship outside the U.S. See \"Travel overrides for prescription drugs\" on page 91 if you will be traveling. Prescription cost -limit for specialty drugs ALERT! The prescription cost -limit is the most you will pay for an individual prescription. However, you may pay less based on normal coinsurance (see the \"What you pay for prescription drugs\" section ). 90 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage See the \"How the prescription drug cost-limit works\" section for details about the prescription cost- limit. This limit applies to individual prescriptions only. See the \"Your prescription drug out -of-pocket limit\" section for the annual limit to your prescription drug costs. Specialty drugs are usually limited to no more than a 30 -day supply. The prescription cost -limit for a 30-day (or under) supply corresponds to the \"You pay\" column in the table found in the \"How the prescription drug cost -limit works\" section . However, some specialty prescription drugs are available only in packages with more than a 30 -day supply. In such cases, the prescription cost- limit shown in the table found in the \"How the prescription drug cost -limit works\" section is calculated by multiplying the standard 30 -day prescription cost -limit amount as follows: A 31- to 60 -day supply, multiply the standard prescription cost- limit by two. A 61- day and greater supply, multiply the standard prescription cost-limit by three. Example: If your specialty drug is Tier 2 and you receive a 45 -day supply, the most you will pay (prescription cost- limit) is $150 (standard 30 -day limit $75 x 2=$150). Step therapy ALERT! If a Step 1 or Step 2 drug is approved for coverage by WSRxS, you will pay the applicable cost -share of that prescription drug according to its tier in the UMP Preferred Drug List. When a prescription drug is part of the step therapy program, you have to try certain drugs (Step 1) before the plan will cover the prescribed ( Step 2 ) drug. When a prescription for a step therapy drug is submitted \"out of order,\" meaning you have not first tried the Step 1 drug before submitting a prescription for a Step 2 drug, the plan will not cover your prescription. When this happens, your provider will need to prescribe the Step 1 drug for you. If you or your provider feels that you need the Step 2 prescription filled as originally written without first trying the Step 1 dr ug, your pharmacist or prescribing provider may call WSRxS Customer Service and request coverage. You will have to pay the entire cost of the prescription drug if you have not tried the Step 1 drug and coverage has not been authorized before you get the Step 2 drug. To find out if step therapy applies to your drug, check the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage , or call WSRxS Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information ). Note: Only network pharmacies will check to see if step therapy applies to your prescription drug. If you get a step therapy drug at a non -network pharmacy, the plan may not cover the drug. Substitution under Washington State law ALERT! New generic prescription drugs are released throughout the year. If you want to save money by using generics, ask your provider to allow substitution on your prescriptions, even if a generic drug is not available now. That way, when one becomes available, the pharmacist may automatically refill with the generic. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 91 When a brand -name or biologic prescription drug has a generic equivalent or interchangeable biosimilar, pharmacists in Washington State must substitute the generic equivalent or interchangeable bio similar drug for the brand -name or biologic prescription drug. When a generic equivalent for a brand -name prescription drug becomes available, the brand -name drug immediately becomes noncovered. Your provider may write the prescription \"dispense as written\" if they want you to get only the prescribed brand -name or biologic prescription drug. Or you may tell the pharmacist you want the brand -name or biologic drug. Regardless of whether you or your prescribing provider ask the pharmacist to \"dispense as written,\" if you get the noncovered prescription drug, the plan may not cover it. Final determination of medical necessity for FDA -approved contraceptives is determined by the attending prescribing provid er. To request an exception for a noncovered drug, see pa ge 82. Therapeutic Interchange Program The Washington State Therapeutic Interchange Program allows a pharmacist to substitute a \"therapeutic alternative\" drug for a noncovered drug in certain cases. Therapeutic alternatives are drugs that are chemically different from your prescribed drug but provide the same therapeutic benefit. You may find out if your prescription drug is affected by the Therapeutic Interchange Pr ogram by checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage or by calling WSRxS Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information ). The Therapeutic Interchange program does not af fect all noncovered prescription drugs. The pharmacist will substitute the preferred drug when your prescribing provider has \"endorsed\" the Washington Preferred Drug List, and: You are filling your prescription in Washington State or through UMP's network mail -order pharmacies . Your prescribing provider allows substitution on your prescription. If you do not want your prescription drug to be changed, the plan may not cover your drug if you ask the pharmacist to fill the prescription as written. Regardless o f whether you or your prescribing provider ask the pharmacist to \"dispense as written,\" if you get the noncovered prescription drug, the plan may not cover it. The pharmacy will contact your provider to request authorization for the substitution. If approv ed by the provider, you will receive the alternative preferred drug along with a letter of explanation. If the pharmacy cannot get an authorization from your provider within 48 hours, the prescription will be filled as written, and you will be charged the full price of the drug. Travel overrides for prescription drugs You may request a travel override to get an extra supply of prescription drugs for extended travel. All of the conditions listed below apply. You may request a travel override up to two weeks before your departure. You may request no more than two travel overrides per calendar year, including all travel within or outside the U.S. Within the U.S., you may request up to a 90 -day supply per prescription, or as allowed under that prescription. Outside the U.S., you may request up to a six- month supply per prescription, or as allowed under that prescription. Travel overrides will be granted only while you are covered by the plan. If your eligibility is ending, the plan does not cover prescription drugs past the time your enrollment in the plan ends. You will pay applicable charges (coinsurance) for each extra supply received. 92 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage To request a travel override, call WSRxS Customer Service . Refill too soon The plan will not cover a refill until 84 percent of the last prescription should be used up. Claims for therapeutic equivalents of the previously prescribed drug will also be denied. This also applies if your prescription is damaged, destroyed, lost, or s tolen. For example, if you get a 90 -day supply and you try to refill this prescription before 76 days have passed, coverage will be denied. However, in the event of an emergency or other urgent circumstance, you may request an exception to override the re fill too soon policy. The plan may require documentation to support your request. Approval of your request is at the sole discretion of the plan. Early refill for a natural disaster You may request an early refill for your prescription when you need to eva cuate for a natural disaster. To request an early refill or to locate pharmacies that remain open near you, call WSRxS Customer Service . What to do if the plan denies coverage TIP: If your prescription claims are denied by the pharmacy due to plan eligibility issues or termination of coverage, contact: Employees: Your employer's payroll or benefits office. SEBB Continuation Coverage: SEBB Program at 1 -800-200-1004 (TRS: 711). If a network pharmacy (including the mail- order or specialty drug pharmacy) tells you that preauthorization is required, coverage is denied, or quantities are limited, you, your pharmacist, or your prescribing provider may call WSRxS Customer Service to re quest a coverage review or preauthorization. If WSRxS denies the coverage request, you have the right to submit an appeal (see the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section ). If your provider thinks you need the prescription drug immediately, they may requ est an expedited review by submitting all clinically relevant information to the plan by phone or fax. An expedited appeal replaces the first and second level appeals. WSRxS will decide on coverage of the prescription drug within 72 hours of the request. I n this case, you may choose to purchase a three -day supply at your own expense. Prescription drugs and products UMP does not cover Prescription drugs and products not covered under the prescription drug benefit include, but are not limited to, noncovered prescription drugs and excluded drugs and products . Noncovered prescription drugs Noncovered prescription drugs without a UMP Preferred Drug List exception authorization For more information see the \"Noncovered prescription drugs\" section on page 75 . Excluded drugs and products Dental preparations, such as rinses and pastes Dietary/food supplements, vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements, and medical foods Experime ntal or investigational prescription drugs Homeopathic drugs, including FDA -approved prescription products 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 93 Over -the-counter drugs, products containing an over -the- counter drug, or prescription drugs that have a nonprescription alternative, except for the d rugs specified under \"Exceptions covered\" on page 77, or otherwise listed on the UMP Preferred Drug List . Note: Prescription drugs with a nonprescription alternative \u2014 including an over -the-counter alternative having similar safety, efficacy, and ingredients \u2014 are excluded. Over -the-counter products not approved by and registered with the FDA Prescription drug cost s covered by other insurance (s ee page 109 for coordination with other plans ) Prescription drugs not approved by the FDA Prescription drugs provided to a member , in whole or in part, while the member is admitted to an inpatient facility. Drugs provided in an inpatient setting are covered under the medical benefit. Prescription drugs that are not medically necessary Prescription drugs that are repackaged Prescription drugs that the FDA's DESI classifications have found to be less than effective Prescription drugs under a REMS program required by the FDA when prescribed outside REMS guidelines (see page 87 for details) Most p roducts considered as a medical device by the FDA. Medical devices may be covered under your medical benefit The plan also excludes prescription drugs to treat conditions that are not covered under t he medical benefit. These include, but are not limited to, prescription drugs for: Cosmetic purposes. Fertility or infertility. Obesity (or weight loss). Promoting hair growth. Sexual dysfunction. ALERT! Prescription drugs clas sified as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have over -the-counter alternatives and are not covered for persons ages 18 and over. The plan does cover PPIs for persons under age 18 when prescribed, because the available over -the-counter alternatives are not appr oved for persons under age 18. Limits on plan coverage If you receive a service that is not medically necessary, is experimental or investigational, is listed as an exclusion in the \"What the plan does not cover\" section, or is listed as a noncovered or ex cluded prescription drug, you are responsible for paying all associated charges. Preauthorizing medical services ALERT! This section does not apply to prescription drugs. See page 88 for how to request preauthorization of drugs covered under the prescription drug benefit. 94 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage The plan must preauthorize some medical services and supplies to determine whether the service or supply meets the plan's medical necessity criteria to be covered. The fact that a service or supply is prescribed or furnished by a provider does not, by itse lf, make it a medically necessary covered service . Preauthorization is not a guarantee of coverage. A change after the plan has approved a preauthorization request \u2014 including, but not limited to, a change of provider or different/additional services \u2014 requires your provider to submit a new preauthorization request and for the plan to approve it. Your preauthorization role ALERT! Excluded, experimental, and investigational services do not require a preauthorization because they are not covered by the plan . To confirm whether a service is covered, call UMP Customer Service. To be covered, some services, including, but not limited to, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy for members ages 18 and older (see page 41) and bariatric surgery (see page 41), must be preauthorized before services are received. A network provider may be required to request preauthorization before providing services. An out -of-network provider is not obligated to obtain prior authorization for services that require a preauthorization because they do not have a contract with Regence. If an out -of-network provider does not obtain a required preauthorization in advance of the service, you will be responsible for all charges billed to you. You are encouraged to request that an out -of-network provider preauthorize certain services on your behalf to determine medical necessity before the services are provided. They have the clinical details and technical billing information needed to submit a request. Call UMP Customer Service to ask if a service requires preauthorization and how to submit a request. You may b e liable for all charges if you receive services that are determined to be not medically necessary, experimental or investigational, or not covered under this plan (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section). ALERT! See the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for how to appeal denial of a preauthorization request before receiving services. List of services and supplies requiring preauthorization or notice For a list of services and supplies requiring preauthorization or notice: Visit the UMP Poli cies that affect your care webpage . Call UMP Customer Service to request a printed list or ask questions. See the Directory pages at the beginning of this booklet for links and contact information. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 95 ALERT! The UMP preauthorizat ion list is updated throughout the year. You may find a link to the current list of services that require preauthorization on the UMP Policies that affect your care webpage or call UMP Customer Service to determine if services require preauthorization or notice. The fact that a service does not require preauthorization or notice does not guarantee coverage. Notice for facility admissions Your provider must notify the plan upon your admission to a facility for services requiring plan notice. You may find a l ist of services requiring plan notice by visiting the UMP Policies that affect your care webpage or calling UMP Customer Service. Facility admissions for which the plan is not notified may not be covered. Notice is usually done by the facility at the time you are admitted. Notice is not the same as preauthorization and many services require both. What is the difference between preauthorization and notice? ALERT! Many services, including, but not limited to, inpatient services, require both preauthorization and notice. Call UMP Customer Service or talk to your provider if you have questions about services needing preauthorization or notice. \"Preauthorization\" is when your provider sends a request for coverage of a service on the UMP preauthorization list . Preauthorization is usually requested by the provider performing the services. The plan sends either an approval or denial of coverage. If the plan does not approve services that require preauthorization before services are received, the plan may deny covera ge. The plan does not approve or deny preauthorization for services that are not on the UMP preauthorization list. \"Notice\" means that your provider must contact the plan to let us know when you receive services. Notice is usually done by the facility whe n you are admitted. ALERT! If the plan denies preauthorization and you receive those services anyway, you are responsible for the provider's entire billed charge . How long the plan has to make a decision You will be notified in writing within 15 calendar days of the plan receiving the preauthorization request whether the request has been approved, denied, or if more information is needed to make a decision. If additional information is requested: You are allowed up to 45 calendar days from the date on the letter to submit the information requested. You will be notified in writing of the decision within 15 calendar days from either the plan receiving the additional requested information or the end of th e 45-day period if no additional information is received. 96 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage If you or your provider believes that waiting for a decision under the standard time frame could place your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function in serious danger, your provider shoul d notify the plan by phone or fax as a shorter time limit may apply. This is also known as an expedited preauthorization request. Regence BlueShield will decide on your expedited preauthorization request within 72 hours of receipt. General information from UMP Customer Service For services not requiring preauthorization, you may call UMP Customer Service to ask if a particular service is generally covered by the plan, and for an estimate of how much you will pay. The plan does not approve or deny preauthorization for services that are not on the UMP preauthorization list. Until a claim is submitted and reviewed, the plan cannot guarantee that your service will be covered or give you an exact amount you will pay out of pocket. This is because when a provider bills for a service, the plan pays for it based on procedure codes. Each code describes a service in some detail, and there are many codes for similar -sounding services. Your provider, not the plan, determines which of these codes is used on the submitted claim. Alternative benefits Alternative benefits mean benefits for services or supplies that are not otherwise covered as specified in this COC, but for which the plan may approve coverage after case management evaluation. The plan may cover alternative benefits through case management (see the \"Ca re management\" benefit ) if the plan determines that alternative benefits are medically necessary and will result in overall reduced covered costs and improved quality of care. Before alternative benefits will be covered, the plan, you (or your legal representative), and, if required by the plan, your physician or other provider, must enter into a written agreement of the terms and conditions for payment. Alternative benefits are approved on a case -specific basis o nly. Approval of an alternative benefit applies to only the services and member listed in the written agreement. The rest of this COC remains in effect. What the plan does not cover TIP: If you have any questions about services the plan does not cover, cal l UMP Customer Service or WSRxS Customer Service. This plan covers only the services and conditions specifically identified in this COC. Unless a service or condition fits into one of the specific benefit definitions, it is not covered. You may pay all costs associated with a noncovered service. Here are some examples of common services and conditions that are not covered. Many others are also not covered \u2014 these are examples only, not a complete list. These examples are called exclusions, meaning these services are not covered, even if the services are medically necessary. 1. Activity therapy. The following activity therapy services include, but are not limited to: Aroma; Creative arts; Dance; Equine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 97 Music; Play; Recreational or similar therapy; and Sensory movement groups. 2.

Workers' compensation: When a claim for workers' compensation is accepted, all services related to that injury or illness are not covered, even if some services are denied by workers' compensation If you have questions about whether a certain service or supply is covered, call UMP Customer Service. If you have other medical coverage Coordination of benefits Coordination of benefits (COB) happens when you have health coverage through two or more groups (such as your employer and your spouse's employer), and these two group health plans both pay a portion of your health care claims. The rules beginning under the \"Who pays first\" section determine which plan pays first (primary payer) and which pays second (secondary payer). See page 108 for a description of how the plan coordinates benefits when it pays second. The plan processes claims differently depending on if it is the primary payer or the secondary payer. The differences are described in the next several pages. TIP: If you have other health coverage, it is important that you let your providers know, including the pharmacies where you get your prescription drugs. 106 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Contact UMP and WSRxS If you or your dependents have other insurance, you must let UMP and WSRxS know so claims are processed correctly. To do this, you must complete and submit a separate form for medical services and prescription drugs. Each person claiming payment for benefits under the plan is required to give Regence and WSRxS any facts needed to apply these COB rules. If your coverage under other plans c hanges, you must let UMP and WSRxS know so claims are processed correctly. See the Directory pages at the beginning of this booklet for contact information and ways to get and submit COB forms . Who pays first Note: If you cannot determine which plan pays first, call UMP Customer Service. Alert: Medicare will be the primary payer for covered benefits provided to Medicare-eligible members who are enrolled in UMP as a dependent of a currently employed state-registered domestic partner. Medicare will remain the secondary payer for benefits payable under UMP for (1) individuals age 65 or over who have UMP as a result of their own current employee status, or (2) individuals age 65 or over who have UMP as a result of the cu rrent employment status of a spouse of any age. When UMP coordinates benefits with other plans, the following rules determine which plan pays first. These rules apply in order, so the first rule below that applies to your situation will determine which pla n is your primary coverage, and subsequent rules will not apply. The following plan pays first: Any group plan that does not coordinate benefits. The plan that covers the member as a subscriber, not a dependent. Exception: When the subscriber is a Medicare beneficiary, the plan covering the person as the retiree is secondary to the plan covering the person as a dependent. The plan that covers the member (or their spouse or state -registered domestic partner) as an active employee pays before a plan that covers the member as a retired employee. A plan covering the member as an employee, subscriber, retiree, or the dependent of such an employee, subscriber, or retiree will pay before a COBRA or a state right of continuation plan. If the other plan is Medic are, UMP pays first if the member is age 65 or over who have UMP as a result of their own active employee status or the active employee status of a spouse of any age. Note: Medicare benefits are primary to UMP for members who are enrolled in UMP as a dep endent of a currently employed state -registered domestic partner. The plan that has covered the member (or their spouse or state -registered domestic partner) as a subscriber the longest, if there are two plans and the first five bullets do not determine which plan pays first. If none of the preceding rules determines the order of benefits, the allowable expenses must be shared equally between the plans. For dependent children A group plan is usually primary over Medicaid programs that cover children. If a dependent child has group coverage through their employer, the child's coverage pays first. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 107 Dependent children of married parents The group plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year pays first. For example, the plan of a parent born April 14 is primary over the plan of a parent born August 21. This is called the \"birthday rule.\" This rule looks only at the month and day, not the year. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered either parent the longest is primar y. Exception for newborn children Under Washington State law, the plan must cover newborns under the mother's coverage for the first 21 days of life. Therefore, the mother's plan pays first for covered charges during the first 21 days of a newborn's life. Dependent children of legally separated or divorced parents When no court order specifies which parent is responsible for providing health insurance coverage, the following standard COB rules determine which plan pays first: 1. The plan of the custodial paren t. 2. The plan of the custodial parent's spouse, if the custodial parent has remarried. 3. The plan of the non- custodial parent. 4. The plan of the non- custodial parent's spouse, if the non- custodial parent has remarried. The custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year, excluding any temporary visitation. The birthday rule is used to determine which parent's plan pays first if: The court order states that both parents are responsible for the child's/children's health coverage and expenses. The court order awards joint custody without specifying that one parent is responsible for the child's/children's health coverage and expense s. If the court order states one parent is to assume primary financial responsibility for the child but does not specify that one parent is responsible for health coverage and health care expenses, the plan of the parent assuming financial responsibility is the primary payer. In some cases, a court order determines payment for health care expenses. In those cases, standard COB rules may not apply. You must promptly provide the plan with copies of the court order for the plan to determine which plan pays fir st. If a dependent child is covered under more than one plan through persons who are not the child's parent or stepparent (e.g., a grandparent or other guardian), the plan will use the birthday rule to determine which plan pays first. If none of the preceding rules determine who pays first, then each plan covers half of the allowed expenses. Federal and military plans UMP usually pays first over certain federal or military programs for veterans (retired military members). When UMP pays first When the plan i s the primary payer (pays first), UMP pays its normal benefit as described in this COC. You may need to send UMP's Explanation of Benefits and a copy of your provider's bill to your secondary payer to receive payment. Check with that plan for more informat ion. 108 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage When UMP is supposed to pay first, but another plan did instead If another plan pays first on claims where UMP should have paid first: UMP may pay the other plan the amount UMP should have paid. Amounts UMP pays to the other plan are considered benefits paid by UMP. How UMP coordinates benefits when it pays second UMP uses a type of COB called nonduplication of benefits ( see definition of \"Nonduplication of benefits\" ). When UMP pays second to another plan that covers the member, UMP wi ll pay only an amount needed to bring the total benefit up to the amount UMP would have paid if the member did not have another plan. The intent of this type of COB is to maintain the level of benefits available through UMP. The nonduplication of benefits type of coordination is not designed to pay your covered expenses in full. When UMP pays second, it coordinates with these types of plans: Governmental programs including, but not limited to, Medicare and Medicaid. Group, blanket, or franchise health or d isability insurance policies; health care service contractor and health maintenance organization group agreements issued by insurers; health care service contractors; and health maintenance organizations. Labor management trusteed plans, labor organization plans, employer plans, or employee benefit organization plans. ALERT! If you have other primary coverage that pays for services, those services will apply to the UMP benefit limit. How much you may pay when UMP pays second When you see network providers under UMP, you will owe only the balance of the UMP allowed amount after your primary plan and UMP pay benefits for covered services. Your cost will usually be higher if you see out -of-network providers. See the \"Sample payments to different provider types \" section on page on page 21 for examples. The examples in the table below assume that you have met your medical deductible. Situation Example Network provider charge UMP allowed amount UMP normal benefit Other plan pays UMP pays You pay your provider UMP is primary, other plan is secondary EXAMPLE 1: When UMP pays first (or is the only plan) $200 $100 $85 (85% of $100) N/A $85 $15 UMP is secondary, other plan is primary EXAMPLE 2: The other plan pays less than the normal UMP benefit $200 $100 $85 ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 109 Situation Example Network provider charge UMP allowed amount UMP normal benefit Other plan pays UMP pays You pay your provider UMP is secondary, other plan is primary EXAMPLE 3: The other plan pays as much as (or more than) the normal UMP benefit $200 $100 $85 $85 $0 $15 Contact UMP Customer Service for help with any questions if you are covered by more than one plan. Submit secondary claims promptly All health plans have a \"timely submitting \" deadline. The timely submitting deadline for UMP is 12 months from the date of service. If a claim is not submitted within the plan's timely submitting deadline, UMP will deny it. If your primary plan delays payment on a claim, you must still submit to UMP within the submitting deadline to prevent denial of the claim. UMP may try to contact your primary plan for their benefit payment information or may estimate it to provide timely processing of your secondary benefit. Adjustments may be made when the primary plan pays their portion of your claim. Notifying your providers of any change to your coverage will help avoid errors and de lays in processing of claims (see the \" Billing and payment: submitting a claim\" section ). How diabetes care supplies are covered when UMP pays second UMP covers diabetes care supplies under the prescription drug benefit. If you get your supplies from a pharmacy, ask if the pharmacy can bill both your primary plan and UMP. If your pharmacy does, you do not need to do anything further. If not, you will need to send a claim to WSRxS for secondary payment (see the \" Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for instructions). If you get your supplies from a diabetes care supplier, the primary plan may process the claim as medical. In this case, you need to send your Explanation of Benefits and a claim form to WSRxS for secondary payment (see the \" Submitting a claim for prescription drugs \" and the \"False claims or statements\" sections for instructions). Note: Nonduplication of benefits applies to these claims, which means that UMP may pay nothing after your primary plan pays. See the \"Diabetes care supplie s\" benefit for more information . ALERT! You must submit secondary claims for diabetes care supplies to WSRxS. Regence BlueShield will deny these claims. How COB works with prescription drugs Some of the limits and restrictions to prescription drug coverage listed in the \" Limits on your prescription drug coverage \" section will apply when UMP pays second to another plan. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for how to submit your prescription drug claim. Nonduplication of benefits applies when UMP pays second to another plan. This means that UMP may pay nothing after your primary plan pays. 110 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Using network pharmacies when UMP is secondary If you have primary coverage through another plan that covers prescription drugs, show both plan member ID cards to the pharmacy and make sure they know which plan pays first and which plan pays second. It is important that the pharmacy bills the plans in the correct order, or claims may be denied or paid incorrectly. Using mail -order pharmacies when UMP is secondary If your primary plan also uses one of UMP's network mail -order pharm acies as the plan's network - order pharmacy, UMP's network mail -order pharm acies may process payments for both plans and charge you only the remainder. Make sure that UMP's network mail -order pharm acies have the information for both plans and know which plan is primary. However , if your primary plan uses a different mail -order pharmacy, you will have to use your primary plan's mail -order pharmacy, then submit a paper claim to UMP. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for how to do this. Billing and payment : submitting a claim Submitting a claim for medical services When UMP is your primary insurance and your provider is a network provider, you do not need to submit claims. The provider will do it for you. If you have a question about whether your provider' s office has submitted a claim, sign in to your Regence account or call UMP Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information) . See the \"Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core claim\" section on page 26 for instructions on submitting a claim for services received outside of the United States. TIP: In the following section, Uniform Medical Plan (UMP) refers to the administrative functions for submitting claims to UMP. Regence BlueShield handles medical claims, and WSRxS handles prescription drugs claims. When you need to submit a claim You may need to submit a claim to UMP for payment if: You receive services from an out -of-network provider. You have other insurance that pays first and UMP is secondary. Out- of-network providers may submit a claim on your behalf. Ask your provider. How to submit a cl aim To submit a claim yourself, you may sign in to your Regence account and go to the Submit claim webpage at regence.com/member/submit -claim/ or you may complete a medical claim form and mail the following documents: UMP (Regence) Medical Claim Form \u2014 You may find the for m by visiting forms and publications at hca.wa.gov/ump -forms -pubs or you may request a form by calling UMP Customer Service . An itemized bill from your provider that describes the services you received and the charges. The following information must appear on the provider's itemized bill for the plan to consider the claim for payment: 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 111 Member's name and member ID number, including the alpha prefix (three letters and the 'W' before member ID number) Procedure and diagnosis code(s) or description of the injury or illness Date and type of service Provider's name, address, phone number , and National Provider Identifier (NPI) or Tax ID number For ambulance claims, also include the ZIP code of where the member was picked up and where they were taken If UMP is secondary, you must include a copy of your primary plan's Explanation of Benefits, which lists the services covered and how much the other plan paid. You should wait until the primary plan has paid to submit a secondary claim to UMP, unless the primary plan's processing of the claim is delayed. Claims not submitted to UMP within 12 months of the date of service will not be paid. If we must request additional information, the processing of your claim may be delayed. Note: Be sure to make copies of your documents for your records. Mail both the claim form and the provider's claim document (or bill) to: Regence BlueShield PO Box 1106 Lewiston, 83501- 1106 Or you can fax documents to Regence at 1 -877-357-3418. The plan may send reimbursement for services received from an out -of-network provider to the provider or to you in the form of a check listing both you and the prov ider as payees. If you paid up front for services, proof of payment may be required. Call UMP Customer Service if you have a question about the processing of your claim or for information on what is acceptable as proof of payment. Important information about submitting claims ALERT! You or your provider must submit claims within 12 months of the date you received health care services. This is called the \"timely submitting \" deadline. The plan will not pay claims submitted more than 12 months after the date of service. See \"Submit secondary claims promptly\" on page 109 for how this wor ks when you have other coverage that pays first. For information about submitting claims for services outside of the U.S., call UMP Customer Service. You may have to pay services upfront and submit a claim for reimbursement. If you have other health care c overage, see the \"If you have other medical coverage\" section for information on how the plan coordinates benefits with other plans. Services apply to the UMP medical deductible in the order claims are received, not necessarily in the order the member receives services. Claims reimbursement Most of the time, the plan will pay network providers directly. For claims submitted by you or an out -of- network provider, the plan will determine whether to pay you, the provider, or both. For a child covered by a legal qualified medical child support order (see page 106) the plan may pay the child's custodial parent or legal guardian. 112 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Claims determinations The plan will notify you of action taken on a claim within 30 days of the plan receiving it. This 30 -day period may be extended by 15 days when action cannot be taken on the claim due to: Circumstances beyond the plan's control. Notice will include an explanation why an extension is needed and when the plan expects to act on the claim. Lack of information. The plan will notify you within the 30 -day period that an extension is necessary, with a description of the information needed and why it is needed. Submitting a claim for prescription drugs You may need to submit your own prescription drug claim to WSRxS for reimbursement if you: Buy prescription drugs at a non -network retail pharmacy. Fail to show your UMP member ID card at a network pharmacy. Have other prescription coverage that pays first, and UMP is secondary. TIP: If you get a vaccine from an out- of-network provider, make sure that you submit your claim to Regence BlueShield as a medical claim (see the \" Submitting a claim for medical services \" section ).

Send the completed claim form, along with your pharmac y receipt(s), to: Pharmacy Manual Claims PO Box 999 Appleton, WI 54912- 0999 It is a good idea to keep copies of all your paperwork for your records. When you submit a prescription drug claim to WSRxS, the plan pays the claim based on the following rules, no matter where you purchased the drug: The plan pays based on the allowed amount. If the pharmacy charges you more than the allowed amount, you will pay your usual coinsurance, plus the difference between what the plan paid and the pharmacy's charge. The p lan pays all prescription drug claims, including non -network retail pharmacies, based on the drug's tier coinsurance (see the \" What you pay for prescription drugs\" section). If your claim exceeds the quantity limit or the maximum days' supply allowed by th e plan, the plan will pay only for the amount of the prescription drug up to the quantity limit or maximum days' supply. If you receive a refill before 84 percent of the last supply you received should have been taken, the plan will not pay for it. This is called a \"refill too soon\" (see page 92). You must submit prescription drug claims within 12 months of purchase. The plan will not pay claims for prescription drugs submitted more than 12 months after purchase or prescription drugs purchased from an excluded pharmacy. See the definition of \"Excluded pharmacy .\" 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 113 ALERT! If you do not show your UMP member ID card when purchasing a prescription at a WSRxS' network pharmacy, you will have to pay the full cash price and submit a Prescription Drug Claim Form. You will not receive the plan discount. False claims or statements Neither you nor your provider (or any person acting for you or your provider) may submit a claim for services or supplies that were not received, were resold to another party, or for which you are not expected to pay. In addition, neither you nor any person acting for you may make any false or incomplete statements or any false claims on any documen t for your plan coverage. The plan may recover any payments or overpayments made because of a false claim or false statement by withholding future claim payments, by suing you, or by other means. False claims may also be crimes. If you represent yourself a s being enrolled in this plan when you are not, the plan will deny all claims. If the plan asks you for more information, you will be allowed at least 45 days to provide it. If the plan does not receive the information requested within the time allowed, the plan will deny the claim. Complaint and appeal procedures ALERT! In the following section, UMP refers to the administrative functions for appeals for UMP Plus. Regence BlueShield handles medical appeals and WSRxS handles appeals involving prescription dr ugs. Appeals procedures may change during the year if required by federal or Washington State law. What is a complaint or grievance? A complaint or grievance is an oral statement or written document submitted by or on behalf of a member regarding: Dissatisfaction with medical care. Dissatisfaction with service provided by the health plan. Provider or staff attitude or demeanor. Waiting time for medical services. Note: If your issue is regarding a denial, reduction, or termination of payment or nonprovision of medical services, it is an appeal. How to submit a complaint or grievance For all medical complaints or grievances, it's recommended that you first call UMP Customer Service. For prescription drug complaints or grievances, we recommend calling W SRxS Customer Service . Many issues 114 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage may be resolved with a phone call. If an initial phone call does not resolve your complaint or grievance, you may submit your complaint or grievance: Over the phone: If you want a written response, you must request one. By mail, fax, or email (see the \"Where to send complaints or appeals \" section below). You will receive notice of the action on your complaint or grievance within 30 calendar days of our receiving it. The plan will notify you if it needs more time to respond . What is an appeal? An appeal is an oral or written request submitted by you or your authorized representative to Regence BlueShield or WSRxS to reconsider: A decision to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate payment, coverage, certification, or provision o f health care services or benefits, including the admission to, or continued stay in, a health care facility. A preauthorization. A retroactive decision to deny coverage based on eligibility (see the \"Appeals related to eligibility\" section below). Claims payment, processing, or reimbursement for health care services or supplies. The appeals process ALERT! If your appeal is for an urgent or life -threatening condition, see the \"Expedited appeals process \" section below. You or someone you authorize to repres ent you (see \"How to designate an authorized representative\" on page 124) may submit an appeal. There are three levels to the appeals process: 1. First-level appeal 2. Second -level appeal 3. External review (independent review) Each of those parts are described in further detail below. Coverage during each review If your request involves a decision to change, reduce, or terminate coverage for services, supplies, or prescription drugs already being covered, the plan must continue to cover the disputed service until the outcome of the review. If the plan upholds the decision to change, reduce, or terminate coverage, you will be responsible for the cost of the services received during the review period. If you request payment for denied claims or approval of services, supplies, or prescription drugs not yet covered by the plan, the plan will not cover the services, supplies, or prescription drugs while the appeal is under consideration. First-level and second -level appeal reviewers Claim processing disputes will be reviewed by administrative staff. The plan will consult with a health care professional employed by Regence BlueShield on medical appeals, or with a health care professional employed by Washington State Rx Services on prescription drug appeals, when appeals involve issues requiring medical judgment about cov ering, authorizing, or providing health care. That includes decisions based on determinations that a treatment, prescription drug, or other item is experimental, 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 115 investigational, or not medically necessary. Your appeal will be reviewed by Regence BlueShield or Washington State Rx Services employees who have not been involved in, or subordinate to anyone involved in, reviewing the previous decisions. How to submit an appeal You or your authorized representative (including a relative, friend, advocate, attor ney, or provider) may submit an appeal by using the methods described below in the \"Where to send complaints or appeals\" section. You may authorize a representative to submit an appeal on your behalf in writing or by calling UMP Customer Service (medical appeals) or WSRxS Customer Service (prescription drug appeals). For each appeal request, you must appeal within 180 days of receiving the plan's decision. You may include written comments, documents, and any other information, such as medical records and l etters from your provider, to support your appeal request. The plan will consider all information submitted when reviewing your appeal. You may also request copies of documents the plan has that are relevant to your appeal, which the plan will provide at n o cost to you. The plan will mail you a written response within 14 days of receiving your appeal request. If more time is needed to thoroughly research and review your appeal, the plan is allowed up to 30 days to respond. The plan will ask your permission if it needs more time to respond.

First-level appeals You or your authorized representative may submit a first- level appeal no more than 180 days after you receive the plan's decision. If you do not submit an appeal within this time, your appeal will not be reviewed, and you will not be able to continue further appeals (second -level and external review).

A staff of health care professionals at Regence BlueShield or WSRxS evaluate appeals that involve issues requiring medical judgment about covering, authorizing, or providing health care. ALERT! Deadlines for submitting an appeal are based on the first date you are notified of how a claim was processed, usually when you receive you an Explanation of Benefits (including services that applied to the deductible or were denied). The plan does not waive deadlines based on untimely billing by your provider. Second -level appeals If you disagree with the decision made on your first- level appeal, you or your authorized representative may submit a second -level appeal.

Expedited appeals process Expedited appeals for medical services You or your authorized representative may submit an expedited appeal within 180 days of receiving the previous decision if: You are currently receiving or prescribed treatment or benefits that would end because of the denial; or Your provider determines that tak ing the usual time allowed could seriously affect your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function, or would subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the disputed care or treatment; or The issue is related to admission, availability of care, continued stay, or emergency health care services and you have not been discharged from the emergency room or transport service. You may authorize a representative to submit an expedited appeal on your behalf in writing or by calling UMP Customer Service. An expedited appeal replaces both the first - and second -level appeals.

Your provider must submit all clinically relevant information to the plan by phone or fax at: Phone: 1-888-849-3682 (TRS: 711) Fax: 1-877-663-7526 If you disagree with the expedited appeal decision, your provider may request an expedited external review (see the \"External review (independent review)\" section below). 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 117 Expedited appeals for prescription drugs You or your authorized representative may submit an expedited appeal within 180 days of receiving the previous decision if you or your provider thinks you need a prescription drug immediately.

If WSRxS decides not to cover the prescription drug (denies the appeal), you are responsible for the full cost of the drug. If you disagree with the expedited appeal decision, you or your provider may request an expedited external review (see the \"External review (independent review)\" section below). Time limits for the plan to decide appeals ALERT! The plan will comply with shorter time limits than those below when required by federal or Washington State law. The time limits for both first - and second -level appeals are calculated from when the plan receives the appeal. The plan will decide your appeal within 14 days of receiving it but may take up to 30 days unless a different time limit applies as explained below. The plan will request written permission from you or your authorized representative if an extension to the 30 -day time limit is needed to get medical records or a second opinion. For expedited appeals, the plan will decide as soon as possible but always within 72 hours. The plan will notify you (or your authorized representative) of the decision verbally within 72 hours and will mail a written notice within 72 hours of the decision. External review (independent review) You or your authorized representative may submit a request for an external review by an independent review organization (IRO) if you have gone through both a first - and second -level appea l (or expedited appeal) and your appeal was based on the plan's decision to deny, modify, reduce, or terminate coverage of or payment for a health care service. You may also submit a request for an external review: If the plan has exceeded the timelines for response to your appeal without good cause and without reaching a decision; or If the plan has failed to adhere to the requirements of the appeals process. You may submit a request for an expedited external review if you meet the requirements for the expedited process as described above. You may also request an expedited external review at the same 118 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage time that you request an expedited appeal, called concurrent expedited review. When you request concurrent expedited review, you are not required to go through both a first - and second -level appeal. An IRO will conduct the external review. An IRO is a group of medical and benefit experts certified by the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner and not related to the plan, Regence BlueShield, WSR xS, or HCA. An external review provides unbiased, independent clinical and benefit expertise to determine whether the plan's decision is consistent with state law and the 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage. Requesting an external review To request an external review, see the contact information listed in the \"Where to send complaints or appeals \" section below .

Additional legal options You are required to exhaust the plan's appeals process before you may bring a cause of action in court against the plan or HCA. If an IRO reviews your appeal, their decision is binding on both the plan and you except to the extent that other remedies are available under state or federal law. If the IRO overturns the plan's decision the plan will provide benefits (including making payment on the claim) according to the IRO's decision without delay, regardless of whether the plan intends to seek judicial review of the IRO's decision and unless and until there is a judicial decision otherwise.

The plan may choose to recover expenses directly from the third party (or third party's insurer) responsible for your injury or illness. This is called subrogation . The plan is authorized, but not obligated, to recover any expenses, to the extent that they were paid under the plan, directly from any party liable to you, upon mailing of a written notice to the potential payer, to you, or to your representative. The plan's rights apply without regard to the source of payme nt for medical expenses, whether from the proceeds of any settlement, arbitration award, or judgment, or other characterization of the recovery by you or any third party or the recovery source. The plan is entitled to reimbursement from the first dollar received from any recovery to the extent that the settlement or recovery exceeds full compensation to you for the injury or illness that you sustained.

If you or your agent or attorney fail to comply during the course of the case, we may request refunds from the providers or offset future benefits. You will not do anything to prejudice the plan's rights and that you will cooperate fully with the plan, including signing any documents within the required time and providing prompt notice of any settlement or other recovery. You must notify the plan of any facts that may impact the right to reimbursement or subrogation, including, but not necessarily limited to, the following: The filing of a lawsuit; The making of a claim against any third party; Scheduling of settlement negotiations with a minimum of 21 days advance notice of the date, time, location and participants to be involved in any settlement conferences or mediations); or Intent of a third party to make payment of any kind to your benefit or on your behalf and that in any manner relates to the injury or illness that gives rise to the plan's right of reimbursement or subrogation (notice is required a minimum of five business days before the settlement).

Any benefits prov ided or advanced under the plan are provided or advanced solely to assist you. By paying such benefits, the plan is not waiving any right to reimbursement or subrogation. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 121 Fees and expenses You may incur attorney's fees and costs in connection with obtainin g a recovery.

Motor vehicle cove rage If you are involved in a motor vehicle accident, whether as a driver, passenger, pedestrian, or other capacity, you may have rights under multiple motor vehicle insurance no fault coverages and also against a third party who may be responsible for the accident. In that case, this right of reimbursement and subrogation provision still applies. Future medical expenses Benefits for otherwise covered services may be excluded as follows: When you have received a recovery from another source relating to an i llness or injury for services for which we normally would provide benefits.

Changes to health plan coverage or enrollment as described above in A through C will begin the first day of the month following receipt of the NMSN. If the NMSN is received on the first day of the month, the change to health plan coverage or enrollment begins on that day. A dependent will be removed from the subscriber's health plan coverage as described above in D the last day of the month the NMSN is received. If that day is the first of the month, the change in enrollment will be made the last day of the previous month.

A school employee or their dependent who is enrolled in Medicare may remain enrolled in SEBB medical coverage. However, a school employee may choose to waive their SEBB medical coverage or remove their dependent from their SEBB medical coverage and choose Medicare as their primary insurer. If a school employee does so, neither the school employee nor their dependent can enroll in SEBB medical except during the annual open enrollment or a special open enroll ment. In most situations, a school employee and their dependent can defer Medicare Part B enrollment without a penalty while enrolled in SEBB medical coverage. When the school employee terminates employment, the school employee and the dependent can enroll in Medicare Part B during a Special Enrollment Period. 132 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage If Medicare eligibility is due to a disability, the school employee or their dependent must contact the Social Security Administration about deferring enrollment in Medicare Part B .

If a subscriber or their dependent enrolls in SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) and then becomes eligible for Medicare, their enrollment in SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) will be terminated at the end of the month in which they become eligible for Medicare due to turning age 65 or older or when enrolled in Medicare due to a disability. This may cause the SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) to be terminated early, before the subscriber has used all the months they would otherwise be entitled to. A subscriber or their dependent who are alr eady enrolled in Medicare when they enroll in SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) will not have their coverage terminated early.

Note: If the SEBB organization deducted the school employee's portion of the premium for SEBB insurance coverage after the school employee was no longer eligible for the employer contribution, medical coverage en ds the last day of the month for which school employee premiums were deducted. For a continuation coverage subscriber who submits a written request to terminate medical coverage, enrollment in medical coverage will be terminated the last day of the month in which the SEBB Program receives the request or on the last day of the month specified in the termination request, whichever is later. If the request is received on the first day of the month, medical coverage will be terminated on the last day of the previous month. A subscriber will be responsible for payment of any services received after the date medical coverage ends as described above. Final premium payments Premium payments and applicable premium surcharges are not prorated during any month, for any reason, even if an enrollee dies or asks to terminate their medical plan before the end of the month. If the monthly premium or applicable premium surcharges remain unpaid for 30 days the account will be considered delinquent. A subscriber is allowed a grace period of 30 days from the date the monthly premiums or applicable premium surcharges become delinquent to pay the unpaid premium balance and 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 139 applicable premiu m surcharges. If the subscriber's premium balance or applicable premium surcharges remain unpaid for 60 days from the original due date, the subscriber's medical coverage (including enrolled dependents) will be terminated retroactive to the last day of the month for which the monthly premiums and any applicable premium surcharges were paid. If an enrollee is hospitalized An enrollee who is receiving covered services in a hospital on the date medical coverage ends will continue to be eligible for covered s ervices while an inpatient for the condition which the enrollee was hospitalized, until one of the following events occur: According to this plan's clinical criteria, it is no longer medically necessary for the enrollee to be an inpatient at the facility . The remaining benefits available for the hospitalization are exhausted, regardless of whether a new calendar year begins . The enrollee becomes covered under another agreement with a group health plan that provides benefits for the hospitalization . The enrollee becomes enrolled under an agreement with another carrier that provides benefits for the hospitalization. This provision will not apply if the enrollee is covered under another agreement that provides benefits for the hospitalization at the time medical coverage ends, except as set forth in this section, or if the enrollee is eligible for SEBB Continuation Coverage as described in \"Options for continuing SEBB medical coverage.\" Options for continuing SEBB m edical coverage When medical coverage ends, the subscriber and their dependents covered by this medical plan may be eligible to continue SEBB medical coverage during temporary or permanent loss of eligibility. There are three options the subscriber and their dependents may qualify for when coverag e ends. SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) SEBB Continuation Coverage (Unpaid Leave) PEBB retiree insurance coverage A subscriber also has the right to convert to individual medical insurance coverage with the plan when continuation of group medical insura nce coverage is no longer possible. SEBB Continuation Coverage The SEBB Program administers the following continuation coverage options to temporarily extend group insurance coverage when the enrollee's SEBB medical plan coverage ends due to a qualifying event : SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) includes eligibility and administrative requirements under federal COBRA laws and regulation s. Some enrollees who are not qualified beneficiaries under federal COBRA , may also qualify for SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA). SEBB Continuation Coverage (Unpaid Leave) is an option created by the SEBB Program with wider eligibility criteria and qualifying event types than COBRA . An enrollee who qualifies for both types of SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA and Unpaid Leave) may enroll in only one of the se options. See \"Continuation coverage enrollment\" and the SEBB Continuation Coverage Election Notice. 140 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Premium payments for SEBB Continuation Coverage If a subscriber enrolls in continuation coverage, the subscriber is responsible for timely payment of premiums and applicable premium surcharges. PEBB r etiree i nsurance coverage A retiring school employee or a dependent becoming eligible as a survivor is eligible to continue enrollment or defer enrollment in Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) insurance coverage if they meet procedural and substantive eligibility requirements. See the PEBB Retiree Enrollment Guide for details. Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 A school employee on approved leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) may continue to receive the employer contribution toward SEBB benefits in accordance with the federal FMLA. The SEBB organization determines if the school employee is eligible for leave and the duration of the leave under FMLA. The school employee must continue to pay their monthly premium contribution and applicable premium surcharges during this period to maintain eligibility. If a school employee exhausts the period of leave approved under FMLA, they may continue SEBB insurance coverage by self -paying the monthly premium and applicable premium surcharges set by HCA, with no contribution from the SEBB organization . See \"Options for continuing SEBB medical coverage.\" Paid Family and Medical Leave Act A school employee on approved leave under the Washington State Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) Program may continue to receive the employer contribution toward SEBB benefits. The Employment Security Department determines if the school employee is eligible for leave under PFML . The school employee must continue to pay their monthly premium contribution and applicable premium surcharges during this period to maintain eligibility. If a school employee exhausts the period of leave approved under PFML , they may continue SEBB insurance coverage by self -paying the monthly premium and applicable premium surcharges set by HCA, with no contribution from the SEBB organization . See \"Options for continuing SEBB medical coverage.\" Conversion of coverage An enrollee has the right to switch from SEBB group medical to an individual conversio n plan offered by this plan when they are no longer eligible to continue the SEBB group medical plan and are not eligible for Medicare or covered under another group insurance coverage that provides benefits for hospital or medical care. An enrollee must apply for conversion coverage and pay the first month's premium no later than 31 days after their group medical plan ends or within 31 days from the date the notice of termination of coverage is received, whichever is later. Evidence of insurability (proof of good health) is not required to obtain the conversion coverage. Rates, coverage, and eligibility requirements of this conversion plan differ from those of the enrollee's current group medical plan. To receive detailed information on conversion options under this medical plan, call UMP Customer Service. General provisions for eligibility and enrollment Payment of premiums during a labor dispute Any school employee or dependent whose monthly premiums are paid in full or in part by the SEBB organization may pay premiums directly to HCA if the school employee's compensation is suspended or terminated directly or indirectly because of a strike, lockout, or any other labor dispute , for a period not to exceed six months. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 141 When the school employee's compensation is suspended or terminated, HCA will notify the school employee immediately , by mail at the last address of record, that the school employee may pay premiums as they become due. If coverage is no longer available to the school empl oyee under this certificate of coverage, then the school employee may be eligible to purchase an individual medical plan from this plan consistent with premium rates filed with the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner. Appeal rights Any cu rrent or former school employee of a SEBB organization or their dependent may appeal a decision made by the SEBB organization regarding SEBB eligibility, enrollment, or premium surcharges to the SEBB organization . Any enrollee may appeal a decision made by the SEBB Program regarding SEBB eligibility, enrollment, premium payments, or premium surcharges to the SEBB Appeals Unit. Any enrollee may appeal a decision regarding the administration of a SEBB medical plan by following the appeal provisions of the plan, except when regarding eligibility, enrollment, and premium payment decisions. Learn more at hca.wa.gov/sebb- appeals . Relationship to law and regulations Any provision of this certificate of coverage that is in conflict with any governing law or regulation of Washington State is hereby amended to comply with the minimum requirements of such law or regulation. Definitions Accountable Care Plan (ACP) A plan providing access to a network of health systems, hospitals and doctors working together to improve quality, reduce costs and improve the patient experience . Members may self -refer to most specialists . Allowed amount, medical services Allowed amount for medical services is the most the plan pays for a specific covered service or supply. Allowed amount, prescription drugs The allowed amount for prescription drugs is based on WSRxS' contractually agreed reimbursement, unless other contractual arrangements or terms apply. All covered prescription drug claims are paid based on this allowed amount. Ambulatory surgery center (ASC) An ambulatory surgery center (ASC) is a health care facility that specializes in providing surgery, pain management, and certain diagnostic services in an outpatient setting. ASC -qualified procedures are typically more complex than those done in a doctor's office but not so complex as to require an overnight stay. Procedures commonly performed in these centers include colonoscopies, endoscopies, catar act surgery, orthopedic, and ENT (ear, nose, and throat) procedures. An ASC may also be known as an outpatient surgery center or same- day surgery center. 142 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Annual open enrollment Annual open enrollment is a period of time defined by HCA when a subscriber may change to another health plan offered by the SEBB Program and make certain other account changes for an effective date beginning January 1 of the following year. Appeal See the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for an explanation of appeals and how the process works. For appeals related to SEBB eligibility or enrollment see \"Appeal rights\" in the \"Eligibility and Enrollment\" section for more information. Authorized representative An authorized representative is someone you have designated in writ ing to communicate with the plan on your behalf. See page 124 for how this works. Balance billing Balance billing is a provider billing you for the difference between the billed amount and the allowed amount. Core and support network providers cannot balance bill you for covered services above the allowed amount. See an example of how this works on page 21. When you receive nonemergency services at a network hospital, network hospital outpatient department, network critical access hospital, or network ambulatory surgical center in Washington State, you pay the network rate and c annot be balance billed regardless of the network status of the provider. For nonemergency services performed at one of these facilities outside of Washington State, you still pay the network rate, but in some states, an out -of-network provider may be allo wed to ask you to waive some of your balance billing protections. At an out -of-network facility, w hen you receive emergency services you cannot be balance billed. Birthday rule In some instances, the birthday rule is used to determine which group health plan will pay first for the dependent children of married, living together and not married, legally separated, or divorced parents. This rule looks at only the month and day, not the year, of the parents' birthdays. For example, the plan of a parent born April 14 is primary over the plan of a parent born August 21. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered either parent the longest is primary. Brand -name drug A brand -name drug is a prescriptio n drug sold under the proprietary name or trade name selected by the manufacturer. Business day Business days are Mondays through Fridays, except for legal holidays observed by Washington State. Calendar day A calendar day is any day of the week regardless of whether it is observed as a legal holiday by Washington State. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 143 Calendar year A calendar year is January 1 through December 31. Chronic migraine A chronic migraine is having a headache on 15 or more days per month of which eight or more days are a migra ine. Clinical review Clinical review is when the plan has a clinical professional review medical records related to treatment to determine if treatment is medically necessary. Coinsurance Coinsurance is the percentage of the allowed amount you must pay the provider on claims for which the plan pays less than 100 percent of the allowed amount. This includes most medical services and prescription drugs. Continuation Coverage Continuation Coverage means the temporary continuation of SEBB benefits available to enrollees under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), or SEB Board policies. Coordination of benefits (COB) For members covered by more than one group health plan, coordination of benefits (COB) is the method the plan uses to determine which plan pays first, which pays second, and the amount paid by each plan. S ee description and examples in the \"If you have other medical coverage\" section . Copay Copay is a set dollar amount you pay when receiving specific services, treatments, or supplies, such as chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, inpatient hospitalization , or emergency room visits. Core network pro viders Core network providers are primary care providers (PCP), specialty providers, and facilities (such as hospitals, surgery centers, and clinics) contracted with UMP Plus- UW Medicine ACN . Cost-share Cost -share means the amount you pay for a service, supply, or prescription drug. This may be a deductible, coinsurance, copay, or amounts not covered by the plan. Custodial care Custodial care is care primarily to assist in activities of daily living, including institutional care primarily to support self -care and provide room and board. Custodial care includes, but is not limited to, help in walking, getting into and out of bed, bathing, dressing, feeding and preparing special diets, and supervising prescription drugs that are ordinarily self -administered. 144 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Deductible, medical The medical deductible is a fixed dollar amount you must meet each calendar year for health care expenses before the plan starts paying for covered services. You pay the first $125 per member in medical expenses to your providers ($375 maximum if you have a family of three or more on one account). Only expenses covered by the plan apply to your deductible. For example, if you receive LASIK surgery (see exclusion on 99), the plan does not apply this payment to your medical deductible. Some services are exempt from this deductible (see the \"Summary of benefits\" section ). See the \" What you pay for medical services \" section for details on how the medical deductible works. Dependent A dependent is an eligible spouse, state -registered domestic partner, child, or other eligible family member as described in \"Dependent eligibility\" (see the \"Eligibility for subscribers and depen dents\" section) that is either covered by or eligible to be covered by the plan under the subscriber's account. Detoxification Detoxification is a medically supervised treatment program for individuals with alcohol or drug intoxication, designed to rid the body of toxic substances and manage withdrawal symptoms. Developmental delay Developmental delay is a significant lag in reaching developmental milestones as expected during infancy and early childhood. The cause may be present at birth or acquired after birth from a disease or disorder of the body, an injury, a disorder of the mind or emotions, or harmful effects of the surrounding environment. Only a physician or other provider may diagnose a developmental delay. Durable medical equipment (DME) Durable m edical equipment (DME) is: Designed for prolonged use. For a specific therapeutic or clinical purpose, or to assist in the treatment of an injury or illness. Medically necessary (meeting all plan medical necessity criteria). Primarily and customarily used only for a medical purpose. See page 98 for examples of equipment that is not covered. Effectiveness Effectiveness means the extent to which a specific intervention, procedure, service, level of service, supply, prescription drug, or drug dose may reasonably be expected to produce the intended results and to have expected benefits that outweigh potential harmful effects under real -world circumstances. Efficacy Efficacy is the extent to which a specific intervention, procedure, service, supply, or prescription drug produces the desired effect under ideal conditions (in a controlled environment under lab circumstances). Emergency See the \"Medical emergency\" definition. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 145 Emergency fill Emergency fill is a process where the plan covers a limited amount of a prescription drug on an emergency basis while the plan processes your drug preauthorization request. Enrollee Enrollee means a person who meets all eligibility requi rements and is enrolled in SEBB benefits, and for whom applicable premium payments have been made. Excluded pharmacy Excluded pharmacies are pharmacies that have been excluded due to fraud, waste, or abuse. Locate a network pharmacy by visiting the UMP Prescription drug coverage webpage ( see Directory for link ). Experimental or investigational Experimental or investigational means any treatment that is not recognized by the plan as conforming to standard medical care for th e condition, disease, illness, or injury being treated. \"Treatment\" in this setting may include any intervention, therapy, procedure, facility, equipment, drug usage, device, service, supply, intervention, biologic product or drug (prescription or non -prescription). Experimental and investigational treatments are not covered, even if the treatment is considered medically necessary. The plan will review scientific evidence from well- designed clinical studies found in peer -reviewed medical literature, if available, and information obtained from the treating provider regarding the treatment to determine if it is experimental or investigational. A treatment meeting any of the following criteria is considered experimental or investigational: Approval of the trea tment or one of its components by one or more government agencies (e.g., FDA) is required but has not been obtained at the time the treatment is requested or administered. The improvement has not been shown to be attainable outside the laboratory or clinical research setting. The scientific evidence does not permit conclusions concerning the effect of the treatment on health outcomes, which include the disease process, injury or illness, length of life, ability to function, and quality of life. The scienti fic evidence does not show that the treatment is as beneficial as any established alternatives. The treatment has not been demonstrated to improve net health outcomes. The treatment has scientific evidence to support its use, but not for the specific indication for which it is being requested. The treatment is a drug or device that is prescribed for other than its FDA -approved use(s) and is not recognized as \"effective\" for the use for which it is being prescribed. To be considered \"effective\" for other than its FDA -approved use, a prescription drug or device must be so recognized in one of the standard reference compendia or, if not, then in a majority of relevant peer -reviewed medical literature; or by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human S ervices. The treatment is considered to be experimental or investigational by U.S. standards. The treatment is drug combination therapy, when the scientific literature only supports the drug's use as monotherapy and not when utilized in combination with other drugs. The treatment is drug monotherapy, when the scientific literature only supports the drug's use when utilized in combination with other drugs. 146 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage The treatment is not provided by a provider that has demonstrated medical proficiency in the provision of the treatment. The treatment is only available in the U.S. as part of a clinical trial or research program for the illness or condition being treated. Although the plan does not pay for items, drugs, devices, or services (including items, drugs, devices, or services provided in a clinical trial) for investigational use, the plan does not deny qualified individuals from participating in approved clinical trials. The terms \"qualified individual\" and \"approved clinical trial\" are defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a730 0gg-8. If a qualified individual is participating in an approved clinical trial, the plan will not deny, limit, or impose additional conditions on the coverage for routine patient costs for items and services furnished in connection with participation in the trial and will not discriminate against the individual on the basis of the individual's participation in such trial. The plan will apply its standard terms and conditions for routine patient costs for items and services furnished in connection with par ticipation in the trial. The treatment is the subject of an on -going phase I or phase II clinical trial or is the research, experimental, study, or investigational arm of an on -going phase III clinical trial. Explanation of Benefits (EOB) An Explanation of Benefits (EOB) is a detailed account of each medical claim processed by the plan, which the plan sends to you to notify you of claim payment or denial. You may also sign in to your Regence account or call UMP Customer Service (see Directory for link and contact information) to request a copy of an EOB. You will need to provide identifying information over the phone. Family Family is defined as all eligible family members (subscriber and dependents) who are enrolled on a single account. Fee schedule A fee schedule is a list of the plan's maximum payment amounts for specific services or supplies. Network providers have agreed to accept these fees as payment in full for services to members. See the definition of \"Allowed amount, medical services\" for more details. Formulary A formulary is a list available online that specifies how prescription drugs are covered by the plan. By using this list, you may find out if a prescription drug is covered, if the drug must be ordered through the plan's specialty drug pharmacy, and whether the drug has any limitations (such as needing preauthorization or quantity limits; see the \" Limits on your prescription drug coverage \" section ). The UMP Preferred Drug List is sometimes called a formulary (s ee \"The UMP Preferred Drug List\" section for more information ). Generic drug A generic drug is a prescription drug with the same active ingredient(s), but not necessarily the same inactive ingredients, as a brand -name drug that is no longer protected by a commercial patent. A generic drug is therapeutically equivalent to the brand -name prescript ion drug, which means it works like the brand -name drug in dosage, strength, performance, and use. All generic drugs sold in the U.S. must be reviewed and approved by the FDA, and meet the same quality and safety standards as brand -name drugs. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 147 Generic equivalent A generic equivalent is a generic prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as its brand - name counterpart. For a generic drug to be considered \"equivalent,\" it has to be approved by the FDA as being interchangeable with that brand -name drug. Under Washington State law, the pharmacist is required to dispense a generic equivalent in place of a brand -name drug, unless your provider objects. See \"Substitution under Washington State Law\" on page 90 for how this works. Gestational Parent The individual who carries the pregnancy and gives birth. Grievance A grievance is also called a complaint. See the \" Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for details on how these are handled. Habilitative (neurodevelopmental) services Habilitative (neurodevelopmental) services are health care services that help you keep, learn, or improve skills and functioning for daily living. Examples include therapy for a child who isn't walking or talking at the expected age. These services may include physical and occupational therapy, speech - language pathology, and other services for people with disabilities in a variety of inpatient and/or outpatient settings. Healt h Care Authority (HCA) The Health Care Authority (HCA) is the Washington State agency that administers the Uniform Medical Plan UMP Achieve 1, UMP Achieve 2, UMP High Deductible, and the UMP Plus plans: UMP Plus -Puget Sound High Value Network and UMP Plus -UW Medicine Accountable Care Network), in addition to the following health care programs: Washington Prescription Drug Program, PEBB Program, SEBB Program, Behavioral Health and Recovery, and Apple Health (also known as Medicaid). Health intervention Heal th intervention is a prescription drug, service, or supply provided to prevent, diagnose, detect, treat, or palliate the following: disease, illness, injury, genetic or congenital anomaly, pregnancy, or biological or psychological condition that lies outside the range of normal, age -appropriate human variation. A health intervention may also maintain or restore functional ability. A health intervention is defined not only by the intervention itself, but also by the medical condition and patient indications for which it is being applied. A health intervention is new if it is not yet in widespread use for the medical condition and the patient indications being considered. Health outcomes Health outcomes are results that affect health status as measured by the length or quality (primarily as perceived by the member) of a person's life. High- cost generic drug High -cost generic drug is a generic prescription drug (see the definition of \"Generic drug\") that the plan covers under Tier 2 (see the \"What you pay for pr escription drugs\" section). 148 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Home health agency A home health agency is an agency or organization that: Provides a program of home health care; Practices within the scope of its license as a provider of home health services; and Is Medicare -certified, acc redited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or a network provider. Hospice Hospice is services provided by a state -licensed hospice program in the member's home or in a hospice facility to terminally ill members. Hospice care includes services such as pain care relief for terminally ill members without the intent to cure, and support services for their families. Hospital A hospital is an institution accredited under the Hospital Accreditation Program of the Joint Commission and licensed by the state where it is located . A hospital has a defined course of therapeutic intervention and special programming in a controlled environment. A hospital also offers a degree of security, supervision, and structure. Hospital patients must be medically monitored with 24 -hour medical availability and 24 -hour onsite services as defined in federal guidelines outlining Conditions of Participation for H ospitals . The term hospital does not include a convalescent nursing home or institution (or a part of one) that: Furnishes primarily domiciliary or custodial care. Is operated as a school. Is used principally as a convalescent facility, rest facility, nursing facility, or facility for the aged. Inpatient copay The inpatient copay is what you pay for inpatient services at a network facility, such as a hospital, or skilled mental health, nursing, or substance use disorder facility. Non -Medicare members pay $200 per day up to $600 maximum per member per calendar year. The inpatient copay does not apply to your medical deductible but does apply to the medical out -of-pocket limit. Professional charges, such as for physicians or lab work, may be billed separately and are not included in this copay. Inpatient rate The inpatient rate means that you pay your deductible and copay at network facilities After you have met your deductible and paid your copay, the plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount. The plan pays for professional services, such as provider visits or lab tests, based on the provider's network status during an inpatient stay: Network providers: You pay 15 percent of the allowed amount after you meet your medical deductible. The plan pays 85 percent of the allowed amount. Note: For behavioral health professional services, the plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount. Out- of-network providers: You pay 50 percent of the allowed amount after you pay your medical deductible. You pay all charges billed to you above the allowed amount (known as balance billing ). The plan pays 50 percent of the allowed amount. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 149 Inpatient stay An inpatient stay begins when you are admitted to a hospital or other medical facility, and ends when you are discharged from that facility. Independent review organization (IRO) An independent review organization (IRO) conducts the independent (or external) review of an appeal. An IRO is a group of medical and benefit experts certified by the Washington State Department o f Health and not related to the plan, Regence BlueShield, WSRxS, or the Health Care Authority. An IRO is intended to provide unbiased, independent clinical and benefit expertise, as well as evidence -based decision making while ensuring confidentiality. The IRO reviews your appeal to determine if the plan's decision is consistent with state law and the applicable COC. The plan pays the IRO's charges. See \"External review (independent review)\" on page 117. Intensive Outpatient Program Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) is an outpatient program that is licensed as a facility or agency by the appropriate state agency and is provided under the supervision of a psychiatrist or psychiatric extender. IOP is intended to provide treatment on an outpatient basis, does not include boarding or housing, and is intended to provide treatment interventions in a structured setting, with patients returning to their home environments each day. IOP is a minimum of three hours per day, three days per week. Limited benefit TIP: This de finition applies only to those benefits in which it is used in this COC. Other benefits have additional limits related to medical necessity or preauthorization of services (see the \"Limits on plan coverage \" section ). A limited benefit is a benefit that is limited to a certain number of visits or a maximum dollar amount. The limit applies to these benefits even if the provider prescribes additional visits and even if the visits are medically necessary. For benefits limited to a certain number of visits, any visits that are applied to your medical deductible also count against your annual visit or dollar limit. In addition, visits that are paid by another health plan that is primary apply to the plan limit. For example, if your primary plan applies your first 12 chiropractor sessions to your medical deductible, you may receive coverage for 12 more sessions in that calendar year, for a total of 24 visits (the visit maximum for chiropractic services). These limits apply per member. Services are counted against a limited benefit according to the type of service, not the provider type. When a provider practicing within the scope of their license provides services coded under a limited benefit (e.g., spinal manipulation or physical therapy), those services will be counted against the benefit regardless of the provider type. In addition, if more than one type of limited benefit service is provided during a single visit, the services will count against all the limited benefits. For example, if both manipulation and physical therapy codes are billed for a visit, that visit will count against both the spinal and extremity manipulation and physical therapy benefit limits. 150 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Maintenance care Maintenance care is a health intervention after the member has reached maximum rehab ilitation potential or functional level and has shown no significant improvement for one to two weeks, and instruction in the maintenance program has been completed. Maintenance care may apply to several different services, including, but not limited to, p hysical therapy, speech therapy, neurodevelopmental therapy, home health care, and skilled nursing care. Medical Medical generally refers to all plan benefits and services other than those covered under preventive care and prescription drug benefits (except as the term is used in the eligibility sections of this COC). Medical benefit Medical benefit refers to services subject to the medical deductible, and copay or coinsurance. See the \"What you pay for medical services\" section for a description of how this works. Medical emergency A medical emergency means a medical condition that manifests itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) so that a prudent layperson who has an average knowledge of medicine and health would reasonably expect that not seeking immediate medical treatment at an emergency room would result in any one of the following: Places the member's health, or with respect to pregnancy , the health of an unborn child, in serious jeopardy; Causes serious impairment to bodily functions; or Causes serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. Medical food Medic al food is food administered under the supervision of a provider, intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements. Medically necessary or medical necessity ALERT! The provider or member must provide documentation demonstrating medical necessity when requested by the plan, or the plan may deny services as not medically necessary. The plan may not cover some medically necessary services. All benefits or services that are medically necessary are subject to the plan's coverage limitations, exclusions, and provisions of the plan. It is important to review this COC or verify coverage with UMP Customer Service before receiving services. Medically necessary or medical necessity means health care services, supplies, prescription drugs, or interventions that a licensed health care provider recommends and all the following conditions are met: The purpose of the service, supply, intervention, or prescription drug is to prevent, evaluate, treat, or diagnose an illness, injury, disease, or its symptoms. 2023 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 151 The level of service, supply, intervention, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose is appropriate considering the potential benefits and harm to the member. The level of service, supply, in tervention, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose is known to be effective in improving health outcomes. The level of service, supply, intervention, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose recommended for this condition is cost -effective compar ed to alternative interventions, including no intervention. The service, supply, or intervention is not being recommended for reasons of convenience to the patient or health care provider. For services that the HTCC has reviewed, and that UMP has implemented, medical necessity is established only when HTCC's coverage conditions are met. The fact that a physician or other provider prescribes, orders, recommends, or approves a service or supply, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose does not make it m edically necessary. The plan may require proof that services, interventions, supplies, or prescription drugs (including court - ordered care) are medically necessary . Depending on the circumstances, such proof may be documentation about the member's condition or scientific evidence about the effectiveness of the treatment. The plan will not provide benefits if the required proof is not received, or does not adequately justify the medical necessity of the service, supply, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose. Claims processing may be delayed if proof of medical necessity is required but not adequately provided by the health service provider. The plan uses scientif ic evidence from peer -reviewed medical literature to determine effectiveness for services and interventions not yet in widespread use for the medical condition and member indications being considered. For services that the HTCC has reviewed, and that UMP has implemented, state law requires that UMP use the HTCC's coverage criteria in determining whether the service is medically necessary. When the HTCC determines that a service is not covered, then the service is not covered by the plan. If the HTCC determ ines that a service is covered, then the HTCC's criteria (if any) determine medical necessity. The HTCC's decisions and related documentation are available on the HCA website at hca.wa.gov/hta. For services, interventions, supplies, prescription drugs, or prescription drug doses not related to an HTCC review, the plan first uses scientific evidence, then professional standards, then expert opinion to determine coverage. Scientific evidence consists primarily of controlled clinical trials that either directly or indirectly demonstrate the effect of the intervention on health outcomes. If controlled clinical trials are not available , observational studies that demonstrate a causal relationship between the intervention and health outcomes may be used. Partially controlled observational studies and uncontrolled clinical series may be suggestive, but do not by themselves demonstrate a c ausal relationship unless the magnitude of the effect observed exceeds anything that could be explained either by the natural history of the medical condition or potential experimental biases. Interventions for which clinical trials have not been conducted because of epidemiological reasons (that is, rare or new diseases or orphan populations) shall be evaluated based on professional standards of care or expert opinion.
