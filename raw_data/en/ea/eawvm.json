The Broad Continuum of Affect and Mood2I. A. What Do We Mean When We Talk About Affect and Mood: Defining Affect and Mood A. Defining Affect and Mood Affect From: Gale Encyclopedia of Childhood and Adolescence The expressions of emotion or feelings to others include facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice, and other signs of emotion such as laughter or tears. As a child grows and develops, environmental factors, such as peer pressure , and internal factors, such as self-consciousness, help to shape the affect. What is considered a normal range of affect--display of emotion--varies from family to family, from situation to situation, and from culture to culture. Even within a culture, a wide variation in affective display can be considered normal. Certain individuals may gesture prolifically while talking, and display dramatic facial expressions in reaction to social situations or other stimuli. Others may show little outward response to social environments, expressing only a narrow range of affect to the outside world. When psychologists describe abnormalities in a child's affect, they use specific terminology. The normal affect--which is different for each child and changes with each stage of childhood--is termed broad affect, to describe the range of expression of emotion that is considered typical. Persons with psychological disorders may display variations in their affect. A constricted affect refers to a mild restriction in the range or intensity of display of feelings; as the display of emotion becomes more severely limited, the term blunted affect may be applied. The absence of any exhibition of emotions is described as flat affect; in this case, the voice is monotone, the face is expressionless, and the body is immobile. Extreme variations in expressions of feelings is termed labile affect. When the outward display of emotion is inappropriate for the situation, such as laughter while describing pain or sadness, the affect is described as inappropriate. Labile affect, also called lability, is used to describe emotional instability or dramatic mood swings. Mood From: Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology A mood, while relatively pervasive, is typically neither highly intense nor sustained over an extended period of time. Examples of mood include happiness, sadness, contemplativeness, and irritability. The definitions of phrases to describe moods-such as good mood and bad mood-are imprecise. In addition, the range of what is regarded as a normal or appropriate mood varies considerably from individual to individual and from culture to culture.3B. The Broad Continuum of Affect and Mood 1. Developmental Variations 2. Problems 3. DisordersI. B. What Do We Mean When We Talk About Affect and Mood: The Broad Continuum41. Developmental Variations: Behaviors within the Range of Expected Behaviors for That Age Group* DEVELOPMENTAL VARIATION COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL PRESENTATIONS SPECIAL INFORMATION Sadness Variation Transient depressive responses or mood changes to stress are normal in otherwise healthy populations. Bereavement Sadness related to a major loss that typically persists for less than 2 months after the loss. However, the presence of certain symptoms that are not characteristic of a \"normal\" grief reaction may be helpful in differentiating bereavement from a major depressive disorder. These include guilt about things other than actions taken or not taken by the survivor at the time of death, thoughts of death, and morbid preoccupation with worthlessness. *Adapted from The Classification of Child and Adolescent Mental Diagnoses in Primary Care. (1996) American Academy of Pediatrics.Infancy The infant shows brief expressions of sadness, which normally first appear in the last quarter of the first year of life, manifest by crying, brief withdrawal, and transient anger. Early Childhood The child may have transient withdrawal and sad affect that may occur over losses and usually experiences bereavement due to the death of a parent or the loss of a pet or treasured object. Middle Childhood The child feels transient loss of self-esteem aver experiencing failure and feels sadness with losses as in early childhood. Adolescence The adolescent's developmental presentations are similar to those of middle childhood but may also include fleeting thoughts of death. Bereavement includes loss of a boyfriend or girlfriend, friend, or best friend. A normal process of bereavement occurs when a child experiences the death of or separation from someone (person or pet) loved by the child. There are normal age-specific responses as well as responses related to culture, temperament, the nature of the relationship between the child and the one the child is grieving, and the child's history of loss. While a child may manifest his or her grief response for a period of weeks to a couple of months, it is important to understand that the loss does not necessarily go away within that time frame. Most children will need to revisit the sadness at intervals (months or years) to continue to interpret the meaning of the loss to their life and to examine the usefulness of the coping mechanisms used to work through the sadness. A healthy mourning process requires that the child has a sense of reality about the death and access to incorporating this reality in an ongoing process of life. Unacknowledged, invalidated grief usually results in an unresolving process and leads to harmful behaviors toward self or others. Symptoms reflecting grief reaction may appear to be mild or transient, but care must be taken to observe subtle ways that unexpressed sadness may be exhibited. Children in hospitals or institutions often experience some of the fears that accompany a death or separation. These fears may be demonstrated in actions that mimic normal grief responses.5DEVELOPMENTAL VARIATION DEVELOPMENTAL VARIATION COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL PRESENTATIONS COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL PRESENTATIONS SPECIAL INFORMATION Thoughts of Death Variation Anxiety about death in early childhood. Focus on death in middle childhood or adolescence. Thoughts of Death Problem The child has thoughts of or a preoccupation with his or her own death. If the child has thoughts of suicide, consider suicidal ideation and attempts (next page). *Adapted from The Classification of Child and Adolescent Mental Diagnoses in Primary Care. (1996) American Academy of PediatricsInfancy Not relevant at this age. Early Childhood In early childhood anxiety about dying may be present Middle Childhood Anxiety about dying may occur in middle childhood, especially after a death in the family. Adolescence Some interest with death and morbid ideation may be manifest by a preference for black clothing and an interest in the occult. If this becomes increased to a point of preoccupation, a problem or a serious ideation should be considered. Infancy Unable to assess Early and Middle Childhood The child may express a wish to die through discussion or play. This often follows significant punishment or disappointment. Adolescence The adolescent may express nonspecific ideation related to suicide. Between 12% and 25% of primary school and high school children have some form of suicidal ideation. Those with a specific plan or specific risk factors should be considered at most risk.62. Problems--Behaviors Serious Enough to Disrupt Functioning with Peers, at School, at Home, but Not Severe Enough to Meet Criteria COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL PRESENTATIONS PROBLEM SPECIAL INFORMATIONSadness Problem Sadness or irritability that begins to include some symptoms of major depressive disorders in mild form. depressed/irritable mood diminished interest or pleasure weight loss/gain, or failure to make expected weight gains insomnia/hypersomnia psychomotor agitation/retardation fatigue or energy loss feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt diminished ability to think/concentrate However, the behaviors are not sufficiently intense to qualify for a depressive disorder. These symptoms should be more than transient and have a mild impact on the child's functioning. Bereavement that continues beyond 2 months may also be a problem. *Adapted from The Classification of Child and Adolescent Mental Diagnoses in primary Care . (1996) American Academy of Pediatrics Notes: Dots (...) indicate that the original text has a reference to another section of the book that was omitted here because that section was not included in this guide. InfancyThe infant may experience some developmental regressions, fearfulness, anorexia, failure to thrive, sleep disturbances, social withdrawal, irritability, and increased dependency, which are responsive to extra efforts at soothing and engagement by primary caretakers. Early Childhood The child may experience similar symptoms as in infancy, but sad affect may be more apparent. In addition, temper tantrums may increase in number and severity, and physical symptoms such as constipation, secondary enuresis (...), encopresis (...), and nightmares may be present. Middle Childhood The child may experience some sadness that results in brief suicidal ideation with no clear plan of suicide, some apathy, boredom, low self-esteem, and unexplained physical symptoms such as headaches and abdominal pain (...). Adolescence Some disinterest in school work, decrease in motivation, and day-dreaming in class may begin to lead to deterioration of school work. Hesitancy in attending school, apathy, and boredom may occur. Sadness is experienced by some children beyond the level of a normal developmental variation when the emotional or physiologic symptoms begin to interfere with effective social interactions, family functioning, or school performance. These periods of sadness may be brief or prolonged depending on the precipitating event and temperament of the child. Reassurance and monitoring is often needed at this level. If the sad behaviors are more severe, consider major depressive disorders. The potential for suicide in grieving children is higher. Evaluation of suicidal risk should be part of a grief workup for all patients expressing profound sadness or confusion or demonstrating destructive behaviors toward themselves or others. Behavioral symptoms resulting from bereavement that persist beyond 2 months after the loss require evaluation and intervention. Depressed parents or a strong family history of depression or alcoholism (...) puts youth at very high risk for depressive problems and disorders. Family and marital discord, ... exacerbates risk. Suicidal ideation should be assessed (see Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors cluster). Lying, stealing, suicidal thoughts (see Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors cluster), and promiscuity may be present. Physical symptoms may include recurrent headaches, chronic fatigue, and abdominal pain (...).73. Disorders that Meet the Criteria of a Mental Disorder as Defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the DISORDERS COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL PRESENTATIONS SPECIAL INFORMATIONMajor Depressive Disorder Significant distress or impairment is manifested by five of the nine criteria listed below, occurring nearly every day for 2 weeks. These symptoms must represent a change from previous functioning and that either depressed or irritable mood or diminished interest or pleasure must be present to make the diagnosis. depressed/irritable diminished interest or pleasure weight loss/gain insomnia/hypersomnia psychomotor agitation/retardation fatigue or energy loss feelings of worthlessness diminished ability to think/concentrate recurrent thoughts of death and suicidal ideation (see DSM-IV Criteria ...) *Adapted from The Classification of Child and Adolescent Mental Diagnoses in Primary Care. (1996) American Academy of Pediatrics Note: Dots (...) indicate that the original text has a reference to another section of the book that was omitted here because that section was not included in this guide.Infancy True major depressive disorders are difficult to diagnose in infancy. However, the reaction of some infants in response to the environmental cause is characterized by persistent apathy, despondency (often associated with the loss of a caregiver or an unavailable [e.g., severely depressed] caregiver), nonorganic failure-to-thrive (often associated with apathy, excessive withdrawal), and sleep difficulties. These reactions, in contrast to the \"problem\" level, require significant interventions. Early Childhood This situation in early childhood is similar to infancy. Middle Childhood The child frequently experiences chronic fatigue, irritability, depressed mood, guilt, somatic complaints, and is socially withdrawn (...). Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations or delusions) may be present. Adolescence The adolescent may display psychomotor retardation or have hypersomnia. Delusions or hallucinations are not uncommon (but not part of the specific symptoms of the disorder). Depressed parents or a strong family history of depression or alcoholism puts youth at very high risk for depressive disorder (...). Risk is increased by family and marital discord (...), substance abuse by the patient (...), and a history of depressive episodes. Suicidal ideation should be routinely assessed. Sex distribution of the disorder is equivalent until adolescence, when females are twice as likely as males to have a depressive disorder. Culture can influence the experience and communication of symptoms of depression, (e.g., in some cultures, depression tends to be expressed largely in somatic terms rather than with sadness or guilt). Complaints of \"nerves\" and headaches (in Latino and Mediterranean cultures), of weakness, tiredness, or \"imbalance\" (in Chinese and Asian cultures), of problems of the \"heart\" (in Middle Eastern cultures), or of being heartbroken (among Hopis) may express the depressive experience. Subsequent depressive episodes are common. Bereavement typically improves steadily without specific treatment. If significant impairment or distress is still present aver 2 months following the acute loss or death of a loved one, or if certain symptoms that are not characteristic of a \"normal\" grief reaction are present (e.g., marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worth lessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation), consider diagnosis and treatment of major depressive disorder.8DISORDER COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL PRESENTATIONS SPECIAL INFORMATIONDysthymic Disorder The symptoms of dysthymic disorder are less severe or disabling than those of major depressive disorder but more persistent. Depressed/irritable mood for most of the day, for more days than not (either by subjective account or observations of others) for at least 1 year. Also the presence, while depressed/ irritable, of two (or more) of the following: poor appetite/overeating insomnia/hypersomnia low energy or fatigue poor concentration/difficulty making de- cisions feelings of hopelessness (see DSM-IV Criteria ...) Adjustment Disorder With Depressed Mood (see DSM-lV Criteria ...) Depressive Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified *Adapted from The Classification of Child and Adolescent Mental Diagnoses in Primary Care . (1996) American Academy of Pediatrics Note: Dots (...) indicate that the original text has a reference to another section of the book that was omitted here because that section was not included in this guide.Infancy Not diagnosed. Early Childhood Rarely diagnosed. Middle Childhood and Adolescence Commonly experience feelings of inadequacy, loss of Interest/pleasure, social withdrawal, guilt, brooding, irritability or excessive anger, decreased activity/productivity. May experience sleep/ appetite/weight changes and psychomotor symptoms. Low self-esteem is common. Because of the chronic nature of the disorder, the child may not develop adequate social skills. The child is at risk for episodes of major depression.9DISORDER COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL PRESENTATIONS SPECIAL INFORMATIONBipolar I Disorder, With Single Manic Episode (see DSM-IV CRITERIA...) Bipolar II Disorder, Recurrent Major Depressive Episodes With Hypomanic Episodes Includes presence (or history) of one or more major depressive episodes, presence of at least one hypomanic episode, there has never been a manic episode (similar to manic episodes but only need to be present for 4 or more days and are not severe enough to cause marked impairment in function) or a mixed episode. The symptoms are not better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or psychotic disorder. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. *Adapted from The Classification of Child and Adolescent Mental Diagnoses in Primary Care. (1996) American Academy of Pediatrics Note: Dots (...) indicate that the original text has a reference to another section of the book that was omitted here because that section was not included in this guide.Infancy Not diagnosed. Early Childhood Rarely diagnosed. Middle Childhood The beginning symptoms as described for adolescents start to appear. Adolescence During manic episodes, adolescents may wear flamboyant clothing, distribute gifts or money, and drive recklessly. They display inflated self- esteem, a decreased need for sleep, pressure to keep talking, flights of ideas, distractibility, unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretion, school truancy and failure, antisocial behavior, and illicit drug experimentation. Substance abuse is commonly associated with bipolar disorder (...). Stimulant abuse and certain symptoms of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder may mimic a manic episode (see Hyperactive/ lmpulsive Behaviors cluster). Manic episodes in children and adolescents can include psychotic features and may be associated with school truancy, antisocial behavior (...), school failure, or illicit drug experimentation. Long-standing behavior problems often precede the first manic episode. One or more manic episodes (a distinct period of an abnormally and persistently elevated and expansive or irritable mood lasting at least 1 week if not treated) frequently occur with one or more major depressive episodes. The symptoms are not better accounted for by other severe mental disorders (e.g., schizoaffective, schizophrenegenic, delusional, or psychotic disorders). The symptoms cause mild impairment in functioning in usual social activities and relationships with others.10DISORDER COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL PRESENTATIONS SPECIAL INFORMATIONSuicidal Ideation and Attempts The child has thoughts about causing intentional self- harm acts that cause intentional self-harm or death. This code represents an unspecified mental disorder. It is to be used when no other condition is identified. *Adapted from The Classification of Child and Adolescent Mental Diagnoses in Primary Care . (1996) American Academy of Pediatrics. Note:Dots (...) indicate that the original text has a reference to another section of the book that was omitted here because that section was not included in this guide.Infancy Unable to assess. Early Childhood The child expresses a wish and intent to die either verbally or by actions. Middle Childhood The child plans and enacts self-injurious acts with a variety of potentially lethal methods. Adolescence The adolescent frequently shows a strong wish to die and may carefully plan and carry out a suicide. A youngster's understanding that death is final is not an essential ingredient in considering a child or adolescent to be suicidal. How-ever, very young children, such as preschoolers who do not appreciate the finality of death, can be considered to be suicidal if they wish to carry out a self-destructive act with the goal of causing death. Such behavior in preschoolers is often associated with physical or sexual abuse (...). Prepubertal children may be protected against suicide by their cognitive immaturity and limited access to more lethal methods that may prevent them from planning and executing a lethal suicide attempt despite suicidal impulses. The suicide rate and rate of attempted suicide increase with age and with the presence of alcohol and other drug use. Psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations, increase risk as well. Because of societal pressures, some homosexual youth are at increased risk for suicide attempts (...). In cases of attempted suicide that are carefully planned, adolescents may leave a note, choose a clearly lethal method, and state their intent prior to the actual suicide. In contrast, most suicide attempts in adolescence are impulsive, sometimes with little threat to the patient's life. The motivation for most attempts appears to be a wish to gain attention and/or help, escape a difficult situation, or express anger or love. However, irrespective of motivation, all suicide attempts require careful evaluation and all patients with active intent to harm themselves should have a thorough psychiatric evaluation. Although suicidal ideation and attempts is not a disorder diagnosis, more extensive evaluation may identify other mental conditions (e.g., major depressive disorder).11II.

Environmental Situations and Potentially Stressful Events and Common Behavioral Responses C. Overview of Risk Factors and PreventionII. A. Understanding the Causes of Problems Related to Affect and Mood: Environment in Perspective 12A. Keeping The Environment in Perspective as a Cause of Commonly Identified Psychosocial Problems. A large number of students are unhappy and emotionally upset; only a small percent are clinically depressed. A large number of youngsters have trouble behaving in classrooms; only a small percenthave attention deficit or a conduct disorder. In some schools, large numbers of students haveproblems learning; only a few have learning disab ilities. Individuals suffering from true internal pathology represent a relatively small segment of the population. A caring society tries to providethe best services for such individuals; doing so includes taking great care not to misdiagnose otherswhose \"symptoms\" may be similar, but are caused by factors other than internal pathology. Suchmisdiagnoses lead to policies and practices that exhaust available resources in ineffective ways. Abetter understanding of how the environment might cause problems and how focusing on changingthe environment might prevent problems is essential. A. Labeling Troubled and Troubling Youth: The NameGame She's depressed. That kid's got an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He's learning disabled. W hat's in a name? Strong images are associated with diagnostic labels, and people act upon these images. Sometimes the imagesare useful generalizations; sometimes they areharmful stereotypes. Sometimes they guidepractitioners toward good ways to help;sometimes they contribute to \"blaming thevictim\" -- making young people the focus ofintervention rather than pursuing systemdeficiencies that are causing the problem inthe first place. In all cases, diagnostic labelscan profoundly shape a person's future. Youngsters manifesting emotional upset, misbehavior, and learning problemscommonly are assigned psychiatric labels thatwere created to categorize internal disorders. Thus, there is increasing use of terms such asADHD, depression, and LD. This happens despite the fact that the problems of most youngsters are not rooted in internalpathology. Indeed, many of their troublingsymptoms would not have developed if theirenvironmental circumstances had beenappropriately different. Diagnosing Behavioral, Emotional, and Learning Problems The thinking of those who study behavioral, emotional, and learning problems has longbeen dominated by models stressing person pathology. This is evident in discussions ofcause, diagnosis, and intervention strategies. Because so much discussion focuses onperson pathology, diagnostic systems have notbeen developed in ways that adequatelyaccount for psychosocial problems. Many practitioners who use prevailing diagnostic labels understand that mostproblems in human functioning result from theinterplay of person and environment. Tocounter nature versus nurture biases in thinking about problems, it helps to approachall diagnosis guided by a broad perspective ofwhat determines human behavior.13A Broad View of Human Functioning Before the 1920's, dominant thinking saw human behavior as determined primarilyby person variables, especially inborncharacteristics. As behaviorism gained ininfluence, a strong competing view arose.Behavior was seen as shaped byenvironmental influences, particularly thestimuli and reinforcers one encounters. Today, human functioning is viewed in transactional terms -- as the product of a reciprocal interplay between person andenvironment (Bandura, 1978). However,prevailing approaches to labeling andaddressing human problems still create theimpression that problems are determinedby either person or environment variables. This is both unfortunate and unnecessary -- unfortunate because such a view limitsprogress with respect to research andpractice, unnecessary because atransactional view encompasses theposition that problems may be caused byperson, environment, or both. This broadparadigm encourages a comprehensiveperspective of cause and correction. Toward a Broad Framework A broad framework offers a useful starting place for classifying behavioral, emotional, and learning problems in ways that avoidover-diagnosing internal pathology. Suchproblems can be differentiated along acontinuum that separates those caused byinternal factors, environmental variables, or acombination of both. Problems caused by the environment are placed at one end of the continuum (referredto as Type I problems). At the other end areproblems caused primarily by pathology within the person (Type III problems). In themiddle are problems stemming from arelatively equal contribution of environ-mental and person sources (Type II problems). Diagnostic labels meant to identify extremely dysfunctional problems caused by pathological conditions within a person are reserved for individuals who fit the Type III category. At the other end of the continuum are individuals with problems arising from factorsoutside the person (i.e., Type I problems). Many people grow up in impoverished andhostile environmental circumstances. Suchconditions should be considered first inhypothesizing what initially caused the individual's behavioral, emotional, andlearning problems. (After environmentalcauses are ruled out, hypotheses about internalpathology become more viable.) To provide a reference point in the middle of the continuum, a Type II category is used. This group consists of persons who do notfunction well in situations where theirindividual differences and minorvulnerabilities are poorly accommodated orare responded to hostilely. The problems ofan individual in this group are a relativelyequal product of person characteristics andfailure of the environment to accommodatethat individual. There are, of course, variations along the continuum that do not precisely fit a category. That is, at each point between the extremeends, environment-person transactions are thecause, but the degree to which eachcontributes to the problem varies. Toward theenvironment end of the continuum,environmental factors play a bigger role(represented as E<--->p). Toward the otherend, person variables account for more of theproblem (thus e<--->P). 14Problems Categorized on a Continuum Using a Transactional View of the Primary Locus of Cause Problems caused by factors in the environment (E)Problems caused equally byenvironment and personProblems caused by factors inthe the person (P) E (E<--->p) E<--->P (e<--->P) P |-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------| Type I problemsType II problemsType III problems caused primarily by environments and systems thatare deficient and/or hostilecaused primarily by asignificant mismatch between individual differences and vulnerabilities and the nature ofthat person's environment (notby a person's pathology)caused primarily by person factors of a pathological nature problems are mild to moderately severe and narrowto moderately pervasiveproblems are mild tomoderately severe andpervasiveproblems are moderate toprofoundly severe and moderateto broadly pervasive Clearly, a simple continuum cannot do justice to the complexities associated with labelingand differentiating psychopathology andpsychosocial problems. However, the aboveconceptual scheme shows the value of startingwith a broad model of cause. In particular, ithelps counter the tendency to jumpprematurely to the conclusion that a problemis caused by deficiencies or pathology withinthe individual and thus can help combat thetrend toward blaming the victim (Ryan, 1971).It also helps highlight the notion thatimproving the way the environmentaccommodates individual differences may be asufficient intervention strategy. There is a substantial community-serving component in policies and procedures forclassifying and labeling exceptional childrenand in the various kinds of institutionalarrangements made to take care of them. \"Totake care of them\" can and should be readwith two meanings: to give children help andto exclude them from the community . Nicholas HobbsAfter the general groupings are identified, it becomes relevant to consider the value ofdifferentiating subgroups or subtypes withineach major type of problem. For example,subtypes for the Type III category might firstdifferentiate behavioral, emotional, or learningproblems arising from serious internalpathology (e.g., structural and functionalmalfunctioning within the person that causesdisorders and disabilities and disruptsdevelopment). Then subtypes might bedifferentiated within each of these categories.For illustrative purposes: Figure 2 presentssome ideas for subgrouping Type I and IIIproblems. References Bandura, A. (1978).

C. Understanding the Causes of Problems Related to Affect and Mood: Overview of Risk Factors C. Overview of Risk Factors and Prevention Excerpts from: Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General Current approaches to understanding the etiology of mental disorders in childhood are driven by empirical advances in neuroscience and behavioral research rather than by theories. Epidemiological research on the factors that make children vulnerable to mental illness is important for several reasons: delineating the range of risk factors for particular mental disorders helps to understand their etiology; the populations most at risk can be identified; understanding the relative strength of different risk factors allows for the design of appropriate prevention programs for children in different contexts; and resources can be better allocated to intervene so as to maximize their effectiveness. Risk Factors There is now good evidence that both biological factors and adverse psychosocial experiences during childhood influence - but not necessarily \"cause\"- the mental disorders of childhood. Adverse experiences may occur at home, at school, or in the community. A stressor or risk factor may have no, little, or a profound impact, depending on individual differences among children and the age at which the child is exposed to it, as well as whether it occurs alone or in association with other risk factors. Although children are influenced by their psychosocial environment, most are inherently resilient and can deal with some degree of adversity. However, some children, possibly those with an inherent biological vulnerability (e.g., genes that convey susceptibility to an illness), are more likely to be harmed by an adverse environment, and there are some environmental adversities, especially those that are long-standing or repeated, that seem likely to induce a mental disorder in all but the hardiest of children. A recent analysis of risk factors by Kraemer and colleagues (1997) has provided a useful framework for differentiating among categories of risk and may help point this work in a more productive direction. Risk factors for developing a mental disorder or experiencing problems in social-emotional development include prenatal damage from exposure to alcohol, illegal drugs, and tobacco; low birth weight; difficult temperament or an inherited predisposition to a mental disorder; external risk factors such as poverty, deprivation, abuse and neglect; unsatisfactory relationships; parental mental health disorder; or exposure to traumatic events... Psychosocial Risk Factors A landmark study on risks from the environment (Rutter & Quinton, 1977) showed that several factors can endanger a child's mental health. Dysfunctional aspects of family life such as severe parental discord, a parent's psychopathology or criminality, overcrowding, or large family size can predispose to conduct disorders and antisocial personality disorders, especially if the child does not have a loving relationship with at least one of the parents (Rutter, 1979). Economic hardship can indirectly increase a child's risk of developing a behavioral disorder because it may cause behavioral problems in the parents or increase the risk of child abuse (Dutton, 1986; Link et al., 1986; Wilson, 1987; Schorr, 1988). Exposure to acts of violence also is identified as a possible cause of stress-related mental health problems (Jenkins & Bell, 1997). Studies point to poor caregiving practices as being a risk factor for children of depressed parents (Zahn-Waxler et al., 1990).19The quality of the relationship between infants or children and their primary caregiver, as manifested by the security of attachment, has long been felt to be of paramount importance to mental health across the life span. In this regard, the relationship between maternal problems and those factors in children that predispose them to form insecure attachments, particularly young infants' and toddler'' security of attachment and temperament style and their impact on the development of mood and conduct disorders, is of great interest to researchers. Many investigators have taken the view that the nature and the outcome of the attachment process are related to later depression, especially when the child is raised in an abusive environment (Toth & Cicchetti, 1996), and to later conduct disorder (Sampson & Laub, 1993). The relationship of attachment to mental disorders has been the subject of several important review articles (Rutter, 1995; van IJzendoorn et al., 1995). There is controversy as to whether the key determinant of \"insecure\" responses to strange situations stems from maternal behavior or from an inborn predisposition to respond to an unfamiliar stranger with avoidant behaviors, such as is found in socially phobic children (Belsky & Rovine, 1987; Kagan et al., 1988; Thompson et al., 1988; Kagan, 1994, 1995). Kagan demonstrated that infants who were more prone to being active, agitated, and tearful at 4 months of age were less spontaneous and sociable and more likely to show anxiety symptoms at age 4 (Snidman et al., 1995; Kagan et al., 1998). These findings are of considerable significance, because long-term study of such highly reactive, behaviorally inhibited infants and toddlers has shown that they are excessively shy and avoidant in early childhood and that this behavior persists and predisposes to later anxiety (Biederman et al., 1993). There is also some controversy as to whether \"difficult\" temperament in an infant is an early manifestation of a behavior problem, particularly in children who go on to demonstrate such problems as conduct disorder (Olds et al., 1999). One analysis of the attachment literature suggests that abnormal or insecure forms of attachment are largely the product of maternal problems, such as depression and substance abuse, rather than of individual differences in the child (van IJzendoorn et al., 1992). The relationship between a child's temperament and parenting style is complex (Thomas et al., 1968); it may be either protective if it is good or a risk factor if it is poor. Thus, a difficult child's chances of developing mental health problems are much reduced if he or she grows up in a family in which there are clear rules and consistent enforcement (Maziade et al., 1985), while a child exposed to inconsistent discipline is at greater risk for later behavior problems (Werner & Smith, 1992). Family and Genetic Risk Factors As noted above in the relationships between temperament and attachment, in some instances the relative contributions of biologic influences and environmental influences are difficult to tease apart, a problem that particularly affects studies investigating the impact of family and genetic influences on risk for childhood mental disorder. For example, research has shown that between 20 and 50 percent of depressed children and adolescents have a family history of depression (Puig-Antich et al., 1989; Todd et al., 1993; Williamson et al., 1995; Kovacs, 1997b). The exact reasons for this increased risk have not been fully clarified, but experts tend to agree that both factors interact to result in this increased risk (Weissman et al., 1997). Family research has found that children of depressed parents are more than three times as likely as children of nondepressed parents to experience a depressive disorder (see Birmaher et al., 1996a and 1996b for review). Parental depression also increases the risk of anxiety disorders, conduct disorder, and alcohol dependence (Downey & Coyne, 1990; Weissman et al., 1997; Wickramaratne & Weissman, 1998). The risk is greater if both parents have had a depressive illness, if the parents were depressed when they were20young, or if a parent had several episodes of depression (Merikangas et al., 1988; Downey & Coyne, 1990; McCracken, al., 1995; Wickramaratne & Weissman, 1998). Effects of Parental Depression Depressed parents may be withdrawn and lack energy and consequently pay little attention to, or provide inadequate supervision of, their children. Alternatively, such parents may be excessively irritable and overcritical, thereby upsetting children, demoralizing them, and distancing them (Cohn et al., 1986; Field et al., 1990). At a more subtle level, parents' distress - being pessimistic, tearful, or threatening suicide - is sometimes seen or heard by the child, thereby inducing anxiety. Depressed parents may not model effective coping strategies for stress; instead of \"moving on,\" some provide an example of\"giving up\" (Garber & Hilsman, 1992). Depression is also often associated with marital discord, which may have its own adverse effect on children and adolescents. Conversely, the behavior of the depressed child or teenager may contribute to family stress as much as being a product of it. The poor academic performance, withdrawal from normal peer activities, and lack of energy or motivation of a depressed teenager may lead to intrusive or reprimanding reactions from parents that may further reduce the youngster's self-esteem and optimism. The consequences of maternal depression vary with the state of development of the child, and some of the effects are quite subtle (Cicchetti & Toth, 1998). For example, in infancy, a withdrawn or unresponsive depressed mother may increase an infant's distress, and an intrusive or hostile depressed mother may lead the infant to avoid looking at and communicating with her (Cohn et al., 1986). Other studies have shown that if infants' smiles are met with a somber or gloomy face, they respond by showing a similarly somber expression and then by averting their eyes (Murray et al., 1993). During the toddler stage of development, research shows that the playful interactions of a toddler with a depressed mother are often briefer and more likely to be interrupted (by either the mother or the child) than those with a nondepressed parent (Jameson et al., 1997). Research has shown that some depressed mothers are less able to provide structure or to modify the behavior of excited toddlers, increasing the risk of out-of- control behavior, the development of a later conduct disorder, or later aggressive dealings with peers (Zahn- Waxler et al., 1990; Hay et al., 1992). A depressed mother's inability to control a young child''s behavior may result in the child failing to learn appropriate skills for settling disputes without reliance on aggression. Stressful Life Events The relationship between stressful life events and risk for child mental disorders is well established (e.g., Garmezy, 1983; Hammen, 1988; Jensen et al., 1991; Garber & Hilsman, 1992), although this relationship in children and adolescents is complicated, perhaps reflecting the impact of individual differences and developmental changes. For example, there is a relationship between stressful life events, such as parental death or divorce, and the onset of major depression in young children, especially if they occur in early childhood and lead to a permanent and negative change in the child''s circumstances. Yet findings are mixed as to whether the same relationship is true for depression in midchildhood or in adolescence (Birmaher et al., 1996a and 1996b; Garrison et al., 1997).21Childhood Maltreatment Child abuse is a very widespread problem; it is estimated that over 3 million children are maltreated every year in the United States (National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, 1995). Physical abuse is associated with insecure attachment (Main & Solomon, 1990), psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, conduct disorder, ADHD (Famularo et al., 1992), depression (Kaufman, 1991), and impaired social functioning with peers (Salzinger et al., 1993). Psychological maltreatment is believed to occur more frequently than physical maltreatment (Cicchetti & Carlson, 1989); it is associated with depression, conduct disorder, and delinquency (Kazdin et al., 1985) and can impair social and cognitive functioning in children (Smetana & Kelly, 1989). Peer and Sibling Influences The influence of maladaptive peers can be very damaging to a child and greatly increases the likelihood of adverse outcomes such as delinquency, particularly if the child comes from a family beset by many stressors (Friday & Hage, 1976; Loeber & Farrington, 1998). One way to reduce antisocial behavior in adolescents is to encourage such youths to interact with better adapted youths under the supervision of a mental health worker (Feldman et al., 1983). Sibling rivalry is a common component of family life and, especially in the presence of other risk factors, may contribute to family stresses (Patterson & Dishion, 1988). Although almost universal, in the presence of other risk factors it may be the origin of aggressive behavior that eventually extends beyond the family (Patterson & Dishion, 1988). In stressed or large families, parents have many demands placed on their time and find it difficult to oversee, or place limits on, their young children's behavior. When parental attention is in short supply, young siblings squabbling with each other attract available attention. In such situations, parents rarely comment on good or neutral behavior but do pay attention, even if in a highly critical and negative way, when their children start to fight; as a result, the act of fighting may be inadvertently rewarded. Thus, any attention, whether it be praise or physical punishment, increases the likelihood that the behavior is repeated. Correlations and Interactions Among Risk Factors Recent evidence suggests that social/environmental risk factors may combine with physical risk factors of the child, such as neurological damage caused by birth complications or low birthweight, fearlessness and stimulation-seeking behavior, learning impairments, autonomic underarousal, and insensitivity to physical pain and punishment (Raine et al., 1996, 1997, 1998). However, testing models of the impact of risk factor interactions for the development of mental disorders is difficult, because some of the risk factors are difficult to measure. Thus, the trend these days is to move away from the consideration of individual risk factors toward identifying measurable risk factors and their combinations and incorporating all of them into a single model that can be tested (Patterson, 1996). The next section describes a series of preventive interventions directed against the environmental risk factors described above.22Prevention Childhood is an important time to prevent mental disorders and to promote healthy development, because many adult mental disorders have related antecedent problems in childhood. Thus, it is logical to try to intervene early in children''s lives before problems are established and become more refractory. The field of prevention has now developed to the point that reduction of risk, prevention of onset, and early intervention are realistic possibilities. Scientific methodologies in prevention are increasingly sophisticated, and the results from high-quality research trials are as credible as those in other areas of biomedical and psychosocial science. There is a growing recognition that prevention does work; for example, improving parenting skills through training can substantially reduce antisocial behavior in children (Patterson et al., 1993). The wider human services and law enforcement communities, not just the mental health community, have made prevention a priority. Policymakers and service providers in health, education, social services, and juvenile justice have become invested in intervening early in children''s lives: they have come to appreciate that mental health is inexorably linked with general health, child care, and success in the classroom and inversely related to involvement in the juvenile justice system. It is also perceived that investment in prevention may be cost-effective. Although much research still needs to be done, communities and managed health care organizations eager to develop, maintain, and measure empirically supported preventive interventions are encouraged to use a risk and evidence-based framework developed by the National Mental Health Association (Mrazek, 1998). Some forms of primary prevention are so familiar that they are no longer thought of as mental health prevention activities, when, in fact, they are. For example, vaccination against measles prevents its neurobehavioral complications; safe sex practices and maternal screening prevent newborn infections such as syphilis and HIV, which also have neurobehavioral manifestations. Efforts to control alcohol use during pregnancy help prevent fetal alcohol syndrome (Stratton et al., 1996). All these conditions may produce mental disorders in children...23III.

The Prevention of Mental Disorders in School-Aged Children: State of the Field Excerpts from Greenberg, Domitrovich, & Bumbarger (2001). Prevention & Treatment , 4(1) The Role of Risk and Protective Factors in Preventive Interventions Public health models have long based their interventions on reducing the risk factors for disease or disorder as well as promoting processes that buffer or protect against risk. Community-wide programs have focused on reducing both environmental and individual behavioral risks for both heart and lung disease and have demonstrated positive effects on health behaviors as well as reductions in smoking (Farquhar et al., 1990; Jacobs et al., 1986; Pushka, Tuomilehto, Nissinen, & Korhonen, 1989). Risk factors and their operation. During the past decades, a number of risk factors have been identified that place children at increased risk for psychopathology. Coie et al. (1993, p. 1022) grouped empirically derived, generic risk factors into the following seven individual and environmental domains: 1. Constitutional handicaps : perinatal complications, neurochemical imbalance, organic handicaps, and sensory disabilities; 2. Skill development delays : low intelligence, social incompetence, attentional deficits, reading disabilities, and poor work skills and habits; 3. Emotional difficulties : apathy or emotional blunting, emotional immaturity, low self-esteem, and emotional dysregulation; 4. Family circumstances : low social class, mental illness in the family, large family size, child abuse, stressful life events, family disorganization, communication deviance, family conflict, and poor bonding to parents; 5. Interpersonal problems : peer rejection, alienation, and isolation; 6. School problems : scholastic demoralization and school failure; 7. Ecological risks : neighborhood disorganization, extreme poverty, racial injustice, and unemployment.25Theory and research support a number of observations about the operation of these risk factors and the development of behavioral maladaptation. First, development is complex and it is unlikely that there is a single cause of, or risk factor for, any disorder. It is doubtful that most childhood social and behavioral disorders can be eliminated by only treating causes that are purported to reside in the child alone (Rutter, 1982). Furthermore, there are multiple pathways to most psychological disorders. That is, different combinations of risk factors may lead to the same disorder and no single cause may be sufficient to produce a specific negative outcome (Greenberg, Speltz, & DeKlyen, 1993). In addition, risk factors occur not only at individual or family levels, but at all levels within the ecological model (Kellam, 1990)... Protective factors and their operation. Protective factors are variables that reduce the likelihood of maladaptive outcomes under conditions of risk. Although less is known about protective factors and their operation (Kazdin, 1991; Luthar, 1993; Rutter, 1985), at least three broad domains of protective factors have been identified. The first domain includes characteristics of the individual such as cognitive skills, social-cognitive skills, temperamental characteristics, and social skills (Luthar & Zigler, 1992). The quality of the child's interactions with the environment comprise the second domain. These interactions include secure attachments to parents (Morissett, Barnard, Greenberg, Booth, & Spieker, 1990) and attachments to peers or other adults who engage in positive health behaviors and have prosocial values (Hawkins & Catalano, 1992). A third protective domain involves aspects of the mesosystem and exosystem, such as school-home relations, quality schools, and regulatory activities. Similar to risk factors, some protective factors may be more malleable and thus, more effective targets for prevention... Preventive Intervention: Definition of Levels The Institute of Medicine (1994) report clarified the placement of preventive intervention within the broader mental health intervention framework by differentiating it from treatment (i.e., case identification; standard treatment for known disorders) and maintenance (i.e., compliance with long-term treatment to reduce relapse; after-care, including rehabilitation). Based, in part, on Gordon's (1983, 1987) proposal to replace the terms primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention, the IOM Report defined three forms of preventive intervention: universal, selective, and indicated. Notwithstanding the recent redefinition of prevention by NIMH (Greenberg & Weissberg, in press; National Institute of Mental Health, 1998), we retain the distinctions as defined by the IOM report as well as the recent Surgeon General's report (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1999). Universal preventive interventions target the general public or a whole population group that has not been identified on the basis of individual risk. Exemplars include prenatal care, childhood immunization, and school-based competence enhancement programs. Because universal programs are positive, proactive, and provided independent of risk status, their potential for stigmatizing participants is minimized and they may be more readily accepted and adopted. Selective interventions target26individuals or a subgroups (based on biological or social risk factors) whose risk of developing mental disorders is significantly higher than average. Examples of selective intervention programs include: home visitation and infant day care for low-birth weight children, preschool programs for all children from poor neighborhoods, and support groups for children who have suffered losses/traumas. Indicated preventive interventions target individuals who are identified as having prodromal signs or symptoms or biological markers related to mental disorders, but who do not yet meet diagnostic criteria. Providing social skills or parent-child interaction training for children who have early behavioral problems are examples of indicated interventions... Effective Preventive Interventions: Universal Programs Fourteen universal programs were identified as meeting our criteria for inclusion based on study design and positive outcomes related to psychopathology. For ease of discussion, they can be classified into 4 categories: violence prevention programs; more generic social/cognitive skill-building programs, programs focused on changing the school ecology, and multi-component, multi-domain programs. Although we will use this typology for discussion purposes, in actuality the programs do not fall along a linear continuum and may include characteristics of more than one of the above categories. This typology is useful however in that it is somewhat representative of the recent progress of prevention science, as the field continues to move in the direction of comprehensive, multi-system programs that target multiple risk factors across both individual and ecological domains...27III.

Currently, there are about 91,000 public schools in about 15,000 districts. Over the years, most (but obviously not all)schools have instituted program s designed with a range of behavior, emotional, and learning, problems in mind.Schoolbased and school-linked programs have beendeveloped for purposes of early intervention, crisisintervention and prevention, treatment, and promotion ofpositive social and emotional development. Some programsare provided throughout a district, others are carried out ator linked to targeted schools. The interventions may beoffered to all students in a school, to those in specifiedgrades, or to those identified as \"at risk.\" The activities maybe implemented in regular or special education classroomsor as \"pull out\" programs and may be designed for an entireclass, groups, or individuals. There also may be a focus onprimary prevention and enhancement of healthydevelopment through use of health education, healthservices, guidance, and so forth - though relatively fewresources usually are allocated for such activity. There is a large body of research supporting the promise of specificfacets of this activity. However, no one has yet designed astudy to evaluate the impact of the type of comprehensive,multifaceted approach needed to deal with the complex range of problems confronting schools.************************ It is either naive or irresponsible to ignore the connectionbetween children's performance in school and theirexperiences with malnutrition, homelessness, lack ofmedical care, inadequate housing, racial and culturaldiscrimination, and other burdens ************************ consider the American penchant for ignoring thestructural causes of problems.

Gladstone, Ph.D. (http://www.mhsource.com/depression/youth.html) Excerpt: ...A review of these prevention programs and our experience developing and implementing a family-based preventive intervention program reveal six key points that we believe may prove helpful in treating children at risk for depression. Resilience Resilience refers to competence despite adversity (Luthar et al., in press) and provides an important foundation for the treatment of children with depression. Treatment of children at risk for depression must focus on identifying children''s strengths and resources and on encouraging the development of factors that may protect children from the onset of illness. Our work with at-risk pre-adolescents has indicated that resilient children remained active in school and social activities outside of the home, maintained a view of themselves as separate from their parents'' illness, and developed relationships with adults outside of the family (Beardslee and Podorefsky, 1988). Treatment with mildly depressed or at-risk children must focus on enhancing these characteristics. Historically, research on childhood depression has focused on clinical trials and longitudinal outcome studies, rather than on prevention. In recent years, however, with advances in the science of prevention, data suggest that those at risk for depression can be identified before symptoms emerge (Hammen et al., 1990; Lewinsohn et al., 1994). Examples of successful prevention trials (Mrazek and Hagerty, 1994; National Institute of Mental Health, 1993) have prompted researchers to attend to the primary prevention of depression in youth (Beardslee and Gladstone, 2001). In fact, research on childhood depression has shifted from tertiary treatment efforts to primary prevention studies and from primary prevention approaches aimed at general, unselected populations to prevention programs that focus on populations identified as having an increased risk of future depression. Prevention programs for childhood depression must be informed by research on factors that place youngsters at risk for the disorder. This will enable us to know which factors to target in treating and preventing this disorder in children either at risk for depression or already exhibiting symptoms of depression. To date, research on risk factors for youth depression reveals that, among other factors, depression in children has been associated with a history of psychopathology, suicide attempts, depressotypic cognitive style, low self-esteem, poor social support, lack of peer acceptance and hostile relationships with peers (Lewinsohn et al., 1994; Reinherz et al., 1999;31Psychoeducation In our work with families with parental depression, we found that adults knew little about this disorder and that children frequently did not have a name for their parent''s depressed mood or irritability. Providing at-risk children with information about depression, identifying symptoms as an illness rather than as difficult behavior, and defining depression as a highly treatable mental illness will help reduce children''s feelings of guilt or fear about their parents'' or their own symptoms. In addition, providing children with information about causes, symptoms and risk factors for depression may assist them in identifying their own symptoms and seeking help when necessary. Family-based Approach Depression influences marital and family functioning (Keitner and Miller, 1990), and family members reinforce depressive behaviors in each other (Kaslow and Racusin, 1994), thus supporting the use of a family-centered approach in preventing the onset of depression in children at risk for depression. Parental involvement in treating at-risk children is crucial to successful prevention in this population, as parents may provide support and encourage resilience so that children are better able to negotiate developmental challenges successfully. We have found that families with parental depression are characterized by poor cross-generational communication, poor understanding of disorder by children and feelings of guilt among children for any role they may have played in their parent''s illness (Beardslee et al., 1997). Family meetings and family involvement in treatment may address these concerns and promote understanding and communication in families with depression. The principles of family-based prevention recently have been presented in a format that families themselves can use (Beardslee, 2002). Developmental Perspective Intervention for children at risk for depression must attend to developmental issues as well as emotional concerns. In fact, the risks for depression, and the valence of those risks, shift over the life span, and the expression of symptoms of depression varies developmentally. Thus, an intervention approach that is appropriate for a 4-year-old may be quite different from one that is appropriate for a 14-year-old. For example, parental involvement in intervention is appropriate for early adolescents, but a peer focus group may be more useful with young adults as they make the transition from home to college or the work force. Address All Risks Research tells us that depression in parents or children often signals a constellation of risk factors that, when considered together, puts children at risk for poor outcomes. In fact, social adversity predicts poor mental health outcomes in children, even beyond the effects of parental mood disorder (Rutter, 1986 as cited in Beardslee et al., 1996). Thus, comprehensive concern for the prevention of childhood depression must be based on all the risks a child faces, and treatment must attend to the range of risks present in any child, particularly in children who face social disadvantage.32Treatment Although primary prevention programs aim to reach youth before they are ill, an essential precondition for prevention involves competent treatment for all those who experience illness. It is crucial that adequate treatment for children and adults who already suffer from illness be incorporated into any prevention approach. In fact, illness cannot be prevented in children at risk for depression until their parents who suffer from mental illness receive appropriate treatment services. Conclusions Successful preventive interventions offer great benefit to families because they can relieve the enormous burden of suffering caused by mental illness. The study of prevention requires new, nontraditional ways of thinking, however; and scientific advances in neuroscience and developmental epidemiology have provided an empirical knowledge base from which to mount prevention efforts. In addition, prevention programs targeting children at risk for disorder must consider the plasticity of development and the multiple influences on children''s development. Current research in neuroscience emphasizes the capacity of individuals to change and grow. Knowledge of what influences plasticity at the molecular, individual and familial levels, even in the face of significant adversity, is needed to guide the development of preventive interventions across the life span. Finally, advocates for the study of the prevention of depression must recognize the need for comprehensive programs to prevent risk factors for depression, including exposure to violence, social isolation and discrimination. Indeed, from a public health point of view, those concerned about the prevention of depression can find common ground with others in advocating for adequate health care for all children and all caregivers.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ERIC, CONTACT ACCESS ERIC 1-800-LET-ERIC Loneliness is a significant problem that can predispose young children to immediate and long-term negative consequences. However, only recently have research and intervention in educational settings focused on young children who are lonely. It is becoming increasingly clear that many young children understand the concept of loneliness and report feeling lonely. For example, kindergarten and first- grade children responded appropriately to a series of questions regarding what loneliness is (\"being sad and alone\"), where it comes from (\"nobody to play with\"), and what one might do to overcome feelings of loneliness (\"find a friend\") (Cassidy & Asher, 1992). In a more recent study (Ladd, Kochenderfer, & Coleman, 1996), kindergarten children's loneliness in school was reliably measured with a series of questions such as, \"Are you lonely in school?\"; \"Is school a lonely place for you?\"; and \"Are you sad and alone in school?\" These studies suggest that young children's concepts of loneliness have meaning to them and are similar to those shared by older children and adults. This Digest presents an overview of loneliness with suggestions for practitioners on how they can apply the research in early childhood settings. CONSEQUENCES OF LONELINESS Children who feel lonely often experience poor peer relationships and therefore express more loneliness than peers with friends. They often feel excluded--a feeling that can be damaging to their self-esteem. In addition, they may experience feelings of sadness, malaise, boredom, and alienation. Furthermore, early childhood experiences that contribute to loneliness may predict loneliness during adulthood. Consequently, lonely children may miss out on many opportunities to interact with their peers and to learn important lifelong skills. Given the importance placed on the benefits of peer interactions and friendships to children's development, this potential lack of interaction raises many concerns for teachers who work with young children. Peer relations matter to children, and lonely children place as much importance on them as do other children (Ramsey, 1991). CONTRIBUTING FACTORS OF LONELINESS Several factors contribute to feelings of loneliness in young children. Some that occur outside of the school setting are conflict within the home; moving to a new school or neighborhood; losing a friend; losing an object, possession, or pet; experiencing the divorce of parents; or experiencing the death of a pet or significant person. Equally important are factors that occur within the child's school setting, such as being rejected by peers; lacking social skills and knowledge of how to make friends; or possessing personal characteristics (e.g., shyness, anxiety, and low self-esteem) that contribute to difficulties in making friends. Kindergarten children who are victimized by peers (e.g., picked on, or physically or verbally attacked or taunted) report higher levels of loneliness, distress, and negative attitudes toward school than nonvictimized children (Kochenderfer & Ladd, 1996). 37OBSERVING AND ASSESSING YOUNG CHILDREN Participating in careful observation of children is a necessary first step to gain insights into children's loneliness. While observing children, teachers can focus on the following, which may suggest signs of loneliness: Does the child appear timid, anxious, unsure of himself or herself, or sad? Does the child show a lack of interest in the surroundings? Does the child seem to be rejected by playmates? Does the child avoid other children by choice? Does the child appear to lack social skills that might prevent him or her from initiating or maintaining interactions? Does the child have the necessary social skills but is reluctant to use them? Is the child victimized by peers? Does the child's apparent loneliness seem to be a consistent pattern over time, or is it a more recent phenomenon? In addition, because loneliness cannot always be observed in children (e.g., there are children who appear to have friends but report feeling lonely), teachers can spend time talking individually with children. They might ask children, \"What does sad and lonely mean?\"; \"Are you sad and lonely?\"; or \"What would make you happier?\" (Cassidy & Asher, 1992; Ladd, Kochenderfer, & Coleman, 1996). When observing and assessing children, it is important to be sensitive to and aware of their developmental abilities and personal inclinations. For example, it has been suggested that young children who play alone may be at increased risk for later problems, both socially and cognitively. Many preschool and kindergarten children, however, engage in nonsocial activities that are highly predictive of competence. Therefore, over time, teachers need to observe children's interactions with their peers, talk to children about their feelings, and document their behaviors and responses to determine whether they are lonely or are happily and productively self-engaged. INTERVENTION STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS Although research in support of specific practices assisting lonely children in the classroom is weak, teachers might consider several approaches that may be adapted to individual children. Children who are aggressive report the greatest degrees of loneliness and social dissatisfaction (Asher, Parkhurst, Hymel, & Williams, 1990). Children are rejected for many reasons, and teachers will need to assess the circumstances that seem to lead to the rejection. Is the child acting aggressively toward others? Does the child have difficulty entering ongoing play and adapting to the situation? Does the child have difficulty communicating needs and desires? Once the problem is identified, teachers can assist the child in changing the situation. The teacher can point out the effects of the child's behavior on others, show the child how to adapt to the ongoing play, or help the child to clearly communicate feelings and desires. Children who are supported, nurtured, and cherished are less likely to be rejected and more likely to interact positively with peers (Honig & Wittmer, 1996). Children who are neglected or withdrawn also report feelings of loneliness, although to a lesser extent than do aggressive-rejected children. Because these children often lack social skills, they have difficulty interacting with their peers. These children may also be extremely shy, inhibited, and anxious, and they may lack self-confidence (Rubin, LeMare, & Lollis, 1990). If children lack certain skills, the teacher can focus on giving feedback, suggestions, and ideas that the child can implement. Children who possess adequate social skills but are reluctant to use them can be given opportunities for doing so by being paired with younger children. This experience gives the older child an opportunity to practice skills and boost self-confidence. Children who are victimized by others believe that school is an unsafe and threatening place and often express a dislike for school. Furthermore, these children report lingering feelings of loneliness and a desire to avoid school even when victimization ceases (Kochenderfer & Ladd, 1996). These findings point to the importance of implementing immediate intervention strategies to reduce victimization. Teachers can provide firm but supportive suggestions to the aggressor. For example, teachers might guide and assist children in developing the life skills they need, such as respecting others and self, engaging in problem solving, working together on skills and tasks that require cooperation, and expressing feelings and emotions in appropriate ways (Gartrell, 1997). 38 Teachers can think about how the curricula might be helpful to a child who is feeling lonely. Some children may benefit by being given opportunities to express their feelings of sadness or loneliness through manipulation, drawing, movement, music, or creative activities (Edwards, Gandini, & Forman, 1993). Arranging the dramatic play area with props may help some children act out or express their feelings and feel a sense of control. Use of crisis-oriented books with children, referred to as bibliotherapy, may assist a child in coping with a personal crisis. Sharing carefully selected literature with children may assist in facilitating emotional health. Children who are able to express and articulate their concerns may want to talk about their unhappiness. Developing close relationships with children and communicating with their primary caregivers can give teachers valuable insights and guidance. When teachers become aware of children who are experiencing loneliness caused by a family situation, they can lend their support in a variety of ways. Spending extra time listening can be reassuring and helpful to some children. Suggesting to a parent the possibility of inviting a peer over to the child's home may be a good idea and may help the child to form a friendship. In addition, teachers can ask parents for their recommendations about what might make the child feel more comfortable at school, and they can share relevant resources with parents, such as literature or information on parent discussion groups. CONCLUSION The issues of loneliness were once considered relevant only to adolescents and adults. Research suggests that this notion is misguided and that a small but significant portion of young children do in fact experience feelings of loneliness (Asher, Parkhurst, Hymel, & Williams, 1990). As a result, the immediate and long-term negative consequences associated with loneliness in children are becoming apparent, and the need to observe children and to develop and implement intervention strategies is becoming critical. When teachers take time to focus on individual needs of children, build relationships, and assist them with their needs, children thrive (Kontos & Wilcox-Herzog, 1997). 39REFERENCES Asher, S.

C. Responding to the First Signs of Problems: Depression in School HealthyPlace.com Depression Community (http://www.healthyplace.com/Communities/Depression/related/school.asp) C. Depression in School: A Student's Trial Teachers are trained to handle students who lack discipline, the slow learners, the extremely bright, and even kids faced with ADHD. What I've discovered, though, is that they aren't prepared to teach the students suffering from depression. Just like anyone else, teachers are very perceptive when it comes to identifying disturbed, possibly depressed students in their class, yet they often seem incapable of and uninterested in helping that student. When I was depressed my sophomore and junior years in high school, the academic world was the last place I wanted to be. Like anyone suffering from depression, I wasn't deliberately trying to disrespect the teacher's efforts to conduct a class, but the depression overwhelmed me so that I could only see things in the broad spectrum, as opposed to concentrating on one situation at a time, such as a single class. I found that the majority of my teachers dealt with me in one of two ways. The solution easiest for them was to ignore the fact that I wasn't absorbing any of the information being taught and simply assume that the apathy they were perceiving was typical of high schoolers. The other path was that of talking to me on a personal level. I think we are all aware of the very well defined student-teacher line; therefore, for teachers to ask the student to discuss their problems puts them in a very awkward position. Teachers are different from other adults because they hold a position of superiority over students that is especially apparent when discussing something of a personal matter. Teachers can help to lighten a depressed student's load by creating a comfortable classroom where the student knows he/she is cared for and where the student doesn't have a time limit to suddenly cheer up. Depression takes a lot of time to get over, and school does not have to be a negative place of responsibility. If I had had a teacher that did at least one of the following things during the period of time I was depressed, I might have turned my act around a little sooner, or I might have had a more positive outcome in school. Three tips for dealing with students who are depressed in the classroom: 1.Don't ignore depressed students. It shows that you don't care and invites the students to give up, guaranteeing their failure. Draw them out in class discussion and do whatever it takes to stimulate their minds so that they don't, in turn, learn to ignore you. 2.Let them know that you care, but without getting too personal. Help them to update any missing assignments, or set up extra study time - whether they accept your efforts or not all depends upon the severity of the depression . The fact that you've proven you care can make all the difference in the world. 3.Never give up on the student - regardless of how long they haven't wanted to put forth any effort in your class. Students can tell when a teacher no longer believes in them and expects them to fail, and it only ends up making the situation worse than necessary. Contributed By Alexandra Madison 41IV. D.

Unrealistic academic, social, or family expectations can create a strong sense of rejection and can lead to deep disappointment. When things go wrong at school or at home, teens often overreact. Many young people feel that life is not fair or that things \"never go their way.\" They feel \"stressed out\" and confused. To make matters worse, teens are bombarded by conflictingmessages from parents, friends and society. Toda y's teens see more of what life has to offer \u2014\u2014 both good and bad \u2014\u2014 on television, at school, in magazines and on the Internet. They arealso forced to learn about the threat of AIDS, ev en if they are not sexually active or using drugs. Teens need adult guidance more than ever to understand all the emotional and physical changes they are experiencing. When teens'' moods disrupt their ability to function on a day-to-day basis,it may indicate a serious emotional or mental disorder that needs attention \u2014\u2014 adolescentdepression. Parents or caregivers must take action. Dealing With Adolescent Pressures When teens feel down, there are ways they can cope with these feelings to avoid serious depression. All of these suggestions help develop a sense of acceptance and belonging that is soimportant to adolescents. Try to make new friends. Healthy relationships with peers are central to teens'' self- esteem and provide an important social outlet. Participate in sports, job, school activities or hobbies. Staying busy helps teens focus on positive activities rather than negative feelings or behaviors. Join organizations that offer programs for young people. Special programs geared to the needs of adolescents help develop additional interests. Ask a trusted adult for help. When problems are too much to handle alone, teens should not be afraid to ask for help. But sometimes, despite everyone''s best efforts, teens become depressed. Many factors can contribute to depression. Studies show that some depressed people have too much or too little of certain brain chemicals. Also, a family history of depression may increase the risk for developing depression. Other factors that can contribute to de pression are difficult life events (such as death or divorce), side-effects from some medications and negative thought patterns. 42Recognizing Adolescent Depression Adolescent depression is increasing at an alarming rate. Recent surveys indicate that as many as one in five teens suffers from clinical depression. This is a serious problem that calls for prompt, appropriate treatment. Depression can take seve ral forms, including bipolar disorder (formally called manic-depression), which is a condition that alternates between periods of euphoria anddepression. Depression can be difficult to diagnose in teens because adults may expect teens to act moody. Also, adolescents do not always understand or expr ess their feelings very well. They may not be aware of the symptoms of depression and may not seek help. These symptoms may indicate depression, particularly when they last for more than two weeks: Poor performance in school Withdrawal from friends and activities Sadness and hopelessness Lack of enthusiasm, energy or motivation Anger and rage Overreaction to criticism Feelings of being unable to satisfy ideals Poor self-esteem or guilt Indecision, lack of concentration or forgetfulness Restlessness and agitation Changes in eating or sleeping patterns Substance abuse Problems with authority Suicidal thoughts or actions Teens may experiment with drugs or alcohol or become sexually promiscuous to avoid feelings of depression. Teens also may express their depression through hostile, aggressive, risk-takingbehavior. But such behaviors only lead to ne w problems, deeper levels of depression and destroyed relationships with friends, fam ily, law enforcement or school officials. Treating Adolescent Depression It is extremely important that depressed teens receive prompt, professional treatment. Depression is serious and, if left untreated, can worsen to the point of becoming life-threatening. Ifdepressed teens refuse treatment, it may be necessary for family members or other concernedadults to seek professional advice. 43Therapy can help teens understand why they are depressed and learn how to cope with stressful situations. Depending on the situation, treatment may consist of individual, group or familycounseling. Medications that can be prescribed by a psychiatrist may be necessary to help teens feelbetter. Some of the most common and effective ways to treat depression in adolescents are: Psychotherapy provides teens an opportunity to e xplore events and feelings that are painful or troubling to them. Psychotherapy also teaches them coping skills. Cognitive-behavioral therapy helps teens change negative patterns of thinking and behaving. Interpersonal therapy focuses on how to develop healthier relationships at home and at school. Medication relieves some symptoms of depression and is often prescribed along with therapy. When depressed adolescents recognize the need for help, they have taken a major step toward recovery. However, remember that few adolescents seek help on their own. They may needencouragement from their friends and support from concerned adults to seek help and followtreatment recommendations. Facing The Danger Of Teen Suicide Sometimes teens feel so depressed that they consider ending their lives. Each year, almost 5,000 young people, ages 15 to 24, kill themselves. The rate of suicide for this age group has nearly tripledsince 1960, making it the third leading cause of death in adolescents and the second leading cause ofdeath among college-age youth. Studies show that suicide attempts among young people may be based on long-standing problems triggered by a specific event. Suicidal adolescents may view a temporary situation as a permanentcondition. Feelings of anger and resentment combined with exaggerated guilt can lead to impulsive,self-destructive acts. Recognizing The Warning Signs Four out of five teens who attempt suicide have given clear warnings. Pay attention to these warning signs: Suicide threats, direct and indirect Obsession with death Poems, essays and drawings that refer to death Dramatic change in personality or appearance Irrational, bizarre behavior Overwhelming sense of guilt, shame or rejection Changed eating or sleeping patterns Severe drop in school performance Giving away belongings REMEMBER!!! These warning signs should be taken seriously. Obtain help immediately.Caring and support can save a young life. 44Helping Suicidal Teens Offer help and listen. Encourage depressed teens to talk about their feelings. Listen, don''t lecture. Trust your instincts. If it seems that the situation may be serious, seek prompt help. Break a confidence if necessary, in order to save a life. Pay attention to talk about suicide. Ask direct questions and don''t be afraid of frank discussions. Silence is deadly! Seek professional help. It is essential to seek expert advice from a mental health professional who has experience helping depressed teens. Also, alert key adults in the teen''slife \u2014\u2014 family, friends and teachers. Looking To The Future When adolescents are depressed, they have a tough time believing that their outlook can improve. But professional treatment can have a dramatic impact on their lives. It can put them back on trackand bring them hope for the future.

E. Responding to the First Signs of Problems: Children and Depression E. Children and Depression Accommodations to Reduce Affect and Mood Problems by Janzen, HJ & Saklofske, DH National Association of School Psychologists \u00bbBackground Depressed mood is a common and universal part of human experience that can occur at any age and hasvarious causes. Over time, many children report orgive the appearance of feeling unhappy, sad,dejected, irritable, \"down\" or \"blue\" but most of them quickly and spontaneously recover from these briefand normal moods or emotional states. However, forothers, the depression can be severe and long lasting,and interfere with all aspects of daily life from schoolachievement to social relationships. The incidence of more severe depression in children is probably less than 10% although exactfigures are not known. Girls are more likely than boysto develop mood disorders. The associated risk ofsuicide increases significantly during adolescence. \u00bbDevelopment Recognizing and diagnosing childhood depression isnot always an easy task. The onset of depression canbe gradual or sudden, it may be a brief or long termepisode, and may be associated with other disorderssuch as anxiety. The presence of one or twosymptoms is not sufficient evidence of a depressivedisorder. It is when a group of such symptoms occurtogether over time that a more serious mood disordershould be considered. The DSM-III- R manualpublished by the American Psychiatric Associationclassified depression according to severity, durationand type. The definition of major depression requires the presence of five or more of the following symptoms forat least two weeks. One or both of the essentialfeatures of depressed or limitable mood, and loss ofinterest or pleasure in almost all activities must beobserved. Other symptoms include appetitedisturbance and significant weight loss or gain, sleepdifficulties or too much sleep, slow or agitated andrestless behavior (many depressed children becomeoverly aggressive), decreased energy or fatigue,feeling of worthlessness or self-blame and guilt,concentration and thinking difficulties, and thoughts ofdeath or suicide. Less severe forms of depression include dysthymia (moderately depressed mood over oneyear) and adjustment disorder with depressed moodcaused by some known stress and lasting less than 6months. Depressive features will vary in relation to theage and developmental level of the child. For example,physical complaints, agitation, anxiety and fears aremore often seen in younger children while adolescentsare more likely to engage in antisocial behavior orbecome sulky, overly emotional, and withdrawn. There are a number of suggested causes of childhood depression. Biological explanations ofdepression have examined the roles of hereditary,biochemical, hormonal, and brain factors. Morerecently, the amount of li ght associated with seasonal changes has been suspected to affect mood. Psychological descriptions have linked depression to the loss of loved ones, disturbances in parent-childrelationships, and threats to self-esteem. Attention has also been focused on the way children interpret and structure everyday exper iences and the belief they have about their ability to control and shape their world. Any of a number of psychological stressors may be able to significantly affect the mood of somechildren. Given the various kinds and causes of childhood depression, there are different treatments that may be required. The \"treatm ent\" for the disappointment that follows the loss of a ball game may be a visit to the local hamburger restaurant, or the feelings of failure and irritability caused by a poor school markcould signal the need to improve study habits and pay46closer attention in school. When the signs of depression described above occur and persist, theprofessional assistance of a psychologist orpsychiatrist should be obtained. Antidepressant(tricyclics and MAO inhi bitors) and antianxiety medications are very beneficial in the treatment ofsevere depression. Several effective forms ofpsychological treatment include behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and interpersonal (IPT) therapy. Combined medication and psychotherapy programs arefrequently employed in the treatment of depression. \u00bbWhat can I do as a parent? The list of suggestions follows the most frequentlycited symptoms of childhood depression. \u2014Self-esteem and self-critical tendencies: give and genuine praise; accentuate self-cri ticism; point out negative thinking. \u2014Family stability: maintain routine and minimize changes in family matters; discuss changesbeforehand and reduce worry. \u2014Helplessness and hopelessness: have the child write or tell immediate feelings and any pleasantaspects 3 or 4 times a day to increase pleasantthoughts over 4-6 weeks. \u2014Mood elevation: arrange one interesting activity a day; plan for special events to come; discussenjoyable topics. \u2014Appetite and weight probl ems: don't force favorite foods; make pleasant occasion. \u2014Sleep difficulties: keep regular bed-time hours; do relaxing and calming activities one hour before bed-time such as reading or listening to soft music; end theday on a \"positive note.\" \u2014Agitation and restlessness: agitation; teach the child to relax; massagemay help; encourage physical and recreationactivities. \u2014Excessive anxiety-causing situations and uncertainty; be may reduce uncertainty; relaxation exercisesmight help. \u2014Aggression and anger: convey a kind but firm unacceptance of destructive behavior; encourage thechild to his angry feelings; do not react with anger. \u2014Concentration and thinking difficulties: encourage increased participation in games, activities,discussions; work with the teachers and schoolpsychologist to promote learning. \u2014Suicidal thoughts: be aware of the warning signs of suicide; immediately seek professional help.\u2014if depression persists: consult your family doctor for a complete medical exam; seek a referral to apsychologist or psychiatrist.

Interventions for Serious Problems: Depression: Understanding the Problem 1a. Mood Disorders in Children and Adolescentsby Anne Brown Adapted from an an article of the same name in the NARSAD Research Newsletter, Winter 1996. Many researchers believe that mood disorders in children and adolescents represent one of the most under diagnosed group of illnesses in psychiatry. This is due to several factors: (1)children are not always able to express how they feel, (2) the symptoms of mood disorders take on different forms in children than in adults, (3) mood disorders are often accompanied by other psychiatric disorders which can mask depressive symptoms, and (4) many physicians tend to think of depression and bipolar disorder as illnesses of adulthood. Not surprisingly, it was only in the 1980's that mood disorders in children were included in the category of diagnosed psychiatric illnesses. How Prevalent are Mood Disorders in Children and Adolescents? 7-14% of children will experience an episode of major depression before the age of 15. 20-30% of adult bipolar patients report having their first episode before the age of 20. Out of 100,000 adolescents, two to three thousand will have mood disorders out of which 8-10 will commit suicide. Depression There is emerging evidence that major depression can develop in prepubertal children and that it is a significant clinical occurrence among adolescents. Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that a large proportion of adults experience the onset of major depression during adolescence and early adulthood. By studying high-risk populations for developing childhood mood disorders, researchers hope to learn more about the onset and course of depression. Myrna M. Weissman, Ph.D. of Columbia University (a NARSAD Established Investigator and 1994 Selo Prize Co-Winner) has found an increased prevalence of major depression as well as a variety of other psychiatric problems in the children of depressed parents compared with those of normal parents. Specifically, she has discovered that the onset of major depression was significantly earlier in both male and female children of depressed parents (mean age of 12.7 years) compared with those of normal parents (mean age, 16.8 years). She has also observed sex differences in rates of depression to begin in adolescence. Before 10 years of age, she found a low frequency and equal sex ratio, however by 16 years of age, there was a marked increase in major depression in girls, as compared to boys of the same age. The essential features of mood disorders are the same in children as in adults, although children exhibit the symptoms differently. Unlike adults, children may not have the vocabulary to accurately describe how they feel and, therefore may express their problems through behavior. The following behaviors may be associated with mood disorders in children: In Preschool Children : Somber Appearance, almost ill-looking; they lack the bounce of their nondepressed peers. They may be tearful or spontaneously irritable, not just upset when they do not get their way. They make frequent negative self-statements and are often self-destructive. 49In Elementary School-Aged Children and Adolescence : Disruptiv e behavior, possible academic difficulties, and peer problems. Increased irritability and aggression, suicidal threats, and worsening school performance. Parents often say that nothing pleases the children, that they hate themselves and everything around them. Bipolar Disorder There has been a great deal of diagnostic uncertainty surrounding bipolar disorder in children. This may be caused by a major difference in the way mania is expressed in bipolar children versus adults. A look back at the histories of adults with bipolar symptoms often shows that mood swings began around puberty, however there is a frequent 5-to-10 year lag between the onset of symptoms and display of the disorder serious enou gh to be recognized and require treatment, resulting in the under diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Unlike adult bipolar patients, manic children are seldom characterized by euphoric mood. Rather, the most common mood disturbance in manic children may be better described as irritable, with \"affective storms\" or prolonged and aggressive temper outbursts. For example, a study by Gabrielle A. Carlson, M.D. of State University of New York-Stony Brook, found that bipolar children under the age of 9 had more irritability, crying, and motor agitation as compared to older bipolar children, who were more likely to have \"classically manic symptoms\" such as euphoria and grandiosity. In addition, it has been suggested that the course of childhood-onset bipolar disorder tends to be chronic and continuous rather than episodic and acute, as is the adult form of the disorder. Other aspects that make diagnosing bipolar disorder in children difficult is the frequency with which bipolar disorder is mistaken for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (which includes symptoms of socially unacceptable, violent or criminal behavior), or schizophrenia. Bipolar Disorder vs. Other Childhood Disorders ADHD and bipolar disorder have many overlapping features which include: distractibility, inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. However, bipolar disorder has several differentiating features, which include:psychosis, depression, aggression, excitability, rapid mood swings, inappropriate affect and disregard for feelings of others. Conduct disorder overlaps with bipolar disorder on symptoms such as: impulsivity, shoplifting, substance abuse, difficulties with the law and aggressiveness . However, in bipolar disorder, some distinguishing factors include: antisocial behavior with elevated or irritable mood and lack of peer group influence. When comparing schizophrenia and bipolar, their common symptoms include: grandiose and paranoid delusions and hallucinatory phenomena. However, in schizophrenia, differentiating features include: thought disorder and bizarre delusions. The widely accepted belief that childhood-onset mania is rare has recently been challenged. Many researchers including Janet Wozniak, M.D. of Harvard Medical School (a NARSAD Young Investigator) have shown a major overlap in the symptoms of mania and ADHD. Dr. Wozniak believes that this overlap may be responsible for the under identification and misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder. In her study of clinically referred children, she found 16% to have mania with irritable and mixed moods (i.e. with symptoms of depression and mania occurring simultaneously). Also, she found that the children meeting the criteria for mania frequently also met the criteria for ADHD (the rate of ADHD in children with mania was 98%, while the rate of mania in children with ADHD was only 20%). Schizophrenia has also been found to be mistaken for manic depression in adolescents. Despite the fact that psychotic features are a well-established part of adolescent manic-depressive illness, many clinicians continue to believe that thought disorder, grandiosity, and bizarre delusional and hallucinatory phenomena are distinctively characteristic of schizophrenia. Difficulties often arise in differentiating blunted from depressive affect and apathy from depression-induced delay in response time to questions. Treatments It is important for children suffering from mood disorders to receive prompt treatment because early onset places childr en at a greater risk for multiple episodes of depression throughout their life span. Children who50experience their first episode of depression before the age of 15 have a worse prognosis when compared with patients who had a later onset of the disorder. At the present time, there is no definitive treatment for the spectrum of mood disorders in children, although some research ers believe that children respond well to treatment because they readily adapt and their symptoms are not yet entrenched. Treatment consists of a combination of interventions. Medications can be useful for cases of major depression or childhood onset mania, and psychotherapy can help children express their feelings and develop ways of coping with the illness. Some other helpful interventions that may be used are educational and family therapy. Children suspected of mood disorders should be evaluated by a child psychiatrist, or if one is not available an adult psychiatrist who has experience in treating children. It is important that the clinician has had special training in speaking with children, utilizing play therapy, and can treat children in context of a family unit. Suicide An estimated 2,000 teenagers per year commit suicide in the United States, making it the leading cause of death after accidents and homicide. According to David Schaffer, M.D., of Columbia University ( a NARSAD Established Investigator), suicidal behavior is uncommon before puberty, with the incidence of suicide attempts reaching its peak at around age 15 and becoming less common by the late teens. Studies of adolescent suicides in New York, Pittsburgh and Finland indicate that approximately 90 percent of the teenagers who commit suicide have a psychiatric diagnosis, most often a form of mood disorder and/or alcohol or substance abuse. As in adults, suicide attempts occur more often in females (a ratio of 9 to 1), with overdose and wrist-cutting the most common means. Completed suicide occurs more often in males (a ratio of 3 to 1), usually white males, with shooting (62 percent) and hanging (19 percent) the most common means. Biological Theories on Suicide A number of biological theories are emerging to explain suicidal behavior. The available evidence points tohyposerotonergic functioning in studies of both completers and attempters. In suicide victims' brains, an increase in postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2 (5-HT2) receptors was found in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting that a compensatory increase in receptor density occurred in response to decreased serotonin release. The most robust findings in postmortem brains have been the measurements of low levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Those findings were localized to the brainstem (the level of cell bodies) and were not found in the cortex. Completers have also shown alterations in noradrenerg ic (the activation of norepinephrine in the transmission of nerve impulses) but not cholinergic (of autonomic nerve fibers) pathways. Several clinical studies have also found evidence of family histories of suicidal behavior, suggesting the likelihood of genetic factors playing a role in suicide. Twin studies provide evidence for genetic transmission of this vulnerability as twins share the same environment but differ in number of genes shared. Of 150 sets of twins reported in which at least one twin committed suicide, all 10 of the pairs in which both committed suicide were identical twins, and half of those were concordant for the same psychiatric illness. Identifying the Vulnerable Dr. Schaffer believes that screening out the vulnerable groups of children and adolescents for the risk factors of suicide and then referring them for treatment is the best way to lower the staggering teenage suicide rate. Students are regarded as high-risk if they have indicated suicidal ideation within the last three months, if they have ever made a prior suicide attempt, or if they indicate severe mood problems, excessive alcohol consumption or substance use. In summary, mood disorders in children and adolescents are much more common than was originally estimated. This underestimation was primarily due to the diagnostic confusion surrounding overlapping symptoms from other childhood disorders and the difference in the expression of mania in children versus adults. Many research efforts are underway to better diagnose and identify the children and adolescents who are at risk for mood disorders. It is hoped that by identifying the most vulnerable individuals and providing them with treatment, we will finally start to see a decline in the staggering suicide rates for adolescents. 51V. A. 1b.

Brief Notes on the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents Excerpt: The future of our country depends on the mental health and strength of our young people. However, many children have mental health problems that interfere with normal developmentand functioning. A 1999 study estimated that almost 21 percent of U.S. children ages 9 to 17 hada diagnosable mental or addictive disorder that caused at least some impairment. Whendiagnostic criteria were limited to significant functional impairment, the estimate dropped to 11 percent. Moreover, in any given year, it is estimated that fewer than one in five of these youthreceives needed treatment. Recent evidence compiled by the World Health Organizationindicates that by the year 2020, childhood neuropsyc hiatric disorders will rise proportionately by over 50 percent, internationally, to become one of the five most common causes of morbidity,mortality, and disability among children. The mental health problems affecting children andadolescents include the following: Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders, which include major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder , and bipolar disorder , adversely affect mood, energy, interest, sleep, appetite, and overall functioning. In contrast to the normal emotional experiences of sadness, feelings of loss, or passing mood states,symptoms of depressive disorders are extreme and persistent and can interfere significantly witha young person''s ability to function at home, at school, and with peers. Researchers estimatethat the prevalence of any form of depression among children and adolescents in the U.S. is morethan six percent in a six-month period, with almost five percent having major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder (major depression) is characterized by five or more of the following symptoms: persistent sad or irritable mood, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, significantchange in appetite or body weight, difficulty sl eeping or oversleeping, psychomotor agitation or slowing, loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, difficulty concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Dysthymic disorder , a typically less severe but more chronic form of depression, is diagnosed when depressed mood persists for at least one year inchildren and is accompanied by at least two other symptoms of depression (without meeting thecriteria for major depression). Youth with dysthym ic disorder are at risk for developing major depression. Although bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood, there is increasing evidence that this illness also can begin in childhood.According to one study, one percent of adolescents ages 14-18 were found to have met criteria52for bipolar disorder or cyclothymia, a similar but less severe illness, in their lifetime. Bipolar disorder beginning in childhood or early adoles cence may be a different, possibly more severe form of the illness than older adolescent- and adult-onset bipolar disorder. Research has revealedthat when the illness begins before or soon after puberty, it is often characterized by acontinuous, rapid-cycling, irritable, and mixed manic and depressive symptom state that may co-occur with disruptive behavior disorders, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) or conduct disorder (CD), or may have features of these disorders as initial symptoms. The manic symptoms of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents may include the following: either extremely irritable or overly silly and elated mood; overly-inflated self-esteem;exaggerated beliefs about personal talents or abilities; increased energy; decreased need forsleep; increased talking; distractibility; increased sexual thoughts, feelings, behaviors, or use ofexplicit sexual language; increased goal-directed activity or physical agitation; and excessiveinvolvement in risky behaviors or activities. There is evidence that depressive disorders emerging early in life often continue into adulthood, and that early-onset depressive disorders may predict more severe illnesses in adult life.Diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorder s in children and adolescents are critical for enabling young people with these illnesses to live up to their full potential. Depressive disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior. In 1999, suicide was the 3rd leading cause of death in 15-to 24-year-olds, following unintentional injuries (#1)and homicide (#2), and the 4th leading cause of death among 10- to 14-year-olds. Earlyidentification and treatment of depressive diso rders in young people may play an important role in reducing or preventing suicidal behavior. Both medication and specialized forms of psychotherapy are prescribed to treat depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Recent studies indicate that certain selective serotoninreuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are safe and efficacious treatments for major depression inyoung people. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven effective for treatingdepression in adolescents. The ongoing Treatme nt for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS), funded by NIMH, is comparing the effectiveness of an SSRI medication, CBT, andtheir combination to determine the best approach for treating major depression in teenagers.Other studies are evaluating the effectivene ss of different individual, family, and group psychotherapies for treating depressive disorders in young people. At present, the treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is based mainly on experience with adults, since as yet there are limited data on the safety and efficacy of treatmentsfor this disorder in young people. The essential treatment in adults involves the use of mood-stabilizing medications, typically lithium and/or valproate, which are often very effective forcontrolling mania and preventing recurrences of manic and depressive episodes. However,because medications may have different effects in children than they do in adults, they should becarefully monitored by a physician. For example, there is some evidence indicating thatvalproate may cause hormonal problems in teenage girls. Antidepressant medication, if needed,generally must be used together with a mood stabilizer, since antidepressants taken alone mayinduce manic symptoms or rapid cycling in pe ople with bipolar disorder. Current NIMH-funded studies are attempting to fill the gaps in knowledge about treatments for bipolar disorder inchildren and adolescents...53 V. A. 1c.

THE DEPRESSED CHILD No. 4 (10/92) (http://www.aacap.org/publicati ons/factsfam/depressd.htm) (Updated 7/04) Not only adults become depressed. Children and teenagers also may have depression, which is a treatable illness. Depression is defined as an illness when the feelings of depression persist and interfere with a child or adolescent''s ability to function. About 5 percent of children and adolescents in the general population suffer from depression at any given point in time. Children under stress, who experience loss, or who have attentional, learning,conduct or anxiety disorders are at a higher risk for depression. Depression also tends to run in families. The behavior of depressed children and teenagers ma y differ from the behavior of depressed adults. Child and adolescent psychiatrists advise parents to be aware of signs of depression in their youngsters. If one or more of these signs of depression persist, parents should seek help: Frequent sadness, tearfulness, crying Hopelessness Decreased interest in activities; or inability to enjoy previously favorite activities Persistent boredom; low energy Social isolation, poor communication Low self esteem and guilt Extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure Increased irritability, anger, or hostility Difficulty with relationships Frequent complaints of physical illnesses such as headaches and stomachaches Frequent absences from school or poor performance in school Poor concentration A major change in eating and/or sleeping patterns Talk of or efforts to run away from home Thoughts or expressions of suicide or self destructive behavior 54 A child who used to play often with friends may now spend most of the time alone and without interests. Things that were once fun now bring little joy to the depressed child. Children and adolescents who aredepressed may say they want to be dead or may talk about suicide. Depressed children and adolescentsare at increased risk for committing suicide. Depressed adolescents may abuse alcohol or other drugs asa way to feel better. Children and adolescents who cause trouble at home or at school may actually be depressed but not know it. Because the youngster may not always seem sad, parents and teachers may not realize thattroublesome behavior is a sign of depression. When asked directly, these children can sometimes statethey are unhappy or sad. Early diagnosis and medical treatment are essential for depressed children. This is a real illness that requires professional help. Comprehensive treatment often includes both individual and family therapy. It may also include the use of antidepressant medication. For help, parents should ask their physician torefer them to a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat depression in children andteenagers.

Interventions for Serious Pr oblems: Depression: Assessing the Problem 552a. Assessment and Treatment of Childhood Depression From the Clinical Child Psychology News letter, Volume 13, Number 3; Fall 1998 By: Wendy Bailey, M.A. and Nadine J. Kaslow, Ph.D ABPP Emory University School of Medicine \u00bbDefinition and Prevalence of Unipolar Depression For a child to receive a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder, the child's symptoms must causeimpairment of daily functioning, reflecta change from baseline, and may notbe secondary to uncomplicatedbereavement. The ch ild must exhibit at least five of the following symptomsduring the same two week period: (1)depressed or irritable mood (must bepresent for diagnosis); (2) anhedonia;(3) decreased weight or appetite orfailure to make expected weight gains;(4) sleep disturbance; (5) psychomotoragitation or retardation; (6) fatigue orloss of energy; (7) feelings ofworthlessness or inappropriate guilt;(8) concentration difficulties orindecisiveness; and (9) thoughts ofdeath and/or suicide. Other depressivedisorders that may be manifested inyouth include dysthymic disorder andadjustment disorder with depressedmood. While the DSM-IVacknowledges the existence ofdepressive disorders in youth, DSM-IV criteria for mood disorders lack adevelopmental perspective, failing toaccount children's cognitive,affective, and interpersonalcompetencies, and (Cicchetti & Schneider-Rosen, 1986). As a result, the criteriafor the diagnosis for children arealmost identical to those for adults.Dissatisfaction with these criteria haveled many to advocate for a develop-mental psychopathology perspectivewith regard to the diagnosis of mooddisorders in youth (Cicchetti &Schneider-Rosen, 1986). No large scale epidemiological study has been conducted regarding theincidence and prevalence of mooddisorders in youth. The available data,however, reveal prevalence ratesranging from 2-5% in 1992; Petersen et al.,1993). Prevalence rates for mooddisorders increase with age (Fleming &Offord, 1990). Although there is noevidence of con-sistent sex differencesin depression rates among pre-pubertalyouth, by age 15, females are twice aslikely as males to receive a depressivediagnosis etiological models have been offered as explanations fordepression in youth. The mostcommonly cited psychosocial modelshave emerged from psychodynamic,cognitive behavioral, and familysystems theories. Psychodynamic Perspective Ego-analytic, object relations, and attachment theories offer the predominant current psychodynamicmodels of childhood depression. Theego-analytic model suggests thatchildren with separation-individuationdifficulties, and unrealistic expectationsof them-selves and others are atincreased risk for depression (Sandler&Joffee, 1965). Based on this model,depressed children's cognitivedistortions reflect problematic parent-child interactions that produce lowself-esteem, a perceived lack ofinstrumentality, dependence on othersfor gratification, and a negative frameof ref-erence that often renders themunhappy (Bemporad, 1994). Accordingto object relations and attachmenttheories, early disruptions inattachment predispose individuals tosymptoms associated with depressionsuch as the experience of emptiness,helplessness, and a negative perceptionof the world (Bowlby, 1981). Littleresearch has been conducted to assessthe validity of the psychodynamicperspectives on mood disorders inyouth. Cognitive-Behavioral Perspective Researchers have extensively studied the cognitions of depressed children and adolescents. This researchreveals that the cognitive patterns ofdepressed children are similar to theiradult counterparts. Specifically,compared to nondepressed children,depressed youth have impairedinformation-processing; negative (low self-esteem), the world,and the future (hope-lessness); aperception of themselves as helplessand unable to control the events intheir lives; a depressogenicattributional style (attribute negativelife events to more internal, stable, andglobal causes and positive events tomore external, unstable, and specific56causes); and deficits in self- monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-reinforcement (Kaslow, Brown, &Mee, 1994). Despite the proliferationof research highlighting the cognitivedeficits of depressed youth, the role ofthe negative cognitive style in theetiology of depression is only nowbeginning to be studied (Garber &Hilsman, 1992). Family Systems Perspective Depressed youth typically have a familial history of psychopathology,particularly mood and substance usedisorders (Hammen, 1991). Inaddition, these children are often fromfamilies with a history of severalnegative life events; experiences withhigh levels of negative life events placea child or adolescent at risk fordepression (for reviews see Compas,Grant, & Ey, 1994; Garber &Hilsman,1992). The families of depressed youthtypically are characterized by thefollowing relational pat-terns:attachment problems (e.g., insecureattachment), low cohesion, lowsupport, child maltreatment,inappropriate levels of family control,high levels of family conflict,ineffective conflict resolution,difficulties with affect regulation,impaired communication patterns,transmission of depressive cognitions,and a poorness of fit between thechild's beenmade to date to examine empiricallythe role of family dysfunction in theetiology of depressive disorders inyouth. \u00bbAssessment Psychosocial Approach A psychosocial assessment of childhood depression uses a mu lti-trait, multi-method, multi-informantapproach to examine individual andcontextual factors. This method ofassessment enhances diagnosticreliability and validity, addresses discrepancies, domains (e.g.,cognitive, affective, and interpersonalfunctioning, adaptive behavior, negativelife events) and settings. In brief, athorough evaluation examines domainsof functioning beyond mood relatedsymptoms. Furthermore, a psychosocialevaluation involves interviews with thedepressed child and primary caretakersand family members, completion ofbehavior ratings scales by multipleinformants (e.g., child, parents, teachers,peers, clinicians), and when indicated,results from psychological testing.Given the potential contribution offamily process, it can be valuable toassess interactional patterns. Semi-structured interviews Hodges (1994) suggests that diagnostic interviews are optimalassessment tools for the diagnosis ofclinical depression as a syndrome, whilesymptom checklists and questionnairesyield information about individualsymptoms and psychological distress.Semistructured diagnostic clinicalinterviews include the DiagnosticInterview Schedule for Children, theChild Scale, the Schedulefor Affective Disorders andSchizophrenia in School-Age Children,theDiagnostic Interview for Childrenand Adolescents, and the comorbiddisorders also can be diagnosed throughthe use of these semi-structureddiagnostic clinical interviews. Thisstandardized method of assessmentfacilitates differential diagnosis. Self-report questionnaires Self-report questionnaires are the most commonly used assessment toolfor the determination of the severity ofdepressive symptoms. Reliable andvalid self-report measures that areappropriate for eight Scale, BeckDepression Inventory, and the Centerfor Epidemiological Studies DepressionScale (for review, see Reynolds, 1994).Self-report measures are preferred overdiagnostic clinical inter-views becausethey are less lengthy, therefore theyrequire less time to administer.However, self-report questionnairesshould be used in conjunction withclinical interviews that offer a morecomprehensive diagnostic picture ofthe level of psychological distressedexperienced by the patient or client (Reynolds, 1994). Medical Approach Alcohol and illicit drugs as well as prescribed medication such as anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, andsome antibiotics have depressive side-effects, therefore medical work-ups arehelpful in ruling out depression due toorganic causes. Medical work-upsshould include a physical examination,a drug screen for the most commonlyabused substances, and the gatheringof infor-mation pertaining to familialhistory of depression. A lab-oratorywork-up is also recommended in orderto rule out infection, anemia, thyroiddisease, parathyroid disease, kidneydisorders, adrenal \u00bbTreatment psychosocial children andadolescents. Although multipletreatment approaches have beenadvanced, few have been adequatelyevaluated (see Kaslow &Thompson,1998 for review). The followingsection offers a brief overview oftreatments with sound empiricalsupport. Empirically supported psychosocial interventions forchildren. Multi-component treatments formulated from a cognitiv -behavioral perspective, consisting of less than 20sessions, and admi-istered in group-format within a school setting havereceived the most consistent empiricalsupport. These interventions (Stark,Reynolds, & psychoeducational treatments that donot differ markedly from those that arecommonly administered to adult57populations. Treatment components involve enhanc-ing skills in cognitiverestructuring, problem-solving,relaxation, self-control, social skills,and social competence amongdepressed youth (for seeKaslow &Thompson, 1998). Empirically supported psychosocial interventions foradolescents . Similar to the psychosocial interventions for depression among children, most adolescent interventionsconsist of less than 20 sessions and areadministered in a psychoeducationaland group format. One well-designedadolescent intervention Lewinsohn, Clarke,Rohde, & cognitive-behavioraltreatment more effective atdecreasing depressive symptomsamong adolescents than a wait-listcontrol condition. The cognitive-behavior intervention focused onincreasing pleasant activities andenhancing skills in social competence,relaxation, con-flict resolution, depressive thoughts.Lewinsohn and colleagues (1996) cog-nitive behavioraltreatment is equally effective inameliorating depressive symptomsamong adolescents when administeredonly to the adolescent in a groupsetting and when offered to theadolescent in a group setting combinedwith separate sessions for the parents. Biological Interventions Pharmacotherapy. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and specific sero-tonin reuptake fre- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAOIs) are not recommended theirlevel of lethality in overdose andstringent dietary restrictions (Ryan,1992). Research has yielded mixed results the efficacy oftricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) andspecific serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) in depressed children For example, trialstudies of TCAs, such as imipramine,amitriptyline, and nortriptyline, indicatethat TCAs are effective in decreasingdepressive symp-toms amongprepubertal youth (for review, seeHarrington, 1993). such as fluoxetine symp-toms in adolescents(Harrington, 1993). However, double-blind studies do not support previousfindings; TCAs (e.g. Geller, Fox, &Clark, 1994) and to placebo treatments. While more method-ologically sound pharmaco-logical studies are needed to clarify the efficacy ofantidepressants with various age groups,both TCAs and SSRIs are frequentlyused by child psychiatrists andpediatricians. While SSRIs are lesslethal than TCAs in overdose and causefewer harmful side effects, TCAs areless expensive moreaccessible to low-income youth(Rosenberg, Holttum, & Gershon,1994). \u00bbPrevention Prevention trials for depression are recent, although a number of pro-grams designed for youth fol-lowing stressfulevents (e.g., divorce, death of a familymember) have implications forpreventing depression. Similar to childhood and adolescent depressioninterventions, in the area of theprevention of depression among youth,the most effective prevention programshave been psychoeducational. Forexample, in one 10-to 13-year-oldswho training focusing on social problem solving, cognitiverestructuring, assertiveness, negotiation,and coping strategies reported fewerdepressive symptoms than their waitlistcontrol counterparts. Similarly, Hainsand Ellmann (1994) reported that thoseadole-cents who had received cognitiverestructuring, problem solving, andcoping skills training reported fewerdepressive symptoms than a wait-listcontrol group at follow-up. Morerecently, Clarke and colleagues (1995)compared a 15 session group cognitiveprevention program and a treatment-as-usual condition for adolescents withself-reported depressive symptomswho did not meet diagnostic crite-riafor a mood disorder. A survivalanalysis indicated that at 12-monthfollow-up, adolescents in the experi-mental group were less likely thancontrols to meet the diagnostic criteriafor a mood disorder. These findings su-port the utility of prevention programsin reducing the risk for mood disordersin at-risk youth. Related psychoeductional prevention efforts focus on children parents. Beardslee and colleagues (e.g., Beardslee, &MacMillan, 1993; Beardslee al,1993) found that families in aclinician-based format were morepositive about the program anddeveloped more adaptive attitudes andbehaviors for coping with stress thandid families in the lecture-basedprogram. These changes may beassociated with improved parentalmanagement of high-risk children andmore adaptive child coping, both ofwhich may decrease th e child's risk for depression. \u00bbConcluding Comments Despite the proliferation of research on child and ado-lescentdepression, research on effectivetreatments is only beginning to emerge.Initial results suggest that multi-component interventions guided bycognitive-behavioral principlesproduce sinificant reductions indepressive symptoms among childrenand adolescents. Other interventionsmay be effective, for example, family-based treatments, but few havereceived systematic empiricalevaluation. Thus, given multipleetiologies among children and adoles-cents with depressive symptoms, it ispremature to conclude that a singleapproach, or specific treatment compo-nent, will be uniformly effective acrosscases. Progress in this area will hingeon longitudinal investigations with an58explicit developmental focus that consider the cognitive, interpersonal,and neurobiological processesassociated with depressive risk andcourse. Such research will provide thebasis for the development andempirical validation of newinterventions that aim to prevent orresolve depressive disorders. \u00bbReferences Angold, A. (1988).

It is not a diagnostic procedure. That is, just because a student scores high doesn't mean they are clinically depressed. It does mean they have a lot of concerns that need to be discussed. The survey has 27 items. For each item the student has 3 choices from which to select. For example, \"(a) Things bother me all the time, (b) Things bother me many times, (c) Things bother me once in a while.\" The inventory has good internal reliability. The CDI items and administrator instructions can be found in J.G. Schulterbrandt and A. Raskin (1977). Depression in children: Diagnosis, treatment, and conceptual models. NY: Raven Press.

Ten-year review of rating scales II: scales for internalizing disorders. (Research Update Review). Author/s: Kathleen Myers Excerpt: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Depression-rating scales and anxiety-rating scales offer great utility for elucidating youths' internalizing psychopathology treatment planning, following treatment course, and assuring accountability in practice. However, they cannot be used casually. The potential user must consider a particular scale in relation to the problem to be assessed, characteristics of the sample, properties of the scale, and the goals of assessment. All of the reviewed scales have strengths and weaknesses. Depression-rating scales suffer predominantly from the lack of clear construct validity. Furthermore, several depression scales are waning in popularity, thereby reducing the number of available depression-rating scales and ongoing examination of their functioning. On the other hand, the most popular scales provide a wealth of information on their functioning. Furthermore, these scales have parallel parent-report forms for collateral information and short forms to facilitate repeated evaluation. Older anxiety-rating scales also suffer from the lack of construct clarity and developmental relevance. However, newer scales appear to enjoy good construct validity and suitability for youths but have not been used long enough to draw conclusions regarding their overall appropriateness and validity. Most also have parallel parent forms and short screening forms. Their biggest challenge, and their greatest promise, is their ability to discriminate anxiety disorders from depressive disorders. In any event, no one scale is likely to provide all of the information desired. In general, more than one scale should be used to evaluate a specific internalizing construct, thereby assuring a more robust assessment of a youth's problem (Myers and Winters, 2002). This is especially important for scales assessing mood and anxiety disorders because they tend to overlap in their construct s and symptom profiles. Within these guidelines, rating scales for internalizing disorders can facilitate research and augment clinical practice.V. A. 3. Interventions for Serious Pr oblems: Depression: Treating the Problem 61Empirically Supported Treatments In an effort to improve the qua lity of treatment, the mental health field is promoting the use of empirically supported interventions. The following pages contain excerpts from a 1998 report entitled \"Applying the Criteria for Empirically Supported Treat ments to Studies of Psychosocial Interventions for Child and Adolescent Depression\"by T. H. Ollendick and N. J. King, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Child Psychology, 27 , 156-167. Excerpted here are the abstract, the authors' conclusions, and their reference list. Abstract of article by T. H. Ollendick and N. J. King, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Child Psychology, 27 , 156-167. Reviews the psychosocial treatment outcome studies for depressed children and adolescents and concludes that psychosocial interventionsare effective at posttreatment and follow-up in reducing depressivesymptoms/disorders in clinical and nonclinical samples of youth,regardless of treatment modality or extent of parental involvement. The article then examines the extent to which each study conforms to the guidelines set forth by the Task Force on Promotion and Disseminationof Psychological Procedures (1996) for well-established and probablyefficacious interventions. Results of this analysis indicate only 2 seriesof studies that meet criteria for probably efficacious interventions andno studies that meet criteria for well- established treatments. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of applying criteria for empiricallysupported treatments to identify good treatments for depressed youth are discussed, the importance of devising developmentally and culturallysensitive interventions targeted to the unique needs of each child is highlighted, and recommendations for fu ture research that is informed by clinical practice and empirical findings are offered. The following pages illustrate the gist of the article.62 * * * Criteria for Well-Established and Probably Efficacious Treatments The following are the most recent criteria for ESTs (Chambless et al., 1996; see Lonigan et al.,this issue). Because the child and adolescentdepression intervention literature does not include alarge series of single case design experiments, onlycriteria related to between-group design studies aredelineated. For an intervention to be deemed well established, there must be at least two goodbetween-group design experiments demonstratingefficacy in one of the following ways: (a) superiorto pill or psychological placebo or to anothertreatment, or (b) equivalent to an already establishedtreatment in experiments with adequate statisticalpower ( n > 30 per group). The experiments must be conducted in accordance with a treatment manual,sample characteristics must be detailed, and at leasttwo different investigators or investigatory teamsmust demonstrate intervention effects. For anintervention to be classified as probably efficacious,either two experiments must demonstrate that theintervention is more effective than a wait-listcondition or one or more experiments must meet allcriteria for a well-established treatment, except forthe requirement that treatment effects be shown bytwo different research teams... ...to date, none of the childhood depression intervention studies meet criteria for well-established treatments. The two studies conductedby Stark and colleagues (Stark et al., 1987, 1991),however, appear to meet criteria for probablyefficacious treatments. Because the investigations by Stark and colleagues represent the best available psychosocialtreatment out-come studies for childhooddepression, these studies are detailed. Stark et al.(1987) weighed the relative efficacy of 12-sessiongroup interventions involving self-control therapy,behavior problem-solving therapy, and a wait-listcontrol for 29 fourth through sixth graders withelevated depression scores at two time points. Theself-control intervention taught self-managementskills (e.g., self-monitoring, self-evaluating, consisted ofeducation, self-monitoring of pleasant events, andgroup problem solving directed toward improvingsocial behavior. Postintervention within-groupanaly-ses found that participants in both activeinterventions reported fewer symptoms ofdepression and anxiety, whereas wait-list childrenreported minimal change. Between-group analysesrevealed that children in the self-control condition showed relatively greater improvement in self-esteem and depressive symptoms, as measured bythe Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1985), than the youth in the other two groups.However, no between-group differences were notedon the other measures of depression according tochild or mother ratings or on measures of self-esteem or anxiety. At 8-week follow-up, 88% of thechildren in the self-control condition and 67% of thechildren in the behavioral problem-solvingcondition obtained CDI scores below the cutoff fordepression (i.e., <13), and none of the participantsin either experimental group met criteria forclinically significant levels of depressive symptomsaccording to their res ponses on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R;Poznanski, 1984). Also at follow-up, the children inthe self-control condition reported greatergeneralization of treatment effects according to theirresponses to the CDRS-R and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (Coopersmith, 1975), but nodifferences in depression levels were noted betweenthe children in the self-control and behavioralproblem-solving conditions on the CDI or the ChildDepression Scale (Reynolds, 1989). Also, therewere no between-group differences at follow-up interms of mother's depressionon the Child Behavior Check-list (Achenbach &Edelbrock, 1983) or in terms of children's reports ofanxiety. Taken together, results revealed that bothexperimental interventions were relativelysuccessful in reducing symptoms of depression. Forthe most part, findings regarding the comparison ofthe self-control and behavioral problem-solvinggroup interventions were equivocal. However, thepattern suggested that the self-control interventionwas more beneficial to the children. Based on results from the aforementioned study, Stark et al. (1991) evalua ted an expanded version of self-control therapy for 26 fourth through seventhgraders who endorsed high levels of depressivesymptoms. This research offers only a partialreplication of Stark's earlier work (i.e., Stark et al.,1987), as the self-control therapies tested in the twodifferent treatment outcome studies were similar butnot identical, and there was no behavioral problem-solving condition in the second study. Theexperimental intervention in the second study wasa 24- to 26-session cognitive-behavioral treatmentthat consisted of self-control and social skillstraining, assertiveness training, relaxation trainingand imagery, and cognitive restructuring. Thisexperimental treatment was compared to atraditional counseling condition designed to controlfor nonspecific elements of the intervention.Monthly family meetings for the cognitive-behavioral group encouraged parents to assist theirchildren in applying their new skills and to increasethe frequency of positive family activities. Monthlyfamily sessions associated with the traditionalcounseling condition addressed improvingcommunication and increasing pleasant family63events. Postintervention and 7-month follow-up assessments revealed d ecreases in sel f-reported depressive symptoms for both groups of children.At postintervention, youth in the cognitive-behavioral intervention reported fewer depressivesymptoms on a semistructured interview andendorsed fewer depressive cognitions. The 1987 and 1991 outcome studies by Stark and colleagues come the closest of all of the childstudies to meeting the criteria for probablyefficacious treatments. Specifically, clientcharacteristics were specified, a treatment manualwas used, and two adequate group design studiesdemonstrated that a self-control intervention wassuperior to a placebo treatment. However, as notedpreviously, the self-control interventions used in thetwo studies were not identical in terms of length oftreatment or material covered. With thesequalifications, we view this research program asapproximating that required for being a probablyefficacious EST. * * * ... The intervention research conducted by Lewinsohn and coworkers (i.e., Lewinsohn et al.,1990; Lewinsohn et al., 1996) represents state-of-the-art adolescent depression intervention research.These methodologically sophisticated studies meetcriteria for probably efficacious treatments as clientcharacteristics were specified, a treatment manualwas used. and two adequate group design studiesdemonstrated that a coping skills program was moreefficacious than a wait-list condition. Thus, a briefdescription of these studies is warranted. In the firststudy, Lewinsohn et al. (1990) randomly assigned59 high school students, ages 14 to 18 years whomet diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders, tocognitive-behavioral group treatment for theadolescent only, concurrent cognitive-behavioraltreatment groups for the depressed adolescent andhis or her parents, and a wait-list control condition.The cognitive-behavioral intervention, based on theCoping With Depression (CWD) course for adults,was adapted to address the concerns andcompetencies of adolescents. The CWD, a 14-session multiple component intervention, focuses onexperiential learning and skills training, withattention to increasing pleasant activities, training inrelaxation, controlling depressive thoughts,improving social interaction, and developingconflict resolution skills. The seven-sessioncomplimentary parent intervention program isdesigned to enhance parents' ability to reinforcetheir adolescent's adaptive changes, which shouldincrease the maintenance and generalization oftreatment effects. Postintervention assessmentindicated that fewer adolescents in the two activetreatment groups met diagnostic criteria fordepression as compared to youth in the wait-listgroup. Also, compared to their nontreatedcounterparts, adolescents in the CWD adolescent-only and the CWD for adolescent-and-parent evidenced greater reductions in self-reporteddepressive and anxious symptoms and maladaptivecognitions and evidenced more involvement inpositive events. Treatment gains were maintained at2-year follow-up. Although there were a fewstatistically significant found on most variables, suggesting either thatthe outcome was similar for both groups or that witha larger sample, the adolescent-and-parent CWDwould prove to be more effective than theadolescent-only condition. The second study conducted by Lewinsohn et al. (1996) was a replication, with modifications, of theprior design. Skills training was interwoventhroughout the CWD course rather than offered insingle blocks in separate sessions. The othermodification was the addition of random assignmentto different conditions during the 2-year follow-upphase: (a) booster sessions plus assessment every 4months, (b) assessment only every 4 months, and (c)annual assessment only. In a sample of 96adolescents meeting diagnostic criteria for majordepressive disorder or dysthymic disorder, recoveryrates in the two active treatment conditions (i.e.,CWD = 65%, CWD plus parent intervention = 69%)were greater than those for the adolescents in thewait-list control group (48%). No significantdifferences were found between the twoexperimental groups. Comparable recovery andrelapse rates were reported for the three follow-upconditions. Of particular interest was that at the 2-year follow-up, 97.5% of adolescents whoparticipated in an active treatment condition nolonger met criteria for a depressive disorder. Current Empirical Status of Psychosocial Interventions for Depressed Children andAdolescents In summary, results from this review reveal that several psychosocial intervention programs, themajority of which are based on a cognitive-behavioral model, are effective in reducingdepressive symptoms and alleviating depressivedisorders in nonclinical samples of children andboth clinical and nonclinical samples of adolescents. Positive treatment effects are noted regardless oftreatment modality (group, individual. or familytherapy) or nature or extent of parental involvement.Treatment effects generally are maintained atfollow-up. However, because most of the studieswere conducted in schools with nonreferred youth with depressive symptoms and used relativelyinexperienced clinicians, the generalizability of thefindings across populations, settings, and clinician- experience level remains unclear. Further, becausefew between-group design studies have compared64different interventions, it is premature to conclude that any specific intervention approach is mostefficacious in reducing depression in youth. Giventhat the intervention literature on mood disorders inyouth is in its infancy and most of the studies wereconducted prior to the establishment of the criteriafor ESTs, it is not surprising that none of theinterventions met criteria for well-establishedtreatments and only one series of child studies andone series of adolescent studies appear to meet thecriteria for probably efficacious interventions. Strengths and Weaknesses of the EST Approach Our review of the child and adolescent depression treatment literature brings to the fore anumber of advantages and disadvantages of the ESTmovement. There are enumerable methodologicaladvantages to ascertaining the efficacy of anintervention based on its superiority to a pill,placebo, or other treatment or its equivalence to analready established treatment when a randomassignment to control study is conducted. Only withrandom assignment can between-group differencesin the reduction of depression and its sequelae beattributed to the intervention. However, a majorclinical concern often emerges regarding randomassignment to a placebo control condition. Someyouth with significant problems (e.g., suicidalideation) will not receive adequate and timely carein the control condition. Many researchers havehandled this issue by eliminating children withelevated levels of suicidal ideation. This, however,limits the utility of the interventions to thosedepressed youth in greatest need. The primary advantages of conducting treatments in accord with a manual are that such interventions(a) are systematic, focused, and goal-oriented; (b)enable more mental health professionals to betrained to provide effective psychosocialinterventions for depressed youth; (c) increase ourability to detect differences between treatmentconditions; and (d) have a greater likelihood forreplication. A number of obstacles impede the useof treatment manuals for addressing child andadolescent depression. First, rigid application of amanualized treatment protocol may result indifficulty establishing rapport with a depressedyouth and ineffective dissemination ofpsychological services due to the therapist's inabilityto attend to the distinctive mood or context of eachsession or the child's current concerns. Second, it isdifficult for an intervention manual to addressindividual differences (e.g., depression symptomsand severity, comorbid conditions, education level,cognitive level, age, sex, family constellation,family income, attendance patterns). Third, mosttreatment manuals only address a singular problem(e.g., depression) rather than the comorbidpsychological conditions and environmentalinfluences (e.g.. poverty, physical/sexual abuse, parent and child substance abuse and psychiatricproblems. parental cognitive limitations) that impactthe child's adjustment and that often are of greaterconcern to the child or family than the child'sdepression. Finally, most treatment manuals lacksystematic attention to the child's background (e.g.,ethnicity, income level), belief system, andexpectations of therapy. The key advantage of specifying client characteristics is that this information is crucial toconsiderations regard-ing the generalizability of thefindings. There are no disadvantages to informingthe reader of the client character-istics. However,the issue of determining client characteristics forinclusion criteria often is a challenging one.Developing inclusion criteria comprehensiveenough to promote participation of all youth whoneed the intervention results in considerable within- group variability. It is difficult to control for thisvariability when matching the experimental andcontrol groups. Many researchers address thisdilemma by providing relatively narrow inclusioncriteria, which limits the generalizability of findingsfrom research studies to actual clinical practice.Often treatment outcome researchers, in an effort toconduct methodologically sophisticated studies,place methodological rigor above clinical reality. The merits of determining the efficacy of an intervention across research teams are withoutquestion, and there are no disadvantages of such arecommendation. The dilemma for researchers inachieving this goal is the limited research fundingavailable for conducting psychosocial interventionstudies for depressed youth. A Look to the Future In closing, a number of problems with the child and adolescent depression treatment literature arenoteworthy and have implications for thedevelopment and implementation of futuretreatment outcome studies. First, most studies failedto accommodate developmental differences inchildren's competencies and did not assess thebenefits of various intervention strategies for youthat different ages and developmental levels. Theprotocols often failed to incorporate the pertinent developmental psychology literature on cognitiveand affective development, but rather appeared to bedownward extensions of adult depressioninterventions. Thus, future research should integratedevelopmental research findings on the cognitive,affective, and social functioning of youth indevising and implementing therapies for depressedchildren and adolescents. Given that children areembedded within a family context, a developmentalperspective also highlights the importance of activefamily involvement, including family therapy(Kaslow & Racusin, 1994).65A second problem is the lack of a culturally sensitive perspective. Most studies were conductedwith middle-class, Caucasian youth, and littleattention was paid to the cultural relevance of thematerials used, the intervention strategiesincorporated, and the cultural background andsensitivity of the therapists who administer theprotocols. Thus, in the future, researchers shouldinclude diverse groups of children, the therapistsshould be cognizan t of the child's sociocultural context and aware of their own ethnicity affects thetherapeutic alliance, and culturally sensitiveassessment and interventions should beincorporated. Third, there are no data that indicate which treatments are most effective for which depressedchildren and adolescents, and none of theinvestigatory teams have examined which specificcomponent(s) of the multifaceted interventions ismost beneficial for which children. Future studieswould be more informative if they examined whichchildren benefitted most from which interventioncomponents (e.g., social skills training, cognitiverestructuring, family involvement). This would help clinicians to target specific intervention components for different children andfamilies. In addition, researchers need to ascertainwhich depressed children are most likely to benefitfrom cognitive-behavioral versus interpersonalversus family therapy versus pharmacology, orsome combination thereof. Such information will enable clinicians and clinical researchers to providethe optimal treatment for each depressed child or adolescent. References Achenbach , T. M., & Edelbrock, C. S. (1983).

GUIDELINES FOR SCHOOL BASED SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMS Prevention Division of the American Association of Suicidology 1999 (http://www.suicidology.org/associations/1045/files/School%20guidelines.pdf) Excerpt: Suicide prevention is competing for time and resources with many other initiatives in schools. We must have confidence in both the efficacy and e fficiency of any program that we propose. While schools adopt many programs on the basis of packagi ng, programs generally are not retained in the absence of results. A sound conceptual grounding is necessary for achieving consistent results andmakes it easier to update the program in light of experience and empirical findings. Part of the effort to build the conceptual base for prevention in general has resulted in typology intended to clarify prevention methodology (Institute of Medicine,1994) which included: 1.Universal interventions, which are directed at an entire population rather than selected subpopulations or individuals. Such interventions may include efforts to enhance the supportiveness of populations such as their ability and inclination to provide a helpful initial response to a troubled youth; or, they may include teaching generic coping skills to an entirepopulation; or, they may seek to enhance th e sense of connection and participation among members of an organization or community. 2.Selective interventions, which are targeted to subpopul ations that are characterized by shared exposure to some epidemiologically determined risk factor(s). For example,students at critical transitional periods, such has entering middle school or high school, can be at greater risk for a variety of adjustment and/or academic problems. 3. Indicated interventions are targeted to specific indi viduals who are already preclinical levels of a disorder and who have been identifie d through screening procedures. For example, students who self identify or ar e identified by others as having suicidal thoughts or plans are referred for an appropriate treatment... Universal Suicide Prevention Approaches The goal of universal approaches is to raise the overall supportiveness and responsiveness of the at risk youths' environment. This approach is preferable when the causes of a risk behavior are not yet clear or easily attenuated. Many factors have been proposed to contribute to youth suicide. Thebest current risk factors produce high false positives, thus universal approaches that help schoolpersonnel to identify and get help for at risk youth represent an efficient approach. The role of the school is seen as critical, but limited. All schools are not assumed to possess the resources to treat suicidal or emotionally disturbed students. They can enhance their capacity to identify and get help for these students as part of their mandate to socialize and protect their students. Following are empirical bases for the universal program that includes classes for students:68 Most suicidal youths confide their concerns more often to peers than adults. Disturbed youth (e.g. depressed, substance abusers) prefer peer supports over adults more than their non disturbed peers. Some adolescents, particularly some males, do not respond to troubled peers in empathic or helpful ways. As few as 25% of peer confidants tell an adult about their troubled or suicidal peer. School personnel are consistently among the last choices of adolescents for discussing personal concerns. Consistent reasons cited by students for reluctance to confide in adults in their schools include: confidentiality is not respected, and school schedules and conflicting adult roles (i.e. evaluative and disciplinary) prevent students from getting to know adults well enough toconfide in them. The inaccessibility of, and reluctance of adolescen ts to seek out helpful adults is considered to be a risk factor that contributes to destructive outcome s associated with a variety adolescent risk behaviors. Conversely , research has shown that contact with helpful adults may be considered a protective factor for a variety of troubled youth. There is also evidence that provision of help by youths may be beneficial to them: participation in helping interactions can shape prosocial behaviors and reduce problematicbehavior; and is related to indices of social competencies that can carry over to otherchallenging situations. Therefore, the overall goals of the universal program are to increase the likelihood that school gatekeepers (administrators, faculty, and staff) and p eers who come into contact with at-risk youth can more readily identify them, provide an appropr iate initial response to them, will know how to obtain help for them, and are consistently inclined to take such action. Protective Factors & Wellness Promotion It should be noted within the context of universal prevention programs that research on resilient youth (those who fail to evidence risk behaviors such as poor social and school performance in spite of coming from difficult environments) and protec tive factors has identified characteristics of youth and their environments that can attenuate the likelihood that they will engage in a variety of riskbehaviors such as delinquency, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts. Some longitudinal researchindicates that the presence of protective factors may have a stronger influence on the likelihood that risk behaviors will occur than the presence of risk factors. These protective factors include personal characteristics such as social problem solving competencies; and, environmental characteristics suchas contact with a caring adult and a school c limate that promotes students' involvement, contribution, and sense of connection with their school. Thus, there is evidence that universal,69empirically grounded, multigrade school programs th at teach problem solving, decision making, and other competencies may attenuate the likelihood of a variety of risk behaviors. The multiple impacts of such programs makes them more efficient than categorical programs, and thus appealing to educators. Programs that increase the opportunities for students to participate in and contribute to their schools, as well as opportunities for outside of class interactions among students and adults in their school are also potentially powerful preven tive interventions. One caveat concerning resilient youth is in order. Research indicates that youth who come from high risk environments and yet do well in school and peer relations still evidence a greater prevalence of anxiety and depression thanpeers who do not come from such environments. A nxiety and depression are significant risk factors for suicide, and these internalizing disorders are more likely to go undetected than the externalizing behaviors with which school must contend. Univer sal screening programs have been proposed for schools, but such programs are beyond the resources of schools and require parental consent.Moreover, students' self reports of suicidality ha ve been shown to change on surveys a few weeks apart, so how often would schools have to conduct screening in order to obtain reliable results? At the very least, all school personnel should be aw are of basic signs of depression and anxiety in students. .. REQUIREMENTS FOR EFFECTIVE PREVENTION PROGRAMS The following points have been gleaned from the literature on effective prevention, and theimplementation and institutionalization of innovations in schools. Conceptually & empirically grounded goals and objectives. Note: Clear, observable instructiona l objectives also serve as outcome or dependent program variables. Clearly articulated and packaged components. Note: Teachers prefer to work with materials that include lesson outlines and plans, detailed instructor guidelines that include typical student responses and how to respond to these, all handouts, and references for additional materials. As they gain experience with the materials, they may adapt them to their students and their own teaching style. Appropriate instructional principles. Note: these include participatory lessons that acknowledge and relate the material to students' experience; and the use of the demonstration, practice, f eedback, practice sequence for teaching skills. Comprehensive: address all levels of targeted organization. Note: School programs must include consults and training for administration, all faculty & staff, and students. Ecological: address the multiple contexts in which participants interact. Note: Most school programs involve identification and refe rral of at risk students. Close working relationships must exist between the school and community gatekeepers and parents. Gatekeepers must be trained to workwith suicidal youth; and parents must be info rmed about school programs and involved in supportive interventions. Conform to the context/culture/values of the target population and organization. Note: programs must fit into the educational and protective mandate of schools , minimize disruption of school schedules, and minimize dema nd on other school resources such as pe rsonnel, time, space, and materials. 70 R EQUIREMENTS FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION No matter how well researched, designed, and packaged a program is, if it is not implemented as conceived, it will not have the desired impact. As with effectiv e programs guidelines for effective implementation can be gleaned from the experience and research, including: Pilot Note: piloting a program reveals the inevitable adaptations that must be made so it can work in different school contexts. Also, pilots show school personnel that you are taking their c ontext and feedback into consideration and help to promote their ownership of the program. Packaging Note: Programs must fit into the education, socialization, and protection mandates of the school (in that order ofemphasis). They must also fit into the schedules and personnel/material resources of the school. If a program is a pull out,costs too much, or requires too much training and time of school staff, it won't be maintained. (One of the reasons thatDARE is so widespread, even though controlled studies have failed to demonstrate impact, is that it is vigorouslymarketed and is provided by outsiders rather than school staff (low effort)). Be aware that if the program consists of a even a very detailed manual with no on site consultation, there can be considerable slippage in the implementation. That's why you want to avoid conc lusions about a programs' efficacy if th e implementation hasn't been checked. Reconnaissance and relationship development. Note: spending time in the school also shows that you take their context and feedback seriously. Schools are inundated with \"innovations\". They will adapt those that come from a trusted source. You ma y start by meeting some other felt need of the school before introducing your program. Similar models Note: school officials are swayed most by endorsements fro m colleagues in other schools/districts who have used the program. Two-sided communication Note: provide opportunities for school personnel to voice and discuss concerns about the program. Elicit and address concerns. Moderate fear arousal Note: school officials often hesitate to add more to thei r ever-expanding programming unless they are aware of negative consequences if they do not have a pr ogram or procedure in place (e.g. schools have been sued for providing an inadequate response to a suicidal student. Also,suicide is co morbid with other risk behaviors that are more evident to school officials, such as interpersonal violence and dropout). WIIFM Note: \"what's in it for me\" must be addressed with school officials. (e.g. it is now recognized that emotional distress, andcommunity and family stressors are ba rriers to learning; we cannot separate cognitive and emotional functioning. Collaboration with responsive community providers can assist schools in attenuating barriers to learning). Plain language Note: even experienced consultants cannot recognize all of their profession's jargon. Program materials should be reviewed with school personnel. (e.g. don't use \"comorbid\"). Collegial Note: beware of \"professional preciousness\" eviden ced by such statements as \"you mean you let coaches provide the suicide classes?\" Listen71 Core & adaptable Note: guided by your conceptual basis, you must identify core features of your program that cannot be changed, such as minimum dosage (hours); or, media can be upda ted but not replaced by a l ecture. Other features can be changed to fit the context (e.g. replacing a pull out program with an in-class program). Train on site providers (using demonstration, practice, feedback) Note: turnkey programs that don't require outside personnel are mo re likely to be adopted and retained in schools. Outside consultants can provide ongoi ng or occasional follow up. REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTITUTIONALIZATION (RETENTION OVER TIME ) OF PROGRAMS There is a considerable body of literature (as well as the experience of anyone who has worked with schools, corporations, and other institutions) that shows that few programs last long in a given setting. There are some strategies for increasing the likelihood that a pr ogram will be retained or institutionalized in schools. In addition to the variables associated with effective program design and implementation: Supportive administration Note: program survival requires the principal's support of the particular program, as well as his/her support of the school's responsibility for prevention of risk be haviors and promotion of positive coping behaviors, student responsibility, and other principles contained in the program. Identify responsible individual(s). Note: there must be an individual or group that assumes formal ownership of and responsibility for providing and sustaining the program. Some successful programs outlive the recollection of their original source or authors. Provide ongoing consultation/support. If at all possible, this is helpful at least for the first two cycles of program implementation until school personnel not only gain ownership, but also gain familiarity with resource sources on the topic. Identify a place in the curriculum or some other fo rmal school structure such as a school based crisis team or youth service center. Create policies, procedures, structures to support innovation. Easy to administer assessments to check implementation and impact. Note: when educators can see results, they are more likely to retain and update the program. Remember, this is where clear, measurable program obj ectives come into play. Educators feel stretched by the program. Note: school personnel will remain advocates when they are able to adapt the program based on their experience; enjoy mutual support; can bring to bear other skills/materials from their background; a nd, in general, experience involvement with the program as providing a usef ul addition to t eaching repertoire... 72V. A. for Serious Problems: Depression: Suicide 4b. Behavioral Management: Suicide Crisis In developing our Center's Resource Aid Packet on Responding to Crisis at a School, we were impressed by the good work being done by so many people around the country. The unfortunate fact that so many students feel despair and consider suicide has resulted in important common practices at school sites. Changing systems in schools to suppor t students and reduce unnecessary stre ss is the first line of defense. However, when concerns arise about a specific student, school st aff must be ready to respond. The suicide assessment and follow - through checklists in the next section are a compilation of best practices and offer tools to guide intervention. When a Student Talks of Suicide . . . You must assess the situation and reduce the crisis state (see Suicidal Assessm ent Checklist in section V). The following are some specific suggestions. What to do: Send someone for help; you'll need back-up. Remain calm; remember the student is overwhelmed and confused as well asambivalent. Get vital statistics, including student's name, address, home phone number and parent's worknumber. Encourage the student to talk. Listen! Listen! Listen! And when you respond, reflect backwhat you hear the student saying. Clarify, andhelp him or her to define the problem, if youcan. Consider that the student is planning suicide. Howdoes the student plan to do it, and how long has s/hebeen planning and thinking about it? What eventsmotivated the student to take this step? Clarify some immediate options (e.g., school and/or community people who can help). If feasible, get an agreement to no-suicide (\"No matter what happens, I will not kill myself.\") Involve parents for decision making and follow-through and provide for ongoing support and management of care (includingchecking regularly with parents and teachers). What to avoid: Don't leave the student alone and don't send the student away Don't minimize the student's concerns or make light of the threat Don't worry about silences; both you and the student need time to think Don't fall into the trap of thinking that all the student needs is reassurance Don't lose patience Don't promise confidentiality -- promise help and privacy Don't argue whether suicide is right or wrongWhen a Student Attempts Suicide . . . A student may make statements a bout suicide (in writing assignments, drawing, or indirect verbal expression). Another may make an actual attempt using any of a variety of means. In such situations, you must actpromptly and decisively. What to do: Be directive. Tell the student, \"Don't do that; stand there and talk down.\" \"Hand me that.\" \"I'm listening.\" Mobilize someone to inform an administrator and call 911; get others to help you; you'll need back-up. Clear the scene of those who ar e not needed. An \"administrator\" should contact parents to advise them of the situation and that someone will call back immediately to direct the parent where tomeet the youngster. Look at the student directly. Speak in a calm, low voice tone. Buy time. Get the student to talk. Listen. Acknowledge his or herfeelings \"You are really angry.\" \"You must be feeling really hurt.\" Secure any weapon or pills; record the time any drugs were taken to provide this information to the emergency medical staff or police. Get the student's name, address and phone. Stay with the pupil; provide comfort. As soon as feasible, secure any suicidal note, record when the incident occurred, what the pupil said and did, etc. Ask for a debriefing session as part of taking care of yourself after the event. What to avoid: Don't moralize (\"You're young, you have everything to live for.\") Don't leave the student alone (even if the student has to go to the bathroom). Don't move the student. In all cases, show concern and ask questions in a straightforward and calm manner. Show you are willing to discuss suicide and that you aren'tappalled or disgusted by it. Open lines of communication. Get care forthe student. Read Some MoreAdolescent Suicide: Assessment and Intervention by A.L. Berman & D.A. (1991).

(2) REACTIONS TO PRECIPITATING EVENTS Is the student experiencing severe psychological distress? Y N Have there been major changes in recent behavior along with Y N negative feelings and thoughts? (Such changes often are related to recent loss or threat of loss of significant others or of positive status and opportunity. They also may stem from sexual, physical, or substance abuse. Negative feelings and thoughts often are expressions of a sense of extreme loss, abandonment, failure, sadness, hopelessness, guilt, and sometimes inwardly directed anger.) (3) PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT Is there a lack of a significant other to help the student survive? Y N Does the student feel alienated? Y N (4) HISTORY OF RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR Does the student take life-threatening risks or display poor impulse control? Y N *Use this checklist as an exploratory guide with students about whom you are concerned. Each yes raises the level of risk, but there is no single score indicating high risk. A history of suicide attempts, of course, is a sufficient reason for action. High risk also is associated with very detailed plans (when, where, how) that specify a lethal and readily available method, a specific time, and a location where it is unlikely the act would be disrupted. Further high risk indicators include the student having made final arrangements and information about a critical, recent loss. Because of the informal nature of this type assessment, it should not be filed as part of a student's regular school records.74 FOLLOW-THROUGH STEPS AFTER ASSESSING SUICIDAL RISK -- CHECKLIST ____(1) As part of the process of assessment, efforts will have been made to discuss the problem openly and nonjudgmentally with the student. (Keep in mind how seriously devalued a suicidal student feels. Thus, avoid saying anything demeaning or devaluing, while conveying empathy, warmth, and respect.) If the student has resisted talking about the matter, it is worth a further effort because the more the student shares, the better off one is in trying to engage the student in problem solving. ___(2) Explain to the student the importance of and your responsibility for breaking confidentiality in the case of suicidal risk. Explore whether the student would prefer taking the lead or at least be present during the process of informing parents and other concerned parties. ___(3) If not, be certain the student is in a supportive and understanding environment (not left alone/isolated) while you set about informing others and arranging for help. ___(4) Try to contact parents by phone to a) inform about concern b) gather additional information to assess risk c) provide information about problem and available resources d) offer help in connecting with appropriate resources Note: if parents are uncooperative, it may be necessary to report child endangerment after taking the following steps. ____(5) If a student is considered to be in danger, only release her/him to the parent or someone who is equipped to provide help. In high risk cases, if parents are unavailable (or uncooperative) and no one else is available to help, it becomes necessary to contact local public agencies (e.g., children's services, services for emergency hospitalization, local law enforcement). Agencies will want the following information: *student's name/address/birthdate/social security number *data indicating student is a danger to self (see Suicide Assessment -- Checklist) *stage of parent notification *language spoken by parent/student *health coverage plan if there is one *where student is to be found ____(6) Follow-up with student and parents to determine what steps have been taken to minimize risk. ____(7) Document all steps taken and outcomes. Plan for aftermath intervention and support. ____(8) Report child endangerment if necessary.75V. A. 5. Interventions for Serious Problems: Depression: Affect Regulation and Self-Injury 5. Affect regulation and addictive aspects of repetitive self-injury in hospitalized adolescents. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Nov 2002 v41 i11 p1333(9) Nixon MK, Cloutier PF, Aggarwal S. Excerpt: The association of SIB with stressful events and the endorsement of self-injury as a means to cope with dysphoric affect or express frustration, anger, or revenge support the affect regulation model as the primary function of SIB in hospitalized adolescents. The only other studies examining reasons for self-injury that we are aware of are those of Briere and Gil (1998), which examined a sample of self-referred, primarily abused women, and Herpertz (1995), who studied a psychiatric inpatient population of mostly women. The former gave self-punishment as the most commonly reported reason to self-injure, with affect regulatory being secondary, whereas the latter study, with a broader clinical sample, endorsed SIB'S tension-relieving effect in response to overwhelming affect. SIB as a means to regulate affect may be more predominant among those with psychiatric disorders. Zlotnick et al. (1997) noted that suicidal behavior in adolescent inpatients appeared related to a reduced capacity to manage internal states, with the suggestion that suicide attempts were a means to reduce intolerable emotional states. Whereas learning to modulate affect adaptively should lead to appropriate self-soothing strategies as the individual matures, the failure to regulate affect, due to either genetic or environmental factors, has been suggested as being central to the development of psychopathology (Bradley, 2000). Overall, much of our sample did not experience anger chronically, nor did a large proportion invest a great deal of energy in monitoring or preventing the experience or expression of anger. The equal distribution of those with clinically elevated internalizing anger and externalizing anger indicates that repetitive SIB is nor exclusive to those who primarily suppress their anger. Nevertheless, adolescents with elevated internalized anger scores appear to have greater morbidity, with higher levels of both depression and self-reported rates of ever having had an eating disorder. SIB served most highly as a means to express frustration, in addition to being a means for expressing anger and revenge, releasing unbearable tension, and coping with feelings of depression...76V. B. 1. Interventions for Serious Problems: Bipolar Disorder: Child and Adolescent NIMH National Institute of Mental Health1. Child and Adolescent Bipolar Disorder: An Update from the National Institute of Mental Health (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/bipolarupdate.cfm) Excerpt: Research findings, clinical experience, and family accounts provide substantialevidence that bipolar disorder, also calle d manic-depressive illness, can occur in children and adolescents. Bipolar disorder is difficult to recognize and diagnose in youth, however, because it does not fit precisely the symptom criteriaestablished for adults, and because its symptoms can resemble or co-occur withthose of other common childhood-onset ment al disorders. In addition, symptoms of bipolar disorder may be initially mist aken for normal emotions and behaviors of children and adolescents. But unlike normal mood changes, bipolar disordersignificantly impairs functioning in school, with peers, and at home with family. Better understanding of the diagnosis and tr eatment of bipolar disorder in youth is urgently needed. In pursuit of this goal, the National Institute of Mental Health(NIMH) is conducting and supporting research on child and adolescent bipolardisorder. A Cautionary Note Effective treatment depends on appropriate dia gnosis of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. There is some evidence that using antidepressant medication to treat depression in a person who has bipolar disorder may induce manic symptoms if it is taken without a mood stabilizer. In addition, using stim ulant medications to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ADHD-like sy mptoms in a child with bipolar disorder may worsen manic symptoms. While it can be hard to determine which young patients willbecome manic, there is a greater likelihood among children and adolescents who have afamily history of bipolar disorder. If manic symptoms develop or markedly worsen duringantidepressant or stimulant use, a physician should be consulted immediately, anddiagnosis and treatment for bipolar disorder should be considered. Symptoms and Diagnosis Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness char acterized by recurrent episodes of depression, mania, and/or mixed symptom states. These episodes cause unusual and extreme shifts in mood, energy, and behavior that interfere significantly with normal, healthy functioning. 77 Manic symptoms include: Severe changes in mood\u2014\u2014either extremely irritable or overly silly and elated Overly-inflated self-esteem; grandiosity Increased energy Decreased need for sleep\u2014\u2014ability to go with very little or no sleep for days without tirin Increased talking\u2014\u2014talks too much, too fast; changes topics too quickly; cannot beinterrupted Distractibility\u2014\u2014attention moves constantly from one thing to the next Hypersexuality\u2014\u2014increased sexual thoughts, f eelings, or behaviors; use of explicit sexual language Increased goal-directed activity or physical agitation Disregard of risk\u2014\u2014excessive involvement in risky behaviors or activities Depressive symptoms include: Persistent sad or irritable mood Loss of interest in activities once enjoyed Significant change in appetite or body weight Difficulty sleeping or oversleeping Physical agitation or slowing Loss of energy Feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt Difficulty concentrating Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide Symptoms of mania and depression in children a nd adolescents may manifest themselves through a variety of different behaviors 1,2. When manic, children and adolescents, in contrast to adults, are more likely to be irritable and prone to destructive outbursts than to be elated or euphoric. Whendepressed, there may be many physical complaints such as headaches, muscle aches, stomachaches or tiredness, frequent absences fr om school or poor performance in sc hool, talk of or efforts to run away from home, irritability, complaini ng, unexplained crying, social isolation, poor communication, and extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure. Other manifestations of manic and depressive states may include alcohol or subs tance abuse and difficulty with relationships. Existing evidence indicates that bipolar disorder beginning in childhood or early adolescence may78 be a different, possibly more severe form of the illness than older adolescent- and adult-onset bipolar disorder. When the illness begins before or soon after puberty, it is often characterized by acontinuous, rapid-cycling, irritable, and mixed symptom state that may co-occur with disruptivebehavior disorders, particularly attention defic it hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or conduct disorder (CD), or may have features of these disorders as initial symptoms. In contrast, later adolescent- or adult-onset bipolar disorder tends to begin suddenl y, often with a classic manic episode, and to have a more episodic pattern with relatively stable pe riods between episodes. There is also less co- occurring ADHD or CD among those with later onset illness. A child or adolescent who appears to be depre ssed and exhibits ADHD-like symptoms that are very severe, with excessive temper outbursts and mood changes, should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist with experience in bipolar disorder, particularly if there is a family history of the illness. This evaluation is especially important since psychostimulant medications, often prescribed for ADHD, may worsen manic symptoms. There is also limited evidence suggesting that some ofthe symptoms of ADHD may be a forerunner of full-blown mania. Findings from an NIMH-supported study suggest that the illness may be at least as common among youth as among adults. In this study, one percent of adolescents ages 14 to 18 were found to have met criteria for bipolar disorder or cyclothymia, a similar but milder illness, in their lifetime 3. In addition, close to six percent of adolescents in the study had experienced a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood even though they never met full criteria for bipolar disorder or cyclothymia. Comp ared to adolescents with a history of major depressive disorder and to a never-mentally-ill gr oup, both the teens with bipol ar disorder and those with subclinical symptoms had greater functi onal impairment and higher rates of co-occurring illnesses (especially anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders), suicide attempts, and mental health services utilization. The study highlights the need for improved recognition, treatment, and prevention of even the milder and subclinical cases of bipolar disorder in adolescence. Treatment Once the diagnosis of bipolar diso rder is made, the treatment of children and adolescents is based mainly on experience with adults, since as yet th ere is very limited data on the efficacy and safety of mood stabilizing medications in youth . The essentia l treatment for this disorder in adults involves the use of appropriate doses of mood stabilizers, mo st typically lithium and/or valproate, which are often very effective for controlling mania and preventing recurrences of manic and depressive episodes. Research on the effectiveness of these and other medications in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder is ongoing. In addition, studies are investigating various forms of psychotherapy, including cognitive-beha vioral therapy, to complement medication treatment for this illness in young people.79 V. B. 2. Interventions for Serious Problems: Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar Disorder in Teens American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry 2. BIPOLAR DISORDER (MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ILLNESS) IN TEENS No. 38 Updated 5/2000 (http://www.aacap.org/publications/factsfam/bipolar.htm) Teenagers with Bipolar Disorder may have an ongoing combination of extremely high (manic) and low (depressed) moods. Highs may alternate with lows, or the person may feel both extremes at the same time. Bipolar Disorder usually starts in adult life. Although less common, it does occur in teenagers and even rarely in young children. This illness can affect anyone. However, if one or both parents have Bipolar Disorder, the chances are greater that their children will develop the disorder. Family history of drug or alcohol abuse also may be associated with Bipolar Disorder in teens. Bipolar Disorder may begin either with manic or depressive symptoms. The manic symptoms include : severe changes in mood compared to others of the same age and background - either unusually happy or silly, or very irritable, angry, agitated or aggressive unrealistic highs in self-esteem - for example, a teenager who feels all powerful or like a superhero with special powers great increase in energy and the ability to go with little or no sleep for days without feeling tired increase in talking - the adolescent talks too much, too fast, changes topics too quickly, and cannot be interrupted 80 distractibility - the teen's attention moves constantly from one thing to the next repeated high risk-taking behavior; such as, abusing alcohol and drugs, reckless driving, or sexual promiscuity The depressive symptoms include : irritability, depressed mood, persistent sadness, frequent crying thoughts of death or suicide loss of enjoyment in favorite activities frequent complaints of physical illnesses such as headaches or stomach aches low energy level, fatigue, poor concentration, complaints of boredom major change in eating or sleeping patterns, such as oversleeping or overeating Some of these signs are similar to those that occur in teenagers with other problems such as drug abuse, delinquency, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or even schizophrenia. The diagnosis can only be made with careful observation over an extended period of time. A thorough evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist can be helpful in identifying the problems and starting specific treatment. Teenagers with Bipolar Disorder can be effectively treated. Treatment for Bipolar Disorder usually includes education of the patient and the family about the illness, mood stabilizing medications such as lithium and valproic acid, and psychotherapy. Mood stabilizing medications often reduce the number and severity of manic episodes, and also help to prevent depression. Psychotherapy helps the teenager understand himself or herself, adapt to stresses, rebuild self-esteem and improve relationships. 81V. B. 3. Interventions for Serious Problems: Bipolar Disorder: Sample Goals for Individualized Educational Program 3. Sample Goals for Individualized Educational Program (from : NAMI - the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill http://www.nami.org/youth/iep.html) Excerpt: While preparing their book, The Bipolar Child, authors Janice and Demitri Papolos sent a description of \"Elan,\" a hypothetical student with bipolar disorder and special education needs, Elan is a personable individual who shows good attention and task orientation for very short periods of time. Elan has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. His emotions and his academic availability are variable and quite unpredictable. Physical complaints are often present both in and out of school. Presently, Elan has a difficult time getting up in the morning, and he is often late, or does not come to school at all. He can appear tired, bored, irritable, and explosive, and he has poor judgment and decision-making skills. Other times, Elan can be extremely energetic and need to move around quite a bit. He can be talkative, distractible, and extremely impulsive. Elan has difficulty expressing his feelings and frustrations , and he often has negative and hopeless thoughts. When unable to do something others might consider simple, he feels a sense of failure. He does not have good problem-solving skills or stress-management techniques. He often resorts to self-inflicted wounds and talks of suicide. Elan's concentration and ability to focus can be extremely impaired because of his limited alertness and attendance difficulties. His lack of interpersonal skills causes peer difficulties and limits his ability to establish healthy relationships with peers and adults. At other times-usually when he has high energy levels and is becoming more manic-he feels his understanding is superior to that of his classmates and that this negates his need to complete assignments. During these times, he can be disrespectful to adults, oppositional, and provoking to his peers. Currently, Elan is very compliant about taking his medications, and he has the desire to do what it takes to manage his disorder. Consistent positive understanding and intervention is necessary for improving Elan's self-esteem and allowing him to be accepted through his good and bad times. Staying calm and speaking to him in a reassuring tone is a must. Elan is in need of a smaller, very structured setting that would be sensitive to his psychosocial needs. He presently does not do well with change or too much environmental stimulation. Counseling and support services, such as a safe place and/or a person to go to when he feels overwhelmed or is having negative thoughts, is necessary. A support group with similar peers would be ideal, if available. Flexibility in this plan is a must.82Goal #1 :Elan will learn and apply strategies to independently divert bad thoughts. Objectives: Elan will go to the school counselor/psychologist twice a week (more frequently as needed). Elan will explore negative thoughts with the counselor and develop strategies for diverting them independently. Elan will tell an appropriate adult when he has negative feelings he cannot manage. Elan will use a variety of learned strategies and document results in a journal at least two times weekly. Goal #2: Elan will develop other techniques to relieve anxiety rather than resort to harmful behaviors. Objectives: When faced with a stressful situation, Elan will explore options with a counselor. Elan will address anxiety-causing topics, which may be suggested by staff, in a journal at least one time per week. Elan will talk to an adult when feeling explosive or becoming out of control. He will remove himself to a safe place/person before harming himself or others. Elan will identify triggers that contribute to harmful behaviors and problem-solve alternatives with a counselor. Goal #3: Elan will increase his time on task with only one redirective from 2-3 minutes to 10-15 minutes. Objectives: Elan will comply with all redirection (such as non-verbal cues) the first time. Elan will increase the number of daily assignments he completes within a specified amount of time, determined by the teacher and his ability for that day. Elan will stay focused for 10-15 minutes-or longer-on any given subject. Elan will use problem-solving strategies when needing a break to refresh and refocus. 83 Goal #4: Elan will increase his communication skills in a variety of settings. Objectives: Elan will seek assistance with problem-solving from appropriate adults. Elan will practice communication skills at least one time per week with staff and in his journal. Elan will ask an adult when he needs to move around and/or go to a safe place. Elan will tell an adult when he feels he may be getting out of control. Elan will converse positively with a peer three times a week. He will note any positive changes he notices as a result of these interactions. Goal #5: Elan will achieve grade-level work with a success ratio of four out of five assignments completed in all classes. Objectives: When given an assignment, Elan will complete four out of five of them, accurately, legibly, and on time. Elan will ask for extended time, modified work, etc. when he feels overwhelmed. (Parent will have to do this initially.) Elan will accept redirection cues from the teacher when off task. Elan will use a homework notebook daily to record all assignments. Teachers will check for accuracy and sign. Parent will sign to verify homework is completed. 84Modifications Necessary at This Time: Breaking down assignments into manageable parts with clear and simple directions, given one at a time. Preparing for transitions. Ensuring clarity of understanding and alertness. Allowing most difficult subjects to be taken in the afternoon when he is most alert. Granting extra time for tests, class work, and homework. Allowing for unpredictable mood swings and skill functioning. Training all staff involved with Elan on bipolar disorder. Ensuring awareness of potential victimization from other students. Providing positive praise and redirection. Reporting any suicidal comments to counselor/psychologist immediately. Providing home instruction to help him keep up with schoolwork if there are times when Elan's mood disorder makes it impossible for him to attend school for an extended period of time. Placing an aide in Elan's classroom to ensure his well-being and to assist the teacher with all the students who also need help. Having the aide accompany Elan as a buddy without drawing undue attention to him if he does not do well with unstructured times, such as lunch and recess. Behavior Plan Goal # 6: Elan will decrease explosive outbursts. Objectives: Elan will seek adult assistance before lashing out with aggressive behaviors. Elan will remove himself and seek time out and/or a safe place when feeling explosive. Elan will learn and apply strategies for anger control. Elan will postpone making important decisions during a depressive state. Elan will recognize possible early signs of an impending manic or depressive cycle and talk about them to his psychiatrist. Elan will earn points for all of the above. Points can be accumulated toward a day without homework or something special that will motivate this child.

Interventions for Serious Problems: Bipolar Disorder: Educator's Guide to Receiving Bipolar Students After Hospitalization 4. Educator's Guide To Receiving Bipolar Students After Hospitalization (2000) by Tracey Trudeau. (From the Child & Adolescent Bipolar Foundation - http://www.bpkids.org/learning/reference/articles/015.htm) Tracey Trudeau is a Child & Adolescent Specialist at the Mood Disorders Association of Manitoba, Canada. 1.Erratic school attendance makes it difficult to assess academic potential or impairment, therefore awareness of lack of opportunity to learn as opposed to the inability to learn is important. Students require flexibility in their academic programming, including those capable of learning core subjects when well and stable. This ultimately becomes an attendance issue rather than a problem defined by a deficit in potential. 2. Premorbid cognitive assessment data provide a good baseline measure for illness-related changes, particularly when qualitative analyses of subtests are employed. 3. A strong supportive partnership between the disciplines of psychiatry and education where there is some common understanding of each other's roles, needs, and language is a prerequisite of successful transitioning. Information sharing that is full of discipline-related jargon confounds the end purpose - student well-being. 4. A special effort should be made by inpatient facilities to connect with rural school districts to minimize any feelings of geographical disconnection by receiving school staff or perception of diminished support. 5. Inpatient staff roles should include finding a supportive school and a primary liaison for the student, providing initial teacher education, program planning assistance, and post-placement support to the receiving school. 6. Predictable and consistent daily routines are ideal for recovering students - the idea of one room, one teacher, might be explored with appropriate students. Gradual or partial re-integration is usually recommended rather than returning with a full academic load. 7. Importance of finding a student's optimum learning style is stressed (i.e. auditory, visual, kinesthetic), as is the willingness of teachers to allow flexibility of the format of work product that would best represent the student's understanding of concepts. 8. Medication and treatment non-adherence difficulties are often timed around school and holiday transitions. Is there a role here for the school counselor in proactively seeking out the student and checking in? 9. Some students will struggle with learning in two languages after recovery despite excelling previously in bilingual education. Careful evaluation of student ability to continue in a demanding bilingual program will ensure that possible pressure to please parents or teachers does not sabotage the total academic program. 8610. Students have a strong desire to return to community schooling. This is complicated by worry of ostracism or harassment by peers. These concerns should be raised proactively by parents, therapists, and school staff. Instances of bullying or ridicule about psychiatric hospitalization or diagnosis should be dealt with swiftly and seriously in a manner consistent with racial or sexual harassment. 11. Mental health units should be taught in the upper grades in the context of regular biology or health courses. It is important to begin to demystify these illnesses to the general public and to peers of recovering students rather than solely directing this information to educators, service providers and other helpers. 12. Hospital staff is encouraged to develop a personalized checklist for cues of illness relapse (such as particular symptom emergence) based upon an individual student's past history and current presentation. The student should collaborate in the creation of the checklist and know the steps a school staff member will take on his/her behalf. The use of a contract in the event of acute illness onset facilitates more efficiently timed emergency psychiatric services. Emergence of psychotic symptoms in school should be handled (if possible) discretely. 13. Medication education (especially the side effect profile and level of efficacy in controlling symptoms) should be provided to teachers. Evaluation of work product and performance must consider the limitations of residual illness symptoms and medication side effects: Poor penmanship due to hand tremor, awkward gait or rapid weight gain in physical education, dry mouth and increased fluid intake necessitating frequent bathroom trips, heightened sensitivity to noise and light, are all common in students treated with psychotropic medications. 14. Public school reintegration should be gradual (starting with half days) and working gradually towards a full load if the student is capable. Curriculums should be flexible and the preferred learning methods are co-operative learning and a module format. Mastery learning through module format will ensure that cognitive instability has not interfered with concepts previously taught. A module format may be helpful where a student can work at his or her own pace, or perhaps come back to the module after a hospitalization. Emphasis on mastery learning may be appropriate for students who have lost previous academic achievements/gains. Learning gaps (including concurrent high competencies and clear deficits) are common in bipolar students. 15. A peer mentor (ideally one grade older) may be assigned to the student at a new school. Conversely, a recovering bipolar student wishing to mentor younger peers may be important in developing self-competency. A peer mentor from a self-help or advocacy group may be one important step in understanding that it is possible to grow beyond persistent psychiatric illness, or conversely, share the realistic experiences of being treatment non-adherent and self-destructive. 16. Teachers and other staff should encourage a self-help philosophy with students through advocating for a life- management perspective. Such a philosophy includes self-challenge, self-acceptance, honesty, and especially humor. Typical classroom behavior management strategies are appropriate to use when the student is stable and in remission - they do not work when the student is becoming ill or is still in recovery. For example, during the depressive phase of the illness, bipolar students experience phenomena called 'anhedonia' or flat affect - the inability to experience pleasure or happiness. Consequently, the student has lost the reinforcement of satisfaction which comes from learning something new, so being praised and encouraged by teachers and parents may be ineffectual for behavioral reinforcement. 17. Special education staff are encouraged to design IEPs for students with bipolar disorder that allow for equal time to develop strengths and to follow creative projects as is given for addressing identified academic shortcomings. Students who see themselves as spending more time 'making up' and less time 'getting ahead'87may not develop an area of perceived competence. For example, these students show decline in math performance when comparing work pre- and post-illness. Remedial work in math is necessary, however bipolar disorder also increases the tendency of creative excellence in the visual and written arts. These strengths must be developed and even become a primary focus in an IEP. 18. Below average adaptive behavior skills (communication, daily living skills, socialization, motor skills) as measured by tools like the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale may identify target areas missed in more 'intellect-based' assessments (Shole-Martin & Alessi, 1988). Many students who are hospitalized frequently or for extended periods with serious psychiatric illnesses show significant to serious deficits in adaptive behavior skills. Consulting with an occupational therapist may identify problems which parents and/or teachers have attributed to 'motivational' factors. 19. If a student is capable or doing all academic work, but at a slower pace, or, in chunks due to regular and protracted school absences, an IEP that realistically plans for 1.5 academic years to complete each grade might be more helpful than a plan that 'hopes' the student will complete the work if he or she would just remain stable. This also brings forth the serious question of mandatory grade promotion. If the student can understand the work but simply requires the time to complete it, are educators creating ever-increasing cumulative deficits and setting these bipolar students up for later failure? Promoting these students just so that they may remain with their peers may not be a) what the student wants, b) an academically sound decision, or c) the best way to ensure that the student is given a chance to learn to his or her potential. 20. Inpatient staff must ask themselves if parents are making 'informed' decisions regarding educational and health concerns for their children. Parents must know, however hard it may be, the full extent of current and future impairment given what is know about the student's course of illness and history. This is neither the time to 'understate' the case nor to protect the student and the family from the expectation that relapse is not only likely but highly probable. The goal is to frankly communicate the serious nature of the disorder while ensuring that some optimism may be maintained. Contingency planning helps reduce the anxiety of impending relapse. 21. The most important goal for an educator of a bipolar student is to keep that student interested in learning and feeling welcome at school. This is even more important that teaching a prescribed number of concepts by June or in a manner that does not appear to 'bend the rules' too much for a particular child. If the primary measure of success in educating these students is how well they have been molded into the routine and rules of the school, then it is likely that the student's best interests have come second. This illness will go on far longer than the years spent in school. If the student leaves school loving to learn, (s)he will come back to it throughout the lifespan when well enough. 22.Remember that the student did not choose to have bipolar disorder any more than a child chooses to have Down's syndrome or profound deafness. The transition planning process and educational programming should be governed by compassion. Tracey Trudeau may be contacted at: tltrudeau@hotmail.com. 88 V. C. 1. Interventions for Serious Problems: Anger: Controlling Anger APA ONLINE (http://www.apa.org/pubinfo/anger.html) 1. Controlling Anger -- Before It Controls You We all know what anger is, and we've all felt it: whether as a fleeting annoyance or as full-fledged rage. Anger is a completely normal, usually healthy, human emotion. But when it gets out of control and turns destructive, it can lead to problems\u2014\u2014problems at wo rk, in your personal relationships, and in the overall quality of your life. And it can make you feel as though you're at the mercy of an unpredictable andpowerful emotion. This brochure is meant to help you understand and control anger. What is Anger? The Nature of Anger Anger is \"an emotional state that varies in intensity fr om mild irritation to intense fury and rage,\" according to Charles Spielberger, PhD, a psychologist who specializes in the study of anger. Like other emotions, itis accompanied by physiological and biological change s; when you get angry, your heart rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. Anger can be caused by both external and internal ev ents. You could be angry at a specific person (Such as a coworker or supervisor) or event (a traffic jam, a canceled flight), or your anger could be caused by worrying or brooding about your personal problems. Memo ries of traumatic or enraging events can also trigger angry feelings. Expressing Anger The instinctive, natural way to express anger is to respond aggressively. Anger is a natural, adaptive response to threats; it inspires powerful, often aggre ssive, feelings and behaviors, which allow us to fight and to defend ourselves when we are attacked. A certa in amount of anger, therefore, is necessary to our survival. On the other hand, we can't physically lash out at every person or object that irritates or annoys us; laws, social norms, and common sense place limits on how far our anger can take us. People use a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with their angry feelings. The three main approaches are expressing, suppressing, and calming. Expressing your angry feelings in anassertive\u2014\u2014not aggressive\u2014\u2014manner is the healthiest wa y to express anger. To do this, you have to learn how to make clear what your needs are, and how to get them met, w ithout hurting others. Being assertive doesn't mean being pushy or demanding; it means being respectful of yourself and others. 89 Anger can be suppressed, and then converted or redir ected. This happens when you hold in your anger, stop thinking about it, and focus on something positive. The aim is to inhibit or suppress your anger and convertit into more constructive behavior. The danger in this type of response is that if it isn't allowed outward expression, your anger can turn inward\u2014\u2014on yourself. Anger turned inward may cause hypertension, high blood pressure, or depression. Unexpressed anger can create other problems. It can l ead to pathological expressions of anger, such as passive-aggressive behavior (getting back at peopl e indirectly, without telling them why, rather than confronting them head-on) or a personality that seems perpetually cynical and hostile. People who are constantly putting others down, criticizing everythi ng, and making cynical comments haven't learned how to constructively express their anger. Not surprisingly, they aren't likely to have many successfulrelationships. Finally, you can calm down inside. This means not just controlling your outward behavior, but also controlling your internal responses, taking steps to lower your heart rate, calm yourself down, and let the feelings subside... Anger Management The goal of anger management is to re duce both your emotional feelings and the physiological arousal that anger causes. You can't get rid of, or avoid, the things or the people that enrage you, nor can you change them, but you can learn to controlyour reactions. Are You Too Angry? There are psychological tests that measure the intensity of angry feelings, how pr one to anger you are, and how well you handle it. But chances are good that if you do have a problem with anger, you already know it. If you find yourself acting in ways that seem out of control and fr ightening, you might need help finding better ways to deal with this emotion. Why Are Some People More Angry Than Others? According to Jerry Deffenbacher, PhD, a psychologist who specializes in anger management, some people really are more \"hotheaded\" than others are; they ge t angry more easily and more intensely than the average person does. There are also those who don't show thei r anger in loud spectacular ways but are chronically irritable and grumpy. Easily angered people don't always curse and throw things; sometimes they withdraw socially, sulk, or get physically ill. People who are easily angered generally have what so me psychologists call a low tolerance for frustration, meaning simply that they feel that they should not have to be subjected to frustration, inconvenience, or annoyance. They can't take things in stride, and they're particularly infuriated if the situation seemssomehow unjust: for example, being corrected for a minor mistake. What makes these people this way? A number of things. One cause may be genetic or physiological: There is evidence that some children are born irritable, touc hy, and easily angered, and that these signs are present from a very early age. Another may be sociocultural. Anger is often regarded as negative; we're taught that90 it's all right to express anxiety, depression, or other emo tions but not to express a nger. As a result, we don't learn how to handle it or channel it constructively. Research has also found that family background plays a role. Typically, people who are easily angered come from families that are disruptive, chaotic, and not skilled at emotional communications. Is It Good To \"Let it All Hang Out?\" Psychologists now say that this is a dangerous myth. Some people use this theory as a license to hurt others. Research has found that \"letting it rip\" with anger actually escalates anger and aggression and does nothing to help you (or the person you're angry with) resolve the situation. It's best to find out what it is that triggers your anger, and then to develop strategies to keep those triggers from tipping you over the edge. Strategies To Keep Anger At Bay Relaxation Simple relaxation tools, such as deep breathing and relaxing imagery, can help calm down angry feelings. There are books and courses that can teach you rela xation techniques, and once you learn the techniques, you can call upon them in any situati on. If you are involved in a relations hip where both partners are hot- tempered, it might be a good idea for both of you to learn these techniques. Some simple steps you can try: Breathe deeply, from your diaphragm; breathi ng from your chest won't relax you. Picture your breath coming up from your \"gut.\" Slowly repeat a calm word or phrase such as \"relax,\" \"take it easy.\" Repeat it to yourself while breathing deeply. Use imagery; visualize a relaxing experience, from either your memory or your imagination. Nonstrenuous, slow yoga-like exercises can relax your muscles and make you feel much calmer. Practice these techniques daily. Learn to use them automatically when you're in a tense situation. Cognitive Restructuring Simply put, this means changing the way you think. Angr y people tend to curse, swear, or speak in highly colorful terms that reflect their inner thoughts. When you're angry, your thinking can get very exaggerated and overly dramatic. Try replacing these thoughts with mo re rational ones. For instance, instead of telling yourself, \"oh, it's awful, it's terri ble, everything's ruined,\" tell yourself, \"it's frustrating, and it's understandable that I'm upset about it, but it's not the end of the world and getting angry is not going to fix it anyhow.\" 91Be careful of words like \"never\" or \"always\" when talking about yourse lf or someone else. \"This !&*%@ machine never works,\" or \"you're always forgetting things\" are not just inaccurate, they also serve to makeyou feel that your anger is justified and that there's no way to solve the problem. They also alienate and humiliate people who might otherwise be willing to work with you on a solution. Remind yourself that getting angry is not going to fix anything, that it won't make you feel better (and may actually make you feel worse). Logic defeats anger, because anger, even when it's jus tified, can quickly become i rrational. So use cold hard logic on yourself. Remind yourself that the world is \" not out to get you,\" you're just experiencing some of the rough spots of daily life. Do this each time you f eel anger getting the best of you, and it'll help you get a more balanced perspective. Angry people tend to demand things: fairness, appreciation, agreement,willingness to do things their way. Everyone wants thes e things, and we are all hurt and disappointed when we don't get them, but angry people demand them, and when their demands aren't met, their disappointment becomes anger. As part of their cognitive restruct uring, angry people need to become aware of their demanding nature and translate their expectations into desires. In other words, saying, \"I would like\"something is healthier than saying, \"I demand\" or \"I must have\" something. When you're unable to get whatyou want, you will experience the normal reactions\u2014\u2014f rustration, disappointment, hurt\u2014\u2014but not anger. Some angry people use this anger as a way to avoid f eeling hurt, but that doesn't mean the hurt goes away. Problem Solving Sometimes, our anger and frustration are caused by very real and inescapable problems in our lives. Not all anger is misplaced, and often it's a healthy, natural response to these difficulties. There is also a culturalbelief that every problem has a solution, and it adds to our frustration to find out that this isn't always the case. The best attitude to bring to such a situation, then, is not to focus on finding the solution, but ratheron how you handle and face the problem. Make a plan, and check your progress along the way. Resolve to give it your best, but also not to punish yourself if an answer doesn't come right away. If you can approach it with your best intentions and efforts and make a serious attempt to face it head-on, you will be less likely to lose patience and fall into all-or- nothing thinking, even if the problem does not get solved right away. Better Communication Angry people tend to jump to\u2014\u2014and act on\u2014\u2014conclusions , and some of those conclusions can be very inaccurate. The first thing to do if you're in a heated discussion is slow down and think through yourresponses. Don't say the first thing that comes into your head, but slow down and think carefully about what you want to say. At the same time, listen carefully to what the other person is saying and take your time before answering. Listen, too, to what is underlying the anger. For inst ance, you like a certain amount of freedom and personal space, and your \"significant other\" wants more connection and closeness. If he or she starts complainingabout your activities, don't retaliate by painting your part ner as a jailer, a warden, or an albatross around your neck. 92It's natural to get defensive when you're criticized, but don't fight back. Instead, listen to what's underlying the words: the message that this person might feel neglected and unloved. It may take a lot of patient questioning on your part, and it may require some breathing space, but don't let your anger\u2014\u2014or a partner's\u2014\u2014let a discussion spin out of control. K eeping your cool can keep the situation from becoming a disastrous one. Using Humor \"Silly humor\" can help defuse rage in a number of wa ys. For one thing, it can help you get a more balanced perspective. When you get angry and call someone a name or refer to them in some imaginative phrase, stop and picture what that word would literally look like. If you're at work and you th ink of a coworker as a \"dirtbag\" or a \"single-cell life form,\" for example, picture a large bag full of dirt (or an amoeba) sitting atyour colleague's desk, talking on the phone, going to m eetings. Do this whenever a name comes into your head about another person. If you can, draw a picture of what the actual thing might look like. This will take a lot of the edge off your fury; and humor can always be relied on to help unknot a tense situation. The underlying message of highly angry people, Dr. Deffenbacher says, is \"things oughta go my way!\" Angry people tend to feel that they are morally right , that any blocking or changing of their plans is an unbearable indignity and that they should NOT ha ve to suffer this way. Ma ybe other people do, but not them! When you feel that urge, he suggest s, picture yourself as a god or goddess, a supreme ruler, who owns the streets and stores and office space, striding alone and having your way in all situations while others defer to you. The more detail you can get into your imaginary scenes, the more chances you have to realize that maybe you are being unreasonable; you'll also realize how unimportant the things you're angry about really are. There are two cautions in using humor. First, don' t try to just \"laugh off\" your problems; rather, use humor to help yourself face them more constructively. Second, don't give in to harsh, sarcastic humor; that's just another form of unhealthy anger expression. What these techniques have in common is a refusal to take yourself too seriously. Anger is a serious emotion, but it's often accompanied by ideas that, if examined, can make you laugh. Changing Your Environment Sometimes it's our immediate surroundings that give us cause for irritation and fury. Problems and responsibilities can weigh on you and make you feel angry at the \"trap\" you seem to have fallen into andall the people and things that form that trap. Give yourself a break. Make sure you have some \"per sonal time\" scheduled for times of the day that you know are particularly stressful. One example is the wo rking mother who has a standing rule that when she comes home from work, for the firs t 15 minutes \"nobody talks to Mom unl ess the house is on fire.\" After this brief quiet time, she feels better prepared to ha ndle demands from her kids without blowing up at them.93 Some Other Tips for Easing Up on Yourself Timing: If you and your spouse tend to fight when you discuss things at night\u2014\u2014perhaps you're tired, or distracted, or maybe it's just habit\u2014\u2014try changing the times when you talk about important matters so these talks don't turn into arguments. Avoidance: If your child's chaotic room makes you fu rious every time you walk by it, shut the door. Don't make yourself look at what infuriates you. Don't say, \"w ell, my child should clean up the room so I won't have to be angry!\" That's not the point. The point is to keep yourself calm. Finding alternatives: If your daily commute through traffi c leaves you in a state of rage and frustration, give yourself a project\u2014\u2014learn or map out a different route, one that's less c ongested or more scenic. Or find another alternative, such as a bus or commuter train. Do You Need Counseling? If you feel that your anger is really out of control, if it is having an impact on your relationships and on important parts of your life, you might consider couns eling to learn how to ha ndle it better. A psychologist or other licensed mental health professional can wo rk with you in developing a range of techniques for changing your thinking and your behavior. When you talk to a prospective therapist, tell her or him that you have problem s with anger that you want to work on, and ask about his or her approach to ange r management. Make sure this isn't only a course of action designed to \"put you in touc h with your feelings and express them\"\u2014\u2014that may be precisely what your problem is. With counseling, psychologists say, a highly angry person can move closer to a middlerange of anger in about 8 to 10 weeks, depending on the circumstances and the techniques used. What About Assertiveness Training? It's true that angry people need to learn to become assertive (rather than aggressive), but most books and courses on developing assertiveness are aimed at people who don't feel enough anger. These people are more passive and acquiescent than the average person; th ey tend to let others walk all over them. That isn't something that most angry people do. Still, these books can contain some useful tactics to use in frustrating situations. Remember, you can't eliminate anger\u2014\u2014and it wouldn' t be a good idea if you coul d. In spite of all your efforts, things will happen that will cause you anger; and sometimes it will be justifiable anger. Life will be filled with frustration, pain, loss, and the unpredicta ble actions of others. You can't change that; but you can change the way you let such events affect you. Controlling your angry responses can keep them from making you even more unhappy in the long run.94V. C. 2. Interventions for Serious Problems: Anger: Helping Young Children Deal With Anger 2.Helping Young Children Deal with Anger. ERIC Digest. ERIC Identifier: ED414077 Publication Date: 1997-12-00 Author: Marion, Marian Source: ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education Champaign IL. (http://www.ericfacility.net/ericdigests/ed414077.html) Children's anger presents challenges to teachers committed to constructive, ethical, and effective child guidance. This Digest explores what we know about the components of children's anger, factors contributing to understanding and managing anger, and the ways teachers can guide children's expressions of anger. THREE COMPONENTS OF ANGER Anger is believed to have three components (Lewis & Michalson, 1983): THE EMOTIONAL STATE OF ANGER. The first component is the emotion itself, defined as an affective or arousal state, or a feeling experienced when a goal is blocked or needs are frustrated. Fabes and Eisenberg (1992) describe several types of stress-producing anger provocations that young children face daily in classroom interactions: * Conflict over possessions, which involves someone taking children's property or invading their space. * Physical assault, which involves one child doing something to another child, such as pushing or hitting. * Verbal conflict, for example, a tease or a taunt. * Rejection, which involves a child being ignored or not allowed to play with peers. * Issues of compliance, which often involve asking or insisting that children do something that they do not want to do--for instance, wash their hands. EXPRESSION OF ANGER. The second component of anger is its expression. Some children vent or express anger through facial expressions, crying, sulking, or talking, but do little to try to solve a problem or confront the provocateur. Others actively resist by physically or verbally defending their positions, self- esteem, or possessions in nonaggressive ways. Still other children express anger with aggressive revenge by physically or verbally retaliating against the provocateur. Some children express dislike by telling the offender that he or she cannot play or is not liked. Other children express anger through avoidance or attempts to escape from or evade the provocateur. And some children use adult seeking, looking for comfort or solutions from a teacher, or telling the teacher about an incident. 95Teachers can use child guidance strategies to help children express angry feelings in socially constructive ways. Children develop ideas about how to express emotions (Michalson & Lewis, 1985; Russel, 1989) primarily through social interaction in their families and later by watching television or movies, playing video games, and reading books (Honig & Wittmer, 1992). Some children have learned a negative, aggressive approach to expressing anger (Cummings, 1987; Hennessy et al., 1994) and, when confronted with everyday anger conflicts, resort to using aggression in the classroom (Huesmann, 1988). A major challenge for early childhood teachers is to encourage children to acknowledge angry feelings and to help them learn to express anger in positive and effective ways. AN UNDERSTANDING OF ANGER . The third component of the anger experience is understanding-- interpreting and evaluating--the emotion. Because the ability to regulate the expression of anger is linked to an understanding of the emotion (Zeman & Shipman, 1996), and because children's ability to reflect on their anger is somewhat limited, children need guidance from teachers and parents in understanding and managing their feelings of anger. UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGING ANGER The development of basic cognitive processes undergirds children's gradual development of the understanding of anger (Lewis & Saarni, 1985). MEMORY. Memory improves substantially during early childhood (Perlmutter, 1986), enabling young children to better remember aspects of anger-arousing interactions. Children who have developed unhelpful ideas of how to express anger (Miller & Sperry, 1987) may retrieve the early unhelpful strategy even after teachers help them gain a more helpful perspective. This finding implies that teachers may have to remind some children, sometimes more than once or twice, about the less aggressive ways of expressing anger. LANGUAGE. Talking about emotions helps young children understand their feelings (Brown & Dunn, 1996). The understanding of emotion in preschool children is predicted by overall language ability (Denham, Zoller, & Couchoud, 1994). Teachers can expect individual differences in the ability to identify and label angry feelings because children's families model a variety of approaches in talking about emotions. SELF-REFERENTIAL AND SELF-REGULATORY BEHAVIORS. Self-referential behaviors include viewing the self as separate from others and as an active, independent, causal agent. Self-regulation refers to controlling impulses, tolerating frustration, and postponing immediate gratification. Initial self-regulation in young children provides a base for early childhood teachers who can develop strategies to nurture children's emerging ability to regulate the expression of anger. 96GUIDING CHILDREN'S EXPRESSIONS OF ANGER Teachers can help children deal with anger by guiding their understanding and management of this emotion. The practices described here can help children understand and manage angry feelings in a direct and nonaggressive way. CREATE A SAFE EMOTIONAL CLIMATE. A healthy early childhood setting permits children to acknowledge all feelings, pleasant and unpleasant, and does not shame anger. Healthy classroom systems have clear, firm, and flexible boundaries. MODEL RESPONSIBLE ANGER MANAGEMENT. Children have an impaired ability to understand emotion when adults show a lot of anger (Denham, Zoller, & Couchoud, 1994). Adults who are most effective in helping children manage anger model responsible management by acknowledging, accepting, and taking responsibility for their own angry feelings and by expressing anger in direct and nonaggressive ways. HELP CHILDREN DEVELOP SELF-REGULATORY SKILLS. Teachers of infants and toddlers do a lot of self-regulation \"work,\" realizing that the children in their care have a very limited ability to regulate their own emotions. As children get older, adults can gradually transfer control of the self to children, so that they can develop self-regulatory skills. ENCOURAGE CHILDREN TO LABEL FEELINGS OF ANGER. Teachers and parents can help young children produce a label for their anger by teaching them that they are having a feeling and that they can use a word to describe their angry feeling. A permanent record (a book or chart) can be made of lists of labels for anger (e.g., mad, irritated, annoyed), and the class can refer to it when discussing angry feelings. ENCOURAGE CHILDREN TO TALK ABOUT ANGER-AROUSING INTERACTIONS. Preschool children better understand anger andother emotions when adults explain emotions (Denham, Zoller, &Couchoud, 1994). When children are embroiled in an anger-arousinginteraction, teachers can help by listening without judging,evaluating, or ordering them to feel differently. USE BOOKS AND STORIES ABOUT ANGER TO HELP CHILDREN. UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE ANGER. Well-presented stories about anger and other emotions validate children's feelings and give information about anger (Jalongo, 1986; Marion, 1995). It is important to preview all books about anger because some stories teach irresponsible anger management. COMMUNICATE WITH PARENTS. Some of the same strategies employed to talk with parents about other areas of the curriculum can be used to enlist their assistance in helping children learn to express emotions. For example, articles about learning to use words to label anger can be included in a newsletter to parents. Children guided toward responsible anger management are more likely to understand and manage angry feelings directly and nonaggressively and to avoid the stress often accompanying poor anger management (Eisenberg et al., 1991). Teachers can take some of the bumps out of understanding and managing anger by adopting positive guidance strategies. 97V. C. 3. Interventions for Serious Problems: Anger: Helping the Child Who is Expressing Anger SAMHSA's National Mental Health Information Center The Center for Mental Health Services (http://www.mentalhealth.org/publications/allpubs/Ca-0032/default.asp) 3. Helping the Child Who is Expressing Anger When you hear about children killing other children, you may think, \"I don't know a single child who could do such a thing.\" Too often the daily news confirms that children and teens can be violent, even deadly. As parents, families, teachers a nd members of the community, what can we do to help children cope with angry feelings--from frustration to rage? Some young people turn to violence, because they do not see other ways to endure what they are feeling at that moment. They may not anticipate the repercussions oftheir violence. These tips may help when you recognize a child who is withdrawing or exploding over everyday frustrations: Listen to what the child is saying about his or her feelings and be willing to talk about any subject. Young people t oday are dealing with adult problems such as love, sex, relationships, failure and rejection. Unfortunately, theirminds and bodies simply are not ready for these stresses. Provide comfort and assurance. Tell th e child that you care about his or her problems. Show confidence in his or her ability to tackle life''s ups anddowns. Tell the child that everyone experiences anger. Tell him or her about the last time you felt really angry and how you dealt with that anger in a positiveway.98 Encourage the child to shift gears\u2014\u2014t o spend some time doing things he or she really likes to do\u2014\u2014playing sports , walking someone's dog, or reading a book. A different activity can refocus thoughts and help alleviate some of the angry feelings. Teach basic problem-solving skills. When upsetting situations arise, the child who has practiced these skills will be more likely to think through the consequences of different actions and will, ultimately, make a better choicethan violence. Look at how you handle your own a nger. Are you setting a good example? Would you want to be imitated by a child who admires you? Acknowledge good behavior. When a child deals with his or her anger in a positive way, praise the positive choice. Take every opportunity to reinforcestrengths. Build the child''s awareness of his or her own talents and abilities. If none of these approaches seems to work, and the child stays angry or withdrawn for a long time, seek help. Talk to your family doctor or pediatri cian. Together, you may decide that your child and family need help from someone with more mental health training.

Interventions for Serious Problems: Anger: Helping Your Children Navigate Their Teen Years 99SAMHSA's National Mental Health Information Center The Center for Mental Health Services (http://www.mentalhealth.org/publications/allpubs/SVP-0013/SVP-0013ch5.asp) 4.Helping Y our Children Navigate Their T een Years: A Guide for Parents Managing Anger: Theirs and Yours Warm family relationships can help protect children from acting violently, abusing alcohol and other drugs, or engaging in other high-risk behaviors. But family members\u2014even in the most loving families\u2014get angry at one another from time to time. When families communicate well and work cooperatively, anger can be resolved without a problem. Handled poorly, however, anger gets in the way of good communication between parent and child. Anger without control can sometimes be dangerous and may even become violent. Many adults are not good at managing anger, and expressing this emotion in a healthy way. Some adults see anger as an emotion that should be suppressed, because it leads to trouble. Some grew up in families in which anger generally led to explosive behavior and even violence. Others were taught that it is not \"nice\" to be angry. It's important that parents know how to manage anger successfully in family life, at work, and in the community. And that same knowledge needs to be shared with children, so that they learn this important skill. My teenage son doesn't know how to handle his intense feelings. He talks back to us and even swears at us. He doesn't do what we ask him to do. He seems to be trying to aggravate us. I get so angry I blow up. We end up screaming at each other and saying things we regret. I feel like things are out of control. With the many changes that occur during adolescence, it's not unusual for teenagers to feel anger and resentment toward parents. Adolescents struggle to establish prepare for adulthood. Sometimes anger is their way of asserting independence. This can wear thin on parents, who may fight back with their own anger, creating a vicious circle of escalating resentment. The best solution to out-of-control anger\u2014whether from a parent or from a teen\u2014is to step back, and identify more positive, healthy ways to deal with strong feelings. We do this when we can calm down and respond in a disciplined and thoughtful way. By maintaining composure, parents can be good role models and open the door to constructive communication with their children. But how do you keep calm when you feel pushed to the limit? Here are some suggestions:100Tips for Calming Down Pick your battles . Sometimes the issue is not worth the anger, or worth arguing about. Take a deep breath; count to ten . Think about the issue before a single word comes out of your mouth. Go for a walk . Use \"self-talk\" to calm down . That is, say something soothing to yourself such as: \"I need to relax and stay calm. I can't afford to blow up.\" Reframe the issue . For example, when your son says something rude to you, it may be less a matter of him disrespecting you than a sign that he has a problem with his anger. \"Framing\" it this way, you focus on the fact that he needs your help in overcoming this problem. Use humor . Humor can sometimes be a good way to calm anger, but be sure not to use sarcasm, which can sometimes be hurtful. Sometimes the hardest part of helping children learn to manage their anger is that parents have to look at their own practices. Parents need to ask: Do I express anger in positive and constructive ways? Do I resolve conflict well? Have I taught my children to accept and express their anger? Resolving Conflict Resolving conflict constructively may be a huge challenge, but it's an absolute necessity for the sake of every member of your family. Once you are calm, you are in a better position to address the issues that caused the conflict. Here are some tips: Give your point of view . State the problem as you see it; speak clearly and calmly\u2014 don't yell. Ask to hear your teen's point of view . Pay attention, listen, and carefully consider what your teen is saying . Discuss ways to solve the dispute without a battle . Practice the art of compromise . Find the middle ground you can both live with comfortably. Assert your authority, when appropriate, but in a calm, yet firm manner . What If the Anger Doesn't Stop? When anger becomes a chronic problem for someone in the family, the underlying issue may be larger than you or your teen can manage. If you even think your family is at this crisis point, or if you even think you or any member of your family has a serious problem with anger management, it's time to seek help from a mental health professional. Recognize that this situation necessitates counseling, and sometimes that means the entire family will need help.101V. C. 5. Interventions for Serious Problems: Anger: Model Programs 5. Model Programs Aggressors, Victims, and Bystanders: Thi nking and Acting to Prevent Violence , for middle schools, is a demonstrated curriculum for high-risk students. Th e curriculum is composed of 12 classroom sessions that deal with violence among peers and the separate but inte rrelated roles of aggressors, victims, and bystanders that youth play in potentially violent situations. The b ackbone of this curriculum is the four-step Think-First Model of Conflict Resolution. The model helps student s to pause and keep cool , understand what is going on before jumping to conclusions, define their problems and goals in ways that will not lead to fights, andgenerate positive solutions. The curriculu m has been tested in urban, suburban, and small-city school districts and has made students more supportive of resolving conflicts without aggression.

The program's main co mponent is a curriculum integrated into a required 11th grade social studies course that trains students to be problem solvers, engages students in solving their school's problems, identifies problem students through reviews by teachers and police, and sponsors regular meetings among school teachers, school administrators , and the police. An evaluation found a 50 percent reduction in incidents requiring calls to the police (mai nly assault-related behaviors) at an intervention school but only a small reduction at a comparison school. In a ddition, threats to teachers decreased 17 percent in an intervention school but increased by five percent in a comparison school.
