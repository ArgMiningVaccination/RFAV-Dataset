{"title": "Hijama Therapy Clinic - AUTISM AND HIJAMA by Bai Sha Hijama Therapy Clinic Admin Hijama Therapy Clinic, Cotabato, Philippines How to check if your child has autism? Autism Spectrum Disorder or simply autism is a developmental disorder where a person's capacity to socialise and communicate with others is affected. The condition may impair the person mildly, but in some cases it can severely disable him/her. The term spectrum is used as the symptoms and signs of the disorder is vastly varied. Astrocytes are type of brain cells that support functioning of neurons. They produce immune and inflammatory molecules amogst other things. It appears that in autism for some reason these astrocytes produce inflammation, which then damages functioning of neurons. If we can stop this inflammation we should be able to rescue brain function in autism, according to this research. \"The researchers co-cultured astrocytes derived from the ASD children with neurons derived from normal controls. The healthy neurons behaved like ASD neurons... \"But more importantly, the opposite was true. When we co-cultured ASD neurons with normal astrocytes, we could rescue the cellular defects. The neurons reverted to normal functioning and behavior.\"Early signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be detected in infants, yet many children with autism do not receive a diagnosis until the ages of two or three. While not every autistic baby is able to be diagnosed as an infant, there are many benefits to receiving a diagnosis before reaching preschool age. Why you must do hijama children and adults...? \"We see the world not as it is but as we are\" Has anyone used a paper dictionary lately? The internet is updated and so you won't find the information that is in books published in the 1970's or before. Pick up a dictionary from back then and be prepared for a few shocks. \"Aspergillosis\" is not a syndrome but a disease caused by fungus Aspergillus fumigatus and \"Asperger\" is a Roman Catholic rite performed in the Church. It is not a pathos. Then look up \"autistic\"- you find the meaning \"obsessed with self.\" These words were not illnesses half a century ago! Children are increasingly becoming brain damaged or autistic. Parents have reported damaging side effects within hours after vaccination. And those that haven't reported life-threatening symptoms, have reported breathing, skin and sleep problems. If you investigate further, the damage caused may be latent. The forecast is cancer rates will rise exponentially by the 1920's and autism will rise from currently 1 in 27 to 1 in 20. That's a couple of years away. Dr. Campbell-McBride's book Gut and Psychology Syndrome contains an entire chapter outlining what health care professionals need to do to improve the vaccination strategy, because the standard vaccination protocol is bound to damage GAPS (Gut and Psychology Syndrome) babies. She explains: \"It's a matter of the last straw breaking the camel's back. If the child is damaged enough, the vaccine can provide that last straw. But if it doesn't provide that last straw in a particular child, then it will get the child closer to the breaking point.\" Cupped blood in Turkey showed high levels of mercury and aluminium drawn from the body. The blood brain barrier does not fully develop until age 7 (some doctors say puberty) in children. They may not have autism but complaints are mainly regarding the gut and brain function- two things that our life depends on. Not everyone has access to a doctor who is also a hijama therapist working in a hospital and able to get (cupped) blood tested but in Turkey it's happening. Children need cupping with blood. The effect of a single vaccine can lead to serious damage. All one has to do is look at the ingredients of the vaccine. Every vaccine uses a metal, either aluminium, mercury and formaldehyde. These metals have the following effects on the body: Aluminum is a heavy metal with known neurotoxic effects on human and animal nervous systems. It can be found in the following childhood vaccines - DTaP, Pediarix (DTaP-Hepatitis B-Polio combination), Pentacel (DTaP-HIB-Polio combination), Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae B (HIB), Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), and Pneumococcal -vaccines [http://www.nvic.org/Doctors-Corner/Aluminum-and-Vaccine-Ingredients.aspx] \"Mercury has a centuries-long history of causing cell injury and cell death\" https://www.sott.net/article/263203-Connecting-the-Dots-Vaccines-heavy-metals-GMOs-and-brain-damage Formaldehyde, widely known as an embalming fluid. An NCI case-control study among funeral industry workers that characterised exposure to formaldehyde also found an association between increasing formaldehyde exposure and mortality from myeloid leukemia. Immediate effects are eye irritation, bronchitis and pneumonia. [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet] Formalin (saturated formaldehyde) belongs to that rare group of poisons which are capable of producing death suddenly when swallowed. Formalin exercises a destructive action upon all organs (pancreas, liver, peritoneal fat, Fallopian tubes,[infertility] etc.) with which it comes in contact and causes inflammation in these organs. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2124506/] \"Since formaldehyde is routinely used in many vaccines given to babies, even tiny and vulnerable premature infants, studies would have looked at whether it is safe to inject this poison directly into their immature systems. No such studies appear to have been done.\" http://www.thevaccinereaction.org/2015/11/formaldehyde-a-poison-and-carcinogen/ One more mention from the NHS website-Gelatin derived from pigs is used as a stabilising agent in some vaccines [http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/vaccine-ingredients.aspx] There is no physical way to reverse the damage but it can be minimised. Since cupped blood contains high amounts of metals, this non-invasive way is the 'one hope' we are now relying on for survival. Adults benefit from cupping but imagine the response of the body of a child. Just as the blood brain barrier allows the heavy metals to enter the brain because it is not fully developed, cupping too can alter the physiology of an unhealthy child. They are still growing and latent illnesses can be prevented through early intervention. It's time to see the world as it is!
