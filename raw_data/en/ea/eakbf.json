I've a bit of a question regarding Reiki and the notorious Covid vaccine. I've had 1 of 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which I accepted without hesitation because I'm convinced it is a good thing, medically. However, I just trained to the master level of Reiki, and in the time I was with my master she suggested on multiple occasions that the soul is 'blocked' or 'lost' due to how vaccines alter your body (which I am not even sure they do). She isn't anti-vax, only anti covid-vaccine, but she said that there are many people now losing connections to their sole, unable to preform Reiki and other spiritual/energy practices due to the rift the vaccine is causing. She told me to seriously think about getting the second dose, so as not to do any further damage and limit my abilities with Reiki etc. Do any other practitioners have any insight as to how something as benign as a vaccine could impact Reiki? Thanks. :) "}
