Those nagging, troublesome illnesses that just don't seem to go away. We go to our family doctor and are prescribed this pill or that cream but nothing seems to work. So someone suggests going to a therapist such as a naturopath or a homeopath or a specialist in Chinese medicine. But which one do you choose? Can the people who practise these disciplines really give help and advice that will make them a good addition - or alternative - to your GP? Good question, says the naturopath Penelope Sach, and one that everybody seeking a complementary therapist should ask or they might find themselves in the hands of a charlatan. \"I think a lot of people don't understand how to find a good complementary therapist - that's where the fear comes in,\" she says. \"People have very bad experiences with someone who might have only done a six-month course and this is not a professional, qualified person. They need to ring the national association [for that therapy] to find the people qualified in that area, who have done years of full-time study and are qualified to treat people. Once people understand that, they know they're in good hands.\" Associate Professor Alan Bensoussan, who has a PhD in Chinese herbal medicine and heads the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the University of Western Sydney, says that the growth in the popularity of alternative therapies has been \"phenomenal\" in recent years. He says the desire to manage - or beat - chronic disease drives many people to seek out a complementary therapist. Some may dislike the idea of undergoing surgery or taking heavy medication while others may not be happy with the progress they are making and look for an alternative. One such ailment is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients can be offered numerous medications and some dietary advice but still be struggling with symptoms years later. We asked three complementary health professionals - all with at least 15 years of practical experience and qualifications involving more than three years' full-time study - how they would approach a patient suffering from IBS. Peter Tumminello, a practising homeopath and lecturer at the Sydney College of Homeopathic Medicine, says he would be looking to home in on a person's individual experience of their illness. \"To get an appreciation of any chronic disease you have to investigate it at depth,\" he says. \"We want to know what they feel in response to it [the illness] - local sensations plus their habits. There might be things they eat or drink that make it better or worse. I'd also be trying to find out when it started, the history of it and any general constitutional weaknesses in that person. All these things lead us to prescribe a remedy tailor-made for their problem.\" Medical and general health history are also important to Sach. She takes a thorough case history of the patient's childhood illnesses and also inquires about their socio-economic background, what they eat and where they live. \"That all fits in,\" she says. \"They might have grown up in an industrial area and come from a low socio-economic group that, unfortunately, didn't attend to certain food groups and that will affect children's bowels right from the very beginning.\" Before she recommends a diet or herbal/vitamin preparation, Sach looks at the patient's iris to get an idea of their health and constitution and what foods might disagree with them. \"You should improve within three weeks,\" she says. \"I tell a patient that within three months there should be 50 per cent to 60 per cent improvement.\" Bensoussan says there are several syndromes in Chinese medicine that relate to IBS. His task is to pinpoint which one is involved by assessing \"symptoms and signs\": energy levels, whether the severity of the illness fluctuates and when, where pain is located and what their stools are like. Any prescription would include dietary change, he says. First, to take pressure off the gut while the patient is being treated; second, \"because even the strongest herbs that are used therapeutically are just part of a continuum of ingestibles\". Patients who have had digestive trouble for years won't be symptom-free in a day, he says, but \"the combination of therapeutic intervention and time will allow the patient to recover\". Another chronic illness that responds well to complementary medicine is osteoarthritis. Professor Marc Cohen, the head of the department of complementary medicine at RMIT in Melbourne, presented a paper earlier this year to the Australasian Integrative Medicine Association outlining the different treatments available, and assessing their safety, quality and efficacy. Arthritis, he says, is the most common chronic disease in the country. In addition, \"the most regularly prescribed class of drugs in Australia\" are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \"We spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on these drugs in terms of subsidies on the PBS [Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme],\" he says. \"When treating osteoarthritis, they certainly treat the pain but there are side effects ... they're known for upsetting your stomach but they're not as well known for affecting your heart.\" Cohen cites statistics from the 1999 Journal of Quality in Clinical Practice, which give preliminary estimates of 12,000 hospital admissions a year related to NSAIDs and \"about 1200 deaths\". By contrast, he says, a complementary medicine called glucosamine (a by-product of shellfish that has undergone \"rigorous\" testing) has been proven to treat the pain of osteoarthritis and slow the disease's progression with \"side effects ... comparable to a placebo\". But glucosamine is not subsidised. It also attracts GST and - says Cohen - makes the gap between a prescription for glucosamine and one for an NSAID about $30. \"Whose role is it to educate doctors about [glucosamine]?\" asks Cohen. \"There's no patent on it. There's no incentive for a company to market it because [the company's] competition would just ride in on its back. \"I don't know a doctor in Australia who hasn't got a pen with the name of some anti-inflammatory drug on it. I've never seen a pen with glucosamine on it. It's extremely challenging to try and get the message across to doctors.\" Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association [http://www.acupuncture.org.au](http://www.acupuncture.org.au) Australian Naturopathic Network [http://www.ann.com.au](http://www.ann.com.au) Australian Association of Professional Homoeopaths [http://www.homoeopathy.org.au](http://www.homoeopathy.org.au) Association of Traditional Health Practitioners [http://www.traditionalmedicine.net.au](http://www.traditionalmedicine.net.au) Healing herbs Sheryl Gray was desperate to get rid of the severe stomach pains and bowel trouble that had dogged her for four years. When she began to get symptoms after a bout of flu, her doctor diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and suggested medicines that might help. He also raised the possibility of acupuncture, but at the time Gray thought it too expensive on top of the other medications she was taking. After six months Gray, pictured, was sent for a colonoscopy, which came up with no answers. Subsequent attempts to find a solution from other doctors were not only unsuccessful, but depressing. \"I've tried so many different pills,\" she says. \"[Doctors] were telling me how I should have more yoghurt in my diet and keep off alcohol and fatty foods and things like that. \"But I just felt that, because they weren't sure, they didn't really feel it was a severe problem. It was just, 'Try this and get back to me at some stage' . . . they really weren't that interested in trying to find a solution.\" A few months ago Gray heard, through a work colleague, about Alan Bensoussan, and his success with another IBS patient. She made an appointment and was told that the problem could be solved, but that it would take time because her abdominal pain was so severe. Bensoussan prescribed weekly acupuncture and a formulation of herbs, which Gray has been boiling up and drinking twice a day before meals for the past six weeks. She says she can already feel the difference. \"I'm feeling 30 per cent to 40 per cent better . . . the best that I have been for a long time,\" she says. \"Half my symptoms have pretty much disappeared.\" JA "}
