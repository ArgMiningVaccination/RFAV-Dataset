Body Re .... 81 ii A Message to Program Lead Teacher s Stay in Shape focuses on teaching the evidence -informed knowledge and skills of early prevention and health promotion that can bene fit the participa ted students for a lifetime. The COVID -19 pandemic, tragic as it is, has further demonstrated the relevance of and need for the program. Each of the seven core program learning objectives or skills is repeatedly recommended by health experts across the globe for adults and children to apply to t heir daily life to stay safe, healthy, and resilient during the pandemic. We are proud of the fact that Stay in Shape is ahead of the curve in prevention , as the program has been serving schools in the MGH Health Center -served communities of Charlestown, Chelsea, and Revere for more than 20 years! We at MGH Community Health Associates are grateful for the opportunity to work with you in delivering the Stay in Sh ape Program to your students . We believe that, through our joint effort, we can make a difference in students' lives and our communities. We invite you to a podcast about Stay in Shape , hosted and produced by the MGH Clay Center for Young Healthy Mind before you move on to the next section. Parental Consent o Please c ollect Parental Consent during your recruitment or on the first day of the program . o Be sure to review Food Allergies in the Consent once it is returned to you, especially if you plan to bring snacks to the program . Follow the school food policy when planning for any other tasting activities. o Review any medical c onditions including food allergies listed in the Consent. Consult the parent and School Nurse if you have questions about how that will affect a student's participation in program activities. o Please note: The Parent Letter and Consent Form in 2020 -2021 sc hool year notify parents that the program will be offered virtually due to the COVID -19 Pandemic.

Just let us know. Attendance o Encourage the participants to stay through the entire program to ensure program quality and effectiveness as consistent attendance is one of the indicator s for success . o Students who complete the program (defined as having no more than two absenc es) will receive a special Stay in Shape Certificate (To be provided at the end of the program ).

There are three recommended home assignment s included in the curri culum : SIS Weekly L og, Body Image Essay, and Fiber -Up Essay . Tips for Teaching , Outreach , and Advocacy o Help students understand that health is a life -time process for everyone . Without being in good physical, mental, and social health at any stage of life, we cannot accomplish our goals as well or smoothly as we hope for. Striving to stay in good health - as defined by Stay in Shape - will prove to be the best investment students make for life, especially now as the world is going through the COVID -19 pandemic . o What students learn from Stay in Shape can help them do the right things through good decision -making and developing everyday health habits in nutrition, physical activity, and stress management . o Always e ncourage students to share what they learn from the program with their families and friends . Suggest at the beginnin g of the program that they talk about Stay in Shape at family dinner ti me on the same day when they have had a program meeting at school . o Help students connect all dots reflected in program topics / learning objectives for living a healthy life through se ssion discussion and activities , mid -program and final summaries . Every program learning objective is not only connected but also interrelated to each other . For example, good mental health cannot be achieved without eating healthy foods. Help students develop a life -long vision for health as a top priority throughout childhood and adulthood. Based on such an understanding, urge students to practice and sustain the Stay in Shape knowledge and skills from this point on. o In addition, if you would like to discuss a topic outside of th e Stay in Shape Curriculum , so your program can better meet current and evolving health education needs of the students, please let us know. We can arrange a guest speaker to talk with the students about, for example, any of the following topics: - What Is A Pandemic? What You can Do to Protect Yourself ? - Vaping: What You should Know and What You can Do? - Bullying: What You should Know and What You can Do? - Skin Health: Our Skin, Our Health - Careers in Public Health: What Is a Public Health Professional and What Does It Take to Become a Health Professional ? If you have another topic in mind, please reach out to us as well. o Once \"Stay in Shape\", always stay in shape . Each student's effort counts and makes a difference in imp roving his or her own health as well as family and community health.

Chan School of Public Health, 2017 -2018 . Updated 1 2/9/20. 16 Health Education Stress and Relaxation Part 1 Session Goal To learn the concepts of stress and relaxation and how they are related to personal health To introduce Relaxation Response and learn to build relaxation skills through deep breathing exercises Teaching Points Facts about stress : Everyone has stress from time to time . Stress is the body's natural response to danger or any other types of threat. Not all stress is bad for us. At Stay in Shape, we discuss the kind of stress that can do harm to health and need to be managed well. Vis it https://medlineplus.gov/stress.html for more information about stress. Definition of Relaxation Response (RR) : Pioneered by Dr. Herb Benson, MD at MGH Benson -Henry Institute of Mind Body Medicine , Relaxation Response is a physical state of deep relaxation achievable through skills such as deep breathing. RR has many values for disease prevention and management because it can help reduce blood pressu re, lower metabolism, slow down pace of breathin g and heart rates. Chronic or long -term stress is a real and serious risk for a long list of diseases . Stress management is one of the most important things to do to live a healthy life. Value of living a healthy life : preventing or delaying diseases; achieving goals in life; improving quality of like; increasing years of quality life , not just years of life . Suggested Activities Ask students to help define stress and sources of daily stress - where stre ss comes from or what makes them feel stressful; fi nd out what they currently do to manage daily stress . Then ask students to name diseases that can be caused by chronic stress , if they know. Introduce deep breathing skills : Engage the belly in breathing deeply; recognize thoughts that come in and gently let them pass by repeating a word (e.g. Love, peace etc.) or numbers during the process. Allow 3 - 5 minutes for students to try and enjoy deep breathing - Play light music if it helps them focus. Organi ze BioDots Activity.

Exercise helps reduce stress according to research. Breathe deeply, as you have jus t learned from Stay in Shape. Tell someone you trust or w rite down your feelings . Practice mindfulness. Try this: Choose a piece of music you love and have heard many times before. Listen to it again but in a way you never have before . For every negativ e thought, find two positive ones to be on the winning side. Learn to acc ept things that are not perfect by looking at it in a different way. Break large tasks into smaller ones. Plan breaks into your busy study schedule. Don't hesitate to take more brea ks during stressful times to help your mind focus.

Give each of the above suggestions more thoughts, so you understand their benefits and will make a plan to try a f ew activities, especially deep breathing. Be more willing to use your coping skills to control daily stress. Instead of fighting with stress head -on, give yourself an opportunity to face it.

In real life, caloric needs are different from person to person. Nutrition Facts on the label are always for one serving . The difference between serving and portion sizes: Serving size: Recom mended and used on Food Labels Portion size: Anyone's call - how much food you decide to put on your plate Note: In real life, the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Definition of calories : Units of energy Suggested Activities Circulate a sample food label (Bring one from home or choose from the pages below ) Test participants ' prior knowledge and skills of label reading by asking a few basic questions about serving size, fats, sugar, or sodium content Emphasiz e the importance of knowing the baseline numbers as listed in Teaching Points and tested in Pre - and P ost-Surveys Enco urage participants to make reading food labels a healthy habit from now on Student Handout s Trans Fats : What You should Know Resources for Facilitating Discussion What's new with the new Nutrition Facts Label? https://www.fda.gov/food/new -tc Get the facts on nutrition by reading your food labels www.thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/site/healthyyou/HealthyYouNutritionFacts.pdf Spanish v ersion: www.thenationshealth.aphapublications.org/site/healthyyou/HealthyYouNutritionSP.pdf Sodium Reduction Campa ign Encourages Healthy Ch oices a mong Consumers www.cdc.gov/salt/pdfs/phpsff_massachusetts.pdf 39 Student Handout Trans Fats : What You should Know Facts about trans fats - Trans fats are artificial fats (partially hydrogenated fats) made of vegetable oil and hydrogen gas. 1Some fried and baked foods have trans fats. - Trans fats make foods taste better and last longer. They also provide the desired textures in baked goods. That's why trans fats are a favorite with food makers including restaurants. - When a Food Label lists \"0 trans fat\", it does not mean this food is trans fat free. By law, \"0\" can be listed as long as the food contains less than 0.5 gram of trans fats per serving. - Americans eat an av erage of 6 grams of trans fats a day. That's almost 5 lbs a year. Too much to be healthy! Possible harms of eating trans fats - Our body can't break down and use tran fats. - Trans fats lower good cholesterol (HDL) and increase bad cholesterol . - Eating trans fats put us at risk for high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, heart diseases, and even cancer. Check trans fat out in the Food Label - Seeing words like \"0 trans fat\" or \"Trans fat free\" on the Food Label is not enough. Go on to check the section of Ing redients. - Look for Partially Hydrogenated Fat in Ingredie nts. If you see it listed, this food item is not trans fat free. Partially Hydrogenated Fat is trans fat. Be smart with making your food choices . Going for the Healthy Fats - Unsaturated ( Mon o- and Poly -unsaturated) fats, such as Omega 3 fats from cold -water oily fish (e.g. Salmon), nuts, and other plant -based foods. - Our body is naturally very good at breaking down and benef iting from the healthy fats. So it is an excellent idea to eat fish a nd nuts. - Be sure to also include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your meals! Handout developed August 2012 .

When reading the label, look at the ingredient list for words such as \"hydrogenat ed\" or \"parti ally hydrogenated\" as they are trans f ats. If a product has less than 0.5g of trans fats per serving , it is not against the law for food industry to list it as zero \"trans fat or trans fat free \". Compare: Calories from a gram of fat: 9 ; Calories from a gram of protein: 4 Definition of Daily Values: A guide to the nutrients in one serving of food. For example, if the label lists 15% for calcium, it means that one serving of this food provides 15% of the calcium you need each day. DV reference ranges: How to understand these ranges (Rules of thumb) ? 5% or less : Low or not a significant source of the nutrient or ingredient Between 10% - 15%: M edium 20% or more : A lot, too much or a very significant source of the nutrient or ingredient DV for suga r is not listed on a food label, as there is recommendation for how much sugar a person should eat each day Rule of thumb: When it comes to salt a nd sugar, less is better. Experts think that less than 10% of the daily calories should come from salt or sugar .

Use this information to guide you to good portion control Servings per container : Check number of servings in the whole c ontainer. Tip: Nutrition information on a food label is for 1 serving. If you eat more than 1 serving, remember to multiply. Calories Check calories per serving Tips: Know the following rules of thumb: 40 calories/per serving: Low in calories 100 calories/per serving: Medium in calories 400 calories/per serving: High in calories Watch for calories from Fat - it should be less than 30% DV. Total Fat Look for low saturated f at. Eat no trans fat - look for words like \"hydrogenated\" or \"partially hydrogenated \" (trans fat) in the ingredient list to make sure that the product contains no trans fat. Tip: Low saturated fat means 2 grams or less fat per serving. Cholesterol Look for low cholesterol Tip: Low cholesterol means 20 milligrams or less per serving. Sodium (in salt) Look for low sodium Tips: Less salt is better for your health. Low sodium means 140 milligrams or less per serving. Carbohydrates Mainly sugars and starche s Tips: 1 gram of carb = 4 calories Dietary Fiber : Look for more fiber per serving. Tips: Good source of fiber means at least 3 grams per serving . Excellent source of fiber means 5 or more grams per serving . Sugar : Look for low or no sugar; watch for added sugar . High sugar means 7 or more grams of sugar per serving. 1 teaspoonful of sugar = 4 grams of sugar Protein Proteins are the building blocks of life in every cell in the human body. They are v ery important for children's health and growth. Tips: 7 grams (1 oz.) protein = 1 serving; 1 gram protein = 4 calories Compare with Fat: 4 - 5 grams (1 oz.) fat = 1 serving 1 gram fat = 9 calories The type of fat is more important than the amount. Trans fat is the most unhealthy type of fat. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat -like stuff in all body cells. Many f ruits and vegetables come with fiber. Try to eat 5+ servings of them a day. Whole grain food also has more fiber. Eat less sugar Protein comes from e ggs, fish, lean meat, nuts, seeds, beans , and vegetables like bro ccoli and brussels sprouts. DV: Percent Daily Value It is a guide to the nutrients in 1 serving of food, e.g. I f the label lists 15% for calcium, it means that 1 serving of this food provides 15% of the calcium you need each day.

The one on the right is the new label now being used since March 2020 . Please k eep in mind: - Infor matio n on a Food Label is based on 2,000 calories day, a standard for most adults. There is a lot of information on a label. Because of this reason , Stay in Shape recommends that students take small steps in learning to read Food Labels . As a beginner, you c an focus on looking at: o Total servings and s erving size o Calories per serving o Trans Fat o Sodium o Sugars, especially Added Sugars Gradually you can build up your reading skills to read and understand every line. - Food L abels help us make healthier food cho ices. Reading labels makes a great healthy -living habit. Go for it! Screen shot from https://www.fda.gov/media/135197/download 44 Student Handout Research shows that foods and drinks with added sugar do not make to the list of healthy foods. C andy, cookies , and soda can have a lot of added sugar in them . Sugar can also hide in foods that aren't even taste that sweet! Here's what to look out for to avoid added or hidden sugars . GRA NOLA BARS are a quick and easy snack, but next time you reach for one, check the ingredients for molas ses, malt extracts, and any word that ends in \" -ose\" , \"syrup \" or \"saccharide \". These are sugars hiding in your \"healthy\" snack! It's pretty tough to f ind granola ba rs without a lot of added sugar that don't taste like cardboard, so a healthier - also quick, filling, and delicious - snack would be trail mix. You can make it yourse lf by mixing your favorite nuts, seeds , and bits of dried fruits ! YOGURT has calcium, protein , and probiotics that keep your digestive system healthy, but watch out for ingredients that end in words like \"syrup\" and \"concentrate,\" because these are added sugars. Don't like plain, unsweetened yogurt ? Try mixing in fresh fruit li ke banana, grapes, and others you like. It sweetens the yogurt without any added sugar. JUICE & SPORTS DRINKS Do you play a team sport, run or weight train? That's awesome - keep it up! But put away the Gatorade and Vitamin Water. These drinks can have over 20 grams of sugar per serving, and a lot of these bottles contain more than one serving! If you train and sweat a lot for a long period of time and you want to use sports drinks, that may be fine. But please know that most people only need water t o stay hydrated during exercise. Electrolytes in sports drinks are mostly sodium and potassium, so a couple crack ers and some banana for your workout can do the job without 20+ grams of added sugar. DRESSINGS & SAUCES WHAT?! These foods aren' t even swee t! It's true though. Check the label on your spaghetti and barbeque sauces and favorite salad dressings. If you see sugar or high fructose corn syrup on the ingredients list, you've got yourself some added sugar. There are many ways to flavor up your m eat, pasta or salad without added sugar. Instead of BBQ sauce, try a suga r-free dry rub on your chicken. Many brands of dressings and sauces are made without sugar - It just takes an extra look at the Food Label to know.

Warm -up is an activity that prepares your body for physical exercise at any intensity. It makes your heart beat and breathing faster. What Can I Do to Warm Up ? You can use the activity that you are going to do for exercise at a slower pace for your warm -up. For example, if you plan to jog, start with a 10 minute walk or jog at a slower pace than you would normal ly walk or jog. Then move on to stretching. Wha t Is Stretching? When and How Do I Do It? Stretching is great for you before you start your exercise, but after you have warmed up. Stretching can lower the chance of muscle injuries. It does so by improving your muscle flexibility. When you stretch a muscle, you want to feel pulling of that muscle , but not too much . To do a stretch, you hold the position for 30 seconds and repeat 2 -3 times. Breathe normally as you go. Stretch safely: Avoid bouncing or push ing too hard. What Is a Cool -Down? Cooli ng-down is very important. You need to slow down your body after a workout for 5 -10 minutes to help your body recover from the workout. It should include light aerobic exercise like walking or marching, then stretching. Cooling down can help slow down y our heart beat and breathing, and lower the chance for muscle and joint pain.
