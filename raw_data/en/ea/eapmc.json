The Acutonics Healing System answers these needs, by drawing on science, music, metaphysics, ancient truths, philosophical traditions and both Eastern and Western Medicine to create an integrated and harmonic approach to health care and healing. It is a beautiful healing system that can be used by practitioners of all modalities: acupuncturists, massage therapists, energy workers, psychotherapists, chiropractors, veterinarians, physical therapists and medical doctors, just to name a few. It can also be used by individuals in their homes for self healing and healing for family and friends. Throughout time and across all cultures, music and sound have been an integral part of ceremony, ritual and healing. Today we know that when we listen to music or hear certain sounds, it evokes powerful emotions that can pump us up, make us sad, or help us to understand and express our feelings. It is this growing recognition of the power that music and sound play in therapy, healing and life that is giving rise to the new field of Harmonic Medicine. I was first introduced to sound as a therapeutic modality when I was working with an occupational therapist on Sensory Integration with my 5-year-old daughter. There were specific sounds that would invoke chemical changes in the brain that would then alter inharmonic behaviors. After months of listening to specific sounds and frequencies, I noticed a significant shift in her behavior. She was more at ease with herself and her surroundings. She was more present and in her body. Though I have always had soothing music in my treatment rooms, I began to seek ways to incorporate sounds that invoke specific healing responses. As I explored the integration of sound into my clinical work, a colleague who had just found the Acutonics Healing System introduced me to this powerful modality that merges sound and Oriental medicine. It was a perfect match! The Acutonics Healing System is an energy-based, non-invasive treatment that is similar to acupuncture but without needles. Precision-calibrated tuning forks are applied to specific acupuncture, acupressure, and trigger points of the body to access the body's Meridian and Chakra energy systems. These tuning forks represent a natural harmonic series based on the orbital properties of the Earth, Moon, Sun and other planets. Their rich resonance and vibration connects with and supports the body's natural frequencies. It brings us to alignment with the cycles of the Cosmos known since antiquity as the Music of the Spheres. When the frequencies and intervals of Acutonics are applied to specific points and gateways the sound waves travel deeply into the body along energy pathways, affecting human physiology and reaching places not easily accessed by traditional medicine. Applying the forks stimulates and balances the body's physical and subtle energy fields to promote healing and inner harmony - to connect us to the original source. It provides access to a deep inner balance by sonically resetting negative cellular patterns. This work is deeply transformational; it can relieve chronic and debilitating illnesses for which Western Medicine and other Complementary Medicines often have no answers. There are thousands of case studies that speak to the efficacy of this new medicine. The following are examples of some conditions that have been successfully treated by the Acutonics Healing System: - - Stress - Acute & Chronic Pain - - Depression - Fibromyalgia - - Anxiety - Peripheral Neuropathy - - Insomnia - Infertility - - Asthma - Stroke Residuals - - Allergies - Fatigue - - Gastrointestinal Disorders - Environmental Illness - - Irritable Bowel - Migraines - - PMS - Arthritis - - Menstrual Disorders - Tendonitis - - Menopause - Balance Acutonics Tuning Forks Edgar Casey said that sound would be the medicine of the future. The future is now. Come experience the healing of sound. Allow yourself to experience that place of harmony, peace and healing that is so often hidden, but waiting to be heard in our hearts, that place of Ohm. Susan B.
