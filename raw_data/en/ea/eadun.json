But this volume should also be readby those who gain economic benefits from natural resources at a distance thanksto the sophisticated technology of communications and marketing systems. Mostof these people are deeply indebted to the labour and creativity of rural commu-nities, whose livelihoods are inextricably related to the natural resources andecosystems in the different regions of the planet. Above all this volume is a tributeand recognition to the traditional knowledge, rights, skills and institutions ofindigenous peoples and local communities and to their daily struggles for a bal-ance between their immediate needs and long term well-being, founded on thesound and sustainable management of our planet's natural wealth. From a recollection of the political and socio-cultural history of human relation- ships with nature, the volume moves into a more conceptual analysis of actors,entitlements, equity and co-management itself. Through a series of illuminatingexamples characterised by cultural and regional diversity, the authors show us theimpacts, tensions, inequalities and opportunities that inhabit the field of naturalresource management and bear such important consequences for the livelihoodsand quality of life of rural communities. Co-management as a process is thenunpacked and explored in detail, from its roots in local systems of solidarity to theunlikely and very powerful \"syncretic\" merging of traditional practices and mod-ern conservation expertise. As a matter of fact, when we are lucky enough toapproach sound contemporary natural resource management, this looks more andmore like a jigsaw puzzle of new and old knowledge, indigenous and modernelements, practices and values of different \"cultural\" origin. As in all processes ofcultural change, we find in it contradictions and chaotic situations and, exactlybecause of this, the concept and practice of adaptive management become cru-cial. This should be appreciated in terms of both conceptual and practical rele-vance, as top-down inflexible and supposedly a-political decisions have indeedpast their time. For practitioners in search of an open and flexible guide to co-management prac- tice on the basis of lessons learned in a variety of socio-ecological settings, thisvolume simply has no equal. The \"phases\" of the process\u2014 organising, negotiat-ing, implementing agreements and learning by doing\u2014 as well as the agreementsand organisations they usually end up developing, are described and appreciatedthrough a wealth of examples, tools and sound advice. The authors have obvious-FOREWORD by Juan Mayr Maldonadoly in mind the real world, where nothing is univocal and fixed and where compli- cations abound as well as unexpected opportunities. The product is a creativetension between realities and visions, what is and what could be, especially inresponse to external forces and the continual demographic, social, economic andcultural changes that affect both local communities and other actors, and naturalresources. If anything, one could fault the authors for being too positive, for com-pelling us to believe that, even in the worst possible situation, change is possible.But this may be more a consequence of the invigorating feeling that the readercarries away from the reading than of the content of the volume in itself.Examples of problems and failures, in fact, abound, and they are candidlyrecounted.... It is on the basis of a world perceived in a state of evolution and creative tension that the political proposal for co-management illustrated in this volume\u2014 becausethis is what it is\u2014 becomes most compelling. Co-management can involve thegradual harmonising, balancing and adjustment of the interests, aspirations andcapacities of a variety of actors both within rural communities and in the world atlarge. The lamp-posts are intelligence, care and equity\u2014 the exact opposite of sit-uations in which the stronger forces impose their will on the weaker ones withoutregard to understandings, results or even meaning, let alone sustainability. Thepractices that are here described to make a difference are a careful assessment ofissues, dialogue, negotiation, the active mediation of conflicts and the nurturing ofjoint learning. But we would be wrong if we would think that this applies only tospecific contexts where local actors are concerned, let us say, with a specific for-est, a pastoral landscape, a rare species of wildlife or a rich coastal fishery.\"Sharing power\" makes a compelling case that continuous engagement of actorsand learning must extend to the policy arena, beyond the command and controloperations of policy specialists and non-participatory elected leaders. \"Sharing Power\" is an important contribution to environmental thinking and reflection, at a time of great political and economic challenges throughout theworld. It invites us to, and equips us for, a dialogue among different cultures,being those of neighbours or of distant actors, in a respectful and equitable searchfor new forms of natural resource management. I do not advise you to read thisvolume cover-to-cover\u2014 although you may want to!\u2014 but I definitely advise youto go through it, be inspired to understand what it contains, and keep it on yourdesktop. You will find yourself consulting it over and over again when you needinspiration and practical help about more cooperative ways of managing naturalresources.

It was conceived in the first half of the 1990s, at a time when the social innovations introduced by the 1992 Earth Summit ofRio were timidly percolating amidst the conservation community. A large part ofsuch community, actually, was still openly weary of participatory processes, letalone co-management settings. Discussing issues of equity and power-sharing inconservation was an uphill job, and social advocacy was barely tolerated. Theheart of conservation institutions and resources remained solidly in the hands ofconservation businessmen, agency bureaucrats and biological scientists. It was in this context that Grazia and Michel, at the time staff of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWFInternational), 11decided to gather experiences in collaborative management (CM) of natural resources and derive from those some concrete lessons for action.They felt that unspecific advocacy about \"community participation\" was not suf-ficient and potentially even damaging. At the same time, the promises as well asthe limitations of integrated conservation and development programmes (ICDPs)were becoming apparent, as was the need to utilise more specific methods andtools to engage a variety of social actors in conservation. Crucial issues were notonly \"participation\" (how can people be effectively engaged in conservation?)but also the meeting of local needs in the areas to be conserved, and how to doso in a way that is sustainable in the long term. 22Interestingly, community empowerment, social justice and human rights, which were the origin andessence of those concerns, could barely be mentioned in an open way. Suchterms were not well received in conservation organisations and speaking themwas a sure way to raise a backlash. The first step towards this volume was a questionnaire which was sent, in three languages, to hundreds of field practitioners of both organisations. The inquirywas about the kind of information and tools sought by IUCN and WWF fieldpractitioners. What would practically help them in their tasks, when dealing withsocial concerns in conservation? It was also about the experiences and lessonsthey wished to pass on and share with others. In the meantime, the IUCN washeading towards its first World Conservation Congress, in Montreal in 1996. Inthe preparatory process, about fifty IUCN members joined efforts to draft andtable a Resolution on Collaborative Management for Conservation, which wasthen approved by the Congress. 33As part of this, ideas, case examples and reflec- tions on CM were gathered, some of which in the form of papers to be presentedPREFACE & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 1Grazia was then Head of the IUCN Social Policy Programme, and Michel was Head of the Biodiversity, Protected Areas and SpeciesConservation Policy Programme at WWF International. 2These are dealt with at length in Pimbert 1997; in a dedicated workshop that attracted hundreds of participants. A Panel of IUCN Commission members interested in collaborative managementwas also created at the Congress, with Fikret Berkes and Yves serving as its firstCo-chairs. Ashish was also importantly involved in the Congress workshop andin the CM Panel. The replies to the questionnaire, the papers, the relevant corre-spondence and the results of literature searches carried out also with the help ofmembers of the IUCN Commission on Environmental, Economic and SocialPolicy (CEESP) working as consultants, volunteers and interns were consolidatedin a small CM resource centre at the IUCN Headquarters. Very many people played an important role in gathering and consolidating infor- mation and encouraging work in the early stages described above. Among themwe would like to thank in particular Fikret Pattemore and PatrizioWarren. Their early encouragement and the specific experience and insights theyshared with us were extremely precious. Many others were also variouslyinvolved and we are most grateful for the important ideas and advice they pro-vided.

On the basis of the collected materials, Grazia, Michel and Ashish produced a draft of this volume at the end of 1997. The document was widely circulated in1998 and the comments received were poignant and useful for the versions tocome. Among those, we have the great pleasure of acknowledging the reviewsby Carmen Aalbers, Anil Agarwal, Ed Barrow, Marcus Scoones, Neena Singh, Vital Rajan and PeterSchachenmann. Grazia, Michel and Ashish set to revise the work on the basis ofthe received comments but the task proved more difficult than expected. BothGrazia and Michel\u2014 some say precisely because of the key interests and con-cerns they brought into their jobs\u2014 were no longer employed by IUCN andWWF, which rendered the book a full labour of volunteer love. More important-ly, a staggering amount of relevant experiences and lessons was accumulating inthe field. Co-management was literally growing under our eyes, and every turn. The human rights dimensions of conservation, environmental entitlements, social communication, conflict management, publicparticipation in policy development and many other subjects were beingexplored in detail by specific constituencies. The subject of our book was dan-gerously (but excitingly) enlarging.... It was then that the second phase of our work began. On the eve of the second World Conservation Congress (Amman, 2000), which reconfirmed the impor-tance of co-management approaches for conservation, 44Grazia, Michel, Yves and Taghi\u2014 newly elected Chair of CEESP\u2014 had a meeting in Switzerland to reviewthe fate of the earlier work on co-management. Over a decade earlier, Taghi hadbeen one of IUCN's earliest and strongest advocates of communities as keyactors in natural resource management and conservation. With him as Chair ofCEESP, they all felt more hopeful that community concerns could be incorporat-ed in the work of the Union, and were encouraged to proceed with the book.They agreed to gather and synthesise as much new relevant material as theycould, privileging field-based lessons for action over theoretical analyses. Fromthe institutional point of view they were going to be supported by theInternational Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), for which Michelwas then working and, as all were long-time members of CEESP, they could alsotake on writing as volunteers or semi-volunteers for the Commission. Elevenchapters were thus \"re-conceived\", and the book took its final form. Grazia took responsibility for Chapters 1 to 6 and weaved in the contributions by Marshall Murphree, Patrizio W arren, Ricardo Ram\u20acrez and T aghi. Michel took responsibility for Chapters 7 to 9, in contact with Hanna Jaireth and VickyPattemore. Yves and Michel took responsibility for Chapters 10 and 11, in whichthey also incorporated the work originally prepared by Ashish and some morerecent comments from him. Taghi and Yves, and then Grazia, revised and har-monised the whole. The work for the book proceeded slowly\u2014 not least becauseall the authors were engaged in much CM-related work, in policy and in prac-tice. It was punctuated by a handful of meetings, but most communication pro-ceeded via e-mail. All throughout, invaluable stirring and inspiration were pro-vided by many colleagues through the \"sounding board\" of the CollaborativeManagement Working Group (CMWG) of CEESP\u2014 a body now encompassingnearly 400 people from over 40 countries dedicated to learning, mutual supportand action on co-management. 55 Among the CMWG members and other colleagues we have consulted and worked with in these last years, we would like to acknowledge with gratitudeCherif Abdellatif, Karin Augustat, Brockington, PeteBrosius, Jessica Brown, Michael Brown, Nicole Brown, Martin Bush, Ralph Buss,David Butz, Pierre Campredon, Christian Castellanet, Claudio Maurilio Cipparone, Marcus Colchester, Steve Collins, 4IUCN Resolution 2.15 on Collaborative Management for Conservation Programme, 2ndWorld Conservation Congress, Croft, Alex de Sherbinin, David E.

Early work was made possible thanks to the support provided by the Danish Development Agency(DANIDA) to the then Social Policy Programme of IUCN. Most subsequent workwas carried out on a volunteer or semi-volunteer basis as part of the initiatives ofthe IUCN Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy (CEESP).This publication is made possible by grants from the Swedish InternationalDevelopment Agency (Sida) and the Dutch Development Cooperation (DGIS) insupport to IIED's work on the co-management of biodiversity and naturalresources as part of on-going action research on food, agriculture and livelihoodsecurity and by a grant from the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ) on-going encouragement to learning the lessons of collaborative management of natural resources in several regions of the world. We also warmly thank Jeyran Farvar and Fabrice Prati for art work and layout and Hoonam Publishing Services in Tehran, which did the lithography and print-ing under the technical supervision and management of CENESTA\u2014 the IranianCentre for Sustainable Development\u2014 host to the IUCN Commission onEnvironmental, Economic and Social Policy. Our special gratitude and admiration go the multitude of indigenous peoples, local communities and enlightened government and NGO staff who have shownthe way to wise co-management of natural resources and who have provided therich base of experience, practice and policy we have documented here. Wehope to have done at least partial justice to their efforts and work. After these several years of gestation, we confide this volume to print and to its readers with joy and some sense of relief. May it be useful! Grazia and social calamities pass away. Whole populations are periodically reduced to misery and starvation: the very springs of life are crushed out of mil- lions of men, reduced to city paupers; the understanding and the feelings of the millions are vitiated by the teachings worked out in the interest of the few. All this is certainly part of our existence. But the nucleus of mutual support institu- tions, habits and customs remains alive with the millions; it keeps them togeth- er.... In the practice of mutual aid, which we can retrace to the earliest begin- ning of evolution, we see the origins of our ethical conceptions; and in the progress of man, mutual support\u2014 not mutual struggle\u2014 has had the leading part. In its wide extension, even at the present time, we find the best guarantee of a still loftier evolution of our race. \u2014 Petr Kropotkin, 1902 Nothing truly valuable can be achieved except by the unselfish cooperation of many individuals. \u2014 Albert Einstein, 1940 The history of mutual aid and collective action in social and ecological affairs isas ancient as human life. For many thousands of years, human communitiesestablished their livelihoods by gathering, hunting and fishing in a collectivefashion. Human collaboration within small groups was essential to recogniseedible and medicinal plants as well as to overpower animals, build shelter orfind and carry water. Through time, \"communities\" gained their livelihoods bydealing together with the natural threats and opportunities in their surroundings,by developing productive technologies and practices and by producing knowl-edge and culture in the same process. A feature of most traditional human soci-eties throughout the world is to retain under common property\u2014 thus commoncare and \"management\"\u2014 pasture, forests, fisheries, wildlife and wetlands,including lakes and rivers. Such communal resources are subjected to a varietyof rules and regulations devised by the communities themselves, usually embed-ded in institutions that prove their worth through centuries of trial and errors. Forthe distant past much of this is inferred from indirect data, but in time closer tous historical evidence abounds of human associations for various livelihoodenterprises. In Mutual Aid , first published in 1902, Petr Kropotkin draws from the history of guilds and unions in Europe, from travel from the experience of village communities everywhere and even from the biological realm at large, to show how collaboration and mutualsupport are at the heart of whatever makes our species successful. As a biologist,he stressed that, the more difficult the natural environment, the more necessaryis cooperation among the members of a species to be able to survive and pros-per. Negotiated agreements on the roles, rights and responsibilities of different actors in a common enterprise are at the heart of the forms of collaboration describedby Kropotkin and celebrated by some of the most imaginative and engagedmembers of the human race. We have been moved and inspired by the immenserichness of the human experience that stirred these insights, and brought toexplore contemporary forms of group collaboration and lessons learned alongthe way. This volume is the result of our efforts in bringing together accounts andreflections on a variety of partnerships for the management of natural resourcesin different social and ecological contexts, based on both our own experiencesand the very rich experience of others. The volume has inevitable limitationsand we are aware that we have just touched upon the wealth of existing relevantexperiences and insights. We still hope, however, to have provided a steppingstone towards a better understanding of co-management (CM) of naturalresources (NR) for conservation, livelihoods, and development purposes. Social organisation for the management of natural resources is a fundamental attribute of human communities. Not all social responses to resource manage-ment challenges, however, achieve appropriate or effective results. Violent con-flicts, extreme inequities in access to natural resources, instances of peoplescrambling for resources in open access situations or major developmentschemes delivering environmental and human tragedies too often do occur, ush-ering in human and environmental tragedies. What do we know about the rootcauses of such tragedies? What distinguishes social progress from destructivechange? The analysis of the experiences collected in this volume seems to suggest that problems often arise when change is imposed by force or is hurried through,without the benefit of slow advances and testing through time. Many suchchanges are part of a socio-political shift of historical proportion currently welladvanced throughout the world. From the early agrarian and industrial revolu-tions to the current dominance of the global agro-industrial-market system, peas-ants have been progressively reduced in relative numbers, involved in cash cropproduction and grown dependent on mechanised implements, oil, pesticides,fertilisers and abundant water. Nomadic pastoralists have been forced to settleand become dependent on imported feed for their animals. Hunter-gatherershave also been constrained to settle, become farmers (or \"poachers\") and link tomarket economies. The loss of power of local communities has corresponded toa rise in power of national states and private individuals and corporations. Newstate bureaucracies and economic enterprises, associated with monolithic viewsof progress and rational order, have expropriated from indigenous and localcommunities many of the decisions and privileges that used to be their own. 11 From the \"scramble for Africa\" to the top-down declaration of state jurisdiction on forests, rangelands, waters and coastal resources in Asia, from the state col-lectivisation of farms and natural resources in the Soviet Union to the impositionof huge-agribusiness ventures upon the common lands of Scott, 1998.XXIXthe forced resettlement of nomadic populations in Iran, Turkey, Central Asia and East Africa to the destruction of ancient villages to make room for obscenelyanonymous apartment complexes in Rumania\u2014 rural communities 22 have been dis-empowered and, in the words of Banuri and Amalric,33\"de-responsibilised\" of taking care of much of their own environment and livelihoods. The phenome-non can be seen as part of the \"great transformation\" described by Karl Polanyi, 44 by which an idealised economic rationality has been slowly but steadily negat- ing and crushing a whole range of other human and social values and areas ofautonomy. Other authors emphasised the scope of this historical process ofsweeping and authoritarian domestication of people and nature, highlightinghow it influenced biological and cultural diversity, local (community) knowledgeand skills, human well being, \"common sense\" and even the nature of scientificinquiry. 55 The \"great transformation\" brought about a variety of consequences throughout the world, among which the fact that many customary and community-basednatural resource management (NRM) systems have been overlooked, negated orsimply crushed in the name of modernisation and development. Nature hasbecome a collection of \"natural resources\", to be \"managed\" through \"dismem-bering\" and extreme biological and social simplification in the interest of pro-ducing commodities. 66Many rural communities are no longer in charge of man- aging their natural resources, and, importantly, they are not \"trusted\" by statebureaucracies to be able to do so. 77Their inventiveness and autonomy are brushed aside in the name of state rationality, economic development and con-servation. Their viable, relatively simple to operate, modest and time-tested solu-tions to natural resource management problems, embedded in unique localknowledge and skills, are substituted by powerful and locally-untested solutions,based on a-local (\"scientific\") understanding of how nature should be managedand \"conserved\". While the character of rural environments changes under theseforces, urban environments are also created or enormously expanded, resultingin new demands and challenges for people. Increasingly, in both rural and urbansystems, success is defined in economic terms and the collateral damages interms of human and cultural losses 88are perceived as inevitable side effects. Is the phenomenon unstoppable and irreversible? Should we all resign ourselves to it? But also: is the phenomenon entirely negative and destructive? Or are therealso positive changes brought about by the rise of national states, private enter-prises, new technologies and globalisation? As always in human phenomena,matters are not sharply defined and history presents us with a never-ending coex- 2We understand as \"community\" a human group sharing a territory and involved in different but related aspects of livelihoods\u2014 su ch as managing natural resources, producing knowledge and culture and developing productive technologies and practices. Communities a re by no means homogenous, and harbour complex socio-political relations, with diverging and sometimes conflicting views, needs an d expectations. Yet, they have major common concerns which, in healthy situations, lead towards various forms of collaboration an d cohe- sion. Examples may be found in Ralston et al., 1983; Reader, 1990; Ghai and Vivian, 1992; 1994; Borrini-Feyerabend et al. , 2004, (in press); and in volume. 3Banuri and Amalric, 1992. 4Polanyi, 1944. 5Gramsci, is one of the important insights masterly illustrated by Scott (1998). As a result of this active disempowering, which in some places has been going on for a long time, human communities may have become all but capable of managing their environments and/ or sha r- ing management rights and responsibilities with others. 8See the lucid description and miracles of ingenuity and personal and collective strength. In this volume we refrain from interpreting or judging phenomena ofhistorical proportions. We rather wish to point at specific examples of \"values inaction\", instances in which people and nature found remarkable ways of organ-ising their co-existence. Indeed, despite adverse forces of great proportions, localcommunities are still able to discern and adjust, they can merge their uniqueheritage with innovations and new structural conditions, they can \"re-organise\"themselves, re-conquer memories, skills, information, rights. These communitiesadapt themselves, develop new capacities and weave political and economicalliances with new actors, including state governments, international organisa-tions, individual and corporate businesses. New and at times experimental part-nerships are central to these phenomena, involving extensive dialogue andaction-research and the recognition, understanding and reconciliation of a multi-plicity of capacities and comparative advantages. Traditional knowledge andskills, in particular, are set to work within changed environmental, political andsocial contexts, including \"science-based\" innovations. Instead of witnessing thedeath of local communities in natural resource management we witness at timesthe birth of many forms of social \"syncretism\" and synergy\u2014 the wise merging offeatures from different origins. This is at the heart of what we understand as \"co-management\" in this volume\u2014 a process of collective understanding and actionby which human communities and other social actors manage natural resourcesand ecosystems together , drawing from everyone's unique strengths, vantage points and capacities. This said, we should also stress that our understanding of co-management is not restricted to state-community partnerships. Co-management approaches can beand are applied among and within communities as well. For indigenous peoplesin particular, co-management processes, albeit rarely described with this name,are part of traditional ways of relating with common property natural resourcesand with community conserved areas. 99In such indigenous versions of co-man- agement, the national state is often not present as a partner because it is per-ceived as non-legitimate or irrelevant or antithetical to indigenous peoples' self-determination. In this volume, therefore, we do not necessarily refer to co-man-agement as a state-led or even a state-involving process. While we include suchcases, we also bring in many instances of cooperative decision-making concern-ing natural resources held in common property regimes among two or morecommunities, or between communities and private, NGO, or internationalactors, or including only interest groups within a local community. We believe our \"open\" understanding of the co-management concept is helpful to situate it in a historical context and to avoid using it in a restrictive sense,which is a real possibility as the term, along with the term \"partnership\", isbecoming accepted jargon and even a buzzword. In this sense, we wish to con-tribute to an empowering adoption of the approach by national decision-makersand, most of all, by indigenous and local communities and civil society at large.We wish this volume to contribute to disseminating valuable experiences,enhancing reflection and capacities, and promoting inter-cultural and interna-tional comparison and cross-fertilisation. As \"explicit\" partnerships to managenatural resources are a growing phenomenon throughout the world 1100and as crit- ical environmental and social situations clamour for action, we believe that ourattempt to systematise the co-management concept and practice has a tobe useful. XXX SHARING POWER9Posey, 1999; Kothari, 2004; Borrini-Feyerabend et al. , 2004 (in press). 10But they are not a new phenomenon, as described the current interest in the co-management of nat- ural resources for both conservation development and conservation schemes all too often entail hugesocial and ecological costs, especially in areas where people are directlydependent on natural resources for their livelihoods. For instance, a growingbody of evidence indicates that many state-based development and conserva-tion projects have brought serious adverse effects on the food security andlivelihoods of people living in and around major infrastructures or protectedareas and wildlife management schemes. 1111Local communities have faced loss of land and restrictions in their use of common property resources forfood gathering, harvest of medicinal plants, grazing, fishing, hunting, collec-tion of wood and other wild products from forests, wetlands and pastorallands. Development enterprises, infrastructures or national parks have deniedlocal resource rights, turning local people overnight from hunters, pastoralists,sea nomads and cultivators into \"poachers\", \"invaders\" and \"squatters\". 1122 Resettlement schemes for indigenous peoples removed from areas earmarked for development or conservation have had devastating consequences.1133No wonder, there are serious conflicts between indigenous and local communi-ties and development managers or park authorities. Such conflicts are burn-ing in many contexts, too often side by side precious natural resources, biodi-versity and ecosystem services that should be carefully used and conserved.Co-management processes often provide answers to these conflicts or at leasta forum where different views can be vented and confronted, and where con-ciliation can be processes and resource management regimes involve making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, being largelyunable to predict the effects of different courses of action. Indeed, many pastand current conflicts in development and conservation have come from thefailure of management agencies to accept and embrace this complexity andthis uncertainty even in \"simple\" systems. The science of parts (reductionism),as opposed to knowledge and ways of knowing that integrate the parts, haslargely failed to come to terms with dynamic complexity 1144and variation with- in and among ecosystems. Global environmental change and human-maderisks, such as climate change or interactions among genetically modifiedorganisms (GMOs) and the environment at large, exacerbate these variationsand uncertainties. 1155In addition, the perceptions of both problems and solu- tions are value laden and differ enormously within society,1166and \"experts\" seem no longer better equipped than any other groups to decide on questionsof values and interests. All of the above emphasises the need for flexibleresponses and adaptive management of natural resources, which can best be 11Cernea, 1985; Kothari et al. , and Schmidt-Soltau, 2003. 14Variation in response to the same change is enormous in both organisms and biological systems, with daily, seasonal and longer term modifications apparent from the broad landscape to the small cultivated plot. See Gunderson et al. , 1995; Holling et al. , 1998. 15The conventional approaches of risk management and cost benefit analysis become more apparently inadequate when \"we don't know what we don't know\" and where \"we don't know the probabilities participatory learning and action.1177In facing these challenges, co-management processes and flexible institutionalagreements are increasingly sought to assure new forms of dialogue and par-ticipatory decision-making, responsive to the particular contexts. 1188 3.Globalisation aand ddecentralisation pphenomena. Local resource users and their communities are increasingly caught in the contradictions of global gover-nance systems. Whilst some trends towards devolution and decentralisationfoster local awareness and empowerment processes, the global rules of theWorld Trade Organisation (WTO), the agreements of the Trade RelatedIntellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) such as for patents on seeds and medicinalplants, the concentration of economic power in the hands of trans-nationalcorporations (TNCs) and finance markets, and the current widespread privati-sation trends related to land, water, forests and public services add to theundermining of community control over natural resources, knowledge andinstitutions. 1199In the conservation arena, while protected areas demand high management investments by governments and sacrifices by local communi-ties, the majority of benefits accrue to national and international businessesactive in tourism, hunting, pharmaceuticals or water-hungry agriculture andindustrial production. National states are challenged from both \"above\", bytrans-national corporations and elements of state power acting on their behalf,and below, by local communities. Co-management attempts provide a prom-ising, if uncertain, balancing act among contrasting needs, for instance by set-ting up \"contracts\", \"agreements\" and \"partnerships\" with various socialactors, including local communities, corporations and non governmentalorganisations (NGOs). Such attempts \"legitimate\" and guarantee the new rolesassumed by the new actors and increasingly blur the conventional dividebetween the local aand pprocesses. Governance in general and governance of natural resources in particular are gaining atten-tion in the national and international debates on conservation. Experiences inthe governance of natural resources have even proven to be good vehicles forthe promotion of local governance in other spheres of social and economicdevelopment. On the one hand, governments seek to implement their policiesand programmes in so-called cost-effective ways and look for social actorswith whom they can share their burdens of responsibility. On the other, civilsociety demands more influence on decisions affecting their lives and, asappropriate, the redressing of past injustices. Indigenous peoples and localcommunity organisations, non-governmental organisations with environmentand development goals, trans-national corporations, bodies of internationaland national law, scientific and local expert groups and professional associa-tions\u2014 all clamour for attention and are actively engaged in influencing poli-cies. Among their results are the increased recognition of the legal basis forthe rights of indigenous peoples and the demand for effective access to infor-mation and the representation of civil society interests in policy and decision-making. In this dynamic situation, conventional governance structures androles, based on a centralised and hierarchical authority, appear increasinglyinadequate. More flexible institutional arrangements, characterised by interde-pendence among the actors and shared authority, are being tested both within 17Gunderson and Holling, 2002; Berkes Kalafatides, 2002.national governments and between governments and society.2200These include various forms of collaboration among local communities, government, busi-ness and other actors (\"public interest partnerships\") with increasing referenceto the respect of human rights and the United Nations (UN) principles of goodgovernance (\"participation and voice\", \"accountability\", this sense, co-management can be seen as empowering for some of the social downtrodden, as it helpsthem find a place at the decision-making forum. Whether that is enough toovercome their problems is a very open question. A variety of concepts and terms are used to describe partnerships for the manage- ment of natural resources. As mentioned, we will use in this volume a comprehen-sive rather than narrow understanding of what co-management is about, empha-sising the following in particular: 1.Collaboration aas aa fform oof sself-ddefense.Many indigenous peoples and local communities in a changing world need more than ever strong internal andexternal forms of cooperation to be able to withstand the dangers of environ-mental degradation and socio-cultural impoverishment. 2.Collaboration aas aa rresponse tto ccomplexity.As a result of complex historical developments, the management of natural ecosystems and the naturalresource base of livelihoods generally cut across a variety of political, admin-istrative, cultural and social boundaries: a multiplicity of concerned socialactors exists for most units. 3.Colla boration ffor eeffectiveness aand eefficiency.Different social actors possess complementary capacities and comparative advantages in management,which, while respecting customary and existing rights, can be profitably har-nessed together. 4.Collaboration ffor rrespect aand eequity.A fair sharing of the costs and benefits of managing natural resources and ecosystems is essential for initiatives aim-ing at human development and conservation with equity. 5.Collaboration t through nnegotiation.Most institutional arrangements among relevant actors have at their core formal and/ or informal co-managementplans, agreements and organisations. Such arrangements need to be negotiat-ed through a fair process and subsequently adjusted in a learning-by-doingmode. 6.Collaboration aas ssocial iinstitution.The harnessing of complementary capaci- ties and the fair share of the costs and benefits of managing natural resourcesare the natural roots of many institutional arrangements.

We only attempt to overview relevant experiences and concerns and, from those, synthesise some key CMfeatures, important steps in developing those and lessons learned regarding man-agement institutions and the evolution of a favourable policy context. There isno \"recipe\" to develop a co-management partnership capable of fitting the vari-ety of existing contexts and requirements. While recognising this, we wrote thisvolume to promote action, and thus offer a practical menu of examples, consid-erations to learn from, tools and reminder checklists. We hope these can be use-ful and inspiring. The specific co-management path, unique for every context,can only be made by the ones who will decide to walk it. AA gguuiiddee ttoo tthhiiss vvoolluummee The overall structure of this volume is designed to both draw from and help sup- port co-management practitioners in \"learning by doing\" in a variety of fieldcontexts. Towards aa cconttexttual fframmework In Part II of this volume we explore natural resource management at the historical interface between traditional and \"modern\" societies and illustrate some com-plex combinations of the old and the new devised by local communities as aresponse to current challenges. Five case examples offer a glimpse of the com-plexities that abound in specific contexts, while pointing at a general pattern ofgenerating syncretic solutions. We then discuss issues of actors, entitlements andequity in natural resource management, setting a conceptual foundation to ouranalysis. Various types of actors are described, with attention to the unique enti-tlements of indigenous peoples and local communities and why they are moreakin to rightholders than stakeholders. Entitlements are social constructs that findmeaning only within the society that created them. In this sense, we explore anumber of arguments that have been used to claim entitlements to manage natu-ral resources as well as their interplay with various forms of power. Pathways tomove from potential to empowered and responsible actor, and to do so with spe-cific attention to equity, are sketched and illustrated. Ways by which the actorscan represent themselves in negotiation or be represented by others are dis-cussed, as well as the development of co-management concepts through the lastdecades. Part I closes with a panorama of contemporary forms of co-management in dif- ferent places and cultures. Examples deal with pastoral societies, forestresources, fisheries and coastal resources, mountain environments, managementof wildlife and protected areas, agriculture, agricultural research, and watermanagement. Various common successful characteristics are highlighted but wealso include cases in which co-management did not succeed in taking off. Therest of the book analyses in some more detail the constituent elements (compo-nents) of co-management: the co-management process, the co-managementinstitution and the social context that makes them possible. Towards eeffecttive pprocesses A co-management process is the series of events by which a management part- nership develops and unfolds. Its key aim is to develop a consensus among therelevant partners on \"what to do\" about the ecosystem and natural resources atXXXVstake. The term \"consensus\" is often misunderstood as to convey a sense of total satisfaction achieved by everyone involved. This is not what it represents. A con-sensus may just imply that a compromise has been achieved by which eachparty renounced some of its desires but satisfies others. The term consensusmeans that the phase of negotiation achieved an agreement that everyone \"canlive with\". In Part III of this volume, we begin by describing a number of points of departure and occasions for the co-management process to start. We thenexplore several preparatory requirements to the negotiation phase and lessonslearned during negotiation. We offer a variety of methods and tools, includingseveral checklists. By comparing contexts and examples, we emphasise the needto bend and adjust the process steps in the light of particular situations and con-ditions. Broadly, such process steps accompany a variety of social actors inorganising, expressing and defending their interests and concerns, negotiatingthe agreement, setting up one or more pluralist management organisations, andlearning by doing while implementing their agreement. These steps are mostly valid for modern and formal contexts and possibly less so for other contexts, where co-management can be practiced in a variety of cul-ture-specific ways (for instance, without developing a written agreement). In thelatter cases the process we outline may not be entirely applicable or some of thesteps may merge together. In all, no general procedure is applicable to all cases,but we can still examine a number of important experience-based recommenda-tions. Regardless of context, a co-management process is rarely entirely smooth,often complex and lengthy, and sometimes arduous. It may involve changes ofplans, surprises, contradictory information and the need to retrace one's ownpath and re-iterate a number of steps. Towards eeffecttive iinsttittuttions The co-management agreement and organisations negotiated among the parties spell out the consensus reached through the co-management process and are,basically, as good as the process that generated them. In general, the co-manage-ment agreement includes a management plan but also accords or initiatives thatdo not immediately and directly relate to natural resources but complement theplan by creating the conditions that make sound management possible. It mayconsist of oral understandings or written documents, including project contracts,letters of intent, local by-laws, etc. The co-management plan, whether written ornon-written, usually defines the essential management elements for the relevantarea and natural resources, including objectives, priorities, expected results, therecognised relevant actors, their functions, responsibilities, entitlement, etc. Theagreement often foresees the setting up of one or more co-management organisa-tions, 2222i.e., multi-party bodies with defined functions in the management setting (e.g., an advisory council, a management board, an executive secretariat) usually including the key relevant actors at stake. Together, the co-management plan and complementary accords represent the overall efforts of the parties to fairly share the relevant management functions,entitlements and responsibilities, and thereby create a co-management institu-tion. And yet, a real institution is more than the sum of its parts. An institutionincludes expectations and routine reflexes (in particular the sense of sharedresponsibility in managing natural resources), social norms (such as the habit ofdiscussing decisions with various relevant actors, and accepting that all points of 22We understand as organisations \"groups of individuals or customary social groups bound by a common purpose to achieve objective s\". See also valuable) and the use of specific terms and concepts in everyday life (such as co-management, but also entitlements, equity, linking of benefits andresponsibilities, seeking good governance in resource management). Agreeing ona co-management plan and setting up a pluralist management board are crucialbut not sufficient steps towards institutionalising a co-management regime. Thiswill be achieved only when, besides and beyond rules and organisations, behav-iours and ideas become spontaneously pluralist and respectful of a variety ofentitlements and concerns in society. For this to be achieved, one of the crucialingredients of a social institution is time. Only a day-by-day experience throughtime can give people the sense of normality and the confidence associated witha spontaneous, acquired behaviour and the associated social values. Otheressential ingredients are the stability and resilience of the rules and organisa-tions, which need to merge into normal life. The forms and functioning of co-management agreements and organisations are examined in Part IIIIof this volume, along with the dynamics of institutionalising co-management. We offer several examples of co-management agreements andorganisations and discuss what makes them effective and sustainable. We thenexplore the experience of social actors engaged in \"learning by doing\" as part ofco-management institutions. Towards eenabling ppolicies A social context favourable to co-management allows the co-management process to take place and fosters the development of co-management institu-tions. In some cases, key features are specific legislation and policy, while inothers political and economic conditions are determining elements. No socialpre-condition is always and absolutely necessary for effective co-managementregimes, which are largely the products of the wider environment of which theyare parts, but can also contribute to shaping and reforming that environment. Inother words, practice can be ahead of policy, and co-management processes canhave significant impacts on policy environments. In some countries, context-spe-cific changes in natural resource governance towards increased participationand empowerment have even inspired and informed broader processes ofdecentralisation and democratisation. Part IIVof this volume is concerned with the policy contents and instruments helpful to make co-management work. We focus on the types and content ofenabling policies and institutions and seek to address the real problems encoun-tered by policy-makers, managers and social actors. We discuss how a support-ive and coherent policy environment can comprise elements at various levels,from the specific deeds of local level bureaucrats and leaders to the foundingprinciples of national constitutions and the carefully crafted wordings of globalconventions. International and national policies that enable collaborativeapproaches to natural resource management and sustainable development aredescribed, and the diversity of possible pathways is emphasized. Far from deliv-ering standardised recommendations, we stress that policies and institutionsneed to adapt to local and national contexts, although possibly on the basis ofan in-depth analysis of what has worked or failed elsewhere. We affirm theimportance of local history in co-management processes, and stay away fromstandardised prescriptions and a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. In the final chapter of Part IV we discuss the policy-making process and specificXXXVIIways to change and improve it with an emphasis on participatory democracy, civil society deliberation and mechanisms for social inclusion. In any given soci-ety it is important to ask whose perspectives, knowledge and aspirations areembedded in policies, and whose are excluded. Recognising that policies usual-ly reflect and reinforce the interests of the powerful, we describe some of themethods and approaches that foster greater inclusion and democratic pluralismin policy making. After highlighting ways of strengthening civil society, wereflect on key challenges for deepening participatory governance of both naturalresources and the broader conditions of social life. Finally, in the Concluding Remarks, we draw from our own field experience to offer the reader our personal observations and heartfelt commentary.Part II.TOWARDS AA CCONTEXTUAL FRAMEWORK2 SHARING . She is harvesting cassava today, and wor- rying about the disease that seems to have attacked so many of the new plants.Wondering what she could do to prevent further spreading, she resolves to discussthe problems with some of her village friends later in the day. In her mother's shamba on the outskirts of Kampala ,cassava still grows well. Perhaps she could walk there, one of these days, and get some of her mother's cuttings to try in herown fields. The new portable machine has been set under a shack on the side of the grazing fields and Tobias is gathering the cows for milking. The machine could easilyservice many more cows than he has, but his quota for the year is already filled.Fortunately, the farmers' political lobby in Switzerland is very strong. Tobias andcolleagues just celebrated their most recent victory against a motion to lower agri-cultural subsidies in the country. With subsidies at the current level, twenty cowsare enough to gain an excellent income. Chapter1. MANAGING NATURAL RESOURCES: A STRUGGLE BETWEEN POLITICS AND CUL TURE4 SHARING POWERErika has just survived one of the two annual meetings of the Consultative Council of the Protected Areas Authority of which she is in charge. She is exhausted butsatisfied. The discussion was lively and the people had so much to say. The newlocal administrators seemed not entirely at ease, but the representative of the cat-tle owners and the one of the environmentalists were extremely vocal and every-one now clearly knows where they stand. She goes back in her mind to the pic- tures of the degraded areas she showed in the afternoon, against the backdrop ofthe whitest peaks and one of the most untouched old-growth forests in Romania.These were impressive images and she is sure they will be discussed by the work-ing group in charge of developing a draft management plan in their forthcomingmeeting, just a week from now. The minga , a weekly day of communal work, has just ended. Colourful people scatter back home on the chequered green and brown landscape of the Andeanhills. Rosario and twenty other people representing all the village householdsgathered in the morning to plant lentils and oats in the plot of hard soil they areall recuperating together. For some months they moved the earth and fertilised itwith animal manure, and are now halfway into the process. Once the oat andlentils are harvested, they will mix the remains into the soil, and add some moremanure. In the next growing season they will be able to plant maize and potatoes.They will finally have managed to add some productive land to the meagreresources of their community. This is one of the most important deals of Mark's stockbroker career in New York. He puts down the phone having reached an agreement that will change the priceof cocoa for some time, and his client will profit from it. The new price will even-tually encourage more people to produce and process cocoa, and the supply mayrise too much in a not-so-distant future. This is not his immediate concern. He justneeds to call his client and announce the good news of the deal. Fatima had just gathered the yews and she-goats within the stone enclosure. As she milks the animals, she thinks about the quality of grass in the pasture. Thenomadic pastoral elders are about to meet and decide the date, length, itineraryand size of the migrating herd for the entire Qashqai sub-tribe, one of the largesttribes in Iran. Some months ago she and several other women collected a goodquantity of quality grass seeds. Tomorrow they will place them in perforatedgoatskins, and append those to the neck of the lead goat. As the animals roam,the seeds will come out gradually and will be ploughed under and fertilised bythe marching flocks. The rangeland will improve after the next rains and betterquality pasture will be available on their return from the summering grounds. What do Erika and Filder, Fatima and Tobias, Mark and Rosario have in common? Not much, seemingly. Yet, the daily work and decisions of all of them impactupon the natural environment. They are all \"natural resource managers\". For some of them, the interaction with natural resources and the environment is a direct and intimate affair. Learned in the household and the community, it is anintegral part of what makes life normal, convivial and safe, what makes them amember of a group and a culture. For others it is an acquired and rather distantpower, mediated by technology, sophisticated information systems and bigmoney. 11Still for others, in rapidly growing numbers in wish to express judgments here on the relative merits of one or the other type of interaction, but some cultural crit ics and environmentalists do, at times very powerfully. See, for instance, Wes et al. , 1983; and Berry, 1990.A STRUGGLE BETWEEN POLITICS AND CULTURE 5world, that interaction is both distant and relatively uninformed. Many of us eat food we have not grown, consume electricity unaware that it comes from burningfossil fuels or from nuclear power plants, use and pollute water without considering that we are subtracting it from environmental functions with noknown alternative. For the vast majority of time in which our species roamed the planet, the interac- tion between humans and the environment has been of the first kind. Early groupsof Homo sapiens may have impacted upon the environment in a substantial man- ner (mostly through the use of fire)22, but were also in the front-line to see and feel the results of their own action. More recently, modern technology and the globali-sation of the economy allowed for some on the planet to have an interaction withnatural resources that is at the same time very powerful and very remote. This is aunique characteristic of modern times, built up in recent millennia through socialdiversification, the diffusion of travelling and exchanges, the intensification ofagricultural and industrial production and the progressively imposed dominationof the market economy. 33Below we will discuss, on the basis of field examples, how such intimate and remote interactions with the environment co-exist today,and how they clash or integrate with one another. To arrive at that, however, wewill start from some general considerations. A human culture is a set of institutions, practices, behaviours, technologies, skills, knowledge, beliefs and values proper to a human community. As such, a humanculture is usually received, lived, refined, and reproduced at any given moment inhistory. In traditional societies, many of the features proper to a culture can beinterpreted primarily as a response to the specific natural environment where theyneed to gain their livelihood. Much of what differentiates Ugandan peasants fromMongolian herders, French wine makers, or Japanese fisher-folks can be tracedback to environmental factors such as landscape, climate, water availability, typeof soil and the existing flora, fauna and mineral wealth. By no means are these theonly determinants of the cultures that developed in their midst, but they providedthe crucial set of external conditions around which different cultures developedtheir characterising features. Among those features are the organisations, rules,practices, means, knowledge and values allowing communities to exploit andconserve their natural resources. We will refer to these as \"natural resource man-agement (NRM) systems\". Another term used to represent the set of conditionsthat regulate the reproduction and use of natural resources is \"NRM institutions\".In this work we will use the term \"institutions\" with reference to NRM systemsstrongly characterised by social rules and organisations. An NRM system regulates the interplay between human activities and the natural environment. Its major outputs include: human survival and the satisfaction of economic needs through productive activities, such as hunting, fishing, gathering, agriculture, animal raising, timberproduction and mining; the transformation of portions of the natural environment into a domesticated environment, more suited to being exploited ( e.g., clearing of agricultural land, irrigation, management of grazing land and forests); the control of natural environmental hazards ( e.g., preventing floods, fighting vectors of disease, distancing dangerous animals from human communities); the control of degradation and hazards caused by human pressure on See also Esteva, 1992; and Farvar and Milton, 1972. 6 SHARING POWERronment, through more or less intentional forms of conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of natural resources. A feature closely related to NRM systems is the social regulation of population dynamics. The technological and social capabilities to exploit natural resources(in particular food resources) are a major factor in shaping the size and density ofhuman populations. For instance, communities featuring an NRM system basedon agriculture and animal husbandry are usually larger in size and more concen-trated than hunting-gathering communities. In general, an increase in human pro-ductive capability may result in an increased community size. Yet, that sameincrease is one of the main problems NRM systems need to face. If a populationgrows beyond a certain limit, the existing territory may become unable to supportit. Some common solutions involve the migration of a sector of a communitytowards uninhabited areas and the intensification of local production by adoptionor invention of newer or more effective technologies and practices. 44Dominant neo-Malthusian theories maintain that these solutions are far from being availableto all communities, and many NRM systems are today stressing their environment,at times beyond the point of recovery. More balanced analysis would show, how-ever, that in nearly all such cases, some social, economic and political factorsoutside of local control are playing a dominant role. Too often, unequal terms oftrade, land grabs and natural resource alienation by governments and privateactors impinge on the community NRM systems and drive them to stress theirresources much beyond the traditional sustainable practices. All NRM systems include elements explicitly addressing the conservation (includ- ing wise use) of natural resources, such as knowledge of the local environment,technology and know-how. Examples of these elements are hunters' knowledge ofanimal behaviour and self-restraint in time of mating and growing of the offspring,regulation of grazing and fishing rights in indigenous communities, modern farmercapacity to use fertilisers, and community\u2014 or state-promoted watershed manage-ment schemes. Many conservation features embedded in NRM systems, however, are not explic- itly meant for the purpose. Rather, they are embedded in other components of aculture (social organisation, magic and religious beliefs, prevailing values) buthave a significant impact on the interaction between a human community and theenvironment. For instance, a religious taboo preventing hunting during the breed-ing season, on the surface not inspired by a preoccupation for the conservation ofgame, may still be an effective means to avoid over-hunting and over-fishing. Arule establishing distribution of the camel herd among the children of a Bedouinhead of household may be meant to ensure a fair share of wealth among the com-munity, but could also be useful to avoid unsustainable grazing in given locations.The belief that land is a \"gift from God\" is a religious sentiment, but it may alsomotivate farmers to practice sound land husbandry. A sweeping land reform maybe a political move to pacify the rural and urban poor, but may also have impor-tant consequences on the type and intensity of agricultural practices. In fact, the distinction between \"natural resource management\" and the rest of human life may make more or less sense according to the socio-cultural point ofview. Most traditional societies formed relatively closed systems in which naturalresources were managed though complex interplays of reciprocities and solidari-ties. These systems were fully embedded CULTURE 7for differences of power and roles, including decision-making, within holistic sys- tems of reality and meaning. A telling example is described in Box 3.3, in Chapter 3 of this volume. In all cultures, on the other hand, one can also find some explic-it social institutions directly related to the management of natural resources. These generally include: inclusion/ exclusion rules limiting access to natural resources to communities and individuals belonging to special groups based on kinship, residence, citizenship, economic capacity (ownership of land), personal skills or other criteria; customary regulations or written laws aimed at making individual use of resources compatible with collective interests ( e.g., reciprocity and solidarity customs, taxation system, \"polluter pays\" principles); social organisations in-charge of establishing and enforcing rules, through persuasion, negotiation, coercion, etc. Often, such elements coalesce around specific use regimes (Box 1.1) Box 1.1 pprrooppeerrttyy aanndd aacccceessss rreeggiimmeess (Adapted from Murphree, 1997a) Natural resources are those components of nature that are being used or are estimated to have a use for people and communities. In this sense, what is a \"resource\" is culturally and technologically deter-mined. Cultures shape demand: until they create a use for it, a resource remains latent. Similarly, thedevelopment of technology can promote new uses and thus discover new resources ( e.g., oil and natu- ral gas). Demand and scarcity- perceived or actual, present or future- are the complementary and pri-mary incentives to regulate resource use, and they are usually present side by side with the manage-ment and use regulations that characterise a society. Property, or ownership, is the faculty of disposing of certain resources. Contrary to common interpreta- tions of the term, however, ownership is never absolute. It is, rather, a set of entitlements to use a terri-tory or set of natural resources with some limitations\u2014 different in different social settings\u2014 regardingthe entitlements of others. Entitlements of longer duration (\"tenure\") and subject to fewer conditions areobviously stronger than others. The legitimacy and conditions of resource entitlements arise from a vari-ety of social factors, including formal legislation, cultural norms, kinship, and socio-economic interac-tion. These multiple sources explain the frequent discrepancy between the de jure and de facto entitle- ments of resource users, i.e.,between what is prescribed by norms and laws and what actually happens in real life. Types of property regime include: Commmmunal pproperttyy A common property regime under the jurisdiction of a community of users. The term \"community\" can be defined spatially, socially, culturally or economically. Often\u2014 although not always\u2014 it is used torefer to a residential group small enough for the sanction and pressure of peers to be significant in self-regulation. To be sustainable, communal property regimes must have a defined membership, with rulesfor inclusion and exclusion, and rules to regulate internal competition. In other words, they must havethe institutional means to ensure that the collective good is not eroded by particular interests.Communal land property in peasant and pastoral nomadic societies and the kinship-based property of awell among dry land herders are examples in point. Common property has been the predominant formof land tenure in traditional societies. Privatte pproperttyy8 SHARING POWERThe inclusion/ exclusion rules are a fundamental feature of NRM systems but also an important source of problems. First, rules may work only to a limited extent.There is a need to survey that they are respected, and to enforce them if neces-sary. Second, rules may not ensure equity and fairness in access to resources.Sooner or later, such rules will be challenged by the excluded and disadvantaged,with both overt and hidden means. Third, new social and political subjects mayenter the picture... and the rules may be challenged by them! In fact, NRM sys-tems are a political arena par excellence , intertwined with social clashes fuelled by economic interests, ethnic and cultural differences, ideological and religiousvalues. How do these clashes get solved? In many traditional societies, social values such as caste, predestination, religious authority or historical continuity have determined NRM decisions and their rela-tive sharing of costs and benefits among individuals and groups. In others, dia-logue and discussion of field-based experience (what some, today, refer to as \"co-management\") were widely and effectively practiced. In most cases, culture-basedrelationships of solidarity and reciprocity, the prevalence of communal propertyregimes and the collective building of local knowledge and skills through extend-ed experience in managing the resources, succeeded in producing cohesive andsustainable systems. But control over land and natural resources\u2014 in particularclosure and limitation of access and use\u2014 has also been a pervasive area ofsocial struggle. Throughout history, wars and violent conflicts have produced innumerable changes and substitutions of one group by another in the control of naturalThe right of using, modifying and/ or selling the concerned land and resources according to the willand interests of the private (individual or corporate) owner. Other social actors are usually unable tohave a say on the management and use of privately owned resources. Only in particular and ratherextreme circumstances the neighbours or public bodies have negative rights, i.e.,can forbid a private owner of a piece of land to use the resources in a certain way. For instance, they may forbid alandowner to build a skyscraper, raise dangerous animals or drain a unique wetland. Private property isthe prevailing form of land tenure that regulates \"modern\" capitalist production systems (agriculture andindustry). Sttatte pproperttyy A common property regime under the jurisdiction of the state. In contemporary societies, this type of regime pertains to a great proportion of a country's forests, rivers, wildlife and mining resources. Stateproperty is also the legal foundation of most conservation laws. The may rent, sell or assign part of itsnatural resource wealth to other social actors. Forestry and mining concessions are typical examples ofthis kind of arrangement. In many socialist or other \"statist\" countries common or private property hasbeen expropriated by the. Open-aaccess Open-access resources are available to any one and effectively the property of no one. This condition arises when there is no demand for, or perceived scarcity of the resource concerned, and thus no col-lective attempt to control its use. Frequently, open access situations are the result of ineffective propertyregimes, which claim authority over a resource but lack the means to fulfil the responsibilities involved.This can apply to individual, communal or state property regimes, although a de facto open access situ- ation is most frequent for state-owned resources that a state has not the capacity to relatively efficient ( i.e.,capable of gen- erating good results with acceptable effort) and sustainable ( i.e., capable of main- taining a flow of benefits through time). Many, indeed, beautifully succeed. Forinstance, communal grazing has supported human livelihoods in very inhos-pitable natural environments generation after generation, and water-sharing sys-tems have sustained for centuries abundant agricultural productions in dry lands.Yet, even successful natural resource management systems are not free from con-tradictions, inefficiencies, wastes and errors. Such imperfections make any man-agement system much more of an experimental, trial and error process than a sta-ble state of affairs. In fact, a basic feature of NRM systems is their continuous striv- ing to adapt in response to the demographic, economic, social and cultural changes affecting all environments and human communities. For example, popu-lation growth may lead hunter-gatherers to engage in agriculture. The marketeconomy may urge peasant communities to abandon a traditional labour sharingsystem. Overgrazing may lead cattle ranchers to adopt agro-forestry techniques.Concern for the preservation of biodiversity and the recreational value of wilder-ness, may lead a government to establish a National Park. In general, the neces-sary adjustments of NRM systems are done via progressive fine-tuning of interests,concerns, influences and decisions within any given community and/ or betweencommunity insiders and outsiders. This process needs to take advantage of con-resources. This has been mostly true between outsiders and insiders to a commu-nity, but at times also within a community, which could weaken and even split\u2014sometimes also as a direct consequence of population expansion or accumulationof wealth. External actors, however, were the ones to intrude most often in a vio-lent and uncompromising way. The expansion of the Roman Empire to controlgrain production in Northern Africa, cattle raiding among pastoralist groups inMadagascar, the recent wars in Kuwait and Iraq over oil fields, Israel's occupationof a joint Jordanian-Syrian dam site during the six-day war or the imposition ofcolonial rule or national government rule over community resources in countlesscountries are just some poignant examples .Outright violence, however, has not been the only way of gaining control over natural resources, nor has always succeeded. In many instances, the \"weapons of the weak\" included powerfulnon-overt means of resistance, such as hiding, deceiving, cheating, stealing, orspreading false rumours and ridicule. 55These means allowed them to maintain access over at least part of the natural resources they needed. While this situationof conflict may be perceived as typical, there are, nonetheless, striking examplesof societies based on relations of solidarity, hospitality, magnanimity and mutualaid. See Box 1.2 for one such example in is one of the Baggara (cattle pastoralist) tribes of South Darfur in Sudan. The tribe consists of 12 clans, one of which is composed of \"foreigners\"\u2014 immigrants, refugees and others who, throughoutthe ages, came to be welcomed and accepted locally. Rather than fighting them or depriving them ofaccess to natural resources, the Beni Halba recognise the status of foreigners who come as refugees orthrough other events, and consider them as legitimate and equal partners with their original 11 clans.The chiefs of the 12 clans participate in the tribal Council and have common access to the rangelandsand territories of the tribe that extend AND CULTURE 910 SHARING POWERsultation, negotiation and conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms, which in the ideal case are embedded in the relevant NRM institutions In an absolute sense, it is impossible to assess whether a management system has a positive or negative effect on the environment. This is true because there is no\"optimal\" state in which a given environment could or should be. What does thismean? An ecosystem can be described by many properties, such as: capacity tosustain a certain quantity of biodiversity (many different species) or quality of bio- diversity (presence of highly sensitive, endemic species), wildness (for instance as defined by low dependence on human interaction and extensive presence ofendemic species), productivity for given species (including species capable of sus- taining the life of human inhabitants), resilience after stress, structural variety , maturity (average age and size of some important species ), matrix distribution of habitats , aesthetic values , and so on. Many of these properties can be optimised only one at a time, or even one at the expense of the other, but not all together.Thus, if we wish to maximise the total quantity of biodiversity we may do so atthe cost of the quality of biodiversity, for instance the disappearance of a fewspecies, endemic and fragile. If we opt to maximise productivity we may pay theprice in terms of resilience or wildness. And so on. The problem is compounded by the fact that each property of an ecosystem may favour some interests and actors in society, but displease others. For instance, thepresence of important biodiversity in a given patch of forest may please some uni-versity researchers, herbal healers, and scouts of medicinal plants for pharmaceu-tical companies, but the local youth may be more interested in gaining revenuefrom an environment managed for the maximum production of coffee or cocoa.For some tourists it may be interesting to spend time in an unspoiled and wildtropical watershed, but for the urban planners it may be crucial to transform itinto a water reservoir for energy production. Who should decide? The question is particularly problematic as peasants and pharmaceutical compa- nies, tourists and urban planners indeed belong to different \"communities\" and cultures . Within a self-contained society, existing institutions and cultural norms generally provide their unique answers to their internal conflicts of interests andconcerns. When different cultures clash, however, matters are thorny and emi-nently political: management decisions end up reflecting the priorities of the mostpowerful parties in the controversy. Thus one option is the oligarchic or dictatorialcontrol by the few (be they the \"scientific experts\", the ones with the guns, therich, the conservationists, or the dominant elite). Another option is the pluralist/dialogue/ democratic way. This is based on the acceptance of various entitlementsin society, the gathering of the best available information on the consequences ofvarious possible decisions and a negotiation process among the parties possessingentitlements, interests and concerns. This, at least in theory, is what collaborativemanagement\u2014 the subject of this volume\u2014 is all about. LLiivveelliihhoooodd ssyysstteemmss For most of its existence on the planet, humankind got its subsistence from hunt- ing, fishing and gathering. Some contemporary indigenous societies (such as theKung bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, the Eskimos, fishing communities in remoteislands in the Pacific and some Aboriginal communities in Australia) still rely onthis livelihood system to CULTURE 11A hunting/ fishing and gathering economy is based on the exploitation of wild nat- ural resources in a wide territory or sea area. The people do not control the repro-duction of resources but they take advantage of everything nature can offer. Lowpopulation density, diversification of the diet (according to seasons and sites), andnomadism are common characteristics of hunter-gatherer societies. They are facil-itated by a flexible social organisation, which allows human groups to changesize according to food availability. Hunters-gatherers possess an impressive knowledge of animals, plants, and local ecology, and some of their practices aim at preventing overexploitation ofresources and facilitating the reproduction of significant species. This expertise\u2014together with a highly co-operative attitude within human groups\u2014 is essential fortheir survival. As hunting and gathering activities do not always procure enoughfood, food security depends on the generous sharing of whatever has been gath-ered and hunted among the households in the same group. In these egalitarian societies, access and use of natural resources are not regulated by any economically significant exclusion rule. Every member of a human com-munity has the same right to exploit the hunting and gathering territory, and thesame duty to contribute through his/ her activities to the common livelihood. Awide demographic dispersion diminishes competition over natural resources. As aconsequence, relationships among hunter-gatherer groups are usually peaceful.Contact with more aggressive human groups is avoided. At times, this may eveninvolve abandoning a well-known territory and moving into a new one. Throughout millennia, most of the world's hunting-gathering societies have trans- formed themselves into societies based on agriculture and animal husbandry. Thishas been a complex process, which proceeded at different paces in different envi-ronments. Indigenous tropical forest societies in the Amazon, Central Africa, Asiaand Papua-New Guinea represent some contemporary examples of a \"transition-al\" situation in which hunting and gathering still play a key role. The subsistence of tropical forest societies is based on a mix of shifting horticulture (tuber-focused), which provides thecaloric basis of nutrition, and of hunting, fishing and gather-ing activities, which supply proteins, other qualitative ele-ments of the diet, fuel and raw materials. This livelihoodstrategy is usually associated with a relatively sedentary set-tlement pattern. Communities live in long houses or clustersof long houses, hosting about 150-200 people each, scat-tered over a wide area. Each human settlement includes thedwellings, the surrounding fields, and a hunting territory. The NRM systems of tropical forest hunters-horticulturists usually include strict territorial control through feuding andwarfare (often ideologically promoted by complex, highlyelaborate rituals such as headhunting or witchcraft). Suchstrong exclusion mechanisms limit human pressure on theforest. Often the buffer territory between one community andanother becomes a de facto \"no man's land\" where game and other forest resources reproduce without human distur-bance. These undisturbed territories and and ecotypes allow tropical forest hunters-horticulturists to makesustainable use of the fragile tropical forest ecosys-tem and resources. About eight thousand years ago, many human com- munities started to concentrate their productiveeffort on cereal and leguminous cultivation (oftencoupled with small-scale animal raising). This peas-ant way of life is practised today by innumerablerural communities, in both developing and industrialcountries. In comparison with hunter-gatherers, trop-ical forest hunter-horticulturists, and nomadic pas-toralists, peasants feature a more intensive way ofexploiting the natural environment. Their technolo-gy and know-how allow them to get all they needfor survival from a small but efficiently exploited ter-ritory. Furthermore, in the absence of special cata-strophic events such as droughts, floods, famines ormajor wars, peasant societies are also able to accu-mulate surpluses relatively rapidly. This may providelivelihood opportunities for larger and more concen-trated human communities. Traditional peasant NRM systems focus on arable land. The arable land surround- ing a settlement is usually under some form of communal property regime. Plotsare periodically assigned for cultivation by village authorities such as the Councilsof Elders, according to kinship and other customary rules. Often, these authoritiesare also in charge of conserving and enhancing productivity of common land. Tothis end, for instance, communities mobilise to implement erosion control andflood prevention or management works (the agricultural areas of Hadramaut inYemen are an excellent example of this). Land husbandry regulations (such asrespect of fallow time, crop rotation or terracing) are promoted and, when neces-sary, enforced. Similar practices are sometimes extended to the near-by forestsand grazing areas, which are kept in a state of semi-cultivation similar to thatadvocated by modern agro-forestry practices. There the peasants collect fuelwood, fodder and other wild natural resources. Peasant cultures deliberately seekto transform the natural environment into a human-made environment. At times,this includes attempts to control unpredictable factors (such as weather and cli-mate) through magic and religious means. Most peasant NRM systems are not stable. For instance, under the pressure of cli- matic change between 9000 and 3000 years ago, groups of Central Asian farmerswere forced onto horseback to experiment nomadic pastoralism, a livelihoodstrategy which was subsequently adopted in many arid areas of the world.Nomadic pastoral societies (such as those existing in Southwest Asia, Central Asiaand North, sub-Saharan and East Africa) base their economy on the exploitationof domesticated animals, such as cattle, horses, camels or sheep and goats. TheirNRM system is geared towards providing the herds with a constant supply of fod-der and water and thus they adopt a mobile life-style, which allows them to trackrangelands and water resources throughout the year. Seasonal displacements areoften combined with cyclical migrations taking place over POLITICS AND CULTURE 13distribute grazing pressure over a large territory. Overgrazing is prevented also by the periodic sub-division of human communities into smaller sub-units, a phe-nomenon that facilitates the de-stocking of the animal herd. Needless to say, thesedentarisation policies of many national governments severely disrupt this liveli-hood system, with resulting extreme social and environmental stress. Nomadic pastoral communities usually possess impressive capabilities in manag- ing the constraints and hazards of the semi-arid environment, as well as the healthof their animals. Their NRM systems, however, can function only if strong socialcontrol is ensured over rangeland and water resource use. Most nomadic pastoralsocieties, in fact, rely on complex pasture and water tenure regulations, whichusually include rangeland conservation measures. The enforcement of these meas-ures is entrusted to tribal elders and authorities, called to act as mediators in con-flicts that may arise among local groups. If negotiations are not successful, openstruggles for the control of water and pasture may ensue. Peasants who do not adopt pastoral nomadism are usually forced by population growth to expand and intensify the exploitation of arable land. This exposes themto environmental hazards and conflicts with neighbouring villages. To overcomethe above limitations, some peasant communities join in confederations of ruralvillages ruled by a common authority, which can regulate land tenure conflictsand ensure a region-wide control over land husbandry practices. In the ancientworld, this process took an especially rapid pace on the shores of the Nile, theTigris, the Euphrates, the Indus, the Ganges and the Yellow River. In these areas, the quality of soil was high (benefiting from river water and sedi- ments), a fact that prompted peasants to solve land disputes locally rather thandisperse (a common response in areas were natural resources are distributed overlarge territories). In addition, the advantages of a central authority are rather evi-dent among the inhabitants of large river watersheds, where public works are nec-essary to control the floods and to make water available outside the natural edgesof the alluvial plain. Starting from 4,000 BC, the village confederations of the south-west Asian rivers developed fairly stable \"hydraulic states\", which acquired their legitimacy fromtheir capability of implementing flood-control and irrigation works. A variant ofthis watershed management-based form of state is the one developed by someAndean civilisations such as the Inca. Due to the specific ecological conditions oftheir territories, the water management activities promoted by the Inca focused onerosion control, rather than on water-stream control. A huge amount of peasantlabour was mobilised to establish impressive terracing works\u2014 the still observableand functioning andenes\u2014 which made suitable for agriculture the steep hills of the Andes, highly prone to erosion. The hydraulic states also entailed the develop-ment of complex sets of rules for access to land and resources (especially water),legislation for water management (often encoded in religion) 66and the rise of a centralised bureaucracy and military force in charge of enforcement and defence.In this process, individual, community, and state property were differentiated andmany NRM systems were institutionalised, i.e.,codified in specific rules and organisations under central control. This notwithstanding, local knowledge, skillsand institutions continued to be central to the water and irrigation systems, at leastin the oriental world (see Chapter 3. 14 SHARING POWER In other areas, possibly less characterised by very important river basins, the focus of state development and expansion was more urban than rural. Confederations ofpeasant villages developed into states that progressively expanded their area ofinfluence through warfare and built vast political units. This was the case for theRoman Empire (and for the development of most states in continental Europe),which made some effort to plan agricultural exploitation in selected rural areas ofItaly, Southern France, Spain and Tunisia, but always perceived its expansion as aprocess of colonisation, based on road building, military control, collection oftributes, trade, and pillage of local resources. The Empire was in need of progres-sively larger agricultural harvests to sustain its densely populated towns. This wasachieved through the introduction and extension of technological innovations( e.g., diffusion of crops from one place to another, small-scale irrigation schemes, and progressive improvement of tools) rather than via major public works andstate-controlled policies. This approach was consistent with the overwhelmingimportance attributed to private property in Roman laws. In more recent times, the emphasis on technological innovation and private (or corporate) land property has become an overwhelming characteristic of naturalresource management in the Western world. A case in point is the transformationof most European rural inhabitants into urban proletarians or overseas settlers thattook place in the last couple of centuries and was closely intertwined with thedevelopment of capitalist agriculture. Technological innovations\u2014 originally com-ing to Europe from the East\u2014 became very important, including the practice ofcrop rotation, improved crop varieties and breeds and safer storage systems. Lateron, new methods such as mechanical cultivation and harvesting, more sophisti-cated irrigation techniques and new crops ( e.g., potato, tomato and maize) tended to minimise losses, decrease the need for labour and increase the overall outputof the productive process for a given unit of land. An early momentous role in this process of transformation was played by the appropriation and partition of common lands by private individuals and, later,by the state. The phenomenon, which goes under the name of \"enclosure of thecommons\", was a by-product of the monetisation of feudal life. It started in England as early as the 13 thcentury and reached its climax in the late 18thand early 19thcenturies, when halfof the arable land CENESTA, 2004) The land of west and central Asia is dotted with an ingenious community-managed technology for the tapping of ground water. Known as Karez (Afghanistan, Iran and Chinese Turkistan), Qanat (Iran), Fouggara (North Africa), Surangam (India) and Falaj (Arabian Peninsula), this ancient technique has supplied water for irrigation and social life for millennia. Tapping into the renewable hydrologicalreserves of the hills and mountain, the karez provides abundant water for local uses under the control of local community councils and often in defiance of the central authority. Even the water of the centrally-organised irrigation systems of the great rivers (the so-called hydraulic states), once flowing in secondary and tertiary irrigation canals, has been treated the same way as thewater from the ground. The karez system, initially transferred by the Arabs to the Spaniards, can be found today in places as far apart as the Philippines (the sanjeras system), Mexico and Peru.A STRUGGLE BETWEEN POLITICS AND CULTURE 15feudal commons and used by peasants to grow food crops or graze their flock, was \"enclosed\" and reserved for cash-oriented production (initially mostly forsheep rearing and, later, also for tillage) for the benefit of the landowner aristocracy. 77Trees were cleared, marshes were drained, efforts were made to improve the fertility of the soil and large portions of land were offered for leaseat competitive rents. Among the consequences of the enclosures was anincrease in economic productivity of the land, coupled with benefits for thelandlords and the ones who could afford to buy or lease land. In parallel, how-ever, the human cost for the small peasants reached tragic proportions. In someestates nine-tenths of the peasant population were forced to leave the land andwent to feed a mass of wandering poor\u2014 the labour pool for the industrial revo-lution to come and for the migrations to the \"New World\". This wrenchinghuman dislocation proceeded at different pace throughout the European conti-nent and did not go without rebellions. Thousands of peasants were slaughteredin the process, which was at times slowed down by the intercession of kingsand the Church and even by specific legislation, but basically never stopped. Asaptly described by Polanyi 88: \"Enclosures have appropriately been called a revolution of the rich against the poor. The lords and nobles were upsetting the social order, breaking down ancient laws and customs, sometimes by means of violence, often by pressure and intimidation. They were literally robbing the poor of their share in the com- mon, tearing down the houses which, by the hitherto unbreakable forces of cus- tom, the poor had long regarded as theirs and their heirs' .\" The \"enclosure\" model, centred on private property, a monetary economy and efforts to increase land productivity has not remained confined to the lands ofnoble aristocracy. Policies of deforestation and \"enclosure\" by order of the statehave been the rule in European countries throughout recent centuries. In north-ern Italy, for instance, the new national state did not spare efforts at alienating,splitting up and privatizing the collective property of the village communities(woods, pastures, etc.), a process still in the making as late as 1927. 99This was sooner or later accepted for the land most suited to the profit-oriented agricul-ture in the plains (with consequent creation of important landowning posses-sions), but encountered fierce resistance for the more mountainous and marginallands of the upland communities, to the point that some special legislation wascarved to allow some of them to maintain a collective, solidarity-oriented\u2014and, incidentally, very successful\u2014 form of control over those resources. 1100 The \"enclosure\" model has not remained confined to Europe either. It was well applied in the colonies, with individual land conquest and appropriation as apathway ( e.g., for the haciendas of South America1111), but also with land appro- priation by the colonial powers as an explicit effort to \"scientifically manage\"the so-called wastelands of India. 1122In Africa, the colonial triad of taxation, export cropping and monetisation took care of tearing apart local peasants fromtheir kin and community affiliations and obligations in the commons, creating 7Heilbroner, 1968. 8Polanyi, 1944. 9On this date the Italian government passed Act No. 1766 aimed at liquidating collective property: the woods and pastures had to be handed over to the communes and the agricultural land to the farmers. 10Merlo et al., 1989. Many of these collective property systems continue to this day (see Box 11.10 in Chapter 11). 11Burbach and Flynn, 1980. 12In 1865 the Indian government passed such legislation with the Indian Forest Act, which expropriated the individual and collect ive rights at the roots of many modern famines.1133The new post-colonial independent states are also extremely comfortable with thepractice of \"enclosures\", which they have set to work without much re-thinkingor change. In Kenya, for instance, the Registered Land Act makes the individualtitle deeds to prevail over all sorts of customary collective rights 1144considered contrary to modernisation. In West Africa, where cultural resistance to land pri-vatisation is strong, the state policies have favoured state ownership or individ-ual ownership of agricultural land also with the support of foreign aid projects. 1155 State control, however, too often revealed itself a euphemism for unregulated, \"open access\" regimes through which both the state and others appropriateresources with no concern for sustainability. In Nepal, for instance, unqualifiedstate control of village forests prompted a break down of traditional manage-ment practices that damaged both the resources and the people. 1166Likewise, in Iran, Syria, Jordan and other countries, the \"nationalisation\" of rangelands havecaused their alienation from the nomadic pastoralists and the further degrada-tion of these productive, albeit marginal, natural resources. The last centuries have thus seen progressive changes in natural resource manage- ment all over the world. Prompted by technological innovations and the enclo-sure of the commons, these changes lead towards the expansion of cultivatedland at the expense of forests and wildlife habitats, the replacement of use valuesby market/ monetary values and the substitution of experience-based, culture-embedded and often highly productive production systems by the \"science-based\" decisions of merchants, bureaucrats and experts. In parallel, a progressive-ly smaller percentage of the population of a country remained employed and/ orin control of agricultural production. This \"taming of nature\" obtained spectacularresults but also left behind degraded soil and water, polluted air, depletedresources because of excessive extraction (first among all from the sea and forests)and a sustained loss in biological diversity (habitats, species, and genetic variety). Far from being a mere economic or environmental phenomenon, this is principal- ly a political one. It happened first as a consequence of the expansion of thepower of landed aristocracy, then through colonisation and colonial enterprisesand later as a consequence of the globalisation of the world economy and thecoming to dominance of one, or a few, superpowers. In this, subsistence peasantshave been progressively involved in cash crop production, nomadic pastoralistshave been forced to settle and hunters-gatherers have been constrained tobecome farmers. In other words, many existing customary and community-basedrights and traditional NRM systems have been overlooked, negated or simplycrushed in the name of the \"higher\" goals of modernisation and development. Today, the agro-industrial-market system is the dominant, \"modern\" NRM system at the global level. Every day, the international trade and market system moveshuge financial resources (real and virtual) that have all too real effects on land andresource uses and practices. This process is effectively dominated by a few coun-tries, a few international corporations and a few banking giants. Many countriesare seriously dependent on foreign imports of food and other natural resources(raw or processed) and virtually exist under the patronage of the few who domi-nate their markets. Crucial resources, such as oil, are internationally and national-ly controlled, by virtue or vice. In fact, specialisation of local production and 13Watts, 1983a and 1983b. 14In fact, a registered land owner in Kenya is immune to challenge, no matter how the property was obtained, a fact discussed by Alden Wily and Mbaya, 2001. 15Franke and Chasin, 1980. 16See the story of a specific village masterly narrated in Kuchli, 1997.A STRUGGLE extent, the history of contemporary rural developmentefforts can be seen as the history ofthe encounter\u2014 or clash\u2014between the indigenous NRM sys-tem and the modern, agro-industri-al-market system. Such a clash orig-inates in the profound differencesexisting between the two in termsof goals, values and means (seeTable 1.1). It also originates in thepower struggles that accompany theprocess, cutting across both thecentre and on inputs from outside increasingly appear as the two faces of the same coin. These phenomena sprout in part voluntarily and in part imposedby a variety of socio-economic constraints. They have in part healthy results, suchas increased communication and friendly relationships among people belongingto different backgrounds and histories, and in part pernicious results, such as lossof autonomy, diversity and sense of people's identity and culture. The \"collateral ecological damage\" intrinsic to the taming of nature is possibly the most ominous consequence of the agro-industrial market system. Only recently, asenvironmental damage began to affect private and collective interests throughoutthe world, environmental concerns have come to the fore. Principles such as \"pol-luter-pays\" start clamouring for attention, as societies become conscious of thecosts of un-regulated exploitation of natural resources. Some state-enforced con-servation and sustainable use policies are slowly becoming part of the modernagro-industrial NRM system. Societies are not even close, however, to the extentand depth of change they should make in order to reverse and repair existing neg-ative trends. In addition, too often even the positive measures remain as far fromthe interests and concerns of local communities as the economic motivations thatforce them to plant one crop as opposed to another or spray all of them with pesticides. Decisions taken in capital cities or even distant continents have a dom- inant influence on the interaction people have with their local environment. 18 SHARING many context-depending features Focus on the generation of private, corporate orstate wealth Focus on community livelihoods Innovative, often recently tested only outside thearea in different social and environmental settings Traditional, tested at the local level, in the relevantarea, for a long time All market-oriented Mostly subsistence-oriented Based on the control of energy sources ( e.g., oil), mineral sources and water.Based on the control of land, biological resourcesand water.

Since the beginning of thelast century, they have been known as J\u20acvaros , a term that in Ecuadorian Spanish denotes fierce, rebel and savage people. This reputation relates to head-hunting, raiding, witchcraft feuding, andindomitable hostility against outsiders, which\u2014 after a brief period of Spanish rule between 1549and 1599\u2014 made the Indian territory off-limits to Ecuadorians and travellers for about three hundredyears. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Shuar were living according to their tropical forest hunting-horticulturist pattern. They were settled in clusters of 5 - 10 long houses, scattered over animmense and de-populated region and separated by rather large \"buffer\" areas. Each long house cor-responded to an extended family and each cluster to a local group of about 150 persons. Each groupwas named after a Big Man acting as a military and ritual leader in headhunting (against non-ShuarIndians) and feuding (against other Shuar settlements). They practised a subsistence economy basedon manioc and plantain horticulture, pork breeding and hunting. Most technology was indigenous,with the exception of iron tools, introduced during the sixteenth century, which were bought from mestizo traders settled on the Western border of Indian Territory. Pigs, handicraft ( e.g., baskets, blow- guns), forest products ( e.g., dart-poison), and small agricultural surplus were bartered with imple- ments such as machetes, knifes, axes, and, after 1920, muzzle-load shotguns and powder. In the early 1930s, gold was discovered in Western Shuar territory. Gold miners coming from the Azuay highlands used gifts, alcohol, fraud and violence to make their presence accepted. Once thegold fever was over, several miners settled in the area, established cattle ranches and started toemploy Shuar labour. The Ecuadorian Army came to protect colonists' property and life, and mis-sions were opened to pacify the J\u20acvaros . In 1950, the Ecuadorian Government, with the aim of responding to highland peasants' claim for land\u2014 without affecting landowners' interests\u2014 started to actively promote the colonisation of thearea. This process reached its climax in the sixties, when a special institution\u2014 the CREA the infrastruc- ture needed for a massive colonisation of the Shuar territory. To resist this mounting pressure on the Western valleys, many Shuar migrated towards the inaccessi- ble region located east of the Kutuk\u20ac Mountains, where it was still possible to practice their indige-nous way of life. Others, however, adapted to the new situation, seeking protection from the mission-aries against colonists' abuses. They converted to Catholicism, allowed some of their sons anddaughters to learn Spanish and be \"civilised\" in boarding schools, and started to combine indigenousslash-and-burn agriculture with cattle breeding on behalf of the church fathers. Some of thembecame traders and supplied the \"wild Shuar\" of Transkutuk\u20ac with an increasing quantity and variety of western goods. This, of course, increased Eastern Shuar dependence on trading relationships withthe frontier. Thus, in one way or another, all the Shuar became increasingly involved in the nationalmarket and society.Nothing is more illustrative of the interaction, or clash, between modern andindigenous NRM systems, than some actual field examples. Five such examplesare given below.20 SHARING POWERBy the mid-sixties, some \"educated\" Shuar started to realise that little chance was left to their peo- ple to escape this process. Based on this awareness, an ethnic organisation called the ShuarFederation was founded. Its objectives were defending indigenous land rights, ensuring that benefitsof development would be made available to Shuar communities, and preserving indigenous culturaland ethnic identity. With these goals in mind, the Shuar Federation (supported by missionaries and international non governmental organisations - NGOs) started to promote the modernisation of indigenous societythrough the following strategy: registration of Shuar settlements as legally acknowledged co-opera-tives (called Centros ); procurement of agricultural land titles; provision of credit and technical assis- tance for extensive cattle breeding; provision of bilingual education, health and transport services. During the following twenty years, the Federation was successful in achieving its development objectives. However, by the early 1990s, it became clear that the modernisation process was spoil-ing the indigenous NRM system, and, eventually, was having a negative impact on the physical andhuman ecology of most Indian communities. Why was this happening? Since its establishment, the Shuar Federation had decided to work with the existing laws and proce- dures. Unfortunately, these were colonisation rules, based on the assumption that there was no\"Indian land\" in the Amazons but only state property, which could be distributed to individuals orlegally recognised groups ( i.e., colonisation co-operatives) in accordance with their exploitation capability. Among colonists, this policy had already made clearing the forest and opening pasturesan especially popular (and inexpensive) way to get into the position to claim huge extensions ofland. By adopting the same tactics, the Shuar Federation was able to secure significant land titles to many Shuar Centros . This slowed down the occupation of indigenous land. Furthermore, cattle rearing helped people to create some savings, which could then be used to purchase commodities andbasic services. Nonetheless, the substitution of forest cover with grassland had a major impact onbio-diversity and soil, and thus on indigenous subsistence practices. Game, forest materials (such asvines, thatching and poles), and good arable land were becoming scarce. An increasing amount oflabour had to be invested in cattle raising and pasture management. Even in the eastern plains,where colonists were still few and large untouched forest areas persisted, men started lacking thetime for hunting, fishing or looking for forest materials. As a result, tin roofs became less expensivethan thatched roofs and nylon rope cheaper than jungle vines. At the same time, the improvement in the standards of living, modern services and commodities were performing well in decreasing under-five mortality, which fell from 267 per thousand in 1976,to 99 per thousand in 1992. Related to this trend, the total population grew at a rate of about 4% ayear. By the early 1990s, the population density was already 5.2 persons per square km of entitledland ( i.e.,four to five times higher than before contact with the frontier), and it was expected to reach 10.6 persons per square km in 2006. Nobody in the Federation really knew whether the landwould be sufficient to sustain the livelihood of all these people. For sure, however, the poor qualityof most Shuar soils and the increasing land tenure conflicts occurring among families and settle-ments suggested that hard times might be coming. In the late 1990s, based on the above elements and under the influence of several co-operation agencies, the Shuar Federation included environmental sustainability as a major objective in its fightfor development and cultural survival. Moreover, new Ecuadorian conservation laws allowed theA STRUGGLE BETWEEN POLITICS AND CULTURE 21The impact of the national economy and market on indigenous NRM strategies is not always as dramatic as in the Shuar case. Less comprehensive and abruptchanges take place when indigenous strategies are less culturally distant and cancoexist with \"modern\" strategy with minor adjustments. Significantly enough,however, these adjustments often result in less sustainable use of naturalresources. The following case, concerning a Mediterranean peasant community,provides a good example of how modernisation may spoil indigenous practices,without being able to replace them with feasible \"modern\" NRM Zaghouan Governorate, Northern Tunisia. It is a small catch- ment of 62,000 ha, featuring highly deteriorated forest and rangeland areas in the upper part, andover-exploited agricultural land in the lowlands. It hosts a population of about 1,300 Arabic-speakingpeasants who originally migrated from the fertile Zaghouan plain towards this less favourable areaunder the pressure of early twentieth century French colonisers. Sbahiya inhabitants practice typical subsistence Mediterranean farming: they grow cereals (wheat, oats and barley) and leguminous crops (broad beans and green peas), cultivate olive and some fruittrees. They also breed sheep and goats, and tend small kitchen gardens. Dwellings are nucleated insmall hamlets, according to lineage segments known as douars .Douars own collectively the arable land surrounding the settlement. Several small parcels (as small as 0.25 ha) are however assigned forexploitation to households. Erosion is a major problem in the ecology of Oued Sbahiya, originated by both natural factors (such as slope, climate, and soil texture) and human-made factors (including population growth, over- 18This case-example has been provided by Patrizio Warren.Shuar Federation to negotiate their entitlements in two major national parks, in which they would be free to practice hunting, fishing and gathering in exchange for conservation works and surveil-lance. Currently, agro-forestry is also being promoted at the farm level and new income-generatingactivities based on indigenous know-how, and diversification of production are being tested. Familyplanning services are also being introduced, despite their poor cultural acceptability and missionaryresistance. All together, the above initiatives may be useful in improving the human ecology of the Shuar, and in preventing an environmental catastrophe. None of them will however be able to restore thedemographic and ecological conditions on which the indigenous NRM system was originally based.After three centuries of strenuous resistance, the increased pressure of the national society andeconomy on their land brought the Shuar to adopt the particular variant of the \"modern\" NRM sys-tem promoted by the national government. This allowed them to survive as an ethnic group, toincrease their wealth, and to get basic services, but did not prevent them from eventually clashingwith the problems of demographic growth and unsustainable development. 22 SHARING POWERexploitation of agricultural land, grazing, and firewood pressure on the forests). To tackle the prob- lem, the Centre R\u00e9gional de D\u00e9veloppement Agricole (CRDA) of Zaghouan started in the early 1990s to promote soil management works in the area. Bulldozers were made available to the farmers forerosion control works on their land. This intervention, however, rapidly made soil conservationauthorities unpopular with the peasants. Bulldozers were simply too big to operate efficiently in thepatchwork of micro-parcels owned by Sbahiya peasants. Inter-property borders could not be respect-ed and tracks scrapped away amounts of soil which (given the parcel size) farmers perceived as sig-nificant. Passive resistance mounted against the programme, which eventually led CRDA techniciansto think that Sbahiya peasants were not aware of the consequences of erosion on their farming sys-tem, nor willing to take any measure to counteract it, unless forced by authorities. In 1996, researchers from a participatory watershed management project supported by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) tried to face the issue from a different prospec-tive. In the framework of a participatory appraisal exercise, the project team visited a highly erodedarea together with a group of peasants and asked them what they knew about erosion. Peopledefined erosion as \"fertile soil going away, leaving bad land behind\". This was related in part to thewill of Allah , who created the djebels (mountains) and the steep slope; and, in part, to the behaviour of abdallah (literally, \" Allah's servant\", i.e., the peasant), who does not take appropriate care of his land. The peasants were then asked to describe what could be done to avoid soil loss. They said that in the past they used to stabilise soil by constructing check-dams with stones and planting prickly pear cac-tuses on the gullies. They also used to build embankments made of tree branches and earth, consoli-dated through the plantation of fig trees, for collecting and deviating running water. Technicians realised and agreed that these measures were sound and asked why they were aban- doned. People explained that this depended on changes in their lifestyle. New needs (including agri-cultural inputs, household commodities, and expenses related to education and health) have madetheir households increasingly dependent on cash. Yet the price paid for their agricultural products isfar less than the salaries that can be earned by masonry workers in the tourist areas of the coast, bywage labourers in big agricultural estates, or by migrants overseas. Moreover, city lights are attractivefor youngsters. That's why most men (and some unmarried girls) migrate elsewhere in search of betterchances, leaving the burden of agriculture on the shoulders of old people, women and children. Inthese conditions of local labour scarcity, the household economy can not anymore afford conserva-tion works. The fields are worked as fast as possible, trying to squeeze out of them maximum yieldswith little concern for loss of fertility. These considerations had a very practical immediate implication. The erosion control authorities were urged to consider the opportunity to reinvest part of the money allocated to mechanical erosioncontrol works, to pay cash incentives to farmers willing to implement manual works in accordancewith local know-how. It was also stressed that such an option would bring two additional benefits:contributing to lessening seasonal migration, and revitalising some elements of the indigenous farm-ing system that are essential for sustainability. The case, however, tells us more than that. It shows that current attitudes and behaviours of Sbahiya peasants towards land husbandry could not be considered independently from some embedding eco-nomic and political factors, such as land tenure policies, structure of the local market, and socialmarginalisation. The shrinking of arable land per household (related to population growth), the poorprices paid locally to local production, the increased social needs, and the presence of off-farmincome generation opportunities, have all resulted in decreased availability of labour for indigenousA STRUGGLE BETWEEN POLITICS AND CULTURE ago, the Confederation of Qashqai Tribes was one of the largest nomadic pastoralist groups of Iran. At that time, most of the population of the country (probably over one-half) was com-posed of nomadic pastoralists. The most significant ethnic groups were the Qashqai, Shahsavan,Baluch, Turkmen, Bakhtiari and other Luri peoples. Besides them there were seven hundred large andsmall tribes and independent clans of pastoralists. Since time immemorial, the pastoralist tribes con-stituted the backbone of the political structures governing the region. Typically, a number of suchtribes would form a coalition and take hold of political power in the land. The chief of the dominanttribe in the coalition would be named King of Kings and start a new dynasty. If people becameunhappy with the ruling dynasty, a new coalition of tribes would take over and form a new dynasty.This is the essence of the political history of Iran over the past twenty five centuries. Some fourteencenturies ago, Arab tribes took over the land as part of the Islamic expansion. Having defeated theSasanid dynasty, they took over the country and ruled it for four centuries until about 1,000 yearsago, when some Turkish-speaking tribes liberated Iran from Arab colonial rule. Various Turkic tribesthen ruled the country nearly all the time until about 1920 when the Pahlavi dynasty took over theKingdom. This was the first non-tribal, non-pastoral dynasty to rule the country since the dominationby Arab regimes had been overthrown. The Qashqai tribes have likely been living in southern Iran for over a thousand years. For all practi- cal purposes they are \"indigenous\" to several provinces in the south, including Fars, Bushire andHormozgan. These pastoralists, like most of the others in Iran, have depended on grazing rangelandsin an extensive manner, migrating from wintering grounds to summering grounds and back. The win-tering grounds are usually lower planes and hillsides, while the summering grounds are higher up themountains. The distance between these two ranges is usually several hundred kilometres. Most of thetribes have an agreed migration route through which they pass twice a year: in the spring and in theautumn. The landscape over which these tribes migrate is held and managed under a typical common proper- ty regime. The allocation of land follows the customary laws and each unit of the tribe knows the ter-ritory over which it has the right of grazing. They take great care to insure that the rangelands arehealthy. Men take care of larger animals that can move over large distances without water, whilewomen take female and lactating animals grazing closer by. Women are also in charge of milking theanimals twice a day and processing the milk into butter, yoghurt, and many other products. Children,too, are a productive part of the system, as they usually take the young animals to pasture. Managingthe common property resources is the responsibility of the Councils of Elders, usually through asophisticated and complex process. Barring unusual events and disasters, the system assured the sus- 19This case example has been provided by M. Taghi Farvar.Modern influences on indigenous NRM systems do not always result in destruc- tion (as in the Shuar case) or a loss (as in the Sbahiya peasants' case). The follow-ing example from Iran demonstrates the strength and resilience of some traditionalNRM systems in the face of powerful agents of change.soil conservation works. At the same time, the modern alternative (mechanical works) is not appro-priate to the prevailing land tenure pattern.

In the 1920s and 1930s, however, the rule of Reza Shah brought drastic and disastrous changes. Reza Shah was not of nomadic origin. He actually held the nomads in contempt and thought thatthey were a huge impediment to his imitation of the style of development of Europe. In his mad rushto dominate and \"modernise\" the country (by modernisation he simply understood Europeanisation)he mimicked Ataturk, who was busy dismantling the traditional social structures of Anatolia at thesame time. Reza Shah used military force against the nomadic pastoralists to smash any resistance tohis designs, and did not hesitate to use treachery where he could not succeed by the use of force.The landscape of the Qashqai nomads is scattered with the reminders of this very unfortunate epoch.Most of these take the form of ruins of mud housing projects that the King ordered built in the middleof nowhere. Finding themselves confined at gunpoint to a very limited area for grazing, many pas-toralist groups perished together with their livestock. The powerful rural police of Reza Shah man-aged to keep them effectively under the siege of forced sedentarisation. With the abdication of the King in the middle of World War II, his son Mohammad Reza Shah took over. During the 1940s the nomadic pastoralists felt a relative lessening of the iron rule over them,which unfortunately was soon to be re-established. The Qashqai took full advantage of the temporarysituation, as the government in Tehran was weak and ineffective: they simply took to their migrationroutes again! They collected the surviving sheep, goats, donkeys, horses and camels and startedagain to take care of their rangelands and flocks of livestock. They managed rather well until 1953,when a well known USA-UK-backed coup d'\u00e9tat ousted the nationalist and popular Prime MinisterDr. Mohammed Mosaddeq and brought the self-exiled Shah back to power. Throughout their history,the Qashqai have shown to be defenders of the land, particularly against British colonialism. In sup-port of the popular deposed prime minister they actually took up arms and fought for the next tenyears a hard war against the government of the Shah. In the end the Qashqai were defeated and theirtribal chiefs expelled from the country. Already in the 1950s, a new law for foreign aid had passed in the Parliament of the United States of America and an agreement of cooperation had been signed with the government of the Shah. Ayoung man from the Qashqai tribe was recruited by the Point Four (foreign aid) Administration andtaken to the United States of America. This young man, by the name of Bahman-Beygi, was shownthe school system in the American Indian reservations, designed to assimilate the Indians into theAmerican lifestyle and alienate them from their land and traditions. It was assumed that the nomadicpastoralists of Iran were equivalent to the \"Indians\" of the United States. Bahman-Beygi was instruct-ed about how to brainwash the minds of the young students in order to alienate them from theirtribes and implant in them an insatiable thirst for the modern, urban life far removed from the reali-ties of nomadic pastoralism. He came back to Iran and convinced the Shah to let him organise aninnovative tribal school system, based on mobile schools held in tents. The tents were white againstthe backdrop of the black tents of the nomads. The white tents were to symbolise, in the very wordsof Bahman-Beygi \"purity and enlightenment against the darkness and ignorance of the evil blacktents!\" 2200The methods of learning were harsh and rote, reminiscent of a fascist system of education, and were inculcated into selected tribal teachers, recruited from the very tribes. Each teacher wasgiven a white tent and was armed with tools for conditioning the innocent children. When hearingcriticisms of his rote methods of learning, for instance that they were not conducive to encouragingthinking, Bahman-Beygi would retort: \"these children are not supposed to think; they are simply sup-posed to carry out the programme I have implanted in them.\" 2211Mohammed Reza Shah had effective- ly replaced the bullets of his father with American-inspired chalks. Both were instruments for seden-tarisation and the second was even more pernicious than the first in undoing the very basis ofnomadism in Iran. 24 SHARING POWER20Expressed publicly to M. T. Farvar by Bahman-Beygi in the 1977 National Seminar on Nomadism, Kermanshah, western Iran. 21Bahman-Beygi expressed these words to M. T. Farvar in 1977 in the same Seminar.A STRUGGLE BETWEEN POLITICS AND CULTURE 25Two more events took place in these years and were extremely harmful to the life styles and liveli- hoods of the Qashqai nomads. The first was the exile of their chiefs, who took refuge in Germanyuntil after the Islamic revolution of 1979. This amounted to the virtual beheading of the tribes. Intheir place the Shah's security apparatus appointed colonels from the dreaded SAVAK, the secretpolice, who controlled every movement of the tribe and commanded their migrations. The other wasthe much heralded land reform laws, which included among other things the nationalisation of allnatural resources in Iran. According to these laws, forced through the handpicked parliament, allrangelands, which amounted to ninety percent of all usable land in the country and which had beentreated and managed under a common property regime throughout history, became henceforth stateproperty. Instead of dealing with rangelands as a collective responsibility and privilege, individualshad to apply for short term licenses for grazing and all customary rights and laws were ignored. Thisaction was tantamount to removing the base of survival for the nomadic tribes of Iran. As a matter of fact, even other national policies were designed without any consideration for the needs and capacities of pastoral societies, and had a powerful weakening effect on them. Animalproducts such as meat, skin, dairy products and even live sheep were imported from abroad for thebenefit of national merchants, undercutting the production systems of the pastoralists who had beenable to supply the needs of the country with much surplus for export to boot. With their chiefs exiled,the economic base seriously weakened and the minds of the young changed fundamentally, the oncepowerful tribes of Iran were firmly headed towards annihilation. One of the immediate consequenceswas that the integrity of the rangeland ecosystems, which they had so carefully maintained throughtime, began to erode. On a positive note, a number of groups, often based in universities, succeededin early 1970s in designing and testing a different kind of mobile services for pastoral nomads. Theseincluded veterinary services (veterinary assistants recruited from the tribes and trained, returned tothem to provide mobile epizootic and vaccination services) and mobile health services (health assis-tants, also called \"barefoot doctors\", recruited from the tribes and trained, returned to them to pro-vide primary health care and a referral service to clinics and hospitals). The 1979 Iranian revolution presented another chance for the nomadic tribes of Iran to exercise once again their freedom of movement. The Qashqai tribes took once again to migrate in their greatestglory. One should imagine the joy and sense of liberation of these people who were regaining theirsimple right to livelihoods. The Qashqai exiled chiefs had returned from Germany and were attempt-ing to get back their functions in their tribes. Having lived for nearly two decades in the west, theyhad adopted new ideas, and included democratic governance into their world view. They talkedabout human development, and environmental integrity of the rangelands. They were also concernedabout the social responsibility of tribal chiefs. One of them\u2014 the late Khosrow Qashqai\u2014 was eagerto introduce the concept of ecodevelopment into the Qashqai tribes. This same chief was electedMember of Parliament. To his dismay, when he attempted to take his seat in Parliament, someextremist elements prevented him from doing so. Shortly afterwards he was kidnapped, submitted tosummary justice and executed without the benefit of an appeal to the supreme leader, who wouldsurely have protected him. Under the new Islamic regime, the cultural intrusion continued via the same tribal schools men- tioned above, now run by the national Ministry of Education. This meant even less autonomy for thetribal educational system. At this time, issues of natural resources, especially rangelands, were dealtwith by the Forest and Rangeland Organisation (FARO) of the Ministry of Agriculture, which contin-ued the alienation of the nomadic tribes through the endorsement of the practice of rangeland own-ership by the state. 2222At that time, verses from the Holy Koran\u2014 originally dealing with the spoils of war ( infal)\u2014 were interpreted by none other than the very progressive Grand Ayatollah Taleqani as applying to all natural resources, making them state property. No one understood at the time this was 22This happened despite the fact that the late Imam Khomeini, in 1963, had led the rebellion against the land reform laws of the Shah, including the nationalisation of rangelands and other natural resources. 26 SHARING POWERspelling out a sure breakdown in rangeland management and the further alienation of the nomadic pastoralists from their rightful heritage. The government finally realized something to this effect in the1990s, but even then decided to privatise rangeland management rather than return it to its originalrightful owners. Rangelands were and still are given away by FARO for everything\u2014 from militarybases and oil refineries to urban development and speculative operators. One of the Governors-General of the province of Fars boasted in a public statement in 1991 that he had purposely caused the blocking and destruction of tribal migration routes in order to uproot nomadic pastoralism, whichhe considered a backward way of life. The same Governor admitted to playing a key role in the trap-ping and summary execution of Khosrow Qashqai, the popular tribal chief mentioned earlier. While the technical capacity of government institutions, including FARO, was progressively weak- ened as a result of attrition and ideological purges of highly qualified personnel, when the IranianGovernment finally realized the value of technical expertise, it was expertise of the wrong kind thatwas available. In the case of rangeland ecology and management, the old school promoted in Iranby the Utah State University\u2014 to whom the management of natural resources had been entrusted bythe Shah\u2014 became the dominant ideology despite its repeated failures to respond to the needs of theIranian ecology. The non-equilibrium ecosystem conditions that characterise most of Asian aridregions had not yet been understood by the relevant establishment of the country. Alien concepts ofcarrying capacity were applied, including for a major government project called \"Livestock andRangeland Equilibrium,\" imposed all over the country. The main purpose of this project was toreduce livestock on rangelands, and to eliminate many of the pastoral producers, obliging thenomads to settle permanently. The sedentarisation of nomads, in fact, became the main focus of theOrganisation for Pastoralists Affairs (OPA), which had originally been created in the office of thePrime Minister to support nomadic pastoralism. Another post-revolutionary institution, called \"Ruraland Pastoral Service Centres\", was later reduced to rural service centres only, and its job degenerated mainly into writing extravagant prescriptions for pesticides. At the time of this writing the Iranian legislation is still not suited to meet the need of the pastoral communities. The important provision for Local Councils has not been enacted for pastoral commu-nities, and a law in Parliament, which would allow for the creation of Tribal Councils, did not takeinto consideration the specificity of tribal nomadic societies and their traditional organisations. In theend, even this law was vetoed by the powerful Council of the Guardians that is charged with super-vising the Parliament. Hopefully, the Fourth National Development Plan has a chance to remedy thisill and to respond in a positive vein to the needs of the nomads, who still number some 1.5 millionsouls and who can still play an invaluable role as the guardians of the semi-arid ecosystems thatcover most of the country. Despite the most discouraging experience of the past century, there are new seeds of hope among pastoralists. For instance, a recent agreement between the Iranian Government and the Centre forSustainable Development, a national NGO, has made it possible for pastoral communities to startparticipatory planning sessions for sustainable livelihoods and rangeland conservation. This workbrings together supporting agencies at the national and international levels and holds some hope forreversing some past negative trends. It is also encouraging that a group of national legislators are nowinterested in supporting pastoral communities in their quest for cultural survival and sustainablelivelihoods. New models for the sustainable development of pastoral regions and communities areobviously needed and the Iranian NGO is promoting rangeland management based on concepts andpractices of non-equilibrium ecosystem and community-based sustainable livelihoods tailored to thecountry's specific characteristics. As part of the mentioned project, one Qashqai sub-tribe has organ-ised its own tribal council in March 2003 and hopes to register as a community-based organisation(CBO) endowed with a community investment fund.

It spans an area of 300 square kilometres and is sandwiched in between national parks estate land on the south andwest, the Mozambique border on the east and the Zambezi River, which forms a boundary withZambia, on the north. A meeting took place there, in February of 1998, between the Chapoto WardWildlife Committee and a few international visitors. The Wildlife Committee arises from the ward'sinclusion in Zimbabwe's Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources(CAMPFIRE) programme, a national programme that encourages rural development and sustainablenatural resource use through the devolution of management responsibility and access rights to \"pro-ducer communities\". 2244To date, the expansion of the programme has rested largely on the exploita- tion of high-value species through sport hunting, with concessions leased to commercial safari opera-tors. Although formally introduced in 1989, the programme did not achieve implementation momen-tum in Chapoto until 1992. By 1996 wildlife had become the largest collective economic enterpriseof the ward with revenues at household levels equalling those of cash cropping. A party of twotrustees and regional representatives of an international donor foundation constituted the visitors. The chair of the Wildlife Committee opened the meeting by outlining the background and history of the Programme in Chapoto. Being an astute politician he put the programme forward in its best light.For decades of colonialism the people of Chapoto had suffered government neglect, without theroads, schools and clinics, which the communities closer to the capital had received. Living in anagriculturally marginal environment they had had to eke out an existence by cultivation of riverinealluvium, supplementing their diet with foraging and hunting. Even hunting was however difficult,since government claimed the wildlife which raided their fields and gardens as its own. Local hunterswere subject to harassment and arrest by National Parks staff. Wildlife had become an unmitigatedliability for all, except for the few poachers who were adept enough to evade detection. With the coming of the CAMPFIRE programme things had changed. Wildlife became a collective asset, to be communally managed. Poaching dropped and wildlife populations increased, sinceindividual off-takes became a theft of communal property and the community made use of its ownknowledge and peer pressure mechanisms to suppress deviance. Revenues from the sale of wildlife 23This case-example has been provided by Marshall Murphree.

The sustain-able use of wildlife resources in Southern Africa provides a powerfully tellingexample.surplus is expected to be created, which will be used to help other sub-tribes jumpstart their ownprocess of endogenous development. A nomadic pastoralist model for a community conserved areaat the heart of their migratory route has also being elaborated by the sub-tribe currently leading theway and presented at the 2003 World Parks Congress in Durban (South Africa). All this does notmean that traditional nomadic pastoralism is continuing unchanged. Commercially acquired fodderis now part of the subsistence system of the herds and several habits of sedentary people havebecome widespread among the pastoralists. And yet, the diversification in the production system andthe newly acquired habits do not seem to have altered the main character of the tribes' livelihood\u2014herding as primary production, social solidarity, communal care for the pasture\u2014 nor their provenstrength, resilience and pride.28 SHARING POWERescalated annually and the community built a school, a clinic and a grinding mill fromthe proceeds. One of the foundation'strustees opened the question time. \"We arepleased,\" she said, \"to learn that you are get-ting large sums from your wildlife which hascontributed dramatically to your develop-ment. But what is the impact of this exploita-tion on the biodiversity of your area? Howdo you count your animals to ensure thatyou are not driving certain species to extinc-tion?\" After the interpreter attempted to translate the word \"biodiversity\" into the local lan-guage with some complex phrases, the chairrose to reply. With a smile he commented,\"We know that you people from overseaswant to count animals by aeroplane, andhave many papers with figures before ani-mals can be used. But I must be honest andtell you that we do not count each of ouranimals. Even if we had an aeroplane, wecould not count animals in the thick bushhere. But we know that wildlife populationshave increased because we see more ofthem and they are raiding our fields moreintensively than before.\" \"But,\" he contin-ued, \"you should know that a generalincrease in wildlife is not our main concern.Yes, we like to see more kudu and bushbuckaround, but they are not central for our man-agement objectives. What we are really con- cerned with are two species: elephant and buffalo. They are our focus, because it is these twospecies that produce high safari revenues. Since they are so important we monitor them closely.\"\"The way we monitor them,\" he said, \"is by watching trends. And to examine trends we look at tro-phy quality. Each trophy taken is carefully measured; for elephant it is tusk weight, for buffalo thehorns are sized by Rowland Ward measurements. These measurements are taken in each instanceby the safari operator, the National Parks staff and our own game scouts. Since 1992 we have keptthese records and over time can determine trends in trophy quality. If you want to see a paper withlots of figures,\" he added with a twinkle in his eye, \"we can show it to you.\" By this time the chair was full stride. \"Now,\" he said, \"if we see that trophy quality is improving we increase the quota slightly for the following year. But if we see that it is dropping, we decrease thequota since quality is a greater determinant of our safari revenues than quantity. We want to contin-ue to receive high wildlife revenues indefinitely, and limiting quotas is our investment in the future.In our last assessment,\" he went on, \"we saw that buffalo trophies were continuing to improve andso we increased the quota. However, we saw that tusk size of elephant trophies was declining andso we have cut the quota.\" A STRUGGLE BETWEEN POLITICS AND CULTURE 29\"What about generating income from your wildlife through photographic tourism?\" was the next question from the visitors. \"By all means,\" replied another committee member, \"but it is difficult toshow the tourists elephant and buffalo in our thick bush. However, we can show them rare birds, andvisitors are interested in the beauty and the fishing opportunities that they find on the Zambezi. Wehave already leased land on the river to two tourist operators and we are maintaining the riverinehabitat and restricting settlement patterns.\" A number of other questions were posed on issues likeproblem animal control, strategies in times of drought, compensation for crop depredation, control offishing and wood-cutting, the ivory trade and locally managed tourism. To each the community hada reply that showed insight and previous discussion. \"What are your other problems?\" was the final question. \"There are three main ones,\" was the reply. \"Firstly, this business of managing wildlife takes time and transport. We have to constantly meet withthe safari operator, the National Park staff and the District Council. Secondly, it is difficult to manageour money. We are not trained in book-keeping and there is no bank here.\" For the community, infact, the biggest problem was uncertainty about the future. \"We don't really know how long govern-ment will allow us to keep these animals and the revenues they generate. We don't know how longgovernment will allow us to lease sites on the Zambezi and keep the proceeds. Government knows,as we have learned, that these things are extremely valuable and government may take them back. Ifthat were to happen we would abandon our quotas and self-imposed restrictions and take what wecan without being caught.\" With this the meeting closed. The conversation did not cover all aspects of Chapoto's sustainable use programme. The Wildlife Committee's presentation did not reveal the internal divisions that exist within the community or theongoing disputes it has with the District Council, since these are not matters to be discussed with vis-itors. However, the dialogue clearly illustrates some elements of cultural dissonance between thelocal people and their visitors, including at least five main areas. The first of such areas is about values . The people of Chapoto were concerned with sustainable pro- ductivity. For rural farmers and pastoralists as they are, conservation is an investment (in direct oropportunity costs) for present and future value, the goal being the maintenance or enhancement oftheir livelihoods. The visitors were instead concerned with species preservation, \"biodiversity\" and\"ecosystem maintenance\" for aesthetic, recreational or scientific purposes. As a matter of fact, thereis nothing inherently incompatible in the two sets of values. Dissonance arises, however, when onestance is accorded privileged status, as it is at present for international valuations. This does notwork. Aside from their inherent merits, local perspectives have a powerful veto dimension. Unlessthey are accommodated, international values and goals will be subverted by local responses rangingfrom defiance to covert non-compliance. From an international perspective, conservation, sustain-able use and equity are distinct and separate issues, with distinct associated activities while local per-spectives roll these three into one interactive bundle. Programmatic interventions are unlikely towork if they are not responsive to this synthesis. The second area is proprietorship . The devolution of a direct authority over the use and benefit of land and resources has been the catalyst to mobilise action in Chapoto. It stimulated a sense ofresponsibility and launched the community into a new mode of management requiring skills in han-dling the exchange values of their natural resources. The conferment of proprietorship had, howev-er, been one of programme and not legal entitlement. It was therefore incomplete, lacking tenure orlong-term security of access. This insecurity led the people of Chapoto into gloomy prognosticationsof the future. Without proprietorship their incentives for conservation would falter and fail.Unfortunately, this clashes with the bureaucratic mind, disposed to the centralisation of authority,30 SHARING POWERagainst the technocratic mind, disposed to see devolution as the surrender of professional manage- ment to the vagaries of cost/ benefit decisions by unsophisticated peasants, and with the interests ofthe central political elite and their private sector allies. The answer lies neither in communityautarky nor state autocracy. It lies instead in a redefinition and acceptance of complementary andmutually supportive roles. Local organisation can assume the authority and responsibility necessaryto carry through local incentives. The state can take on a supra-local coordinative role with its arbi-trative, regulatory and extension functions. The third area of dissonance is science \u2014 what is it and how should it be used. International conser- vationism relies on high-tech quantitative modelling to monitor and predict ecological status. In theprocess, biological scientists gain a powerful clientele, while governments and agencies \"seek tofind a scientific algorithm to reduce subjective decision-taking and uncertainties\". Rural farmerssuch as those in Chapoto have a similar goal. Dealing with uncertainty is a continuing factor in theirlives and risk-aversion a pervasive feature of their farming strategies. When given the opportunity,they use a methodology of the highest scientific credentials: experimentation . Chapoto's monitoring of trophy trend is elegant in its simplicity, robust in its empiricism and striking in its tight applicationto management decisions. It is also pregnant with potential for the development of locally basedenvironmental science, which moves beyond issues of species off-take. Such science, flexible in itsfoci and dynamic in its analysis, is far more important than the static domain of \"indigenous techni-cal knowledge,\" the box to which we condescendingly assign local insight and experience. Peoplelike those at Chapoto have problems with the scientific environmental \"technicism\". It involves forthem a significant loss of control and can be applied to stop use, which their own science indicatesis viable. And they have a healthy scepticism of its ability to produce the predictive certainties thatare expected of it. (In this they have major allies amongst scientists concerned with evolutionarybiology, system approaches and adaptive management.) Most environmental regulations demandcertainty and when scientists are pressured to supply this non-existent commodity there is frustra-tion, poor communication and mixed messages in the media. One can also add that this pressure isa perverse incentive for the integrity of science itself, since it carries with it the temptation to assertas definitive that which is tentative. Fortunately, both conservation biology and local science tendnow to converge to acknowledge indeterminacy and emphasise experimentation and adaptation inNRM. Potential \"lack-of-fit\" between social and ecological topography is another area of dissonance. The institutional requirements of a local natural resource management regime such as Chapoto includesocial cohesion, locally sanctioned authority and co-operation, and compliance reliant primarily onpeer pressure. This implies a tightly knit interactive social unit spatially located to permit this.However, while social topography suggests \"small-scale\" regimes, ecological considerations tend tomandate \"large-scale\" regimes. This may arise from ecosystem needs or when key resources arewidely dispersed or mobile, as in the case of Chapoto's elephant and buffalo. Economic considera-tions may also dictate \"large-scale\" regimes where market factors require that several owners ofresource units manage and tender their resources collectively. There is no inherent reason whysocial and ecological topographies cannot be harmonised, although this requires context-specificinstitutional engineering through negotiation. Often this will involve nested systems of collectiveenterprise by owners of resource units. The units of management will have a built-in incentive tospread. Dissonance arises when larger ecosystem regimes are imposed rather than endogenous.Such impositions, often in the form of ecologically determined projects, concentrate on ecologicalsustainability at the cost of ignoring the institutional sustainability on which it depends. Projects and programmes are the principal, though not exclusive, contexts bringing together interna-A STRUGGLE BETWEEN POLITICS AND CULTURE 31Field example 1.5 Don EEmiliano's ffarm2255 The ethnic roots of the Ribere\u20aco people are heterogeneous in the extreme. Some of them are the heirs of the sixteenth and seventeenth century Spaniards and Indian river-people. Others originatedfrom inland Indians, Peruvian Creoles, and European adventurers, who were involved in exploita-tion of different types of natural rubber in the period 1880-1950. Others are a mix of recently accul-turated Indians, colonists coming from the upper course of the river, soldiers from other areas ofPeru who married local women, indigenous protestant missionaries, and town-dwellers escapingfrom the law. The Ribere\u20aco culture is a real melting pot of indigenous and exotic elements. The local language, for instance, is strongly influenced by Quechua (the Andean language spread in the Upper Amazon by Jesuits in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries). The social structure includes both Indian fea-tures (such as cousins' marriage) and Spanish-Peruvian elements (such as ritual compadrazgo ). Symbolic culture combines folk-Catholicism (or sometimes revivalist Protestantism), Amazonianshamanism, and elements of sixteenth and seventeenth century European magic, with a major inter-est in global media culture (all Ribere\u20aco households own a radio, and some own a colour TV). This trend of mixing and melting different cultural influences is especially evident in the Ribere\u20aco farming systems, which are based on a combination of subsistence and market-oriented agriculture, hunting and fishing, cattle raising, and agro-forestry activities. An example of how the complexecology of the Amazonian riverbanks is managed through such a diversified NRM strategy is provid-ed by the farm owned by Don Emiliano (in Barranco, Mara\u20acon River). 2266The demand for safari experiences\u2014 a phenomenon originating in countries and cultures very far from Chapoto, seems thus to have successfully integrated thelocal livelihood system of rural communities in Southern Africa. Technical innova-tions have also been integrated with relative success by indigenous and rural cul-tures in their traditional NRM system. This is especially true for rural cultures bornfrom an encounter between native people and foreign colonists, which is a wide-spread phenomenon in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Ribere\u20aco farmers of the Peruvian Amazons are an excellent example. 25This case study has been provided by Patrizio Warren. 26These observations were made by Patrizio Warren between 1982 and 1986.tional and local incentives for sustainable use. These contexts juxtapose two cultures of planning and implementation. The one is reductionist, bureaucratic, directive and contractual, operatingthrough the rigid time and budget frames of a \"project cycle.\" The other is incrementalist, person-alised, suasive and consensual, operating through experiment and adaptation set in indeterminatetime-frames. For various reasons governments and donor agencies typically operate in project cyclesfar more condensed in time than that required for the institutional learning which must take placebefore local regimes can harmonise their modes of implementation with those of external partners.Such institutional learning goes far beyond the impartation of knowledge and skills by externalagents. More fundamentally it is about experiential adaptation of roles and norms in new circum-stances within local social units themselves. Knowledge and skills required by individuals do notsuffice on their own; institutional learning is a collective process of adaptive interaction responsiveto external and internal change. It takes time. At whatever point in the learning curve we placeChapoto, we should bear in mind that their perspectives were the product of a nine year evolutionin status and experience. 32 SHARING POWERAs for any Ribere\u20aco household, the basis of Emiliano's household subsistence is the cultivation of plantains, manioc, and other tubers on never-flooded restinga lands. This activity is carried out with traditional slash and burn techniques of Indian origin, and according to the indigenous division oflabour by gender lines (with men in charge of clearing the fields and women responsible for theircultivation). The fields ( chacras ) are cultivated for two or three years and, when weeding becomes too hard, are left to lie fallow during 5 to 10 years (depending on restinga 's soil quality). These patch- es of secondary forest ( purma ) have always had a significant value for a household: they are a place where wild fruits, special materials, medicinal plants and narcotics can be collected. Following the indigenous livelihood strategy, Don Emiliano's household complements its starch-rich tuber and plantain diet with river proteins. In times of shallow waters, Don Emiliano and his sons gofishing in the river and surrounding lakes, using a technology in part of indigenous origin (canoe,paddle, spear), in part introduced by the Spaniards (hook, tarafa net) and in part modern (nylon line, outboard motor). According to a practice of Spanish origin, part of the catch is salted to secure pango (the Ribere\u20aco fish and plantain soup) for the time of the flood, when fishing becomes difficult and dangerous. Unlike some of his neighbours, however, Emiliano has been resistant to engaging in com-mercial fishing and is against dynamite fishing because of its negative environmental impact. Rather,inspired by an ancient Indian practice he learned from a folk-tale, he experiments with river turtlebreeding in a pond near his house. Hunting is a marginal practice in Emiliano's subsistence strategy, because of the scarcity of game in the surroundings of the farm. This is due to the overexploitation of edible mammals (such as wildpork, tapir and deer) in the last 50 years by soldiers from the neighbouring military camp. However,during the flooding season, at night, Emiliano's sons hunt the big rodents, which haunt chacras to eat tubers. To this end, the Ribere\u20aco gun-and-lamp hunting technique (based on instinct of rodents to stop cold when sharp lights are focussed on them in the dark) is used, as well as pit-and-stakes traps,which Emiliano has learned to build from the Indians. As in any other Ribere\u20aco household, Emiliano's family is engaged in income generating activities. The main business is supplying the military camp (and other customers) with beef and pork. To breed zebu cattle, the hill on the back of the house has been cleared from the forest and sown with gra- malote fodder grass, a species recommended in the area for its soil retention capability, despite its low nutritional content. Applying extension information heard on the radio, Emiliano decided toleave a patch of primary forest on top of the hill. To prevent erosion, provide shading to the cattle,and fulfil household timber and fruit needs, he also planted valuable cedar specimens and fruit treeson the slope. Made aware by the same source of the low nutritional value of his pasture, Emiliano isstriving to prevent his herd from increasing, by timely selling of calves. In contrast with such a modern approach to cattle breeding, pig breeding is managed according to the indigenous pattern. In order to prevent pigs from spoiling crops, animals are kept on a small restinga (island in the middle of the river) where they can run free in search of food. A child brings household garbage to the pigs every day. According to Don Emiliano, daily feeding by humans isessential to prevent the animals from becoming wild and unmanageable at the time when it becomesnecessary to catch them. Finally, Emiliano and his family engage in cash cropping. To this end, as many other Ribere\u20aco house- holds of the area, at every shallow water season they receive credit from the Agriculture Bank andsow rice on the fertile soil of river mud banks. This is a risky enterprise, because young rice is highlyexposed to parrots and insects, and, what is worse, nobody in the Amazons can really foresee whenthe floods will come. However, with good luck, significant gains can be made through this activity.A STRUGGLE BETWEEN POLITICS AND CULTURE 3311..33CCoonntteemmppoorraarryy iinnddiiggeennoouuss NNRRMM ssyysstteemmss aanndd ccoo-mmaannaaggeemmeenntt From the field examples illustrated above, a few lessons can be derived concerning the structure of NRM systems currently practised by indigenous andlocal communities and their relevance for sustainable development and conser-vation initiatives. The lesson here is that most NRM systems of contemporary indigenous and local communities are puzzles of old and new knowledge, practices, tools and valuesof different cultural origin. Building upon the characteristics of diverse politicaland economic contexts, the combination of indigenous and modern elements inthese NRM systems varies and leads to different outcomes. The indigenous sys-tem may be almost completely replaced by a variant of the agro-industrial mar-ket system promoted by the state (as in the Shuar case). Change in the indige-nous system could be only partial, but powerful enough to affect the communi-ty's capability to manage the local resources in a sustainable way (as in theSbahiya peasants' case) or apparently overpowering but unable to destroy theheart of the livelihood system, as in Iran. Eventually, an innovative and morecomplex NRM system can develop by combining indigenous and modern ele-ments (as for Chapoto's community and in Don Emiliano's farm and, to a certainextent also in Iran). Process and outcome variations on this theme are indeed as diverse as human cultures and communities on earth. But\u2014 local differences notwithstanding\u2014practically no NRM system observable in the field at the beginning of the 21st Emiliano believes that this is a \"crazy business, which is spoiling so many farmers.\" However, he allows his sons to engage in it, because, as he says, \"the trunk of our farm is solid enough to affordthe loss of some branches.\" Don Emiliano's story illustrates the complexity and sophistication of the Ribere\u20acos ' NRM system. It shows their diverse and specific uses of the Amazonian wetlands\u2014 the never flooded restingas , the rivers, the lake, the hills, the mud-banks\u2014 in accordance with seasons, subsistence needs, and mar-ket opportunities. It also shows how such diversification is promoted by the Ribere\u20aco cultural capaci- ty to combine in a new synthesis elements originating in a variety of cultural environments and his-torical experiences. Emiliano's farming system is indeed a mix of reminiscences of pre-ColombianAmazonian wetland society, old Spanish and European legacies, contemporary Indian influences,twentieth century technology and modern agricultural extension advice. Its success witnesses thecapability of contemporary Amazonian people to build an alternative to the development modelwhich national colonisation agencies and the global market are striving to impose on them in thename to be purely \"indigenous.\" On the contrary, NRM systems featured by contem-porary ethnic and rural communities are syncretic constructions , i.e.,more or less consolidated synthe- ses of knowledge and practices of different historicaland cultural origins, which previously might haveeven been considered incompatible. 2277As such, they represent attempts made by local people to adaptindigenous NRM systems to cope with new environ-mental conditions, market economy requirements,and tenure regulations imposed by the national soci-ety and the state. The merging of features from different cultural origins is not a unidirectional process. Elements of modernNRM systems are integrated into an indigenous back-ground and, at the same time, the indigenous back-ground contributes to shape the particular variant ofthe modern system that is actually implemented inthe area. For instance, the shifting horticulturalknowledge and practices of the Shuar (the only com-ponent of the indigenous NRM system still alive in the area) has substantially influenced the colonists' subsistence agriculture.Zaghouan soil and water management authorities are considering the opportu-nity of providing incentives to Sbahiya farmers to implement conservationworks on the basis of indigenous know-how. Diversified exploitation of multi-ple ecosystems and ecotypes, as experimented in Don Emiliano's farm, isincreasingly promoted among tropical forest farmers by rural developmentagencies and experts. The pragmatic approach to sustainable use of theChapoto community has now been studied and advocated by the WorldConservation Union's (IUCN) Sustainable Use Initiative and the pastoral prac-tices of nomadic communities are being re-discovered as a most effective andcareful way of managing rangelands in non-equilibrium ecosystems. 2288 As in any process of cultural change, the development of this syncretism is somehow chaotic and unsystematic. It mostly takes place through a trial anderror process, whereby new elements are adopted, old elements dismissed, andsystem structures re-arranged. At times, and especially when trial and error istransformed into a more or less conscious form of \"adaptive management\" 2299 this succeeds in identifying creative and effective solutions. Unfortunately, most contemporary indigenous NRM systems are not as well integrated, efficient orsustainable as the traditional ones. This is because most of them are in a phaseof transition in which much testing takes place, often unsuccessfully.Furthermore, the rapid evolution of the relationship between local communi-ties and the national society, new development and conservation policies,innovative technologies and the omnipresence of the global market, make thebuilding of combined NRM systems a tricky endeavour under ever-changingrules. In some ways, the development of NRM systems that uniquely combineelements from different origins is a worldwide laboratory in which communi-ties experiment with options for sustainable development. Everyone concerned 27The term \"syncretic\" is used in religious and philosophical contexts to signify the merging of rather opposite positions, at ti mes border- ing on AND CULTURE 35with sound environmental management\u2014 on matters of both policy and prac- tice\u2014 may learn from these experiences while, hopefully, positively contribut-ing to them. Understanding and supporting the efforts made by communities to experiment and combine old and new elements as part of their NRM systems is essentialfor programmes or projects willing to improve the use of natural resources in aparticipatory way. Such combined (syncretic) NRM systems share with partici-patory natural resource management both the basic objective ( i.e., improving the management of local natural resources according to people's needs, expec-tations and values) and methods (community driven processes, in which localactors play a major role in making decisions and taking action). A second key lesson to consider regards indigenous knowledge and know-how. Many \"modern\" natural resource managers and sustainable development prac-titioners are now well aware of their importance. Unfortunately, however, sev-eral of them focus their attention and appreciation on the traditional wisdom ofindigenous and peasant communities but neglect the new economic, politicaland environmental conditions in which indigenous knowledge and know-howexist today. As a result, the dynamics of change in indigenous NRM systemsare overlooked in pursuit of an unrealistic and anachronistic purity of values,understanding and practices. In fact, insistence on research on indigenous knowledge may lead far from the needs of the people. Shuar elders' knowledge of forest trees and plants is fasci-nating, but it is rather useless in a situation in which there is no more primaryforest in the surroundings of the settlements, and no forest exploitation. 3300For sure, however, resources and time could be effectively spent in appraising whatthe last two generations of Shuar (and colonists) have learned on range man-agement, agro-forestry and diversification of agricultural production.Furthermore, the \"traditional wisdom\" approach can lead to missing the struc-tural conditions needed to turn indigenous knowledge into actual NRM prac-tice. For instance, Sbahiya peasants' indigenous land husbandry cannot survivethe shortage of agricultural labour affecting the household economy- tacklingthis problem is essential to adapting indigenous know-how to the new condi-tions and to making the syncretism viable. On the other hand, if the traditionallivelihood system is resilient enough, it will withstand all sorts of blows, incor-porate change and maintain its unique essence and sense of identity, as in thecase of the Qashqai of Iran. The third key lesson, linked and in fact derived from the above two, is the pres- ent opportunity to engage a multiplicity of social actors in a dialogue and jointaction-research about natural resource management. Through it, a multiplicityof capacities and comparative advantages can be recognised, understood andhopefully harmonised and reconciled. Traditional knowledge and skills, in par-ticular, can be set to work within changed environmental, political and socialcontexts, including the presence of the new social actors which historicallyemerged in the NRM scene. The safest route begins with a thorough under-standing of the indigenous and traditional NRM systems, and only integratingmodern practices into them in a careful and reversible way, if absolutely neces-sary. Some science-based innovations do not stand the test of time, and long- 30This said, local knowledge should also be preserved for an unknown future, as the conditions of its usefulness may present them selves again. Losing such knowledge may be equivalent to losing entire up just confirming the wisdom of the traditional systems.3311 When the dialogue and action research are conducted with equity and integri- ty, however, they can produce concerted agreements and institutions capableof meeting the challenges of modernisation through the wise merging of fea-tures of different historical and cultural origins\u2014 what earlier we referred to as\"syncretism\". Such a process of dialogue and action-research\u2014 which we call\"co-management\"\u2014 is the very subject of this work. 31Cases in point are the nomadic lifestyle of Qashqai pastoralists-first denigrated and opposed and now re-evaluated (see case ex ample 1.3 in this chapter), and the prohibition of grazing from Keoladeo National Park (Rajastan), later found to be essential for th e birds habi- tat (see the discussion of freshwater wetlands in Chapter 3 of this volume). ACTORS, ENTITLEMENTS AND EQUITY 37 Chapter 2. ACTORS, ENTITLEMENTS AND EQUITY IN NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 22..11MMaannaaggeemmeenntt aaccttoorrss People have diverse perceptions of the same environment. A forest can be seen as an aggregate of trees waiting to be felled and sold, a place of rest and leisure, asource of food and firewood, the hiding nest of dangerous animals, the sacredhome of water-giving gods, a place providing safe haven from pursuing enemies,a hiding place for insurgents against a government, or the habitat of a rare sub-species of pangolins. These different perceptions correspond to different under-standings of the values, opportunities and risks that the same environment has tooffer. As a basic source of livelihood, the forest should be utilised and protected.As a place of leisure, it should be visited in the weekend in the company offriends. As an immobilised capital, it should be exploited. As a dangerous place, itshould be avoided or cleared out. As a sacred place, it should be worshipped andrespected. As a valuable ecological niche it should be enlisted as protected areaas soon as possible.... In a broad sense, everyone on Earth could recognise opportunities and risks in management of allnatural resources.11 Via the physical cycles of water, air and energy, the movements of living organisms and people and the expanding global exchanges of goods and informa-tion, powerful linkages are established among distant ecosystems and the humanand animal populations living therein. The most impressive example may be theenormous consumption of fossil fuels in the industrialised North, which is alteringthe chemical composition of the atmosphere and influencing the climate all overthe globe. As a result, nomadic pastoralists in Niger may find that drier seasonswill exacerbate their conflicts with sedentary peasants. Mozambicans may findthemselves hit by exceptional flooding. And Maldives islanders may even losetheir basic \"living ground\" because of the melting of Arctic ice. Thus, the resi-dents of Niger, Mozambique and the Maldives can indeed have legitimate con-cerns about the propensity of North Americans and Europeans for a high-energyconsumption lifestyle. In practice, however, most people and organisations are principally concerned with the status and management of a specific, and usually local , natural environ- ment. It may be the case of the territory in which they live and work, theresources that generate their sustenance and income, the land they own, have aright to use or a mandate to care for, or the territories to which they feel historical-ly and culturally tied. And yet, even for local environments, recognising environ-mental values, opportunities and risks is not a simple matter. Some people maynot be informed or aware of phenomena, activities and decisions affecting the ter-ritory or resources at stake. Others may lack the time, resources, self-confidenceand organisation to articulate their concerns and express them forcefully. In addi-tion, environmental interests may not be neatly defined (exceptions are privateproperty borders, and borders of an area defined in the mandate of an institution),or their definition, while clear and binding to some, may seem hazy to others(such as the three stones put on top of each other to set out the exclosures of thenomadic pastoralists in Iran and Yemen). Commonly, however, borders are recog-nised in a generic and geographically fuzzy way. For instance, down-stream com-munities may be broadly interested in soil conservation \"upstream\", fishermenmay be concerned with spawning grounds \"all along the coast\", and hotel ownersmay be interested in the preservation of the \"landscape\" that attracts tourists. What is more, individuals, groups and institutions do not usually recognise single values, opportunities and risks, but bundles of those for the same territory or resources at stake. This may generate all sorts of dilemmas. Local people may bewilling to preserve their unspoiled scenery (aesthetic value) but also need a new road and the jobs provided by factories (economic opportunity). A conservationorganisation may have a mandate to preserve a species habitat (ecological value) but also may recognise that, as a consequence, another interesting species may disappear from the territory (ecological risk). The local administration needstourist revenues (economic value) but also knows that the tourists will introduce cultural and health problems in the area (cultural and health risks). The very recognition of certain environmental values, opportunities and risks and not oth- ers is a cultural phenomenon at the core of a society's world-view and of thebody of knowledge, practices and technology that characterises its economy, poli-tics and lifestyle. And it depends on inputs and capabilities that may not be underthe control of the people concerned. The above complexities notwithstanding, we will assume here that for any specif- 1Lovelock, 1979.ACTORS, ENTITLEMENTS AND EQUITY 39ic territory or set of natural resources, some communities, organisations, groups and individuals will recognise some relevant values, opportunities and risks.Such communities, organisations, groups and individuals are the ones who, onceproperly organised, may effectively express their interests and concerns andbecome actively involved in management. The awareness of relevant opportuni-ties and risks ( i.e.,interests and concerns) and some form of organisation to express those vis-\u00e0-vis others are necessary preconditions for any social action in natural resource management. Murphree (1994) postulates such prerequisiteswhen he refers to the difference between individuals and groups, on the onehand, and \"institutional actors\" on the other: \" The concept of actor is a social construction rather than simply a synonym for individual. Nor is an institutional actor a synonym for group. An institutional actor is an entity organised for the interests of some group or set of goals. Groups and individuals are considered within the context of organised institutional arrange- ments. \" Thus, according to Murphree, the difference between an institutional actor and a non-specified individual or group is that the institutional actor is organised for an interest or purpose. It is in this sense that we will use the term \"institutional actor\"or \"relevant social actor\" in this work. In the current literature, another term\u2014stakeholder\u2014 is often employed to describe the same concept. We have purpose-fully chosen not to adopt such term in a prominent way in our analysis of co-management approaches. Although the term \"stakeholder\" is widely recognised, itis not accepted by all. Some recall that it derives from the times of land grabbingin North America, when ownership titles were distributed to people who woulddemarcate new lands with stakes. Stakeholders, then, were the individuals whoran with a stake in hand to cover as much land as possible within a given time. Aspre-existing rights and concerns of indigenous inhabitants were not respected inthose land appropriation processes, the term \"stakeholder\" carries a negative con-notation for some people, especially in non-western cultures. 22 Another term applied in the literature (especially in French) is the one of \"strategic groups\" understood as \"groups of social actors possessing the same interests withrespect to a given issue\". This concept is essentially empirical. The strategicgroups cannot bedefined a priori , even though some hypothe-ses may be madeabout how certainactors may react andbehave with respect toa given issue. In fact, itis often the case thatsome unforeseen fac-tors\u2014 such as a sys-tem of social and cul-tural ties, reciprocities,alliances, some politi-cal or personal rival-ries\u2014 reveal institutional actor in a given subject or event is a bearer of specific interests and concerns organised to express them and carry them forward. With reference to the management of natural resources, an \"interest\" refers to a recognised opportunity with potential origin in the natural resources or influence/ impact on them and a \"concern\" refers to arecognised risk also with potential origin in the natural resources or influence/ impact on the same. The term \"stakeholder\" is at times used in place of \"institutional actor\". In this volume we have chosen to do so only rarely ( e.g., when used by original authors), for reasons explained in the text. We will, howev- er, report here some conceptual definition from recent literature: \"Stakeholder is a term which, over the last few years, has come into common usage by most donor organ- isations; it was first used in business management theory and has since been widely adopted as a furtherrefinement of the user concept. It is an umbrella term, which covers all the people and organisations whohave a stake in, and may be affected by, an activity, a development programme or a situation, or whomay have an impact or influence on it. In some situations stakeholders may both \"be affected by the inter-vention and also have an impact on the intervention.\" (Hobley, 1996) \"... the various institutions, social groups and individuals who possess a direct, significant and specific stake in the protected area will be referred to as its 'stakeholders'.\" (Borrini-Feyerabend, 1996) \"In the context of Bank-supported activities, stakeholders are those affected by the outcome\u2014 negatively or positively\u2014 or those who can affect the outcome of a proposed intervention.\" (World Bank, 1996) Some authors include among \"stakeholders\" not only organised social actors, but also animals and plants (or wildlife in general) whose survival depends on the resources of a given area (Hobley, 1996, page 96).This approach is not taken here, as those animals and plants would still need some human advocate tofoster their interests in co-management processes. Which social actors are most likely to express interests and concerns in the man-agement of a given territory, area or set of natural resources? Checklist 2.1 lists atypology of possibly relevant social actors, including communities, organisations,groups and individuals. Among the listed actors, only some will be willing andinfluent than other \"objective\" conditions in determining motivations and posi-tions vis-\u00e0-vis NRM decisions.33For instance, in a village in Senegal the strategic groups identified a priori by the staff of a project included: the youth within a local cooperative; the youth outside of it; the adult population; the local elite; andthe outside actors (governmental agencies and NGOs). What was later revealed inpractice was that the key strategic groups were, in fact, only the lineage groupsthat had different access and tenure to specific landholdings. Another strategicgroup, the one of local women buyers of vegetables, became also apparent as time went by. 44In contrast, a project among the Qashqai nomads of Iran dealing with rangeland biodiversity and sustainable livelihoods simply asked the localpeople to identify their own internal structures and subdivisions. They identifiednomadic camps, clans and sub-tribes as institutional actors, and certainly not theexternally promoted cooperatives\u2014 the only local actors recognised by the cen-tral government. organisations, groups and individuals who live and work close to the resources, the ones who possess knowledge, capacities and aspirations that are relevantfor their management, and the ones who recognise in the area a unique cultural, religious or recre-ational value. (This is an ample category, including several sub-categories.) zNatural rresource uusers, including local and non-local, direct and indirect, organised and non-organ- ised, actual and potential users, as well as users for subsistence and income purposes. zNational aauthorities aand aagencieswith explicit mandate over the territory or resource sectors ( e.g., ministries or departments of forests, freshwater, fisheries, hunting, tourism, agriculture, protectedareas and, in some cases, the military). zSub-nnational aadministrative aauthorities( e.g., district or municipal councils) dealing with natural resources as part of their broader governance and development mandate. zNon-ggovernmental oorganisations aand rresearch iinstitutions(e.g., local, national or international bod- ies devoted to environment and/ or development objectives) which find the relevant territories andresources at the heart of their professional concerns. zBusinesses aand iindustrieslocal, national or international ( e.g., tourism operators, water users, inter- national corporations) which may significantly benefit from natural resources in the area. zNon-llocal aactors,national and international, indirectly affected by local environmental management practices ( e.g., absentee landlords, down-stream water users, environmental advocates or animal rights groups). zIndividual pprofessionalsemployed in environment and development projects and agencies dealing with the management of natural resources in the area. 5These categories are obviously not exclusive, and some institutional actors may belong to more than one category. 6Borrini-Feyerabend, 1996. 7Ostrom and Ahn, 2001.Institutional actors usually possess specific capacities ( e.g., knowledge, skills) and/ or comparative advantage ( e.g., proximity, mandate) for resource management, and are usually willing to invest specific resources ( e.g., time, money, and politi- cal authority) for it.66Among them, traditional groups and organisations ( e.g., a council of elders, a fisher folks society, or a peasant association) are particularlyvaluable. Traditional groups possess a tested structure and representation systemand generally enjoy a broad social recognition\u2014 what some commentators called social capital \u2014 to take on an effective role in natural resource management.77 Table 2.1 shows a list of relevant social actors for a specific National Park in India: eighteen major stakeholders, bearing different interests and concerns! Theanalysis of the relevant social actors was carried out by the staff of the govern-mental agency in charge of Park management and provides a telling example ofthe complexity of stakeholder differentiation.capable of investing their own time and resources, organising themselves, actingto get their interests and concerns socially recognised and taking on some NRMresponsibility.

Typically, they have long associations with nature and a deep under-standing of it. Often they have made significant contributions to the maintenanceof many of the earth's most fragile ecosystems, through their traditional sustain-able resource use practices and culture-based respect for nature 88. This argument has recently been forcefully brought to the fore,99counteracting years of theoretical and practical neglect of the rights, interests and capacities of local people vis-\u00e0-vis \"scientific\" management practices, agency decisions and national developmentschemes. Nonetheless, indigenous and local communities are not yet recognisedas full partners in mainstream environment or development initiatives. In the bestof cases, only their participation in activities identified by outside experts is recommended and has become an issue to tackle. Box 2.2 IInnddiiggeennoouuss ppeeoopplleess aanndd mmoobbiillee iinnddiiggeennoouuss ppeeoopplleess (adapted from ILO, 1989; and Dana Declaration, 2002) According to the ILO Convention no.169 (1989) indigenous peoples include: z tribal peoples in independent countries whose social, cultural, and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations; z peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the countrybelongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundariesand who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, culturaland political institutions. According to the same Convention, self-identification as indigenous or tribal shall be regarded as a fundamental criterion for determining the groups to which the provisions of the Convention apply.Among the criteria used by indigenous peoples to identify themselves as such are: their own historicalcontinuity with pre-colonial societies, the close relationship with the land and natural resources of theirown territory, their peculiar socio-political system, their own language, culture, values and beliefs. Ingeneral, they do not belong to the dominant sectors of a national society, they see themselves as different from it and prefer to relate with the international networks of indigenous peoples. The term mobile peoples ( i.e.,pastoralists, hunter-gatherer, sea nomads, shifting agriculturalists and other peoples with dynamic regular changing patterns of land and resource use) encompasses a subsetof indigenous peoples whose livelihoods depend on extensive common property use of naturalresources and whose mobility is both a management strategy for dealing with sustainable use and con-servation and a distinctive source of cultural identity. 8Beltr\u20acn, for et al. , 2004 (in press); regard to mobile communities: and local communities are social units that possess a strong, usually historical, relationship with a given territory and natural resources and areinvolved in the different but related aspects of local livelihoods. As this definitioncan apply to a range of sizes ( e.g., is a city a community? Is the sum of all people44 SHARING POWERinhabiting a given watershed a community?), one could further specify the term to describe people likely to have \"face-to-face\" encounters and/ or direct influencesin their daily life. In this sense, a rural village, a tribal group moving together in atranshumance path or the inhabitants of an urban quarter can be considered a\"community\", but not all the inhabitants of a district or town. A community usual-ly possesses some form of social organisation \u2014 often based on the need for the management of a particular resource or set of resources\u2014 and its members sharein varying degrees political, economic, social and cultural characteristics (in par-ticular language, behavioural norms, values, knowledge, skills and technologies)as well as ethnic and health features. It is not usual, however, for communities tobe recognised as micro-political bodies with administrative capacity. Important processes in community life regard social integration (cooperation to address common needs) and cultural continuity . Mechanisms that promote inte- gration in communities include patterns of reciprocity (like exchanges in labour, pooling resources, births, marriages and deaths, or economic trade) and redistrib- ution (sharing resource or economic surpluses among individuals or households). Mechanisms that promote continuity are the acculturation of children in society and a variety of local organisations with specific tasks, responsibilities and rules of functioning. Many local communities thus constitute important cultural units, andthe self-awareness, pride, sense of common identity and solidarity of their mem-bers often represent the last defence against massive socio-cultural change andincorporation by outside models and socio-economic forces. In the sense just described, a local community can indeed be regarded as oneactor for a variety of decisions concerning the territory and natural resources of its interest. And yet, forother decisions the communities may include a variety of dif-ferent opinions and be willing to have them all expressed. Asa matter of fact, communities are neither perfectly homoge-neous bodies nor are they culturally static. On the contrary,they continuously grapple with cultural change and social conflict (for instance clashing of needs and wants among people belonging to different families or ethnic sub-groups).Thus communities need to continuously manage a balancebetween the opposite forces of integration and conflict, conti-nuity and change. Their capacity to deal with contrastingsocio-cultural phenomena as well as their capacity to gain alivelihood from a given environment provides us with ameasure of their capacity to adapt and their social resilience . No community can be regarded as homogeneous regarding all interests and con- cerns on the management of the local environment and resources. On the con-trary, most of them, including traditional rural communities, are highly internallydifferentiated. Among the factors at the roots of different interests and concerns inenvironmental management within the same community are basic characteristicssuch as clan, ethnic group, gender, age, caste, social class, economic status, edu-cation, skills and profession. Ownership of land or other resources is a discrimina-tory factor but other factors are also important. These include place of residence,existence of cash savings in the household (or tent-hold), linkage to a particularparty or religious group, access to means and sources of external information( e.g., technical or bureaucratic), social standing, physical surplus or scarcity of labour, presence of salaried peo- ple in the household, and so on. One of the important innovations of the co-management approach is that it spot- lights different interests and concerns not only between communities and otheractors in society but within local communities as well. In this sense, one mayspeak of co-management when a community joins in management with externalactors, but also in entirely community-based and community-run initiatives, aslong as different interests and concerns within the community are recognised andrepresented. Table 2.2 provides a typology of interest groups within a local community vis-\u00e0- visthe management of a regional park in Liguria (Italy). The expressed interests and concerns, although only schematically reported, illustrate the spectrum ofinterests and concerns that can exist within a small and relatively homogeneouslocal community. Noticeably, the information provided in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 isavailable because someone took the initiative to organise a meeting to discuss themanagement of the local park. The individuals who participated in the meetingintroduced themselves as members of a given category (mostly related to resourceownership and profession) and spoke in the name of their categories. The spec-trum of community interests and concerns would likely look different if someoneelse would have called the meeting and/ or different social groups (for instancethe village elders or an association of women) would have participated andexpressed their interests and concerns. It is important to keep this in mind, asoften the \"interest groups\" get organised on the basis of conflicts Aveto Regional Park Committee Respect of law; sound ecological management Farmers Cropping, breeding & forest harvesting Cooperatives Fair income for members Hunters Good hunting and fishing grounds available Landowners Maintaining property rights Holders of Common Properties (\"beni frazionali\") Maintaining property rights, harvesting and graz- ing included Restaurants, hotels and shop owners Enhancing commerce and tourism Pro Loco (local association to promote tourism) Enhancing tourist flow and revenues; social ani-mation Students (primary & secondary school) Leisure and future involvement (jobs?)Among the many categories of potentially different interests in a local community, two may be relevant nearly everywhere: age groups and gender groups. As such,they deserve particular attention. Younger people represent the future and, at leaston that account, are supposed to have the most compelling interest in maintainingtheir environment viable and productive. There are, in fact, telling examples ofeffective involvement of adolescents and children in natural resource manage-ment. 1100But not all youngsters can be expected to be sensitive to environmental values or good managers of natural resources. In great part this is due to modernschool systems, which, following the colonial legacy, often succeeded, over andabove everything else, in alienating the young from their ancestral traditions andculture. Often, indeed, the \"stakes of future generations\" are most forcefully repre-sented by the traditional elders of a community. In Yemen, the traditional systemsof land and water management that assured for millennia the prosperity of thecountry are now rapidly falling in disarray. Most youth and adult men leave therural villages in search of easy and lucrative jobs in the cities. The ones leftbehind to care for the land and preserve the ancient management systems, whenthey still succeed in doing so, are only the elderly and the women. This is thecase in many so called developing societies. With the possible exception of usually temporary living and working arrange- ments ( e.g., labour camps, or villages abandoned by migrant workers), human societies always include men and women, and their interests in natural resourcesand roles in managing them are usually different. For instance, a survey of forestproduct uses was carried out in villages surrounding Mount Elgon National Park,in Uganda. 1111It was found that women were mostly interested in being able to gather firewood, vegetables, mushrooms, medicinal plants and bamboo shootsfrom the park's territory, while the men were keener on grazing permissions, andon collecting less frequently extracted resources, such as materials for house construction and maintenance. In addition, the men wished to gather bambooshoots for sale, rather than for household consumption, as stated by the women. For the communities living in the surroundings of Mount Elgon decisions that are pleasing or acceptable to the men may then be detrimental or unacceptable to thewomen, and vice-versa. A programme to protect wildlife may bring revenue tomen (such as jobs as park guards) but more abundant wildlife may be only a costto women, because of crop damage or increased danger in daily tasks. Forest pro-tection may favour the commercial farmers who use water to irrigate their fields,but disfavour the women and children who have to walk much further to find fod-der, poles or firewood. If only men or only women are allowed to negotiateresource management agreements for the whole community, the other gendergroup may find its interests poorly represented, if not outright neglected. It maythus be inequitable and unwise to accept the voice of one gender group as repre-senting a whole community: both men and women should organise and participate in management. Madhu Sarin, a most effective advocate of gender consideration in stakeholder analysis, 1122adds a further dimension to this point, and warns against generalisa- tions and gender stereotypes. She stresses combinations of social characteristics (e.g., gender and caste, gender and socio-economic class) as main determinants of interests and concerns in resource management, and she recommends remainingopen to surprises: 46 SHARING and responsibilities [of] women and men in Haryana's Shiwalik belt... vary dramatically within and between villages in terms of occupa- tional, caste, economic and cultural characteristics.... Jat women do not go to the forest at all. While some Gujjar village women collect fodder from forest, in the majority of villages they do not do so. [Among the Banjaras] men harvest the grass from the forest [but] processing into ropes is done by women. In Bar Godam, only the men collect bamboo from the forest while in another Banjhida village, Kalka... the collection of bamboo from the forest was done by the women. The Lavana women of main Nada villages collect heavy headloads of both grass and tree leaf fodder for several months of the year.... [But] the stereotyped image of rural women carrying heavy head loads of firewood is extremely rare in Haryana's Shiwalik belt. Practically none of the women in the area's diverse communities are responsible for domestic firewood collection. Occasionally they do pick fallen twigs and branches while collecting fodder, but firewood collection in the belt is essentially a male task, done by either male children, adults seen that the interests and concerns of different social actors in natural resource management can originate from a variety of roots. Some may live inclose geographic proximity to the resources, or their ancestors may have beenassociated with them from times immemorial. Others may own the resources,either legally or by custom, or may have acquired some use rights on them. Someorganisations may have been assigned a management mandate by the govern-ment. Some households may be totally dependent on natural resources for liveli-hood or income. And some individuals or groups may simply possess uniqueknowledge and skills applicable to the local environment. Such different interestsand concerns, which can well coexist for the same territory or body of resources,may compel different social actors towards contrasting management options.Whose opinions should count? Who should decide? The above questions are fundamental in co-management processes, and no single answers are appropriate or possible. Always, however, it is advisable to under-stand the \"playing field\" as thoroughly as possible. This involves an analysis of therelevant social actors (organised and non-organised), their mutual relationships,the context in which they live, their management claims and the justifications\u2014foundations, motivations, historical roots\u2014 they put forth for them. Who are thesocial actors willing and organised to take part in management (the institutionalactors)? What are their claims? How do they justify those claims? Can their differ-ent justifications be compared and weighted vis-\u00e0-vis one another? In the analysis mentioned above\u2014 at times referred to as \"stakeholder analysis\"48 SHARING POWERin current literature\u2014 we can utilise the concept of \"entitlement\" to great advantage. We understand here as an entitlement to manage a territory or set ofnatural resources a socially recognised (legitimate) claim to participate in one orseveral of its relevant management activities. Entitlements do not usually refer toexclusive or extreme powers (all or nothing). Rather, they cover some specificactivities, such as using part or all of those resources, deriving indirect benefitsfrom them, taking responsibilities on related tasks or speaking up and negotiat-ing on management decisions. For instance, an entitlement to manage a given territory could be a broadlyrecognised claim to speakup and negotiate with othersin relevant decision-makingprocesses. An entitlement tomanage firewood and fodderfrom the local forest may berecognised as the right of ahousehold to gather enoughdry and green material towarm their home, cook andfeed their animals.Gathering more than that,for instance gathering fire-wood for the market, wouldbe seen as going beyondtheir entitlement, and wouldhave to be negotiated. In the working definition used in this volume, an entitlement does not need to be legally codified, and it is more a statement of facts (\"what is\") than a state-ment of norms (\"what should be\"). It can in effect be understood as the endresult of a combination of determinants including both accepted normative val-ues (see Checklist 2.2) and differentials of power (see Checklist 2.3). As such, itis a dynamic social construct that finds its meaning only within the social con-text that created it. Different social actors are not all equally entitled to manage resources. On the contrary, some have most of the relevant decisions at their fingertips and othershave almost none. In general, a mix of visible and hidden factors combines togenerate a given distribution of the benefits and costs of management. In somecases, an open debate can take place on those matters and an adjustment of therespective positions and influences can be agreed upon. In others, poorly recog-nised social actors struggle for years to enhance their own measure of controlover natural resources. Still in others, even attempting to put forth some interestsand concerns may be a dangerous activity. A re-arrangement of the entitlementsof different social actors can even be promoted and supported from outside therelevant context ( e.g., by some conservation and development initiatives), but it is only within the local context that a new balance of entitlements must beachieved rreessoouurrccee mmaannaaggeemmeenntt An entitlementto manage a territory set of natural resources is a ssocially rrecognised cclaim to partici- pate in one or several management activities, such as planning, advising, taking decisions, implement-ing plans, appropriating benefits (including using resources), assuming responsibilities, monitoring andevaluating results, etc. An entitlement is a formal or informal title tto ddo, a dynamic social construct that finds its full meaning only within the social context that created it. Sometimes it is codified by the legal system, but often itis not. It reflects facts (\"what is\") rather than norms only (\"what should be\"). It usually results from acombination of social determinants that include both accepted normative values and differentials ofpower. And it is an evolving social phenomenon, more akin to a process than to a fixed state of affairs. The concept of entitlement owes a lot to the seminal work of Amartya Sen, for whom 13\"the word enti- tlement does not refer to people's rights in a normative sense\u2014 what people should have\u2014 but to the range of possibilities that people can have.\" Thus, entitlements are \" the set of alternative commodity bundles that a person can command in society using the totality of rights and opportunities that he or she faces... based on processes such as production, own labour, trade, inheritance or transfer. \" In the words of Leach et al. (1997): \" An extended entitlement approach sees entitlements as the outcome of negotiations among social actors, involving power relationships and debates over meaning rather than simply the result of fixed moral rules encoded in law .\" Leach et al. (1997) provide a further analysis of the concept: \" Environmental entitlements are the alter- native sets of utilities derived from environmental goods and services over which social actors have legitimate, effective command and which are instruments in achieving well being .\" Such entitlements \"...enhance peoples' capabilities, which are what people can do or be with their entitlements. For example, command over fuel resources derived from rights over trees gives warmth or the ability to cook, and so contributes to well being .\" Also: \" Entitlements are what social actors actually get in prac- tice.... By \"legitimate\" we refer not only to command sanctioned by a statutory system but also to command sanctioned by customary rights of access, use or control or other social norm. \" In the words of de Graay Fortman (1997): \" Entitlement is the possibility to make legitimate claims, i.e., claims based on rights. It is a function of both law and power. Power means opportunity, actual com- mand. Law legitimises and hence protects in case of dispute.... People continue to try to improve their entitlement positions. Hence, more than a given state of affairs, entitlement is... a process in society .\" 13Quotes of A. Sen (1984) from Leach et al. , 1997.As entitlements are social constructs, we can attempt to understand their social roots and justifications. To begin with, there exist a variety of grounds for entitle-ments recognised as valid and legitimate on the basis of accepted normative val-ues in different societies (see Checklist 2.2). For any given society, such validityand legitimacy may be acknowledged in a more or less explicit way. For instance,they could refer to a body of written law, but also to customary law or to the basictenets of social life. The latter may include the right to life and the other basichuman rights of the United Nations (UN) Charter but also human solidarity,democracy, social equity, sustainability of the environment, or obedience to a cul-tural or religious credo. Some specific principles may be upheld by the largemajority of a society, and thus become a sort of social norm. These may include\"respect of law and order\", pragmatism, adherence to \"scientific principles\", liber-alism, respect of free market and private property, basic fair play, affirmativeaction, patriotism, effectiveness and efficiency in management, and so to land or resources ( e.g., property rights, usufruct rights) zcustomarily recognised rights to land or resources ( e.g., use rights, communal property, ancestral domains of indigenous peoples) zspecific mandate by the state ( e.g., statutory obligation of a given agency or governmental body) zproximity to the resources ( e.g., the residents of the local community) zdirect dependence for subsistence and survival ( e.g., food, medicine, communication) zdirect dependence for basic economic resources zhistorical, cultural and spiritual relations with the natural resources at stake ( e.g., in the case of indigenous peoples) zcontinuity of relationship ( e.g., local communities and long-time resource users versus recently arrived immigrants, tourists, hunters from other areas) zsocial equity (fairness) in access to resources and distribution of benefits from their use; znumber of people bringing forth the same interests and concerns zunique knowledge and skills for the management of the resources at stake zlosses and damage incurred in the management process zdegree of commitment, effort and resources invested in natural resource management zactual or potential impact of the activities of the social actor on the resource base zgeneral recognition of the value of the perspective/ position ( e.g., \"scientific validation\", \"fitting the the \"precautionary principle\", etc.) zcompatibility with the country's policies and body of law ( e.g., a Freedom of Information Act, the special rights of indigenous peoples) zcompatibility with international conventions and agreements ( e.g., the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Ramsar Convention, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification). In all, different \"grounds\", differently acknowledged and respected by differentcultures, can be upheld and used by social actors as a justification for their claims to participate in managing natural resources. For instance, an indigenous commu-nity may claim a role in managing a territory within a state-controlled protectedACTORS, ENTITLEMENTS AND EQUITY 51area on the basis of their customary rights. A local business may claim a right to use certain resources as in so doing it is providing jobs for local people. A govern-mental agency may impose some rule of access to a territory for the sake ofnational security. But this is not the whole story. In many societies, the emergence of specific environmental entitlements has little to do with an explicit social consensus on claims and values, and more to do withthe exercise of coercive physical power, power of position, economic power,household and group power, etc. (see Checklist 2.3). As some have put it: 1144\"The history of environmental management systems shows that those are more a reflec-tion of dominant socio-economic thinking than of the level of ecosystem knowl-edge.\" The social actors who can exercise various types of power, do so to over-come, distort or impose upon more legitimate claims. At times, however, one formor another of power is also utilised to back up a socially legitimate claim. Forinstance, coercive power may be necessary to prevent some people from huntingwildlife, even though the hunting ban may be fully inscribed in a country's environmental legislation. Or personal charismatic power may be necessary toadvance the claims of an ethnic minority demanding a more equitable distributionof water rights within a 1997) zpower of position (having authority, being in a position to make or influence decisions) zpower of knowledge (having information unavailable to others) zpersonal power (being personally forceful, persuasive) zhousehold power (being from a well-connected family) zgroup power (being a member of an ethnic, religious or other type of group that has a dominant social position or, for example, being male in male-dominated society) zeconomic power (commanding financial and other economic resources in overwhelming amount with respect to the resources of others) zpolitical power (having a powerful supportive constituency or access to political leadership) zlegal power (having strong expert legal council, or privileged access to courts) zcoercive physical power (having police or military backing or weaponry) 14Weber and Bailly , 1993. On this, see also the illuminating article by Ram\u20acrez (2001). 15Scott, 1985.Another important kind of power\u2014 the power of passive non-compliance, subtle sabotage, evasion and deception\u2014 has been the route of escape for many of thedisenfranchised (dis-entitled) throughout history. 1155At times, this has allowed them to survive and gather more environmental benefits than the established system ofpower would have allowed (the environmental impact of this type of behaviour isstill in need of thorough investigation). Whether today it is advisable for many under-privileged to continue on the route52 SHARING POWER16Prabhu Pradip, personal communication, 2002. 17One example among many is recounted in Varela, 2003. 18Again, one example among many is illustrated in 2000. 19Borrini-Feyerabend, 1997. 20Murphree, 1994.22..33EEqquuiittyy iinn mmaannaaggiinngg nnaattuurraall rreessoouurrcceess In the context of multiple social actors with conflicting interests and concerns or competing entitlements on the same territory or set of natural resources, is there away (or are there many ways) of pursuing equitable management arrangements? One fairly obvious first consideration brings to the fore the essential distinctionbetween equity and equality. Certainly not all social actors deserve the same enti-tlements to natural resources. We are far from the simple democratic rule of \"oneperson, one vote\", as the interests and concerns of different social actors withrespect to the same resources can be enormously different in both quantity andquality. But who deserves a privileged position? Who should be considered a \"pri- mary stakeholder\", and thus a rightful decision-maker versus an associate, an advisor, or simply someone to be kept informed about the decisions of others? For some authors, one or more roots or grounds for environmental entitlements appear much more fundamental than others. Marshall Murphree, for instance,stresses that there is one major and most important distinctive characteristicamong social actors with a claim on natural resources, and this is the distinctionbetween local and non-local actors: 2200 \"The danger is that this perspective [stakeholder analysis] can easily transform interests into a conceptual collective proprietorship by a vast and amorphous of passive non-compliance or attempt \"developing their own entitlements\" in a transparent and open struggle is still a matter of debate. In some societies characterised by large power disparities, the recent development of democraticsystems and the state of law allowed a number of social movements, unions, consumer and minority groups to adopt a transparent and direct strategy of confrontation, sometimes even in a overtly legal manner. For example, a recentstruggle in India, where the legal system has always favoured the literate gentry,led to the recognition by the Supreme Court of the right of a community elder toprovide oral testimony in matters of customary law. Other societies, however, cannot yet provide the conditions that would make a transparent and directdebate safer and more convenient than a hidden search for private advantages. Infact, even in relation to the above example, the experience of many Indian com-munity activists working on land rights issues shows they are constantly exposedto physical danger and repression. 1166This is by no mean an isolated case, as activists attempting to improve the NRM conditions of their communities are routinely singled out for violent repression 1177and non infrequently murdered.1188 This represents a most serious obstacle to the promotion and spreading of partner- ships in EQUITY 53circle of stakeholders. Those stakeholders who have invested most in professional expertise and monetary capital form the board of directors. But this accounting procedure is false. Communities' investment in their environments\u2014 their land, their resources, their labour, their local environmental knowledge, their manageri- al presence, and their stake in the future... is far higher than that of all external actors put together.... Community interests, responsibility and authority should be paramount.\" Consequently, Murphree organises social actors into three categories (Table 2.3),according to their range of action and institutional affiliation, clearly distinguish-ing between local and non-local institutional actors (governmental and non-gov- ernmental) and stressing that the former should have a pre-eminent position inmanagement decisions. Table 2.3 CCaatteeggoorriieess ooff iinnssttiittuuttiioonnaall aaccttoorrss(from Murphree, 1994) Community institutional aactors\"Responsive to local relational dynamics, accountable to collective community interests, and able to articulate views and positions effectively with external insti-tutional actors.\" Government institutional aactors\"State institutional actors derive much of their strength from their status as \"gate- keepers\": coercively backed authorities that determine what communities canand cannot do. They also derive strength from their ability to control the flow offiscal and other resources from the centre to the periphery. Rarely do flows tocommunities offset what has been extracted from them. Finally, state agencies actas gatekeepers for donor grants and aid projects.\" Non-GGovernmental institutional aactors\"...focus on specific issues or problems. NGOs arise in response to perceived needs and their raison d'\u00eatre falls away when the need (or the perception of it) changes. They can mobilise financial and personal resources comparativelyquickly and efficiently. They have the money, personnel, and rapid-responsecapacity for programmes and projects, while national governments claim sover-eignty and gate-keeping authority.\" 21Elinor Ostrom, personal communication, 1998. See also Ostrom and Walker, 1997. 22For a given set of natural resources, providers and appropriators can mix, coincide or remain neatly separate. The distinction between local and non-local actors is not the only one possible. Elinor Ostrom offers another demarcation criterion between resource \"appropria-tors\" and resource \"providers\". The appropriators are the ones who simply harvestor pull out resource units. The providers are instead engaged in the process ofcreating, maintaining, or restoring a resource. Fishermen are usually appropriatorsbut become engaged in provision when they change the structure of the seabedin order to improve the habitat for nesting. Irrigators are engaged in provisionwhen they construct or maintain a canal. Many self-governed systems of commonproperty resources provide their own rules as a result of extensive discussion, bar- gaining, and negotiation over what these rules should be, and only those rulesensure the long-term sustainability of the resource. 2211Obviously, the providers have stronger grounds to claim resource entitlements than pure appropriatorsdo. 2222 A similar but not identical distinction is made by Gorman (1995) between pri- mary and secondary users of coastal resources in Tanga (Tanzania). In Table 2.4,...... pprroovviiddeerrss...... 54 SHARING POWERprimary users are defined as the ones who directly depend on the resources for their livelihood, either in situ or by harvesting.

For Farvar (1989) the mostimportant characteristic of local communities is that they have evolved with thenatural resources, and have developed rich and detailed management systemsthat have stood the test of time. A variety of intruders in the community space (colonial powers and other foreign invaders, the national state and governmentagencies, missionaries of various denominations, traders and business, nationaland international corporations, donors and developers of all venues) clamour forattention and pretend to be considered rightful stakeholders. The solutions to thelocal problems imported by these outsiders have generally not improved the man-agement systems devised by local communities and have at times even destroyedwhatever existed and replaced it with tragically ineffective open access regimes.The local communities may or may not wish to accept the claims and/ or enterinto partnership relationships with external actors in a variety of syncretic naturalresource management systems adapted to the new environmental, social and eco-nomic conditions (see Chapter 1). The local communities, however, shouldalways maintain a position of predominance and control vis-\u00e0-vis others. We may agree with Murphree, Ostrom, Gorman or Farvar on a crucial distinction among key relevant social actors on the basis of locality, productive efforts,dependency for livelihood or belonging to an age-old resident or mobile commu-nity. We may pick an entirely different criterion, whether or not listed among theones in Checklist 2.2. Or we may remark that many important criteria\u2014 such aslocality, productive efforts or dependency for livelihood\u2014 tend to converge onthe same social actors. In a typical situation, a complex patchwork of claims(often several claims for each relevant actor) interplay with important power dif-ferentials within a context of relatively limited opportunities and resources. In allcases, having appreciated a plurality of relevant actors and their related bundlesof entitlements and claims\u2014 we can ask ourselves a crucial question: in a given,specific and usually complex context, what does \"striving for equity\" mean? Howcould the system be rendered possible? The following statements offersome initial reflections: zStriving for equity in natural resource management means helping the under- privileged to \"develop their own entitlements\" 2233. zStriving for equity in natural resource management means recognising entitlements rooted in valid and legitimate grounds (as defined by the relevantsociety) rather than entitlements rooted in the exercise of one or the other formof power. zStriving for equity in natural resource management means promoting a fair negotiation of functions, benefits and responsibilities among entitled socialactors. To explore the practical implications of the above we may examine a generic (and by necessity fairly idealised) process by which social actors empower themselvesas entitled and responsible resource managers (see Figure 2.1). At every step ofthat process we will ask ourselves what concrete conditions and inputs may benecessary to enhance equity. (Figure 2.1 is indeed an \"idealised\" sketch, as reallife processes are generally more chaotic, with steps back and forth in place of alinear and smooth progression.) ACTORS, ENTITLEMENTS of the management benefits and responsibilities amongst themselves; contributeknowledge, skills and financial resources toresource management; are held accountable fortheir agreed responsibilities; learn by doing inmanagement tasks Negotiating agreements among several entitledactors and set up organisations, rules and sys-tems to enforce the rules, to share the naturalresource benefits according to their respectiveentitlements and capabilities Recognition/ negotiation by society of the inter-ests and concerns of the institutional actors as\"entitlements\" (customary and legal rightsincluded) Recognition of the values, opportunities and risksassociated with land and natural resources; self-organisation to express those as own interests and concernsResponsible actors Empowered actors Entitled actors Relevant actors Potential actors ACTORS, ENTITLEMENTS AND EQUITY 57We propose that the first step in the process is for social actors to recognise some specific opportunities and risks in a relevant territory or set of natural resources. Opportunities may include all kinds of feasible or profitable utilisation of naturalresources, ranging from shifting cultivation over a forested region to indigenousnomadic pastoralism in rangelands; from harvesting and channelling water for irri-gation to covering the land with cement to enlarge a landing strip; from gatheringmedicinal plants and other natural products to pasturing animals in rangelands,and from recreation by spending a few days inwilderness to setting up a habitat preservation area.Risks may include all kinds of damages that maycome from the environment\u2014 from contractingmalaria in the surroundings of a tropical wetland tohaving agricultural plots destroyed by flooding;from losing a harvest because of pests to beingexposed to attacks by wild animals in the sur-rounding of a protected area. Risks may alsoinclude all sorts of negative impacts the environ-ment may suffer as a result of human activities. Many environmental opportunities and risks are well know by people and acted upon on a dailybasis. Others, however, are not known at all, possi-bly because of lack of specific information orawareness of conditions and consequences. A sec-ond equity concern is thus about assuring that the relevant information is available to everyone potentially concerned. If some social actors are notsufficiently informed and aware about the resourcemanagement issues, there is little they can con-tribute or do about them. Once individuals, groups and organisations recog- nise for themselves some relevant environmentalopportunities and risks, they need to articulate and express those as their own interests and concerns. Thus, a head of household in rural Burkina Fasoplanning to open up new land to agriculture willexpress his intention to the local Chef de Terre , and ask for the customary permis- sion. An environment NGO in the United States of America (USA) will call for ameeting of its members, discuss the priority issues among a number of potentialtopics, and then begin a letter campaign, organise a demonstration, lobby politi-cians, or do whatever else is appropriate to be heard and obtain results. A nation-al environmental protection agency will set up an investigation on a topic of con-cern and then develop, publicise and enforce rules on the matter on the basis ofthe obtained results. A Council of Elders in a nomadic pastoral community in Iranwill meet to assess the carrying capacity of their summering and winteringgrounds before the season of migration and to take decisions on migratory routesfor their flocks. As we have already argued, communities, organisations and indi-viduals become \"institutional actors\" by expressing their interests and concernsand organising for action. The latter point is particularly important, as social actorsmay be powerless simply because they are not sufficiently 1996) Among the more complex aspects of the forest protection process is the definition through inter-group negotiations of the \"social units of organisation\" and of the specific boundaries of the forest area to protect. Due to the scattered settlement pattern of tribal and semi-tribal communities, most villages nearthe forests do not have compact settlements. Instead, they consist of individual houses scattered next toagricultural landholdings. Most villages have a number of falias (hamlets) named after the particular sub-caste or tribe residing in it. These are not easily identifiable as physical units as they areessentially social units. In addition, the boundaries of the administrative \"revenue village\" ( gram panchayat) do not necessarily overlap with the boundaries of the social units. There is also considerable variation in the amount of forestland within the boundaries of different revenue villages, with little correlation between a village's population and the forest area within its boundaries, despite the fact thatthe majority of the population continues to have similar levels of dependence on forest produce. In all,physical proximity, extent of dependence and social relations, rather than formal \"revenue village\"boundaries, have determined which people use which forest area, as well as the composition of the forest protection groups. The process of organising with others to bring forward one's own interests andconcerns requires time, financial resources and human skills that may not bereadily available, especially among the underprivileged social actors who mayneed them the most. A poor, single head of household may be a careful naturalresource manager, possess a wealth of knowledge and skills and have solid cus-tomary rights over a given set of natural resources. Yet she may have little sparetime to take part in meetings, no transport facilities to travel to a gatheringplace, no literacy to check on background information and little self-confidenceto speak in public. Traditional and long-standing local bodies of various kinds offer important opportunities for local people to be represented vis-\u00e0-vis external actors inter-In the above, equity would require that social actors are free to express theirviews and opinions, as well as free to gather and organise to further their viewsand interests. Both of these requirements are far from trivial in many countriestoday. In fact, assembling and organising\u2014 a fundamental human right in the UNCharter\u2014 can still be treated as a crime. When organising is politically feasible, itmay still be difficult because of legal constraints (such as complex procedures, orsimple lack of a legally-recognised status for communities and local associationsof resource users). Finally, the process of organising may be challenging becauseof a more prosaic but no less impeding lack of time, financial resources or humanskills. Depending on the context in which the interests and concerns need to be heard, social actors may require more or less extensive preparatory work before beingable to effectively convey their claims. Sometimes this includes establishing one'sown legal identity (as an accepted association or organisation gathering a constituency that shares some basic NRM interests and concerns, and is willing toact (see Box 2.4). Nearly always, however, this involves discussions and agree-ments on priorities, objectives and strategy. It may include establishing a represen-tation system (see Box 2.5), joining an existing organisation or even establishing anew one (with membership rules, etc.).ACTORS, ENTITLEMENTS AND EQUITY 59ested in the management of the same territory or set of resources. Today, howev- er, many such local bodies are losing rather than acquiring importance. It is anunfortunate development of recent history that many communities that did pos-sess traditional institutions for resource management have seen them devaluedand weakened by modern state policies that do not recognise them, learn fromthem, nor assign to them any meaningful role. 2244In the words of Baland and Platteau,2255\"...state authorities have an interest in tightly controlling all signifi- cant attempts by local communities at organizing themselves, particularly so if these attempts result in the development of large-scale grassroots movements or networks or in the assertion of claims for more authority.\" In some cases, effec- tive traditional systems of resource management exist and could play a mostimportant role for conservation and development, but their recognition by out-siders may still be limited. 2266In other cases, the traditional organisations exist but are unable or unwilling to represent the variety of interests and concerns of theircommunities and can be corrupted by outside forces. 2277 Box 2.5 FFoorrmmss ooff rreepprreesseennttaattiioonn (adapted from Borrini, 1994) zself-rrepresentation(face-to-face; people personally express their opinions, discuss, vote, work, offer a material contribution, receive a benefit, etc.; people represent themselves); zdirect rrepresentation(people delegate others\u2014 relatives, friends, respected members of their commu- nity, traditional leaders, leaders of a community-based group\u2014 to represent them in all sorts of activ-ities but maintain a direct, face-to-face relationship with their representatives); zindirect rrepresentation(people delegate others\u2014 experts, appointees of large associations, non-gov- ernmental organisations, parties, elected or other government officials\u2014 to represent them in all sortsof activities, but they rarely, if ever, interact with their representatives on a person-to-person basis). 24Bromley and Cernea, 1989. 25Page 379 in Platteau, 1996. 26In the Bijagos archipelago (Guinea Bissau) the local people have a varied, complex and effective system of natural resource man agement of enormous value for the Bijagos Biosphere Reserve (IUCN, 1996a; Maretti, 2003). Yet, the communication between the local coun cils of chiefs and the rest of society (state administrators, economic operators, etc.) is still limited. 27A community in New Guinea faced a choice between fast, lucrative and destructive timber exploitation and slower, a bit less lucr ative but sustainable timber exploitation in its own ancestral territory. The elders from the community\u2014 in charge of deciding for ev eryone\u2014 unequivocally chose the former option. One of them, interviewed on why they did so, replied \"I have old teeth and like to eat t ender rice. I like to eat it now.\" See McCallum and Sekhran, 1997. 28Borrini-Feyerabend, 1998. Some may argue that elected political officials and administrators at various lev- els are the ones to represent local interests and concerns, including concernsregarding natural resource management. There is some truth in this, insofar asfreedom of information and the formal procedures of democracy ( e.g., periodic elections) are respected, but there are also obvious limitations. For instance,indirect representation systems (see Box 2.5) are rarely appropriate to conveythe specific and detailed concerns of small groups of people, and surely cannotdeliver the full range of knowledge and skills of local resource users. In general,effective direct representation is crucial to assure the participation of stakehold-ers who do not enjoy a high social status, and it is thus an essential concern for equity in natural resource management. 2288In many cases, the traditional organi- sational structures for the management of common property or common poolresources (such as a council of elders) remain the most appropriate to representlocal interests. These organisations may need The Joint Forest Management (JFM) programme seeks to develop partnerships between local community institutions (as managers) and state forest departments (as owners) for sustainable management and jointbenefit sharing of (usually degraded) public forest lands. In essence, the states Joint Forest Managementresolutions assure participating villagers free access to most non-timber forest products and a 25 to 50% share of poles and timber at final harvesting. In return, the villagers are expected to protect the forestunderstood, supported and empowered to act. Some corrective and supportmeasures could in fact be negotiated with them (for example, to incorporate therepresentation of missing segments of the community, to take on some self-mon-itoring and feed-back procedures or to ensure a high level of interaction withtheir constituencies). Informed, organised and effectively-represented social actors are just a starting point in the struggle to further one's interests and concerns in NRM. It is only inthe political moment of acceptance and recognition by society that those inter-ests and concerns become \"entitlements\". Some entitlements are legally-sanc-tioned and uncontested rights, recognised pretty much everywhere in the world( e.g., an owner of a plot can cut grass on her land). Other management entitle- ments are fuzzily defined and/ or actively challenged. A governmental agencywith responsibility about public health matters might need to fight and win alegal battle with industry owners before being able to tighten regulation on pol-luting discharges in the environment. A community that lived for centuries in aterritory now declared protected area might need to struggle at length if it wishesto maintain some form of access to its natural resources. A factory ownerdependent on the water discharge from a watershed might have to negotiatewith a watershed committee to assure a regular supply to his factory. Justly orunjustly, others in society may not share the subjective perception of one's ownentitlements and that recognition might have to be achieved, bargained for, oreven \"conquered\". Again, some equity considerations are paramount to assure a fair chance to all relevant actors in the sensitive moment of negotiation. A society ridden with dis-criminatory procedures, for instance, will not be able to assure to all the samechances to be heard and responded to in a positive way. Moreover, only a polit-ical arena open to new ideas and offering the concrete possibility to meet anddiscuss conflicting views and interests allows new key relevant social actors toemerge and their entitlements to be recognised. In other words, a measure ofpolitical openness and participatory democracy is needed for new subjects to besocially accepted ( e.g., for community representatives to sit on a Park Management Board, or for an association of squatters to manage a water supplyand sanitation system in their own neighbourhood). In time, the newly recognised entitlements will be specified, systematised and codified. Stronger or weaker types of entitlements will then correspond to thebreadth and strength of the social consensus around them. Within stable systemsof reference, entitlements will likely evolve and stabilise EQUITY 61after conforming to the membership and structure specified by the forest department. The forest depart- ments reserve the right to cancel the JFM agreement unilaterally (and, in most cases, even to dissolvethe community institution itself). In such a situation, the community has no right to any compensationfor its investments of labour, time or capital. If the forest department fails to honour its commitments,the villagers have no reciprocal rights for penal action (except in Haryana where they can at leastdemand compensation). On the basis of the entitlements recognised in society, concrete management ini-tiatives can begin. The entitled social actors can identify priorities, develop plansand find among themselves, or acquire from outside, the skills and resources nec-essary to manage the territory or set of natural resources at stake. It is here thateach actor can assume, on the basis of the agreed entitlements and its own capa-bilities, a specific set of management functions, benefits and responsibilities. WithLeach et al. (1997), it is paramount to recognise that, in this essentially political moment of negotiation: \"...different groups of actors may give priority to different environmental resources and services, and particular trajectories of landscape change will bring a different distribution of costs and benefits to different groups of people.... Landscape change is a fundamentally political process, involving negotiations and conflicts between actors with different priorities [and] who are differently positioned in relations of power.\" In political struggles, equity considerations are again paramount. On the onehand, there should exist places and times for negotiation ( negotiation platforms or fora) and some form of logistical organising. A powerful way to maintain an inequitable status quo may be simply never to allow a meeting and organised dis- cussion to happen. If the meetings do happen, however, every participating actorshould possess the capability to negotiate. Such capability is the end result of asubtle combination of qualities, which may involve various human skills ( e.g., personal assertiveness, clarity and forcefulness of communication, language skills,etc.) but also freedom from fear and freedom from needs which may impose thesilence and withdrawal of some actors. In the negotiation process, the use of rela-tively neutral meeting places, timings that allow everyone to participate and pres-ence of impartial and competent facilitators are generally helpful (see Chapter 6). 62 SHARING POWERWhen the management functions are expected to last through time, it is appropri- ate to institutionalise the social agreement by establishing a multi-stakeholdermanagement body. (The process of negotiation among relevant actors and thetypes of plans, agreements and organisations that may result from it are exploredin detail in Chapters 5 to 9 of this volume). Again, only a socio-political contextin which the development of new organisations is allowed in a non-regimentedway would permit such events to take place. Such a measure of democratic experimentalism characterises strong societies, in which the citizens and civil sub- jects in general are accustomed to assuming social responsibilities.2299A limited space of anarchy (where anarchy is intended in the literal sense of \"absence of fixed governing structures\") seems thus to promote democratic experimentalism,which, in turn, is likely to foster more resilient and stronger societies. 3300For instance, if a national law establishes that the management board of protectedareas in the country must be composed of\u2014 let us say\u2014 ten elected local officials and university experts, the Boards will never include other concerned and well-informed representatives of the civil society. Important management contributionsthat may surface on a case-by-case basis will not have a chance to be incorporat-ed... Only by assuming responsibilities corresponding to their own socially recognised entitlements and by engaging in a flexible process of learning by doing in man-agement, the relevant actors become effectively and fully empowered. Again, forthe sake of equity, flexibility is needed in revising plans and agreements and in re-arranging rules on the basis of lessons from experience (this may allow some part-ners to contribute in the implementation phases what they might have not beenable to contribute earlier on). To balance that flexibility and to protect the interestsof the weakest actors, reliable conflict management, arbitration and legal enforce-ment procedures, and a fair and effective judiciary system, are also paramount. In Part II of this volume, Checklists 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 offer some concrete ideas about how to foster equity in natural resource management. Figure 2.2 also offersa sketch of what can be done to increase equity in the various steps of the CMprocess. 29An example in point is Switzerland, where federalism and strong devolved powers created a society where social responsibility i f fully assumed by citizens.

There are two main challenges in managing natural resources. One is to respond appropriately to the ecological characteristics of a given environment, preserving its integrity and functions while assuring a flow of benefits from it. This challengeis mostly about content \u2014 the what and when of managing natural resources. The other is to respond to the social characteristics of the same environment, dealing in an effective way with the inevitably conflicting interests and concerns of differ-ent social actors. This challenge is mostly about process \u2014 the who and how of managing natural resources. Throughout history, attempts to respond to the lattersocial challenge have included many forms of hostile struggle, both open and violent and hidden, via various means of social control. Fortunately, they alsoinclude a variety of collaborative, co-management solutions. 11 In this chapter we will attempt to illustrate and systematise some contemporary collaborative solutions to resource management challenges. Under diverse socio-political and economic circumstances, these span a bewildering array of processes, agreements and organisations, as it will be apparent from the concreteexamples we will describe. Chapter 3.

(Kropotkin, 1902) Adaptive managementA guiding principle for the design of the interface between society and biosphere, between community and ecosystem, between household and environment....

(Gray, 1989) 2Majid Rahnema (1992) powerfully warns against this danger, which has plagued terms such as \"participation,\" \"aid\" and a trivial issue here. There is no doubt that it would be useful to have a common lexicon for phenomena found throughout the world, which in theleast would facilitate communicating experiences and lessons learned. But thereare pitfalls to avoid. We could use the term \"co-management\" in a broad and gen-eral sense, but lumping too much under the concept may add to a generic \"cor-rupted language\" by which some vague and appealing terms are utilised to coverall sorts of practices and behaviours. 22We could, on the contrary, develop a set of air-tight definitions for similar yet slightly distinct phenomena. But that may com-plicate communication, without necessarily fitting the complexity of real events.In the last decades, various terms have been employed to describe different levels,stages or areas of application of \"co-management situations\". A selection of thoseterms is listed in Table 3.1, given in the chronological order in which they wereintroduced, beginning with a quote of historical value.66 SHARING POWERPopular participationAs an end in itself, popular participation is the fundamental right of the people to fully and effectively participate in the determination of the decisions which affect their livesat all levels and at all times.

Specifically, in a collaborative management processthe agency with jurisdiction over natural resources develops a partnership with otherrelevant stakeholders (primarily including local residents and resource users) whichspecifies and guarantees the respective management functions, rights and responsibili-ties. (Borrini-Feyerabend, 1996) Joint pprotected area managementThe management of a protected area and its surrounds with the objective of conserv- ing natural ecosystems and their wildlife, as well as of ensuring the livelihood securityof local traditional communities, through legal and institutional mechanisms whichensure an equal partnership between these communities and governmental agencies.(Kothari et al. 1996) ParticipationA process through which stakeholders influence and share control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources that affect them.

With co-management, the involvement of indigenous peoples in protected areas becomes a formal partnership,with conservation management authority shared between indigenous peoples andgovernment agencies... or national and international non-governmental organisations.[...] true co-management requires involvement in policy-formulation, planning, man-agement and evaluation.

PluralismThe recognition of the presence and role of multiple actors and their influence in shaping the performance of both natural systems and man-made institutions. (Ram\u20acrez,1998) Democratic experimentalismCitizens in many countries directly participating with government in solving problems of economic development, schooling, policing, the management of complex ecosys-tems or drug abuse. Central governments of nearly all political colours at timesencourage these developments by devolving authority to lower levels and looseningthe grip of public bureaucracies on the provision of some services while wholly pri-vatising others. At times they simply tolerate local experimentation by waiving formal-ly, or through inaction, their statutory rights to specify how programmes are adminis-tered. (Sabel, 1998) Platform ffor ccol- lective aactionA decision-making body (voluntary or statutory) comprising differ- ent stakeholders who perceive the same resource management problem, realise theirinterdependence in solving it, and come together to agree on action strategies for solv-ing the problem.

(Nelson and Zadek, 2001) Deliberative democracyDeliberation is the \"careful consideration\" of the \"discussion of reason for and against\". Inclusion is the action of involving others, with an emphasis on previouslyexcluded citizens. Deliberative inclusionary processes enable participants to evalu-ate and re-evaluate their positions in the light of different perspectives and new evi-dence. Democracy without citizen deliberation and participation is ultimately anempty and meaningless concept. (Pimbert and Wakeford, 2001b) A mmanagement- centred pparadigmIn contrast benefit-centred paradigm, this approach to community participa- tion is concerned with transforming the way the forest is managed and seeks toachieve this through a transfer of responsibility with authority to the forest-localcommunities. This is a power sharing rather than a product-sharing process. (AldenWily and Mbaya, 2001) Decentralisation (de-cconcentration) Privatisation (delegation) Democratic decentralisation (devolution)Decentralisation is any act in which a central government formally cedes powers to actors at lower levels in a political-administrative and territorial hierarchy. De-con-centration involves the transfer of power to lower branches of the central state, suchas prefects, administrators or local ministry agents. Privatisation is the transfer tonon-state entities, including individuals, corporations, NGOs, etc. Democraticdecentralisation is the transfer to authorities representative of and downwardlyaccountable to local populations. (Ribot, 2002) Multi-sstakeholder processesProcesses that bring together all major stakeholders in new forms of communication and decision-finding (and possibly decision-making),... recognise the importance ofequity and accountability... and the democratic principles of transparency and par-ticipation. (Hemmati, 2002) Sound ggovernance Sound governance is based on the application of UN principles, such as legitimacy and voice (through broad participation and consensus-based decisions), transparen-cy and accountability, performance (including responsiveness to stakeholders, effec-tiveness and efficiency), fairness (equity and the rule of law) and direction (includ-ing strategic vision and the capacity to respond to unique historical, cultural andsocial complexities). (Institute on Governance, 2002) Public iinvolve- ment iin ggover- nancePublic involvement is generally recognised to have three pillars: public access to information, public participation in decision-making processes and access to jus-tice. As a practical matter, it also implicates the right of free association and freespeech. These rights operate synergistically. (Bruch and Filbey, 2002)CO-MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES 69Our definition of \"co-management\" is not specific regarding forms, types or levels of power sharing, and it is more concerned with actual events (shared manage-ment functions, benefits and responsibilities) than with stated management objec-tives. Some believe that it would be more appropriate to use different terms fordifferent formal levels of involvement. 33It is difficult, however, to identify a sharp demarcation between formal types of participation and actual power sharing inmanagement activities. For instance, a process of active consultation with localstakeholders may result in the full incorporation of their concerns into the man-agement plan of a state-controlled protected area. Or a multi-party body withoutlegal authority may enjoy a high level of social recognition and see its recommen-dations invariably endorsed by decision mak-ers (see Box 6.12). This is de facto power shar- ing. Conversely, it is possible that severalactors who officially participate in negotiatingmanagement decisions (let us say because theyhold seats in the decision-making body, theyare de jure44in charge) end up more often than not in a minority position and are powerless toinfluence the final decisional outcome. Is thesecond case necessarily more \"co-managed\"than the first? There is, however, one situation,in which the formal inclusion of social actorsin a decision-making body makes the entiredifference. This is when decision-making isstipulated by consensus rather than by vote. Apluralist body in which decisions are made byconsensus\u2014 rather than by vote\u2014 assigns thefull value to the meaning of co-management. In sum, we understand co-management as a broad concept spanning a variety of ways bywhich two or more relevant social actorsdevelop and implement a management part-nership. We speak about it in a pragmatic, de facto sense, regardless of the de jure condition it corresponds to, ignores or contradicts. Obviously, supportive tenure rights, poli-cies and legislation strengthen collaborative processes and partnerships. Yet, moreoften than one may think, there is a schism between policy and practice, andpractice is ahead of policy in many cases. 55Box 3.1 CCoo-mmaannaaggeemmeenntt ooff NNaattuurraall RReessoouurrcceess In this volume we employ the term co-management (CM) to describe a partnership by which two or more relevant social actors collectively negotiate, agree upon, guarantee and implement a fair share ofmanagement functions, benefits and responsibilities for a particular territory, area or set of naturalresources.In this work we deal mostly with the concept of \"co-management\", for which wehave adopted a broad but factual working definition (see Box 3.1). 3See, for instance, Franks, 1995, for the case of a protected area. Stevens (1997) also discusses this at some length. 4The distinction between de jure and de facto corresponds to the distinction between what is prescribed by norms and laws and what actually happens in real life. 5See Part IV of this not a new approach. Partnerships for resource management are as old as human cultures,66exist in all countries of the world77and concern all types of territories and natural resources. Forests, fisheries and coastal resources,grazing lands and wildlife are included in existing management agreementsamong various parties. 88At times the partnership does not regard any specific terri- tory but only a resource that may be temporarily found on a given territory- e.g., water or migratory wildlife. Management partnerships can be found in state-owned, communally owned, pri- vately owned and mixed-property territories. The scale at which the agreementworks may be as large as an entire watershed or as small as a forest patch. Thepartners may include state and para-statal bodies\u2014 such as national governments,ministries, district development committees, state universities and protected areaagencies, and private bodies\u2014 such as indigenous councils, landowners, commu-nities and interest groups within communities, NGOs and private operators.Usually, different types of partners are involved ( e.g., a public agency, several local communities and private operators) but the partners can also be all of thesame kind, for instance several landowners or several interest groups within acommunity. As discussed in Chapter 2, the co-management approach stressespartnerships with communities as well as within communities. Some find it useful to distinguish between management partnerships for produc- tive purposes ( e.g., agriculture or animal husbandry) and partnerships for conser- vation ( e.g., to preserve the habitat of a given species or manage a protected area). Such distinction, however, is not easily drawn. Whenever the managementof natural resources for productive purposes involves some consideration of futureand not only present production, it inevitably involves measures for the preserva-tion of the environmental elements that sustain production\u2014 e.g., soil, water, veg- etation and fodder, biodiversity, or the local climate. Conversely, biodiversity andenvironmental functions sustain community livelihoods and support many smalland big businesses throughout the world. As a matter of fact, it is hardly possibleto separate what is done by society for the sake of conservation from what is donefor the sake of the economy. In the following, a variety of concrete examples of co-management are introduced and discussed. A possible distinction between productive and conservation objec-tives is mentioned, but ultimately left to the judgement of the reader. 6Kropotkin, 1902. 7For a recent review of principles and practices of partnerships see McNeely, 1995. 8McCay and Acheson, 1987. Co-management settings for non-renewable resources ( e.g., oil and mineral deposits) seem to be much less common, although some initiatives may now be promoting them (Mate, 2001). A variety of partnerships are in place through- out the world to sustain agricultural production.Some have traditions rooted in the millennia,such as the minga (communal works) of Andean people,99the naam gatherings of Sahelian societies1100, the nafir systems of Sudan or the boneh systems still found throughout western and southern Asia (see Box 3.2). The minga , for instance, is a central event in the lives of Andean communities and a mainavenue of people's solidarity. It is communalwork, decided upon and regulated by the com-munity members themselves during their assem-bly at the end of each month. Every familysends a member to the minga , which can be called upon to open an irrigation channel, break up some particularly hard soil in common agricultural plot orcarry out any other task needed by the community. The minga usually happens once a week, and after work the people eat together or conclude their efforts witha drinking party. If a family does not fulfil its obligations, it is subjected to heavysocial pressure. Today, this traditional practice is still very much alive and actuallyspreading to private land, with people working on privately owned plots on arotational basis (in this case the minga is called prestamano \u2014 \"lending a hand\"). Even in non-traditional societies farmers, communities, government agencies, researchers and non-governmental organisations collaborate in agricultural pro-duction by contributing a variety of inputs and supportive conditions. 1111 Increasingly, they also link their production-oriented efforts to forms of care that allow extracting natural resources sustainably, i.e.,to maintain productivity in the future. For this, farmers communicate with one another, agree on a commoncourse of action and share the responsibilities for carrying it out. Box 3.2 TThhee bboonneehh\u2014\u2014 aa ccoo-mmaannaaggeemmeenntt ssyysstteemm bbaasseedd oonn ccrroopp-sshhaarriinngg (adapted from Farvar, 1991) In most of southwest Asia crop sharing is common when the factors of production are owned by differ- ent people or groups. For instance, some people own land, others own water, others have seeds andanimal traction, and still others can provide labour. If they pool together what they have to producesome crops they will be entitled to a share of the harvest according to their contribution. In this systemeach partner, including the landlords and the landless peasants, have benefits and responsibilities. One such crop sharing system, which has been quite common in Iran and neighbouring countries, is the boneh (known also with many other names including haraseh, sahra, jogh, boluk, dang, etc.). A boneh is a production unit including an area of land usually equal to what the water source available will irrigate in one 24-hour period, the water rights to irrigate that land , the peasants assigned to work- ing it, and the animal power needed for ploughing and harvesting. The entire agricultural land of acommunity is often subdivided into a number of bonehs equal to the number of days in the irrigation 9Sanchez Parga et telling example of farmer collaboration comes from Australia, where thousands of voluntary groups are currently engaged in what is known as Landcare pro-gramme. 1122The programme aims at developing more sustainable systems of land use, counteracting the severe environmental impact brought about by the un-adapted farming practiced of European immigrants in the last centuries. There isno typical Landcare group (they show a remarkable diversity among themselves)but, basically, a Landcare group gathers individuals who come together voluntari-ly to co-operate in caring for the land. One of the points of strength of Landcare isthat such individuals are not only farmers, but also community members at large,environmental activists and government agency staff. A Landcare group maybegin with an informal gathering of individuals who end up discussing land man-agement problems. If they decide to take action together, they usually elect asteering committee, which is then asked to investigate local problems, opportuni-ties and available resources in a systematic way. That steering committee may inturn call for a more formal group to take shape, and elect its own executive team. A Landcare group becomes operational with decisions regarding management boundaries, goals and memberships. The land degradation problems are dis-cussed, the potential resources to solve them investigated, and the relationshipswith state and governmental assistance agencies and other sources of supportdeveloped. Among the routine duties of a group is usually the monitoring of localland status via innovative \"land literacy\" approaches (community-based actionresearch, farmer-fly-overs, using of living organisms as indicators, listening tointerpretative tapes when travelling, or even becoming \"hands-on\" users ofsophisticated techniques and computer programmes for Geographic InformationSystems\u2014 GIS). Participatory methods (observation walks and drives, mapping,etc.) are used to plan the management of farms and water catchments in an inte-grated way. In all this, new relationships are established with government exten-sion agents and consultants, who may provide specific technical support. Manygroups identify a facilitator (possibly a professional one). If the group's activitiesrequire on-going care that cannot be provided by volunteers only, they hire a pro-cycle. The council of Elders of the community roughly coincides with the Council of the Chiefs of the bonehs (Irrigation Council). The turn for irrigation is usually determined by drawing lots. Once a year, prior to the start of the irrigation season, the elders representing all the bonehs get together and decide by drawing lots whose boneh would get to use all the water available to irrigate on the first day, whose on the second, and so on. In this way, the risk of starting on the last day of the irrigation cycle (whichwould expose the crops to longer periods of drought) is distributed at random (\"decided by God\").Within each boneh , a further management system for water distribution usually functions like clock- works. At the end of the season, the crop is harvested collaboratively, and literally heaped up into the number of shares decided by agreement or tradition. Each owner of a factor of production arrives on the sceneand hauls away his or her share of the harvest. These arrangements are often codified and written downin contracts, some of which are still preserved and studied. Although the various land reform schemes in Iran have in some respects weakened the boneh, this is still the preferred system for irrigation management and the organisation of production in the semi-aridareas of the country. Entrepreneurs from central Iran use it to organise workers, land and irrigationwhen penetrating new agricultural lands, for example areas irrigated by 73fessional co-ordinator. If necessary, the groups apply for funds and other resources from the government and other sources. The organised groups with worthy projects to implement can also refer themselves to the Landcare Programme itself, which may decide to assign some financial sup-port. The Programme fosters various and non-uniform rules among the Landcaregroups, and this has proven one of its winning features. It is too early to have con-clusive data on the impact of the Programme for the whole country. Today, how-ever, communities and agencies co-operate to define and tackle land degradationproblems and further research and new extension approaches in ways that did noteven seem possible only a decade ago. ......iinn wwaatteerr aanndd wwaatteerrsshheedd mmaannaaggeemmeenntt Perhaps more than any other natural resource, water has been co-managed for centuries, under different cultures and geographical conditions, resulting in theeffective utilisation of a most essential input to life and agriculture (see Box 3.3).Throughout the world, there exist innumerable examples of traditional associa-tions for water management, many of whom have been studied extensively tounderstand their characteristics and functional mechanisms 1133, often as part of the study of traditional management practices of common property resources. Someinsights from these studies will be reviewed in Part III of this volume. Box 3.3 CCuullttuurraall ccoo-mmaannaaggeemmeenntt iinn BBaallii (adapted from Reader, 1990) The island of Bali enjoys a constant climate, suitable for the continuous production of rice throughout the year. To fulfil this potential the Balinese people have had to cope with two main challenges:adapting to cultivation in their steep, deeply fissured mountain environment and managing water. Infact, although water is available all year around, it is needed in the rice fields only part of the time,such as during planting and growing but not at harvesting and immediately afterwards. The Balinesepeople have solved the problem of steep terrain by building terraces on the mountain slopes. Theyhave solved the water management problem by setting up an irrigation system that controls the flowof water down the slopes, alternatively flooding and draining fields, and maximising production onevery terrace. An optimal use of the water can be achieved only if the timing of cultivation in different fields is co- ordinated in a rotational cycle. For instance, the fields at the top may be flooded and prepared forplanting while the crop is already well-advanced in the middle terraces and already being harvestedin the lower ones. Obviously, such a well-timed cycle needs advanced co-operation among all farm-ers. Since times immemorial, this has been achieved in Bali by local organisations called subak (irri- gation societies), comprising all the owners of the landholdings irrigated by the same water source. An individual water source ( tempek ) is composed of a dam and system of channels and aqueducts that keep water flowing at optimum speed from the main lakes on the top of the island. Each landunit ( tenah ) is due to receive precisely the same amount of water from the tempek it depends on, regardless of its owner and position. The technical difficulties of dividing water accurately and regu-lating the timing of its supply are taken in charge by the subak council, who also collects taxes to finance upkeep and improvements and calls the members to contribute to maintenance and construc-tion works. Each subak has a written constitution (at times written on a palm leaf!), each member casts one vote on matters of policy and election of officials (regardless of the size of land units held) infraction of subak rules. The Balinese people have set the context of the subak in the realm of a transcendent authority- Dewi Sri, the goddess of rice and fertility. Every stage of water division is marked by a ritual ceremony, heldin the temples at the top of the water flow and in the shrines interspersed among the rice terraces.The ceremonies are scheduled according to the Balinese calendar (the Balinese year is 210 days,exactly the double of the local cycle of rice growing), and at each ceremony the subak farmers are reminded of the timings and sequence of the water flows. Thus, at each ceremony the co-operativerelationship among farmers is strengthened. The religious occasions and the growing cycle of ricematch closely, structuring the whole island into a co-ordinated system in which water management,rice production, spiritual life and social reciprocities closely merge. Partnerships for water management can play an important role for the sake oflocal ecosystem health but also for social development. For instance, a \"RiverParliament\" has been created among various bearers of interests and concerns onthe management of the river Dr\u00f4me, in France. France's law declares rivers to beproperty of the nation, to be managed for the general interest. The problem is thateveryone needs to agree on what this interest is, within a complex system of man-agement conditions. For the Dr\u00f4me, three years of meetings, studies and encoun-ters produced a consensus among all major interested parties. This consensus,spelled out in a document called \"The Dr\u00f4me Sage\", is now the managementplan for the river, the ground on which a number of contracts mobilise conspicu-ous national resources, and a most fruitful and appreciated experience in localdemocracy. 1144French politicians are proud of their experience with the Dr\u00f4me, and are proposing it as a model for the European Community, on the basis of theEuropean Union (EU) Directive on watershed management. In Argentina, the Encadenadas lake watershed (south-west of Buenos Aires) has been subjected for decades to a recurrent alternation of floods and droughts that has accustomed the local residents to natural dis-asters. Such disasters went side-by-side withsocial conflicts, as some groups could protectthemselves from floods only if others wouldaccept to be subjected to water shortages. Thusconflicting interests stalled decisions or promptedone-sided measures that left many people unsatis-fied. In fact, at one time or another, everyone inthe Encadenadas area was hit very hard by watermanagement failures. Droughts severely affectedagriculture and tourism. Destructive floodsbecame so severe as to make some areas perma-nently un-inhabitable. The crucial challenge wasmanaging water as a common good for differentlocal administrative units, each with its ownsocio-geographic peculiarities and ecologic/ eco-nomic priorities. For some time the Argentinean government saw the problem as merely technical, i.e., a problem that could be solved by appropriate technicalsolutions such as water reservoirs and other 75hydraulic works. It was not as simple as that. In practice, the providers of public service did not even manage to agree on a definition of the problems that satisfied all interest groups ( e.g., tourism-dependent businesses, agriculturists, fisher folk, people from upstream and downstream villages, etc.). In addition, some of thehydraulic works they set in place actually ended up aggravating local hardshipsrather than solving them. It was at this time that a change of attitude began to befelt among the various actors interested in water management. Rather than dis-cussing technical fixes, they turned to discussing rights, responsibilities and equityissues. The management of the whole watershed took centre stage, instead of theusual conflicts to appropriate specific water benefits in specific locations. Thischange also signalled the emergence of new social actors, viz. local ad-hoc asso- ciations, which started acting alongside the state-sponsored technical administra-tors and the political administrators elected in various municipalities. Thus begana laborious process that eventually established some co-ordinated managementplans and set in place a Watershed Management Committee. The richer definitionof the water problem and the emergence of organised social actors, capable ofco-managing water rights as well as economic compensations and indemnities forwater damages, are now widely regarded as crucial steps in both the developmentof the region and its democratic re-awakening. 1155 ......iinn aaggrriiccuullttuurraall rreesseeaarrcchh Not only soil or water can be profitably co-managed, but also agricultural research,16for instance on new seed technologies, on irrigation systems and on a variety of management practices. In fact, the participation of peasants\u2014 the mainusers of the research results\u2014 in defining research objectives and methods isconsidered by some among the most promising innovations in modern agricul- ture. 17 15Monachesi Pastapur and Pimbert, 1991) Joint problem solving, mutual learning and negotiated agreements were at the heart of a participatory research process involving scientists and women farmers cultivating marginal land in Andhra Pradesh,India. Actors involved in this decentralised research jointly established reversals in the conventionalroles of scientists and farmers: women farmers took key decisions and scientists acted in a facilitatingand support role. This was farmer-led research on insect pest management. To begin with, major insect pests of pigeon-pea, an important food crop in India, were jointly identified by farmers and scientists who surveyed the crop as they walked through farmers' fields. Women farmersdiscussed and documented together the characteristics of their pigeon-pea varieties and their local cropmanagement practices. They thus agreed that pest-resistant varieties were an important component ofintegrated pest management approaches. On the basis of such an indication, the scientists searched forand identified improved pest-resistant pigeon-pea lines that closely matched the characteristics of thefarmers' varieties. Small batches of pest resistant pigeon-pea identified by the scientists on research sta-tions were then grown out by farmers along local varieties (landraces) to test their performance in differ-ent risk-prone farming situations. The results of these trials were evaluated entirely on the basis of thefarmers' own criteria. In fact, the parameters considered by the women went well beyond the scientists'conventional ones, such as \"yield\" and \"pest resistance\". The women rated the pigeon-pea linesaccording to ten agronomic and social criteria, including pest value, obtainable market price and the retention of quality during storage. The women farmers' criteria and priorities were elicited in individual and group interviews using ranking methodsdrawn from Participatory Rural Appraisal approaches. At all stages of the co-managed research process, women of different ages and wealth, and from differ- ent villages, were included in negotiations with scientists and a local non governmental organisation toreach agreements on what to monitor and evaluate, what indicators to use, how and when to collectand analyse data, what data actually meant, how findings should be shared and what follow up wasneeded. The women sanghams (collectives or community groups) from different villages were regularly involved in discussing and cross-checking the findings, as well as planning each next step in a flexibleand adaptive way. The women collectives offered invaluable guidance to the outside scientists as towhich research questions and categories of knowledge were most relevant to farmers' needs and priori-ties and to the local agro-ecological and social contexts. The participatory research resulted in stunning outcomes: zOne of the improved pigeon-pea lines evaluated by the women farmers was decisively rejected by the farmers because of its bitter taste. However, by the time the women farmers reached this conclu-sion, the same pigeon-pea variety had just been officially released in the state of Andhra Pradesh onthe basis of research station and on-farm trials managed by scientists alone, as part of a conventionaltransfer of technology approach to agricultural development zTwo other improved pigeon-pea varieties evaluated by the farmers performed well under their condi- tions and, in some cases, were rated as superior to the local landraces. But despite the advantages ofthe improved pest resistant pigeon-pea, the women farmers still wanted to retain their landraces andother improved varieties they had tested. They believed that pest attack was lower when they grew amosaic of mixed varieties than when they grew a single variety. The farmers' insistence on biodiversi-ty as a principle of production in risk-prone environments led the scientist to further explore this pestmanagement option by analysing the pest-suppressant impact of mixing different pigeon-pea lines invarious combinations. The participatory research and jointly agreed procedures were particularly appropriate in supporting diversity as a means of sustainability and food security in the local, risk-prone environments. The co-management of agricultural research by scientists and the largely illiterate women farmers also high-lighted the needs for changes in institutions, attitudes and behaviours to allow more people to learn andcreate knowledge and technologies together, through dialogue, collective inquiry and negotiation ofroles, rights and responsibilities. ......iinn rraannggeellaanndd mmaannaaggeemmeenntt Partnerships among pastoralists and between pastoralists and peasant communi- ties have stood the test of centuries in many environments. In the first case, it isnecessary to assure that communities dependent on similar modes of productioncoexist and do not compete destructively with one another. 1188In the second, as different modes of production draw resources from complementary ecologicalniches, pastoralists and peasants must find rules for a fair exchange of productsand for benefiting from one another ( e.g., because of the fertilising of the land by passing animals).1199In both cases, the need for co-operation and the potential for conflict are high, and entire cultures developed to respond to these challenges. The hema system, once common in the Islamic world and now sadly rarer, con- sists of a set of rules for the grazing of herds on a given territory utilised by one 18Horowitz and Salem-Murdock, 1987; OF NATURAL RESOURCES 77or more pastoralist communities ( e.g., particular tribes or villages).2200The families may possess hereditary ownership or right of use or have de facto been grazing on the territory for a long time (in other words, the property regime is usuallymixed). The hema rules bind all the members of the community and specify areas where animal grazing is prohibited (with the exception of specific periodsand drought times, when cutting of grass is allowed as special privileges forneedy people); areas where grazing and cutting is permitted except in some sea-sons; areas where grazing is allowed all year round (but the kind and number ofanimals permitted to graze are specified); areas reserved for beekeeping; areasreserved to protect forest trees such as juniper, acacia or ghada (these areas are usually held under common property of a village or a tribe). A person commit-ting offence against the hema rules has to pay a fine; repeated offenders receive severe social sanctions. A most interesting feature of agreements within and among pastoral societies is a propensity towards flexibility through informality, ad-hoc -ness, un-boundness, porosity, impermanence and a continual socio-political negotiation.2211In other words, pasture access is often granted through alliances and political processesthat better serve the interests of the partners when they are open and informal,leaving space for bargaining and re-adjustments. This best responds to the vari-able ecological and economic conditions that characterise pastoral life 20Draz, 1985. 21Turner, 1999. See also Box 3.5 in this Chapter. 22Watts, 1983a; Watts, 1983b; Horowitz Forole is a sacred mountain just north of the border between Kenya and Ethiopia where the Galbo peo- ples (a sub-group of the Gabbra) hold the jila galana ceremonies. Most of the Galbo live in Kenya, but they move in pilgrimage to the Forole on occasion of the ceremony. The trees of Forole Mountain aretotally protected by the Gabbra and access to the upper part is only allowed to a few people who pre-side over the ceremony of the sacrifice to the Sacred Python. The lower part of the mountain providespermanent water and is used as reserve grazing area by both the Gabbra and the Borana pastoralists.Sometimes there are tensions over pastoral resources among the two groups, but the Borana fullyrespect the sacredness of Forole Mountain and the inherent restrictions, indirectly assuring its conserva-tion. This community conserved area is not univocally associated with a single ethnic group andengages local actors in complex economic and symbolic relationships that work quite effectively inmaintaining the quality of pasture and the livelihood of people. Unfortunately, the forces of economic modernisation ( e.g., the money-dominated economy, the predominance of market values versus use values) and socio-cultur- al change (emergence of state power and bureaucracies, urbanisation, loss ofvalue of traditional institutions and systems of reciprocities, propensity towardsfixed access rules and regulations in place of flexible, on-going, political negotia-tions) managed to severely weaken many culture-based partnerships throughoutthe world, 2222such as the hema and ghada mentioned above. In some places the occupation of crucial land and destruction of traditional natural resource manage-ment systems of pastoral communities has resulted in tragedies of huge propor-tions, as in Ethiopia, where millions of Oromo-Borana people survive today at themercy of climatic conditions to which earlier they were well able to respond. welcome change that some national governments and international donors are now \"discovering\" the management capacities of pastoral people. Thus inKenya, the Loita Maasai communities have recently been re-assigned the man-agement rights over the Loita Forest, after a decade of struggles in court and inthe field. 2244In Mauritania, a recent law called Code Pastoral recognises the eco- nomic and management value of pastoral practices and some projects have pro-moted the establishment of various types of pastoral and farmers associations.These associations are encouraged and facilitated to enter into agreements withthe government and among themselves to improve herds' health and land pro-ductivity while preserving the environment from excessive exploitation. 2255And in Iran, pastoral communities, the government and progressive NGOs are experi-menting with new forms of support to sustainable use of pastoral resources. 2266 ......iinn ffoorreesstt mmaannaaggeemmeenntt Besides agricultural and grazing lands, forestlands throughout the world have been the objects of multiple interests and seen many conflicts developingaround them. Fortunately, they have also been the focus of encouraging types of collaborative solutions. Here below arecontemporary examples from three con-tinents. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, the Applegate River water-shed is located in Southwest Oregon andnorthern California. Long the object ofintense polarisation and controversy overforest management practices, theApplegate Valley is composed of apatchwork of federal, state, county, andprivate lands. Tired of the gridlock, anumber of the key stakeholders con-vened in 1992 to form the ApplegatePartnership, a group uniting naturalresource agencies, industry, conservationassociations and local residents towardsthe goal of ecosystem health, diversityand productivity.

The partnershipserves in an advisory capacity to relevantresource management agencies andseeks to educate private landowners andprovide them with incentives to managetheir forestlands in a sustainable fashion.The partnership has no legal authority tomake decisions on behalf of participatingagencies but, because of its broad repre-sentation and shared purpose, it has con-siderable de facto influence over forest 24Karanja et al. , 2002. 25Pye Smith and Borrini-Feyerabend, 1994.

CO-MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL personal communication by Anada Tiega, 2003) The Gaya region in southwest Niger offers an example of local communities re-appropriating\u2014 as well as reinventing and reorganizing\u2014 their rights to their surrounding natural resources. About 80 villageswith a population of 80,000 reside in the midst of a region of the Sahel blessed with superior condi-tions for agriculture, including a resource unique in potential and diversity of use: the ron palm( Borassus aethiopum ). Benefits derived from the ron palm extend to much of the rural population in Gaya, with distribution of goods and revenues shared between different groups in the society. Thus,women, farmers, herders, fisher folks and artisans all have recognised rights to access to, and use of, thepalm. The palm is of particular interest given a wide range of products harvested from its different parts. In the past it had been overexploited throughout the country to the point that Gaya harboured one of the fewstanding groves left in the whole country. External support to conserve and develop the potential of thelocal ecosystems initially focused on \"technical\" conditions for environmental regeneration, but hassince progressively moved to efforts to promote community initiatives for conservation, management ofwild resources and establishing basic conditions necessary for sustainable livelihoods. The ron palm hasbecome the central focus for important changes in local forms of association, governance, law and eco-nomic organisation. In particular, some community land-use management groups ( unit\u00e9s de gestion de terroir ) have emerged, enjoying great local specificity and independence in their decision making process. Each group exercises the right to govern common resources as well as financial autonomy. Theprogressive recognition by government of the groups and their rights has a direct impact on revisionand application of land tenure law and legislation on forms of association, as well as on common prop-erty and rights and responsibilities in natural resource management. Progressively, the local groups haveextended their interests to a variety of other resources, such as wetlands and fisheries. Their success hasbeen so important that one of their wetlands has now been declared a Ramsar site. 27Wondolleck and Yaffe, 1994.

In particular, it succeeded toremove from the scene the deeply entrenched animosity and the polarity aroundthe issues that had been so pervasive before. In place of the gridlock, \"positiverelationships developed between polarised groups, agencies and the community;a common vision was attained.\" 2277 In India, beginning in the 1970s, the expansion of an informal grassroots forest protection movement eventually triggered the issuing of a national resolution inJune 1990. The resolution provided the authority for communities to participatein the management of state forests (no other institutional actor was contemplatedin the resolution and the private sectors remained out of its scope).Subsequently, sixteen state governments issued resolutions extending rights andresponsibilities to local communities for state forest protection under what isnow called the Joint Forest Management (JFM) programme. As part of the pro-gramme, forestry department officials and ad-hoc local committees from the vil- lages sited close to the forests develop joint management agreements and micro-plans. Over 10,000 village committees are currently active, representing a signif-icant but still limited percentage of the potential and need in the Indian federa-tion. 2288The Joint Forest Management programme has achieved impressive results in forest conservation, but is limited by local people's lack of secure tenure tothe resources they are managing. The state regulations, in fact, fail to address thelong-term rights of The 1996s law on the devolution of management authority and responsibility to organised local com- munities that goes under the name of GELOSE (Gestion Locale S\u00e9curis\u00e9e or local security of resource management) created the conditions for a profound change of approach in natural resource manage-ment in Madagascar. Typical \"integrated conservation and development projects\"\u2014 such as the oneoperated by WWF around the protected areas of Marojejy et Anjanaharibe-Sud\u2014 took advantage ofthis law and offered a new chance to management partnerships in the region. At the beginning the project accompanied the local communities, as well as the administration of the communes and the sub-districts, in revisiting their history and discussing the future of their land,resources and livelihoods. This patrimonial approach created new ties among the local families and vil-lages, which discovered similarities among their problems and wishes. Local people seemed even tostart developing a common identity, despite the mixed ethnicity of the region (a pole of recent immigra-tion). At the same time, the project diffused information on the two main components of the GELOSElaw: the devolution of power regarding forests and other common property resources and the clarifica-tion and attribution of land tenure rights regarding areas under family cultivation. As time went by, theproject ended up playing a role of advisor and intermediary between the communities and the adminis-tration and help building the capacities of everyone in the process, including the \"mediators\" foreseenby the national GELOSE procedures. It also helped the communities to ritualise the long-term manage-In Tanzania, local user groups in the Babati district are entrusted with full decision-making power about conservation and resource use in the communalforests close to their villages. The forestry department and the Swedish aid agencyworked with the user groups to develop management tools and criteria, but allfinal decisions were left to them. For their local \"communal forests\", this is fully inagreement with Tanzanian law. Discussions are being held, however, to extendtheir management responsibility also to nearby state-owned forests, a fact that fallsoutside of the scope of the existing legislation. 3300Some pilot experiences are occurring in the south of the Babati district (Duru-Haitemba) where several forestscontrolled by local communities have been declared Village Forest Reserves.These are gazetted nationally but planning, management, patrolling and enforcement of rules (established as village by-laws) remain with the locals. In thissense, local groups are recognised to have not just some rights and responsibilitiesin management, but full authority and control over the local resources that theythemselves wish to place under protection. 3311A similar situation is found for Mgori Forest, which, however, had a different starting point. Prior to 1995, Mgori Forestwas claimed as government land. When it became apparent that the government did not have the means to manage it, it turned for assistance to thelocal communities. The resulting agreement stipulated that the 44.000-hectare forest would be managed by the five forest-adjacent villages in partnership withtheir district council. The presence of the district council was not too strong (onefield officer only), but the communities soon organised to establish five VillageForest Management Areas, each demarcated and guarded by their village forestguards (totalling more than 100 people) on the basis of village by-laws. Fires, illegal harvesting and clearing for millet production ceased, and the illegal hunting of elephants was also curtailed. The villages have now obtained theirCertificates of Village Land and plan to register their Forest Management Areas ascommon property. 3322 30Johansson and Westman, 1992. Also: examples of participatory management of forests abound, co-management regimes are also becoming frequent for water-based resources.3333The firths of Scotland,3344for instance, are marine and coastal wetlands including large estuaries, sea areas and coastal hinterlands\u2014 a sort of \"arms of the sea\", where waterchanges from salty to fresh and generates a complex mosaic of habitats andspecies. The firths are also the subject of numerous economic and cultural inter-ests of local communities. In recent years, separate management projects havebeen set up for each firth, each run by a cross-sectoral, non-statutory partnershipcalled \"forum\". Individual people have a chance to participate, although thestatutory agencies tend to play a predominant role. The voluntary nature of thesebodies constitutes both a strength and weakness for them. It is a strength insofar aspeople generously contribute their time and efforts for something they deeply carefor. It is a weakness insofar as the decisions of a non-institutionalised forum maybe stalled by a variety of obstacles and vested interests.ment objectives, to organise internally (developing structures and rules through traditional agreementscalled dina) and to develop the necessary simple management plan and terms of reference. The quality of this process was highly dependent on the pace of activities, which proceeded at the actors' own rhythm. The issues, beginning with forest conservation, slowly became \"owned\" by thecommunities and no longer needed to be promoted by outsiders. The communities discovered the com-plexity of forest management and the ways of sustainable use of forest products as well as soil andwater. They themselves ask for all available tools and technical help to fulfil their forest managementobligations and guarantee their future. Importantly, the state technical services become their naturalpartners, both to assist in surveillance and to provide technical solutions to problems. And the stateadministrations found their role in the coordinating initiatives and defending the established manage-ment rules vis-\u00e0-vis the external partners. In this light, the management devolution promoted by theGELOSE law seems indeed to have offered a unique occasion for collaboration and partnership amonglocal actors.

There, the land and sea converge gradually into a complex hydrological system of mangrove stands and creeks, salt and freshwater marshes, brackish lagoons and huge shallowbays of varying salinity, sea grass beds, islets and mangrove keys\u2014 all protected by a barrier reef growing along the coast. This sensitive ecological system has been under severe threat of irreversibledegradation because of unbridled \"development\" based on forest exploitation, tourism and cattle ranching, and unplanned urbanisation. In the early 1980s, the state government, headed by a committed governor named Joaquin Coldwell, agreed to take some major immediate measures: ending timber concessions to private companies,establishing community forestry programmes with local ejidos (a Mexican system of communal owner- ship) and asking that the area be classified as a biosphere reserve. In 1984, the process of developing amanagement plan for the reserve was started. The state and federal government created a steering com- 33For an illustrative review, see White et al. , 1994. SHARING POWER35Gorman and the coastal area of Tanga (Tanzania), a co-management experiment has been on its way for several years with yearly planning workshops that bring together repre-sentatives of villages, government authorities, commercial users of the coastalresources and non-governmental organisations. 3355The workshops are promoted by an IUCN-assisted project, which is also engaged in encouraging villagers toanalyse the situation and prospects of their natural resources and plan appropriatemanagement activities for their land and sea territories. This is done with the con-currence and support of the other institutional actors gathered in the yearly work-shops. To tackle coastal erosion, some villagers have replanted degraded man-grove areas. To support their fish stock, others are surveying their waters againstdynamite fishing. The coastal residents had enjoyed resource abundance for cen-turies, and the project did not find a trace of traditional systems of coastalresource management in the area. Today, however, local residents not only surveyagainst dynamite fishing, but they monitor directly marine biodiversity (includingcoral reef health and presence and abundance of fish species), after being specifi-cally trained by the project staff. In Thailand, the Yadfon Association has been working with 40 small fishing com- munities in Trang province starting with three villages in 1985, when the organisa-tion was formed. The motivation was not to protect these habitats for the sake ofconservation, but to secure the source of local livelihood, threatened by continualdeclining harvest of fish, squid, crabs, and shellfish. Fishers joined together to stopusing destructive gear and practices, such as dynamite fishing and cyanide poi-soning, and to restore the mangroves and sea grass beds. They successfully peti-tioned the local government to ensure regulations within their coastal zone.Following their successful example, in the upstream wetlands the rice farmersestablished a network to protect the sago palm and nypa palm forests. In all, thevillagers are demonstrating their willingness and capacity to manage their coastalresources and are now active to ask the government to formally recognise theirrole. 3366In Sri Lanka, co-management of natural resources has been promoted by Special Area Management (SAM) processes in 11 coastal sites. These processesmittee to coordinate the work and established a local council including representatives of the fisherfolks, coconut growers, cattle owners and peasants besides employees of the municipalities and scien-tists from the Autonomous University of Mexico. Gradually, forest concessions and cattle growers wereasked to leave the area, fishermen organised themselves to control their fishing grounds and a zoningscheme was discussed and adopted. The initiative attracted the attention of national and internationalpeople and NGOs, which came together to create an association called the Amigos de Sian Ka'an . The Association has promoted participatory action research and development initiatives based on the sustainable use of local resources and local environmental knowledge. Land tenure issues also neededto be addressed. The land in the ejidos belongs to the communities but the land in the biosphere reserve was federally owned and the local residents were concerned about their access to resources.The Council proposed the establishment of 90-year concessions for agricultural lots, reversible in casethe occupants would not respect the regulations of the biosphere reserve. In a unique experiment, thisconcept was also applied to the sea. The lobster fishing grounds in the two bays were divided by thefishermen into \"fields\". Strictly speaking this modality cannot be legalised, but it has already become a\"traditional management structure\" in Sian Ka'an. Each fisherman cares for his field, devoting efforts toimprove the lobster habitat, while their overall organisation carries out the surveillance against RESOURCES 83 sought to involve communities as key managers and are now being evaluated in terms of their capacity to contribute to local livelihood sustainability.3377Initiatives are also advancing, with different results, in countries as far as Belize,3388Fiji,3399 Ecuador,4400Australia (see later under co-management of protected areas) and Mauritania, where the Banc d'Arguin National Park and World Heritage Site ismoving towards a co-management setting with the local fishing Box Geoghegan et al. , 1999) In the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, a regional NGO called the Caribbean Natural Resource Institute (CANARI) and the local Department of Fisheries jointly facilitated a laborious conflict resolution processamong local fishing communities, hotel owners, dive operators, community institutions and governmentagencies- for years in bitter confrontation over different management options for their area's coastalresources. The conflict resolution efforts paid off beautifully, as an effective co-management agreementis now in place. A pluralist coordinating body, named the Soufriere Marine Management Association (SMMA), is com- posed of representatives of all major actors interested in the management of coastal resources. TheAssociation developed a shared vision of the future of the marine and coastal environment of theSoufriere region, which includes sustainable development, the equitable sharing of its benefits and thefostering of wide social participation in decision-making. The Association is constituted as a \"non-profitcompany\" with charitable, developmental and scientific objectives and is assigned the powers of coor-dinating the implementation of the agreements to manage the Soufriere Marine Management Area, aswell as related programmes and financial, technical and human resources. Zoning is a main component of the agreement. So far, five zones have been identified, including Marine Reserves, Fishing Priority Areas, Multiple Use Areas, Recreational Areas and Yacht MooringSites. According to the zoning, different regulations for resource use are established for fishing, diving,yachting and water sports. Complementary programmes include activities in education, public aware-ness and communication, social and economic development, infrastructure, research and monitoring.The Association has established its own by-laws, with periodicity and arrangements for meetings, con-ditions for new members (they would have to become signatories to the agreement and be accepted aslegitimate stakeholders at an annual general meeting of the Association), conditions for the nominationor election of officers on the board of directors (Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, Secretary andTreasurer) as well as the duties of these officers, and procedures to constitute advisory committees andother bodies to assist the Board in the implementation of its programmes and the running of its opera-tions. The co-management setting has enhanced the protection of the marine reserves and thus profited the tourism industry. The fishermen, on the other hand, obtained a guaranteed access to the fishing zonesand feel more secure in their livelihood. As a consequence, they actively support the reproduction andmaintenance of the fish stock, resulting in environmental and economic benefits for everyone. 37Senaratna and Milner-Gulland, 2002. 38http://www.communityconservation.org/Belize.html 39http://www.lmmanetwork.org freshwater wetlands, typical limited attempts at participatory approaches are supported by conservation and developmentprojects, as in the cases of Djoudj National Park, Senegal and the adjacentDiawling National Park, Mauritania 4422. For neither Park an effective co-management setting is yet in place, but in both a variety of committees and meetings to engage stakeholders in discussions and advice are slowly substitut-ing top-down decision making practices. The local environmental knowledgeand the indisputable advantage of local communities in carrying out park surveillance are today recognised by governments and experts alike. Withthose, the right of the local people to maintain the integrity of their livelihoods(which includes their own forms of resource management and use) is alsobecoming recognised. In Mexico, the coastal wetlands of the southern state of Sonora encompass 62,000 ha of high biological diversity located along an important shorebird andmigratory bird flyway. Effluents from irrigated agriculture pose the primarythreat to the conservation of the wetlands, followed by cattle husbandry, shrimpaquaculture and urbanisation. Among the social actors with primary interestsand concerns are the local permanent and seasonal fisher folks and the indigenous residents ( Yaquis and Mayos ) but also the aquaculturalists, farmers, livestock raisers, hunters, tourists, industrialists and other local residents.Through a series of workshops beginning in 1994 all these groups had theopportunity to work together and provide inputs into a strategic plan preparedtogether with governmental agencies, academic bodies, NGOs and donors. 4433 In India, Keoladeo National Park4444(Rajastan) is a natural depression re- designed by local kings ( e.g., using small dams) to attract as many birds as possible. Throughout centuries of careful water management, the site becamean internationally famous bird sanctuary and began attracting more and moretourists. In order to favour conservation and tourism, however, the Indian government went possibly too far. In 1992 a three-meter wall topped withbarbed wire was constructed all around the Park to prevent buffalo grazing andother Park access. These measures were implemented without consultationwith the local communities, who saw their historical pattern of access and usesuddenly becoming illegal. Years of violent conflict, non-cooperation and passive resistance ensued. Paradoxically, a very expensive scientific studyended up \"discovering\" that buffalo grazing is essential for the maintenance ofthe ecological characteristics that attract the birds, something that local peoplehad known and fought for all along! It is with the help of the World Wide Fundfor Nature (WWF) that a new atmosphere of dialogue and collaboration is final-ly developing between the park management and the local communities. Anumber of agreements have been drawn to regulate fodder collection andaccess to temples inside the park. Some welfare measures have also been initiated by park authorities and the tourist fees to visit the Park have beenincreased. The Park authorities report to be willing to allow controlled grazingof weeds inside the Park, sharing of tourist revenues with the local communi-ties and setting up effective joint management schemes. In 2000, however, thesituation was still quite unclear and potentially stalled, as national park policyin India was deemed not yet equipped to allow these kinds of formal agree-ments. 42Hamerlynck, 1997; ould Bah et al. and Gujja, 1997; Biksham personal communication, 2000.CO-MANAGEMENT NATURAL RESOURCES 8545http://www.iucn.org/themes/wetlands/naivasha.htmlKenya's Lake Naivasha is the only freshwater lake in the otherwise saline lakes in the Great Rift Valley, supporting a rich biodiversity of plants, mammals, birdsand amphibians. Over 60,000 people live close to the lake, using its water fordrinking water and agricultural production. Human activities on the shores andthe untreated water flowing back into the lake threaten the local ecology. Mostland around the lake is privately owned and since 1931, the landowners organised themselves in the Lake Naivasha Riparian Association. This association manages the lands around the lake in the way it sees fit, the onlyconstraint being that no permanent structures may be erected. Some years ago,the Association's Environmental Subcommittee, out of a growing concern aboutthe state of the lake and its environs, started a management plan developmentprocess. This led to establishing codes of conduct ( e.g., for the flower growers, the tourism industry people and the livestock keepers) for the wise use of the lake's water,4455which prompted the listing of the lake as a Lubuk Larangan system has been carried out by the people of Mandailing Natal district (North Sumatra) since the 1980s. The system is used to protect a river, which is entirely forbidden to exploitduring the \"closed season\" that generally lasts a full year. The monitoring for the fishing prohibition is carried out by the community located close to the river and applies to all the peoplewho interact with the river. At the end of the closed season\u2014 which usually coincides with the Islamic celebration of the end of the fasting month, Raya Idul Fitri in Bhasa Indonesia language \u2014 the prohibition is lifted for a few hours. Everyone can participate in fishing activities in the river after paying a fee which goes to fund community development activities. The occasion generally turnsinto a community festival. Before the spread of the Lubuk Larangan system in the 1980s traditional conservation activities applied to rivers and forests were practised by the Mandailing and known as rarangan (prohibition). These were closely interlinked with the traditional land use system, which was governed by the traditional authority. Since Indonesian independence, however, these traditional systems have beenreplaced by the central government and the local forest prohibitions have been abandoned. One ofthe major ecological and social problems currently affecting the province of Mandailing Natal isboth legal and illegal logging. Various local communities in Mandailing restarted practising riverprotection in the 1980s in order to raise funds for public needs such as teachers' salaries, buildingof religious schools, provision of assistance to orphans and the poorest people, community roadconstruction, etc. The fee collected during the fishing festival varies between 3 to 10 million Rupiaswhich goes a long way in meeting community needs. The Lubuk Larangan system has been adopted from a neighbouring province but closely resembles local practise of the past. The district government passed a decree to regulate the Lubuk Larangan system in 1988. The re-introduction of the Lubuk Larangan has created a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the local people and has provided valuable economic benefit to the community. More studies needto be done to assess the ecological effects. It is believed, however, that an increase in river biodiversity should be revealed. 86 SHARING Commission (OKACOM) was established in 1994, while the Mekong River Commission (MRC) was established already in the 1950s. 47Jentoft, 1989. 48Ruddle and Akimichi, 1984, quoted in Weinstein, 1998 . 49Lim, Matsuda and Shigemi, 1995. 50See the summary of the Japanese fishery case in NRTEE, 1998.The management of large scale river basins is determined by the competing claims on water and water-dependent resources by international, national, sub-national and local actors. Such competing claims need to be resolved by asocio-political negotiation and the resulting decisions need to be properlyenforced. Indeed, the very complexity of the situation of large river basins callsfor a joint jurisdiction regime involving multiple stakeholders at various levels.The co-management path is ridden with difficulties but the costs of not attempting it are even greater. Two typical cases, the ones of Mekong andOkavango, 4466illustrate the attempts at establishing river-wide commissions, involving various countries and tackling issues according to collaboratingrather than competing or hostile processes. Given the extent, importance andcomplexity of the relevant issues, the programmes developed by such RiverBasin Commissions begin by detailed, and often interminable, socio-ecologicalsurveys. Fortunately, while the surveys are going on, limited attempts at co-managing resources, in particular fisheries, can be pursued with success inparticular locations (see Box 3.11). ......iinn ffiisshheerryy mmaannaaggeemmeenntt Fisheries is a sector where co-management has been practised for a long time with excellent results. In the words of Pinkerton (1989) \"The accomplishmentsof co-management [fishery] regimes in which governments and users haveshared power and responsibilities in enhancement of long-range stock recoveryplanning and habitat protection are especially notable in producing superiorand more efficient management\". In Europe, one of the earliest arrangements toinvolve devolution of central government powers and the formal sharing offishery management jurisdiction with fishermen is the Lofoten Cod-fishery Co-management. This arrangement evolved as a solution of last resort to seriousand protracted conflicts among fishermen crowded in the same, exceptionallyrich cod migration routes. On the basis of the Lofoten Act, approved in Norwayin the 1890s, the co-management arrangement became possible, and indeedsucceeded in bringing peace where the Norwegian state had not been able to.As soon as the fishermen assumed responsibility to manage the fishery, theydeveloped their own committees in charge of developing rules (fishing time,type of gear, space allocated, inspections, etc.). Those rules, upon adjustmentson a \"learning by doing\" mode, have been effective for more than a century .4477 In Japan, the offshore, distant fisheries and deep-water resources are managed in much the same way as other countries, by granting licenses to commercialcompanies. The inshore fisheries, however, have a long history of collectivemarine tenure arrangements, comparable to the one of land commons inEurope, with records that at times go back nearly a thousand years. 4488The cur- rent co-management system assigns regulatory authority at national and region-al levels and decision-making power mostly at the local level. 4499This arrange- ment was designed to formalise traditional fishing rights, which in the pastwere in the hands of village guilds. Interestingly, the maritime tradition of Japannever included the idea that the sea could be an open access environment. 5500 The rights are vested now in local fisheries co-operative associations, with membership based on residency and a period of apprenticeship in 52de Sherbinin, 2000. The members of a co-operative obtain their own individual rights of use, which are not transferable.5511The co-operative associations own the local coastal waters but need to apply to the government for fishing licences, which theythen distribute among their members. The national government establishes thetotal allowable catch for the offshore and coastal fishing areas, and the localco-operatives sub-divide the quota among the fishermen. In addition, and inco-operation with other local authorities and partners, the co-operatives set upregulations, special projects, management plans, commercial ventures, purchase of supplies, and so on. Rio Grande da Buba 5522is a brackish estuary with very productive fisheries, a high density of marine and terrestrial mammals and a wide range of bird life inthe south-western coast of Guinea Bissau. Since the early 1990s the IUCN hasfacilitated there the development of co-management arrangements betweenlocal villages and government agencies for the sustainable use of fisheries. Thelocal fishermen were assisted to organise and set up among themselves a creditscheme based on traditional customs, which was remarkably successful. At thesame time, government-assisted research was underway to identify sustainablelevels of fishery exploitations. When it became clear that barracudas werebeing over-exploited, the local communities and government agencies agreedon promulgating and enforcing limitations on the number of boats and the useof fine meshed nets during reproduction time. These limitations have beenoverall very well respected. In the meantime, the IUCN was supporting thecommercialisation of fish through women's co-operatives, which met astounding commercial success. Prior to the conflict that unfortunately engulfedthe country in 1998 there were more than 30 organised groups of fishermenand women fish-sellers in Rio Grande da Buba. They had managed to stabilisetheir fishery catch while greatly increasing the benefits for their own communities. All the above was accompanied by repeated requests for trainingand social support by villagers, the result of successful village-driven develop-ment efforts. At the time of this writing some relatively peaceful if not stablepolitical conditions have returned to the country and the fishermen organisa-tions are active as ever, demonstrating a remarkable sustainability andresilience, and the capacity to survive even the 1999) Between 1993 and 1998, 63 villages in Khong district, Champasak province, southern Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) established co-management regulations to sustainably manage and con-serve inland aquatic resources, including fisheries in the Mekong River, streams, backwater wet-lands, and rice paddy fields. Local government endorsed these regulations, but the villages them-selves choose what regulations to adopt based on local conditions and community consensus. Thesame communities are now empowered to alter regulations in response to changing circumstances. Up until the 1950s and early 1960s fisheries practices in Khong were largely traditional. Fishing was conducted almost entirely for subsistence purposes, with the exception of a small amount of bartertrade for certain high quality preserved fish, and the resources were managed as common property.Over the last few decades there have been many changes in aquatic resource management patternsin Khong district, and in Laos as a whole. The human population of Khong has increased rapidly.Lines and nets made of nylon, including mono and multi-filament gillnets, have become extremelycommon. As fish now fetches higher prices in the market and people are becoming accustomed toconsumer goods, subsistence fishing has turned into market fishing. The Lao PDR is supporting co-management with the assistance of some specific projects. Communities generally learn about this from neighbouring villages, friends and relatives, or fromgovernment officials. If their leaders are interested, they write a short letter to the Khong districtauthority, who later come to visit and assist in the process of developing a co-management plan (seealso Boxes 5.10, 6.10 and 9.21). The plan included detailed regulations, such as fisheries conserva-tion zones (partial or total), bans on stream blocking, on using lights at night, on chasing fish intonets, on destroying flooded forests and forests at the edges of the river, on using frog hooks andtraps, on catching juveniles, and so on. It is generally up to the village headmen to assure that regu-lations are implemented. Most communities rely on a mixed strategy that includes enforcement ofregulations and awareness raising, which are both important, especially at initial stages of imple-mentation. The aquatic resource co-management programme in Khong has been very successful. It has enhanced village solidarity, increased natural resource management capacity and increases the fish and frogstocks and catches. It demonstrated to be a most important option for equitably managing naturalresources in the region. 53King Mahendra Trust, 1994. ......iinn mmoouunnttaaiinn eennvviirroonnmmeennttss Mountain environments present unique difficulties for the development of co- management settings. The relevant territories are often large, sparsely populatedand comprise difficult terrains, sometimes including barriers that separate entirecultures and countries. And yet, remarkable examples of co-managed naturalresources in mountain environments do exist. In the Annapurna ConservationArea\u2014 an internationally renowned high mountain environment in Nepal\u2014 alarge-scale attempt at integrating conservation and local development has beenpromoted and supported for a decade by the King Mahendra NatureConservation Trust. 5533Local, regional and national organisations discuss on an on-going basis the specific management decisions to be taken at various levels(including decisions over distribution of tourism revenues). The main aim is toinvolve all the relevant parties in management, so that their interests, concernsCO-MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES 8954Kettel, 1996a and 1996b. fully taken into account. Several committees participate in developing specific agreements, and dedicated agents called lami (matchmak- ers) facilitate the process. A similar co-management experience is also pursued, albeit with different mechanisms and results, in the buffer zones of some National Parks in Nepal.5544 This builds upon several years of experience and positive results in community forestry initiatives in the country, another example of co-management involving governmental agencies and local communities.5555In Pakistan, the Mountain Areas Conservancy Project is engaging local communities, concerned government departments and various conservation agencies such as IUCN,WWF, the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme and the Himalayan WildlifeFoundation. One of its aims is the development of community conservancies. Aconservancy has a territory (usually a watershed), various conservation committees and a valley conservation plan and fund. The pluralist watershedconservation committees are organised into clusters and apex bodies at eachlevel. 5566 In Scotland, the Cairngorms Area is an important element of the natural heritage\u2014 probably the largest integral area of high and wild ground in theUnited Kingdom. The Area is managed by a Partnership Board composed of 20members in representation of a wide range of social actors with relevant interests and concerns. In turn, the Board calls together the even larger spectrum of concerned individuals, groups, agencies and organisations thatneed to agree and co-ordinate action if any measure of conservation and sustainable development is to take place. This is done in meetings and conferences, privately and in public, and via many community-outreach activities. Through such extended consultations, the Board has developed a conservation and sustainable development strategy. 5577 Zoning is a major means of composing different interests and concerns in the strategy, and several projects have been identified in different zones. A similar pluralist management setting is sought but far from being achieved for the Mont Blanc region, a foremost scenic and biodiversity icon in Europe. This charismatic mountain environment, shared among Italy, France andSwitzerland, is home to 30 municipalities with important common culturalcharacteristics developed through centuries of human and economicexchanges. On paper, a Trans-boundary Conference for the Mont Blanc and anambitious joint programme have been set up, but in practice only the electedpoliticians of the three countries seem to have a voice in the management ofthe area, downplaying environmental concerns, responding only too well toeconomic imperatives and derailing any attempt at genuine participatory conservation attempts. 5588Currently, an umbrella NGO is actively organising national and international meetings among social actors concerned with thefuture of the mountain, its people and culture, and demanding an active role Schachenmann, 2000) Ambondrombe is a sacred mountain and historic site on the border between Betsileo and Tanala lands, towards the southern end of the Malagasy eastern escarpment between Ranomafana and AndringitraNational Parks. Still relatively intact, dense tropical forest covers its flanks, giving way to rare cloudforests at the summit. At lower elevation to the East, the forest dwelling Tanala cultivate mainly bananasand robusta coffee. At lower elevation to the West the undulating savannah gives way to the manicuredfarms of irrigated rice, tobacco, maize, potato and fruit trees of the Betsileo agriculturists. In the lastcentury, the Ambondrombe Mountain and surrounding lands were also inhabited by several generationsof Betsileo royal families. These families called in some Merina people, who brought in their handicraftand agricultural skills. The Merina's cultural influence was absorbed rather then fought by local people,and its impact is still evident today in local architecture, handicrafts, legend, folklore and taboos. Forboth the Tanala and Bestileo peoples, the mountain forest offers rich natural resources, abundant water,relatively fertile soils, wood for building and cooking, natural fibres, medicinal plants and a vast varietyof bush food for hunting and gathering, It is only too reasonable that they both claim the mountain for-est as part of their ancestral inheritance and favour settlements of their own people at the edges of thisforest corridor. More claims are also coming from new migrants and stakeholders (scientific, commer-cial and tourism) as Ambondrombe constitutes the only intact biodiversity bridge left between northand south along the eastern Malagasy escarpment. How can the complex interests and conflicts at play be effectively managed to conserve this unique natural and cultural jewel of Madagascar? The exceptional self-help spirit of local elders and leadersaround Ambondrombe is showing the way. A community-based natural and cultural resource manage-ment programme has started with voluntary forest guards organised by a committee of village elders.The elders are accustomed to protecting the forest against illegal migrants and settlers and to make surethat the use of local resources is done in a sustainable way according to customary laws ( dina). The programme is taking advantage of a state-approved system of natural resource management called GELOSE ( Gestion Locale S\u00e9curis\u00e9e , or local security of resource management) in which they work with various national and international, governmental and non-governmental partners (see also Box 3.7 inthis Chapter). The Water and Forests Service assists in land use and fire control and management. AnNGO is helping with reforestation for timber and firewood, training local farmers in plantation management, sawing and semi-industrial charcoal production with improved mobile kilns. AnotherNGO assists in agricultural diversification and intensification, e.g., the restoration of silk worm production for the weaving of traditional garments ( lambas ) and in agroforestry approaches. Local con- sultants assist with a comprehensive ecotourism strategy, involving the descendants of the Betsileo royalfamily, custodians of cultural and sacred sites in the area. The stakes are high and the challenge is impressive. In the course of the negotiations the poor face the rich; the local visions, aspirations, actions and taboos stand up to global perspectives, interests andinfluences; the demands of traditional subsistence livelihoods clash with the ones of modern economy;and the local governance system based on customary law needs to deal with the rules and inflexibilityof a modern nation state. Fortunately, all the stakeholders involved have expressed a common aim:developing and applying self-help approaches to preserve the natural and cultural diversity and identityof the unique Ambondrombe mmiiggrraattoorryy wwiillddlliiffee Co-management arrangements do not necessarily refer to a specific territory or area of sea. Such is the case for agreements on the management of migratoryCO-MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL specific animal species, for instance the Beluga whales found in the coastal and estuarine areas of the Eastern Canadian Arctic. Thisspecies of whales has been managed for years through agreements betweenFisheries and Oceans Canada and various communities and organisations of theInuit indigenous nation. Under the agreements, female whales are protected, thereis a sanctuary area where calves can grow undisturbed, and hunting rules areestablished and respected 5599. Similarly, a large herd of porcupine caribou, ranging across two Canadian territo- ries and the state of Alaska, is managed as a result of an international agreementbetween the governments of the USA and Canada. 6600The herd is of major eco- nomic and cultural importance to a number of Alaskan and Canadian indigenouscommunities. This is true not only because the caribou meat is an essential com-ponent of their diet. Hunting, preparing the meat and sharing the harvest are thebuilding blocks of their cultures. The agreement between the USA and Canadaprovides for the constitution of the International Porcupine Caribou Board, incharge of developing a management plan for the herd and its habitat. In Canada,a similar \"national\" Board exists, including members from the Gwich'in TribalCouncil, the Council for Yukon Indians, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the YukonTerritorial Government, the Government of Canada and the Government of theNorthwest Territories. Every year, management plan updates and reports areagreed upon and distributed among the various interested groups within Canada,and across the border. Possibly the best known example of co-management of migratory wildlife is the CAMPFIRE initiative in Zimbabwe. 6611The initiative\u2014 described also in case exam- ple 1.3 in chapter 1 of this volume\u2014 has succeeded in establishing many specificpartnerships amonglocal wildlife(including the largeanimals prized by tro-phy hunters), anddirectly sustain the rel-evant opportunity costs and direct damages. Occasionally they also activelyimprove the habitat of wildlife, for instance by digging water pits for the elephantsin case of severe droughts. On the basis of a specific Act of the national govern-ment, the district authorities are in charge of wildlife management. The nationalNGOs and research institutions provide technical and organisational help to theproducer communities and district authorities. The business operators organise theflow of tourists and hunters that inject financial resources into the system and pro-vide a return to the producer communities and the district administrations. Theinitiative has obtained positive results for both conservation 59Drolet et al. , 1987. 60Porcupine Caribou Management Board, 1995. See also Table 8.1 in Chapter 8. 61Jones the local economy and livelihoods. At the time of this writing, big game hunting seems to remain the only economic initiative strained but not substantially affected by the current socio-political crisis in the country. Big gamehunting remains popular, allowing a relatively stable source of income to thewildlife-dependent communities. The CAMPFIRE initiative has been so successful that it has been replicated under similar models in Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, and hasinspired practice in many other African countries. The devolution of managementauthority and responsibility to local communities, however, has been more or lesseffective depending on a country-by-country basis. In Namibia the communitiesthat joint together to form conservancies (see Box 3.13) have substantial decision-making power. The 51 communities in the surroundings of Tanzania's SelousGame Reserve\u2014 one of Africa's oldest and largest protected areas\u2014 on the otherhand, have much less power. They are assigned rights and responsibilities overthe wildlife that penetrates in their territories in a rather paternalistic way. 6622And yet, even such limited levels of authority and responsibility seem to make a signif-icant difference. There appear to be a reduction in poaching between theSerengeti and Selous by a factor of 10, attributable to the fact that only in the sur-roundings of Selous the local communities benefit from the wildlife that movesout of the park into their adjacent lands. 2003) Namibia has about 75% of its wildlife outside formal state-run protected areas. Private farms devel- oped a multi-million euro industry based on consumptive and non-consumptive uses of wildlife. Butindividual farm units are not large enough for successful game farming, as game requires large areaswhere to take opportunistic advantage of pasture growth and water supply in arid and unpredictableenvironments. Mobility and flexibility are the keys to survival. Private farmers soon realised theadvantages of pooling their land and resources to manage wildlife collectively and established \"con-servancies\" with common operating rules, management plans and criteria for distribution of incomederived from wildlife. There are now at least 24 conservancies on private land in Namibia (therewere only 12 in 1998) covering an area of close to four million hectares. Efficiency of scale meansthat their returns are more than twice those of individual wildlife ranches. Namibian communities have followed suit. There are now also 15 \"community conservancies\" in Namibia, managing another four million hectares of land with more than 200,000 wild animals,including endangered black rhino, endemic species such as Hartmann's mountain zebra, and largeparts of Namibia's elephant population. Important habitats managed by community conservanciesinclude the western escarpment of the central plateau, which is a major centre of endemism, sea-sonal and permanent wetlands; northern broad-leafed woodlands; and west flowing rivers whichform linear oases in the Namib Desert. Several community conservancies have set some of theirland aside as core wildlife and tourism areas within broader land use plans and wildlife has been re- introduced to at least three such conservancies. Torra 6644, a community conservancy with more than 350,000 ha in north western Namibia, has one up-market tourism lodge generating about \u20ac50,000 annually. Trophy hunting is worth nearly \u20ac18,000 annually and a recent sale of Springbok raised 62Baldus et al. , 2003. 63R.K. Bagine, Chief Scientist of Kenya Wildlife Service, personal communication, 2003. 64Torra is the first and most economically successful community conservancy in Namibia. Other conservancies are less fortunate in terms of tourism potential and the lack of sustainable income may constitute a problem for their long-term viability.

The size of the conservancy means that it could certainly develop two more lodges with- out causing environmental damage or spoiling the wilderness experience for tourists. This wouldmore than double the existing income, making considerably more money available for the 120households once the operating costs of about \u20ac18,000 have been covered. 65See, for instance, West and Brechin, 1991; Barzetti, 1996b; Borrini- Feyerabend, 1996.

A survey of biosphere reserves concluded in 1995 that they had made little progress in involving comm uni- ties in decision making. The study stated that collaborative action was slow to develop, alternative lifestyles were not taking hold, biolog- ical scientists were remaining in the drivers' seat and local participation was not given the attention it deserved (IUCN, 1995 ). ......iinn mmaannaaggiinngg pprrootteecctteedd aarreeaass Protected areas IUCN categories\u2014 from national parks to protected landscapes\u2014 are increasingly managed by partnerships involving governmentaland non-governmental actors. 6655The 2003 World Parks Congress in Durban (South Africa) endorsed recommendations that identify and acknowledge several gover-nance types for protected areas (PAs), including co-management and communitymanagement (community conserved areas). The openness to a diversity of institu-tional arrangements was recognised as a determinant of strengthening the man-agement and expanding the coverage of the world's protected areas, addressinggaps in national PA systems, improving connectivity at the landscape andseascape level, enhancing public support for conservation, increasing the flexibili-ty and responsiveness of PA systems, improving their sustainability and strengthen-ing the relationship between people and nature. It was also endorsed that theIUCN PA category system (based on key management objectives) was to be inte-grated with a new dimension for \"governance type\" and strengthened with refer-ence to cultural management objectives (more attention to be given to the crucialties between biological and cultural diversity). As major as they appear, thesestatements do not signal a change in orientation but, rather, the full legitimisationof processes underway for several years, which were already recognised at theWorld Parks Congress in Caracas (1993) and at the Seville InternationalConference of 1995. 6666The Caracas Congress stressed the importance of \"conser- vation partnerships\"6677and the Seville Conference emphasised that the biosphere reserves are to be managed with the active involvement of local authorities,NGOs and economic operators, in addition to local communities, scientists andconservation professionals. 6688 An interesting example of a biosphere reserve engaged to transform the partici- pation theory into practice is the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Colombia), thehighest coastal mountain range in the world (it raises to 5,775 meters just 42kilometres from the Caribbean coast). There, the Fundaci\u20acn Pro-Sierra Nevadade Santa Marta conceived and tirelessly supported a collaborative process todevelop a strategy for the preservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use ofnatural resources. Innumerable meetings have been held among various institu-tional actors\u2014 including representatives of thirteen municipalities, two nationalparks, the indigenous inhabitants of the territory, the business sector (heavilydependent on the Sierra as a \"water factory\"), as well as the army and evensome guerrilla groups and paramilitary factions. Despite the foreseeable spec-trum of opinions and interests among stakeholders, some common concernscould be identified and a large number of Santa Marta, 1997. 70Harmon, 1991. 71Statham, 1994. 72Wilson, A., 2003. 73Allali-Puz, B\u00e9chaux and Jenkins, 2003.into a Sustainable Development Plan for the whole bioregion.6699This Plan is the expression of a major social agreement developed under extremely difficultsocio-political conditions. The implementation of the plan is understandablyconstrained by the political instability of the area, but the process has been verypositive overall. In some parts of the world, the participatory approach to protected area manage- ment has been for some time the rule rather than the exception. In WesternEurope, for instance, the interests of local people are central to the stated objec-tives of protected areas (\"...the well-being of those who live and work in theNational Parks must always be a first consideration...\" 7700), privately owned plots are commonly included in the protected territory, and local administrators arelargely involved in management activities. This is not surprising, as the land-scapes of Europe are the product of a long history of interaction between peopleand the land. In fact, biodiversity values are often found in association with tra-ditional land uses (such as pastoral farming systems) and the most appreciatedlandscapes are those that combine natural and cultural features. For such \"cul-tural landscapes\", as aptly described by Phillips (1996): \"... the real protected area managers are not the park rangers but the farmers and the foresters who live there and make use of the land in a traditional way, as well as some branches of regional or local government in democratic represen- tation of local residents. Day to day conservation is undertaken in partnership with a range of stakeholders in the public, private and voluntary sectors. In this sense, collaborative management has been widely practised in Europe for many years \". An example in point is the North York Moors National Park (United Kingdom), which includes land settled and farmed for millennia.7711The landscape encom- passes large areas of semi-natural vegetation\u2014 such as ancient woodlands\u2014interspersed with grazing areas, hedgerows, farmland and some small towns andvillages. The relationship between the park and the local people is so close thatthe Park Management Plan is included as part of the general plan of Town andCountry Development, prepared with the extensive involvement of the public. Infact, most of the land in North York Moors is under private ownership (a factorcommon to many protected areas in Europe) and the management plan is there-fore dependent on the co-operation of the landowners. Management agreementscan be signed between the landowners and the Park Authority and are consid-ered to be legally binding contracts. The agreements are entirely voluntary,although the Park Authority can provide financial incentives and compensationsin return for agreed works or environmentally sound farming practices. Land usechanges can be controlled in part by the Park Authority, but farming activitiesgenerally remain outside these controls. The formal structural arrangement forco-management involves regular meetings, various forms of consultation, localinput to the management plan and the representation of the local community onthe Management Board. The Park Director, however, believes that the attitude ofboth management and the local parties is the most important ingredient of thisvery effective collaboration. 7722 In France, the power of a new approach, citizen-based and citizen-controlled, to establishing and man-aging protected areas. For each ofthe 38 existing PNRs in the country(covering 11% of the national territo-ry), the state retains its role of evalu-ator and supervisor but all otherdecisions, from boundaries to man-agement objectives, are taken bylocal social actors. Such decisionsare collected into \"the Charter\" ofeach Park, a voluntary contractamong all the relevant parties. Inother words, the citizens get together(usually through their elected repre-sentatives but also because of theimpulse of NGOs and others) anddecide that they want to managetheir land, protect their natural andcultural patrimony and experimentwith the best way of doing it. Together, they generate a vision, transcribe it intothe Charter, and identify a variety of initiatives, partnerships and new and inno-vative agreements to take the Charter to action and awaken the natural, culturaland economic potential of the land. They themselves originate the request to thegovernment that their land is declared a Regional Natural Park, which is a stampof environmental quality. The state delivers the denomination on the basis of cer-tain criteria and withdraws it if and when the criteria are no longer respected. Atypical PNR is managed by a mixed body gathering elected officials at variouslevels and socio-professional representatives. This body works in on-going, closeconsultation with the civil society at large, organised in commissions, commit-tees, etc. The adherence to the PNR is totally voluntary (a municipality can\"keep itself out\" of a PNR even if entirely surrounded by it) and the territory ofthe Park is entirely 2003) The Tayna Gorilla Reserve located in North Kivu, DRC was created in 1999 through collaboration between conservation agencies and two traditional leaders of the Batangi and Bamate people. TheStatutes for this \"Community-based Reserve\" of 800 sq km constitute a formal agreement between thecustomary landholders, government and NGOs. Local people directly participate in the management ofthis protected area, whose goals includes both the conservation of biodiversity and the promotion ofrural development. In this region of ongoing armed conflict, the Tayna forest guards are unarmed, andrepressive protection measures are not employed by them. Communities have been directly involved inthe development of the Reserve's management plan, including to establish a forest zoning scheme andto address the long-term development of the protected area. The Reserve programme recognises thatcustomary use of the local resources will continue as part of the long-term management and conserva-tion of the forest habitat. Key dilemmas faced by this initiative are the degree to which unauthorised useby outsiders can be prevented during periods of political instability, and how to include the localPygmy population, which so far has been marginalised in the process of establishing this Western Europe, in most countries of the developing South the forms of participatory management of protected areas now in place has evolved as a sortof \"last resort\" measure. Many have been promoted to palliate the scarcity ofmanagement funds, to deal with situation of high political uncertainty (see Box3.14), or to mend long standing conflicts. 7744The latter was the case, for instance, for Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, one of the most famous and valuablenational parks in Uganda, including as the habitat of the rare mountain gorilla. Atthe establishment of the Park the conflicts between local residents and parkauthorities were so severe that \"spontaneous fires\" in the park became a commonphenomenon. Local people even refused to help when a ranger died in the area. 7755 This was entirely understandable, as the local communities had been suddenly deprived of access to forest products needed for their own physical and social sur-vival (forest foods, honey, medicinal herbs, poles, vines necessary to build theirtools, etc.). Fortunately, a number of studies ascertained the conditions for sustain-able, non-damaging use of some Park resources and a project supported by theCooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) facilitated the develop-ment of co-management agreements between the Uganda Wildlife Authority andthe local communities on the border of the Park. 7766The agreements guarantee that a number of community-selected and certified local users can extract a limitedquantity of specific resources ( e.g., vines, honey, medicinal plants) from the National Park. In exchange, the communities agree to comply with rules andrestrictions and assist in conserving the habitat as a whole. The \"spontaneousfires\" have greatly diminished and the relationship between the Park authoritiesand the local communities has substantially improved. Co-management is also embraced in other National Parks in Uganda. In Ruwenzori, agreements were developed to specify in detail what types of rulesand limits are to be followed for the collection of specific types of resources in thepark area ( e.g., for mushrooms, medicinal plants, honey, etc.).7777Similarly, agree- ments are being signed between the Park agency and local parishes for Mt. ElgonNational Park and Kibali National Park, assigning some surveillance responsibilityto local groups, which, in turn, are allowed to gather natural resources that can beextracted in a sustainable way ( e.g., bamboo shoots). Between 1996 and 1998 a number of agreements were developed and tested in both Mt Elgon7788and Kibale.7799Kibale entered into eight agreements, involving 29% of surrounding parishes. Of these, three agreements were for harvesting wild coffee in the park bypeople in Mbale, Kabirizi and Nyakarongo parishes (each parish consists of about10 villages), one agreement allowed extraction of multiple resources such aspapyrus, craft materials, medicinal plants, grass for thatching and access to craterlakes for fishing at Nyabweya, and four agreements allowed placement of bee-hives inside the Park. Meanwhile Mount Elgon entered into three agreements thatprovide access to a wide range of subsistence resources, such as firewood, anddozens more were developed later. As a whole, Mount Elgon is attempting toengage about 20% of its surrounding parishes (over 10,000 households) in collab-orative resource management agreements. The Ugandan experience has beenfinancially and technically supported by several foreign donors and internationalNGOs. 74See, for instance, West and al.1997. For an illustrative review of conflicts around protected areas and ways to attempt managing them, see Lewis, 1997. 75Philip Franks, personal communication, 1995. 76Wild and Mutebi, 1996. 77Penny Scott, personal communication, 1993. 81See Kothari et al. , 1996. As an example, in Kaila Devi Sanctuary (western India) local pastoralists have access to pasture in the sanctu- ary's territory in return for help in monitoring against illegal grazing and mining (Kothari, 1995). Several action research st udies have been carried out on the possibility of developing joint management agreements in a number of protected areas (Kothari and IIPA T eam, 1997). 82Risby et al., 2002. 83Blomley and Namara, 2003. 84See Box 4.3 in Chapter 4. On 14 October 2003, the Constitutional Court of South Africa ruled that indigenous peoples had both communal land ownership and mineral rights over their territory. Laws that tried to dispossess them are to be considered \"racia l discrimination.\" The decision is that indigenous people who own land under their own unwritten law have the right to have this upheld in spite of the legal systems subsequently imposed by the state. This ruling has important implications also for other countrie s, such as Botswana, which operate under the same \"Roman-Dutch\" legal system. 85See examples described in Boxes 3.16, 4.4, 4.9, 4.10, 7.10 and 8.5. Many co-management initiatives for protected areas in the South begin timidly, as if the government agencies were afraid to lose power if the experiments went toofar. Most often, the local institutional actors are invited to participate only in anadvisory way. For instance, this was the case in Jamaica, where an AdvisoryCommittee including representatives of different interests and concerns was estab-lished during the setting up phases of the Blue Mountains National Park. 8800In India, the debate on the possibility of Joint Protected Area Management (JPAM) isvery lively and pilot initiatives are being promoted in selected protected areas, 8811 but their importance is much less than the one of the Joint Forest Management Programme. Even in the Ugandan cases described above, much is still to be doneto assure the true and effective engagement of local actors. The agreements satisfysome of the needs of local communities and give them a new status and a voicethat may grow with time, but the Uganda Wildlife Authority still retains full man-agement authority. When \"participatory planning\" is limited to \" consulting \" local actors, it cannot and does not affect the substance of accepted management nar-ratives and related action. 8822Some ask whether the experience is not more an attempt to shed responsibilities than to devolve rights.8833 The partnership approach to managing protected areas is likely to have to expand under the current socio-political and economic conditions. Several countries areunder pressure to restructure their internal budgets, and reluctant to invest scarceresources in government-run conservation. Sharing the burden among variousentities, public as well as private, or even transferring control of territories to com-munities or private owners are becoming increasingly appealing options. Evengovernments that expect major tourist revenues out of the conservation invest-ments are concerned that local social support is essential to guarantee the condi-tions for tourism to prosper. Meanwhile, the growing reality of private engagementin conservation is becoming better known and recognised and, in the wake of thefifth World Parks Congress of 2003, a wide constituency is building up around therecognition of the conservation importance of community conserved areas andco-managed protected areas. As part of this, a major phenomenon can be singledout: land restitution claims by displaced indigenous and local communities areacquiring legitimacy and sprouting innovative solutions. 8844And, after years of hos- tile relationships, indigenous peoples and local communities and national conser-vation agencies are beginning to work together to establish and manage new uunnddeerr sstteewwaarrddsshhiipp ccoonnddiittiioonnss Land Trusts are a key force in land protection in the USA and Canada.8866Basically, they involve a partnership among an environmentally oriented NGO, some localauthorities, state authorities (when relevant) and a number of local landowners.The NGO, typically staffed by volunteers and endowed with a tiny budget,mobilises to respond on a timely manner to special conservation opportunities orrisks. It contacts a number of landowners in adjacent lands and convinces them toagree to some management practices, sign a conservation easement and/ ordonate their land for conservation purposes. The landowners are motivated byconservation values and positive social pressure but also by the tax advantagesprovided by local authorities and/ or the state to those who enter into such a part-nership. At times, the agreement is simply a verbal statement between the landowner and the NGO, with technical assistance sometimes provided to the landowner. It mayinclude restrictions to certain types of land development, assurance of keeping theland under appropriate use ( e.g., forestry or agriculture) or assurance of using spe- cific management practices ( e.g., integrated pest management or run-off control devices). In other cases, full management plans are agreed upon by the landown-ers and the NGO or a conservation easement (deed restriction) is signed. The lat-ter formally prohibits \"in perpetuity\" certain land uses ( e.g., infrastructure devel- opments and buildings) and allows only others ( e.g., traditional agriculture). In other words, land ownership is retained with restriction of uses. For an easementto be effective, a specific legislation needs to be developed and approved, usuallyto provide tax incentives to the signatories of the easement. An extreme form ofLand Trust is the one in which the landowners donate their property to the NGO,which assumes the responsibility to manage it. There are now over 1,200 LandTrusts in the USA (a third of them in New England) and many are also found inthe Atlantic coast of Canada. The basic outcome is more land dedicated to con-servation while people enjoy their property rights but also save in terms of taxes. Conservation partnerships with the private sector are not limited to the North America continent. In South Africa, for instance, the National Parks Trust hasnegotiated an agreement with a private group, the Conservation Corporation, forthe management of the Ngala Game Reserve. This led to the establishment of thefirst \"Contract Reserve\" between Kruger National Park and a private enterprise.Signed in 1992, the agreement foresees that the Conservation Corporation hasexclusive rights for operating tourist activities over 14,000 hectares of KrugerNational Park. The Corporation pays dues to the Park, which uses them forwildlife management, research, educational programmes and community-basedprojects in areas bordering the protected environment. 8877This is an example of a quite extreme partnership, basically the passing on of management authority to aprivate institutional actor in exchange for economic benefits to be re-invested inconservation. Another private arrangement is found in Belize. There, the Community Baboon Sanctuary was formed in 1985 to protect one of the few healthy black howlermonkey populations still existing in the world. Unlike other wildlife managementprojects, the sanctuary is a voluntary, grassroots conservation programme depend-ing on the co-operation of private landowners within active farm communities.Nearly all the landowners in the eighteen-square mile 99River signed voluntary conservation pledges to make their farming practices com- patible with the preservation of the habitat of the black howler monkey. Eachlandowner pledged to follow an individual conservation plan, receiving onlymodest financial support from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Societyof Milwaukee County. ......pprroommootteedd bbyy ccoonnsseerrvvaattiioonn Conservation and Development Projects (ICDPs) grap- pled for years with the complexity of issues at stakes and the multiplicity of actorsinvolved in pursuing joint conservation and development goals. Recently, thecontractual approach has become a fairly commonplace response to such com-plexities. 8888In this approach, more or less formal contracts spell out the rights and responsibilities of various parties ( e.g., donors, local authorities, local communi- ties, natural resource user groups) for the management of a territory or set of natu-ral resources. Typically, a contract assigns to a local community the responsibilityto carry out certain management tasks and/ or prevent certain destructive prac-tices and unsustainable uses. In exchange, the community receives an assuranceof access to certain natural resources and benefits and/ or it is provided withexternal aid in various forms Mali's Kita district, the local forest reserves used to be heavily exploited by firewood merchants with the tacit consent of forestry officers and authorities. In contrast, local residents\u2014 dependent on theforests for firewood, timber, game and other non-wood products\u2014 were subjected to fines and impris-onment if they entered the forest even to gather for their livelihood needs. They were denied access tothe forests that belonged to their ancestors from times immemorial. Obviously, strong hostile relationsdeveloped between the villagers and the forestry officers. From the early 1990s, that hostility has givenway to new forms of collaboration as a direct result of an experimental project supported by theInternational Labour Organisation (ILO). The project, with joint development, conservation and socialorganising objectives, focused on elaborating new contractual arrangements for wood supply and forestmanagement. After completion of a forestry and socio-economic study, the project began by hiring some local vil- lagers to carry out forest improvement works, including regeneration, scarification, and the building offirebreaks and access roads. The collaboration was stipulated in labour contracts and the work wasremunerated with carts and donkeys, so that the villagers could more easily transport wood to the vil-lages or to the town of Kita. This equipment, together with the experience gained in performing theforestry improvement works, enabled the villagers to undertake further contracts. The new contractswere more specific and sophisticated, and through them the villagers agreed to comply with forest man-agement rules in exchange for a direct share of profits from the sale of wood. The villagers receivedtraining on methods of cutting and species to be preserved, and the amount of wood authorised for har-vest remained a fraction of the regenerative capacity of the forests concerned. The latter Contracts forWood Supply and Forest Management were institutionalised in 1991 by an Interim NationalGovernment sensitive to the needs of rural populations. This took place despite the opposition offorestry officers at regional and district levels, who did not readily accept either a partnership with thevillagers or the obligations this entailed (loss of power, financial gain, etc). The contractual forest exploitation is closely linked to the establishment of a wood distribution network 88For a review of experience with integrated conservation and development projects that recommends the contractual approach, see: Larson, Freudenberger and Wyckoff-Baird, 1997. See principles defined by the villagers and the state. Contractual exploitation, in fact, competes with uncontrolled and illicit exploitation. A revised taxation system now gives prefer-ence to wood derived from contractual exploitation. Together with tight controls at the entrance to thetown of Kita, this is providing an incentive to contractual exploitation. A system of tax rebates\u2014 toestablish funds for forest improvement and maintenance works, and for village investments\u2014 is underconsideration by the Government. A share of the rebates would be received at the local level. Entrusting villagers with forest management and exploitation has increased their sense of responsibility for the forest resources within their village lands. Through their own organisation (which now includesa federation uniting about thirty five villages), villagers currently survey their local forests and requirethat merchants pay for the resources they gather, rather than getting them for free. Moreover, the role ofthe forestry officers has been redefined as advisory, rather than enforcement or executive. All this hadpositive consequences on the villagers' own sense of dignity. The acceptance of the contractualapproach at the national level, as well as its integration into the country's forestry legislation, generatedgreat interests in rural populations outside Kita district. Rural people throughout the country are impa-tient to become involved in controlled contractual exploitation. 89Prasittiboon, 1997. 90GBRMPA, 1994. 91This ruling, which recognises that a native title existed under British common law, is known as the Mabo Decision.In general, many ICDPs have now adopted a methodology that includes an in- depth stakeholder analysis early on into operations, stakeholder workshops toinvolve various partners in the design and implementation of initiatives and con-flict mediation support. Setting up various kinds of pluralist workshops and com-mittees has proven useful in various circumstances. For instance, CARE hashelped set up a pluralist task force in the process of demarcating the boundariesof the Pa-Kluay community territory (a Karen community in northern Thailand),the local forest, the Doi Inthanond National Park and three neighbouring com-munities. 8899The Task Force included several villagers from the local communi- ties, staff of the forest department and staff of the national park. The demarcationwas carried out with the satisfaction of everyone involved with the help of bothin-forest surveys and analysis of existing maps of the area. ......wwiitthh iinnddiiggeennoouuss ppeeoopplleess In the last decades, many indigenous peoples have negotiated agreements with national governments for the management of their ancestral territories. InAustralia, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (a major source of revenue to thecountry\u2014 more than one thousand million Australian dollars per year 9900) is man- aged by a specific Authority with hundreds of staff and a budget larger than thenational budgets of some small countries. In the last decade or so, the Authorityhas substantially developed its position vis-\u00e0-vis local interests and concerns in the management of the Park. In the beginning, they used to only consult thestakeholders (including the Aboriginal People and people whose livelihooddepends on Park resources). Then they started calling for workshops among localstakeholders to agree on specific management decisions ( e.g., zoning arrange- ments). Now, some stakeholders ( e.g., representatives of the Aboriginal People from the area) sit permanently in the Management Board of the Authority itself.This latter development happened after a ruling by the Australian High Courtrepealed the concept of terra nullius (no-man's land) held true at the time of the colonial conquest of Australia, and began the complex process of recognisingthe tenure rights of the Aboriginal People. 9911The development also built upon the positive experiences of co-management regimes established elsewhere in theCO-MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES 101country ( e.g., in Gurig, Coburg and Kakadu National Parks9922) and on the positive experience of the Authority itself in its interaction with local institutional actors.The trend appears to be from informal to formal mechanisms, from advisory topower-sharing roles, from a management focus to a policy and planning focus. 9933 In Canada there exist several Joint Management Boards, on which both repre- sentatives of government agencies and indigenous peoples sit.9944Such Boards deal with a full range of management matters, from long-term strategic planningto daily operations. The Boards, established by legislation, have formalised theright of indigenous stakeholders to participate in management. Numerousumbrella agreements have obtained legislative backing, 9955and under those agreements several communities have, in turn, prepared their own co-manage-ment plans (only some of those plans, however, take into account the interestsof non-indigenous stakeholders 9966). Despite this, a recent review reports only a few bright spots (see Box 3.16) and not a few problems with regards to theestablishment and management of national parks in aboriginal land in Canada,especially regarding the Government's \"duty of consultation\" with the owners ofaboriginal title. 9977The Supreme Court of Canada has not offered a clear direction on this, stating that the nature and scope of such consultation may \"vary withthe circumstances\". 92See Table 4.3 in Chapter 4; Hill and Press, 1994; and Smyth, 2001. For Australia as a whole an impressive and far-sighted devel opment now sees Indigenous Protected Areas, declared and run by the Aboriginal People, recognised and supported as part of the nationa l pro- tected area system. See Chester and Marshall, 2003. 93Weaver, 1991. 94East, 1991. 95For instance: the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement of 1975; the Inuivialuit Agreement of 1984 in the western Arctic; the Nunavut Agreement of 1993 in the eastern Arctic; the Yukon First Nation Settlement Agreement of 1995 and the Nis'gaa agreement of 1996 in northern British Colombia. Some non-aboriginal groups failed to be recognised as legitimate parties in the agreements ( Fikret Berkes, personal communication, 1996). 96In the early agreements, the Management Boards included nearly exclusively representatives of government agencies and aborigina l peo- ples, and some of the latter fought to exclude from the agreements other stakeholders, such as sport hunters (Fikret Berkes, pe rsonal com- munication, 1996). In some later agreements, the Boards include non-aboriginal, non-governmental stakeholders as well (Stephan Fuller, personal means \"islands of wonder and beauty.\" The Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, located within the Queen Charlotte Islands off the coast of British Columbia,was established in 1986 under an agreement between Parks Canada and the Council of the HaidaNation. The Haida themselves initiated the process, after their land and culture started to disappeardue to heavy logging in their traditional territories. Through alliances with conservation organisations,the Haida people drew international attention to the spectacular beauty and diversity of their home-land and the need to protect it. The dual Park-Reserve status stems from the land ownership dispute.Both the government of Canada and the Haida claim ownership of the land. Fortunately, both sideshave been able to put aside their differences regarding ownership and promote instead their commoninterests and goals. The Haida intent is to protect the area from environmental harm and degradationand continue traditional resource uses. The federal government's intent is to protect the area as a natu-ral cultural environment as part of the national protected area system. Such objectives are perfectlycompatible, leading to a relationship based on respect, reciprocity, empowerment and effective coop-eration. In fact, Gwaii Haanas is now governed by a joint Management Board, made up of two Haidarepresentatives and two Parks Canada representatives, working by consensus. This may slow but assures that they are all well thought out and widely accepted. The connections between land and culture are vital for the Haida, who are dependent on the natural resources forlivelihood (through fishing, hunting and trapping) and also for medicines and the expression of theircultural identity through art. Five heritage sites within the borders of Gwaii Haanas are of particularhigh value to the Haida and are carefully protected. All this has been recognised and supported byParks Canada. Consultation during the establishment and management of the protected area was ade-quate, and the process was not rushed (it took five years to come to an agreement). The establishmentof the Park has promoted a shift in the local economy from logging to tourism. Employment opportu-nities have also been created by the Park itself (more than 50% of Park staff is Haida people). Theonly remaining challenge is to acknowledge the Haida presence, rights and participation in the man-agement of the boundary waters of Gwaii Haanas. To the Haida, there is no separation of land andsea. Parks Canada, on the other hand, is promoting a new federal legislation that could disrupt theHaida Nation's ability to move freely between the land and the sea by introducing different levels ofprotection for various areas and restricting the fishing rights in some of those areas. Several inspiring examples of management collaborations between indigenouspeoples and national conservation agencies exist in Latin America, some of whichare described elsewhere in this volume. 9988In Asia co-management is accepted in principle in the Philippines and is being put into practice in the buffer zone of theNational Park of Ratanikiri in Cambodia and in the Annapurna Sanctuary inNepal. 9999 In Papua New Guinea \"wildlife management areas\" are a special type of protect- ed area initiated by local communities on their customary territories and only laterformalised by official government legislation. 110000An example in point is the Bagiai Wildlife Management Area, declared in the Bagiai Island in 1976. The area occu-pies slightly more than half of the island and was declared under protectionbecause the local people had become concerned about the decrease in wildlife,the over-fishing and the clearing of vegetation. The management rules for the areanearly entirely prohibit the use of firearms, large nets and lamps to attract fish atnight, and ban fishing altogether in certain seasons. The central crater in theisland is declared a sacred area, which cannot even be visited. The indigenouscommunities developed all these rules and boundaries and the government partic-ipated only in the sense that it approved and codified them and had them printedin the National Gazette. Not only did the process succeed in improving theresource status in the area, but also managed to legitimise the traditional owner-ship rights of the indigenous peoples in the absence of other legal avenues for theregistration of customary claims. For cases such as the last one, in which the participation of the national authority is rather \"hands-off\" and limited to a policy decision, the terms \"community-based management\" or \"indigenous management\" are also appropriately used inplace \"co-management\". 110011Hopefully, however, these examples of direct man- agement by indigenous peoples remain examples of co-management as well. Thisis the case if they still associate in management a multiplicity of institutionalactors within the local communities and societies. 98See Boxes 4.4 and 4.10 in Chapter 4. as well as Parques Ferrari, 2003. 100Fauna Protection and Control Act ssyysstteemmss From the examples described above, we can draw some general understand- ing and identify characteristics pertaining to co-management approaches. zCo-management capitalises on multiplicity anddiversity . Different social actors possess different capacities and comparative advantages in manage-ment, and a partnership stresses and builds upon their complementary roles. Different social actors, however, may also possess contrasting interests andconcerns. The challenge is to create a situation in which the pay-offs foreveryone involved are greater for collaboration than for competition. zCo-management is usually multi-party but also multi-level and multi-disci- plinary. Processes, agreements and institutions are inclusive rather than exclusive, they attempt to include all the bearers of interests and concernswho wish to participate. Yet, inclusiveness has to be balanced by therequirement to contain the transaction costs of the process (information pro- vision, individual consultations, large facilitated meetings, translation costs,time and skills to negotiate, etc.). zCo-management is based upon a negotiated, joint decision-making approach and some degree of power-sharing and fair distribution of benefits among all institutional actors. While the type and extent of power-sharingand benefit distribution varies from situation to situation, all entitled actorsreceive some benefits from their involvement. This fact alone may uplift theleast powerful stakeholders, redressing power imbalances in society and fos-tering social justice . zCo-management strives to assure all relevant actors of the chance and capacity to express concerns and take part in decisions on the basis of enti-tlements recognised by society. In short, co-management attempts toachieve more equitable management. Yet, equity does not mean equality and different grounds for entitlement need to result in different roles inresource management. zCo-management stands on the principle of linking management rights and responsibilities . In the words of Murphree (1996b): \" Authority and responsi- bility are conceptually linked. When they are de-linked and assigned to dif- ferent institutional actors, both are eroded\" . zCollaborative management stands on the concept of common good, the trust that it is possible to follow a course of action that harmonises differentinterests while responding, at least to some extent, to all of them. An inclu-sive, collaborative approach to the identification of institutional actors and negotiation of management agreements is a necessary condition for thecommon good to be identified and achieved. zCo-management is part of a broad social development towards more direct and collaborative democracy. In it, the civil society \u2014 organised in forms and ways that respond to variable conditions\u2014 assumes increasingly impor- tant quality of public opinion . This means that people understand the consequences of their choices (risks and oppor-tunities) and are willing to pay the price for those. Both an excellent flow ofrelevant information andtransparency in the management process are essential for this. Yet, different people hold true different values, opinionsand wishes even on the same basis of \"factual\" information. Co-manage-ment strives to recognise such cultural differences while building upon some underlying common interests. zCo-management initiatives can take on a large variety of shapes and forms and need to be tailored to fit the unique needs and opportunities of each context . Approaches to stakeholder participation in different environments have to be sensitive to their specific historical, cultural and socio-politicalcontexts and cannot be appreciated outside of such contexts. CM regimesmay present very different characteristics from place to place. zCo-management builds upon what exists, in particular local, traditional institutions for resource management. It usually begins with an analysis of existing management systems, including institutional problems and opportu-nities. The next step is to strengthen what can be strengthened, also drawingfrom the creativity and inventiveness of new management partners. In tak-ing advantage of the capacities and practices of new actors, co-manage-ment may play an important role in socio-cultural innovation . zCo-management is a process 105rather than the strict application of a set of established rules. Its most impor- tant result is not a management plan but a management partnership, capa-ble of responding to varying needs in an effective and flexible way. As inthe case of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, 110022intervening changes in legal, political, socio-economic and ecological factors induceconsequent modifications to the institutional setting and/ or practice of con-servation. In addition, a process of \"learning by doing\" generally leads towards a better recognition of specific needs, and new opportunities toinvolve institutional actors. Potential advantages for natural resource management exist in all types of arrangements, but so do potential problems. For instance, when authority isfully in the hands of a local body which has broken loose from traditionalsocial controls, this may be co-opted by powerful individuals for their owninterests, which may win over the interests of both conservation and thenational and local communities. Conversely, when control is fully in the handsof a public agency, local rights, knowledge and skills in resource managementmay go unrecognised. In some cases, there can even be a decline in biodiver-sity as a result of the removal of people from a given territory .110033 Is co-management thus a panacea? Should it be attempted and pursued in all possible circumstances? Indeed, it is not and it should not be pursued in allcircumstances. If the social actors with relevant interests and concerns are noteffectively organised, capable of conveying their positions and willing todevelop an agreement, the time and resources invested in a collaborativeprocess may be fully wasted. In other cases it may simply not be wise to havepeople express openly their opinions and concerns when they could exposethemselves to violent repression and persecution. In addition, mistrust amongthe social actors (at times amply justified by lack of transparency and goodfaith) can stall negotiations seemingly forever (see Box 3.17). As a matter offact it seems appropriate to close this chapter, which listed many relativelysuccessful examples of co-management settings, with an example of failedagreement and persistent conflicts. Co-management is not easy and indeedrequires a constellation of circumstances to be taken of variation of management regime, see Bertrand and Weber, 1995. 103Ghimire and Pimbert, 1997; Brown and Wyckoff-Baird, 1994. 104On this, see also Chapter 4 and Part Miskito people, living on the north-east shore of Nicaragua, are the indigenous owners of one of the largest and least disturbed tracts of coral reef in the near shore Caribbean. The Miskito Shelfcontains large expanses of coral patch and bank reefs, large beds of sea grasses and severalcoastal lagoons and associated wetlands, habitat of rare species such as the manatee and a smallcoastal-marine dolphin. For a long time, the Miskito control of their reef and shoreline has been acontested matter. Their opponents included foreign powers and commercial fishing businesses(one can count eleven wars against invaders since the early 1970s). More recently, they alsoincluded the Sandinista government (at the time of Contra-led insurgencies), resource pirates anddrug dealers, and US-supported conservationists attempting to establish a biosphere reserve in thearea. With whatever means they could master, the Miskito have consistently opposed the resource106 SHARING POWERmanagement schemes proposed from outside their communities. What they wish is to establish their own indigenous coral reef management system based on customary rights and responsibili-ties, including regulation of fish catch, number of allowed fisherfolk and access to fishing areas.They also need concrete help to defend themselves against the large-scale exploitation of theirmarine resources by outsiders. In 1991, twenty-three coastal Miskito communities, the Nicaraguan Ministry of Natural Resources and an international conservation NGO formally agreed to establish the largest Latin Americancoastal marine protected area, including the Miskito's Reefs. The agreement included provisionsfor Nicaragua to recognise the Miskito ownership of their ancestral land, lagoons and sea territo-ries, and to assist in protecting them against resource piracy, industrial fishing and drug trafficking.The indigenous communities would manage the protected area with some technical assistancefrom outside, and receive financial assistance to carry out a number of conservation and develop-ment projects. The Nicaraguan government administration includes people interested in donor funding and tourist revenues (and thus in favour of resource conservation), but also others accustomed toreceiving income from the sale of fishing permits and payoffs by resource pirates and drug traffick-ers. As a result of internal power struggles, the government soon retreated from the initial agree-ment and attempted to open up to commercial fishing a large corridor that cut in two the originalarea to be managed. It also declared protected territory an inland area including five communitiesthat had not yet entered the discussions on agreement. As not uncommon in the developingSouth, the government ministries of Nicaragua had little financial means, poor disposal of techni-cal capacities, and overlapping and conflicting internal authorities (different ministries and branch-es responsible for conservation, commercial fishing, fishing permits, law enforcement and regionalgovernance). In addition, they were used to planning for short-term goals only and showing anomnipresent desire to control the natural resources from far away offices. It is not surprising thatthe interests of the Miskito people found themselves in contradiction with those of the govern-ment. In 1992, a local Miskito NGO was created to protect the local interests in management. The name of the NGO is Mikupia, meaning \"Miskito heart\". Despite meagre means, Mikupia managed tofoster environmental discussions and organising in several communities. But new and powerfulactors soon entered the scene. As soon as the provisional protected area was declared, a numberof conservation and development NGOs from the North received some major funding to assist inthe management and further their own goals\u2014 such as the conservation of local biodiversity butalso more prosaic conservation of their own organisations and jobs. About 10% of the financialresources made available by the donors went to the Miskito communities and Mikupia. Theremaining 90%\u2014 in the name of \"community-based development\"\u2014 was disbursed to US-basednon-governmental organisations (with the consent of both the US donors and some branches ofthe Nicaraguan government). A new biosphere reserve management plan was soon prepared, withno mentioning of the provisions agreed upon in the initial plan\u2014 in particular the measures toconfront piracy, industrial fishing and drug trafficking, and the conservation and developmentprojects to be carried out by the local communities. On the contrary, the funds meant for thoseprojects were spent to support the operations of the Northern NGO that considered itself the deci-sion-maker on behalf of the communities and developed the management plan according to itsown analysis and understanding.CO-MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES 107 The Miskito communities eventually learned the truth and realised that the foreign NGOs were more inclined to blame them for resource depletion than to support them in obtaining theirresource rights. They banned the NGO from their land, and denounced it to the US donor. Aninvestigation from the US donor was carried out, but did not acknowledge any wrongdoing on thepart of the NGO. This prompted the Miskito communities to ban also the US donor from theirregion. Despite these heated conflicts, the US donor decided to invest in the contested project and assigned management responsibility to other international NGOs, again without consultation oragreement with the Miskito people or their local NGO. On their part, the Miskito Reef communi-ties created their own Miskito Community Protected Territory, and are now busy fighting drug traf-ficking and resource piracy in their area, and mapping their reefs and marine resource. The \"colo-nialist conservationists\" are still banned from their territories and of departure for co-management (CM) is a situation in which sev- eral social actors\u2014 bearing different interests, concerns and capacities for themanagement of a given territory or set of natural resources\u2014 not yet found, orpossibly not even explored, the possibility of joining their forces and agreeing ona way to do it together. These actors may comprise indigenous and local commu-nities, local authorities, government agencies and representatives at different lev-els, NGOs, associations, individuals with special interests and private companiesand businesses of various kinds. In recent decades, the number of social actorsinterested in managing natural resources has increased as a result of widespreadsocio-political change, including governments' decentralisation processes, the pri-vatisation of previously state-controlled initiatives, the emergence of new demo-cratic institutions, and the proliferation of NGOs, associations and business com-panies. Many such \"new actors\" perceive environmental or social problems andopportunities and believe that they can adequately respond to those if they areallowed to participate in management decisions and actions.Chapter 4. A POINT OF DEPARTURE... A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 111Box 4.1 WWhhaatt ttyyppee ooff ddeecceennttrraalliissaattiioonn?? (adapted from Ribot, Alcorn et al. , 2003) The term \"decentralisation\" describes an act by which a central government formally cedes power to actors and institutions at lower levels in a political-administrative and territorial hierarchy. If those arelocal branches of the central state ( e.g., prefects, or local administration and technical ministries) the process is referred to as \" administrative decentralisation \" or \" de-concentration \". If those are private bod- ies such as individuals, corporations or NGOs, the process is called \" privatisation \" or \" delegation \". If those are local authorities downwardly accountable to local people, the process is called \" democratic decentralisation \" or \" devolution \". The powers that can be transferred are: legislative (elaboration of rules), executive (implementing and enforcing decisions) and judicial. These powers and the financial resources to implement actions arerarely transferred together in integrated packages or ways that create positive synergies, a fact that com-plicates the process and often creates conflicts. Extremely rare are the territories or natural resources not under some form of man-agement ( de jure or de facto ), even if not outright \"visible\" or discernible by non- local people. Usually, one or a few social actors have access to the resources andcan take management decisions. Others are excluded and may sometimes feel(and be) damaged, deprived of their rights, unjustly treated and unsatisfied. Theyalso may be attempting, overtly or covertly, to gain access to natural resources andtheir benefits, engendering acute or chronic conflict situations. In other cases, thecontrol over natural resources is shared among some organisations, groups or indi-viduals, but the rules and conditions of this sharing are unclear or have fallen indisrespect. Or the management activities are simply ineffective, and are themselvesa cause of ecological and economic damages. In some extreme cases it may evenbe that control on the part of any one actor is utterly limited and that the resourcesare in an \"open access\" state, with no one willing or capable of exercising man-agement authority. In all the cases just mentioned, the need to attempt more effec-tive and collaborative solutions is likely to become, sooner or later, evident. Yes but... where to begin? In an ideal case, all relevant social actors would together take the initiative to meet, decide what to do and share fairly amongthemselves the relevant management rights and responsibilities. They would aimat a negotiated agreement and would have all the necessary means and capaci-ties at their disposal, including professional help and time to negotiate.Unfortunately, this ideal case is far from common. A more typical situation seesonly one or a few social actors holding most of the authority and the means to seta partnership process in motion. A co-management process is thus stronglydependent on the initiative of the most powerful parties, a good reason to explainwhy the phenomenon is not yet as widespread as it could be. This notwithstand-ing, the variety of \"prime movers\" and practical occasions to initiate a co-man-agement process is impressive. These comprise responses to ecological andsocio-economic crises (including natural disasters and conflicts over resources, such as legal battles and violent clashes), the emergence of new legislation and favourable socio-political changes (e.g., attempts to promote more equitable and democratic societies), new conservation or development initiatives (especially internationally-assisted projects) and, last but not least, the dedication and com-mitment of some exceptional individuals it was deforestation and the loss of local control over forest resources that prompted villagers to organise sit-ins in the state forestry directors' officesuntil their grievances were heard and at least some solutions were found. 11In Argentina, a destructive succession of floods and droughts made everyone awareof the need for co-operation in managing local water resources. 22In Canada, co- management agreements marked the end of decades of legal conflicts opposingthe federal government and the representative of Indigenous Nations. In Ecuador,a major natural disaster ushered a wave of cooperation, solidarity and joint initia-tives (see Box 4.2). In many island states, the growth of tourism and its impact onlocal livelihoods generated social conflicts that eventually provided the impetusfor CM processes (see Box 3.9 in Chapter 3). Box In the municipality of Paute (Ecuador), much has changed in less than a decade. It all started after an event that disrupted everyone's life: the \"disaster of the Josephina\". In the Spring of 1993, a landslidefrom the hill of Tamuga dammed the rivers Cuenca and Jadan. The natural dam resisted for some time,but eventually broke down and flooded a huge area, including several villages and the town of Paute.The residents of the town\u2014 originally not a particularly cooperative population\u2014 ended up sharing thesame plastic tents and precarious uphill quarters for months. They had to live together, organise them-selves for basic necessities, talk and listen to one another. Later, they had to clean up the town from thetons of mud that invaded it and rebuild all that had been destroyed. From this long and humiliating butalso empowering experience, a new sense of communality and solidarity was born. They begun with an organisation called Paute Construye, which started rebuilding the damaged or destroyed homes with a totally new conception of community involvement in all stages\u2014 from the defi-nition of who should be helped on the basis of local \"scale of need\" (defined and established by thepeople themselves), to the local drawing of construction plans (all houses being different and designedaccording to the needs of the families to live there), to the cooperation between families and new organ-isations of local artisans in the construction of the houses themselves. A women's network was created,which is still active ten years later with training, various types of production and credit initiatives. Thepeasants from the driest rural areas got together and built one of the most ambitious irrigation and watersupply efforts in the region. The artisans created new associations and improved their skills, a new coop-erative credit scheme was set up (now serving 11 municipalities and having more than 10,000 members)and several community buildings were collectively designed and constructed. Currently, a five yeardevelopment plan has been developed and approved for the Municipality of Paute. The Plan is simplebut extraordinary, as it is centred on common visions of the relevant people about what they want theirmunicipality, and their single parishes, to become. The visions were developed in local communityworkshops and, from those visions, specific areas of intervention were drawn and for each of those anumber of specific projects, many of whom are now in operation. The process that developed the plan was as important as the product. The participation of all actors, and the local communities in particular, has been its true heart. Support was provided by the Church, a localNGO called CECCA (Centro de Educaci\u20acn y Capacitaci\u20acn del Campesinado del Azuay) and the munici- pal authorities. Innumerable meetings and workshops took place in forty-three villages and urban quar-ters of the seven parishes in the municipality, as well as many encounters with the main agriculturalemployers (production of flowers for the foreign markets) and the national, regional and district institu-tions. Early in 1999, as a consequence of all these meetings but also because of contingent social rebel- 1Madhu Sarin, personal communication, 1997. 2See the example of Encadenadas Lakes, in Argentina, described in Section 3.2 under \"water and watershed management\".A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 113lion against corruption, the process gave birth to the Municipal Development Committee, a local parlia- ment with representatives of 27 organisations. The development plan has been the result of the work ofthis committee, with ideas from workshops at the grassroots being sent to the committee, which com-mented upon them and sent them back to the grassroots, which commented and sent them back againfor final approval, in an iterative process. The committee has also established some local expert commis-sions to assess specific issues or problems. Once the decisions are taken, an Executive Committee hasthe responsibility of carrying them out. The Executive Committee is composed of four delegates from theMunicipal Development Committee and four representatives of the municipality, headed by the Mayor. Not everything is well in Paute. Many peasant families still survive on smallholdings in harsh environ- ments, health and social problems are serious, migration from the area is still high, environmental prob-lems with roots in the last fifty years of unplanned \"development\" are very severe. With respect to othermunicipalities, however, Paute shows a tremendous difference in terms of local organizing, solidarity,achievements and hope. Surely, this is because of the presence of generous and genial individuals thatmotivated and supported the participatory process. Most likely, however, this is also because of theshock\u2014 and aftershocks\u2014 of the disaster of the Josephina. 3In turn, this was the result of the work of some exceptional individuals (Child, 2003). See also case example 1.3 in Chapter 1 of this vol- ume. 4Child, 2003. 5Wilson, R.K., 2003. Chapter 3. 7de Noray, 2002. 8See a brief description of the Landcare initiatives in Section 3.2 of this volume. 9Numerous examples are illustrated in this volume. See, for instance, Boxes 3.6, 3.7, 3.13, 4.3, 5.5, 5.9, 5.12, 5.14, 6.11, 6.1 7, 7.11, 7.15, 9.5, 9.8, 9.17, 9.22.In Zimbabwe, the CAMPFIRE operation owed its existence to a new piece of leg-islation assigning wildlife management power to \"deserving\" districts, 33and its sub- sequent success to the economic profitability of the sector and to the fact thatmany operations were self-directed and motivated. 44In Madagascar, the GELOSE law, providing for the transfer of management rights and responsibility of commonpool natural resources to local communities under specified conditions, ushered aseries of impressive social processes and NRM regulations. In the United States,the 1964 Wilderness Act, the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, the 1972Endangered Species Act, and the 1976 National Forest Management Act all con-tained provisions for public input into agency decision-making. And yet, theystressed public participation in an individual and nationalistic sense rather than ina collective or community-based sense and did not generate much dialogue ordiscussion. The factor that prompted the enormous popularity currently enjoyedby collaborative stewardship of forests\u2014 by 1997, 90% of US forests were man-aged through some co-management structure\u2014 was, in fact, the success of a fewconcrete examples of collaborative regimes. 55 In Mali, an ILO project prompted the conditions for a new share of benefits and responsibilities between the government and the local villages in forest manage-ment. 66In Cameroon, an initiative for the rehabilitation of the Waza Logone flood plain identified the need for collective management institutions and assisted thelocal society to express them. 77In Australia, informal discussions among local farmers are at the roots of the impressive and widespread Landcare co-manage-ment programme. 88And all over Africa co-management agreements have been developed to attempt providing a solution to the many conflicts opposing localcommunities and authorities in charge of enforcing protected area regulations. 99At the roots of effective co-management are often some visionary and dedicated individuals. Some of them work hard for a long time to prepare the conditions forlocal NRM agreements. Others suddenly change the scene by introducing newincentives. In the region of Menab\u00e9, in Madagascar, Mady Abdoulanzis managedto awaken a relatively sleepy, depressed and dis-organised civil society by callingit to decide what to do with a sizeable sum of money. Mady was a Member ofParliament and in the early 1990s he had been offered, according to a nationallaw, some resources to help in the \"economic development\" of his constituency.Many other MPs spent those resources enriching their friends and personal sup-porters. Mady called the social actors in the region (\" les forces vives de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \") to meet, analyse together the situation and decide case of Miraflor (Nicaragua) is an uncommon example of the opposite situa- tion. There a cooperative of small-scale farmers successfully struggled to havetheir land declared under a protected status (protected landscape under IUCNCategory V) 1100and co-managed with the environment ministry. This demand for officially-sanctioned constraints was a conscious attempt to make the land lessattractive to resourceful landowners who had started buying it up, and to avoidthe health and environmental problems the farmers had experienced elsewhereunder large scale production approaches. 1111The farmers offered the environment ministry their commitment to a livelihood based on small-scale, organic farmingand their support to rehabilitate the local cloud forest patches. In exchange, theyobtained legal and management support to remain in control of their land andsome financial support from external donors. 1969, the Makuleke community of the Limpopo province was forcibly removed from a tract of land in the northeastern-most corner of South Africa. Their land was incorporated into the KrugerNational Park (KNP) and the community relocated some 70 km towards the south. Close to thirtyyears later, ownership of the land was returned to them by way of a co-management agreementwith the South African National Parks (SANP). This settlement was negotiated under the auspices ofthe land reform programme launched by South Africa's first post-apartheid government. Land ownership gave the Makuleke substantial bargaining might and the settlement fundamentally changed the balance of power between the two parties. The agreement made it possible for theMakuleke to pro-actively pursue their interests in the land relative to those of the SANP and thestate. It also created a secure framework for the longer-term conservation of the Makuleke Region'sexceptional biodiversity. A lack of conflict around management issues is often indicative of the prevalence of an oppressive relationship. In this instance, the open conflicts that emerged as part of the redressing of rights afterthe fall of the apartheid regime were successfully settled as part of the co-management process. Theimplementation of the agreement did not immediately \"solve\" the controversies, but all tensions wereultimately dealt with within the framework of the agreement. With the resource base secured, the ulti-mate success of the \"Makuleke model\" will depend on the Makuleke leadership's ability to ensure therational and equitable distribution of the benefits of conservation to all sections of their community. 10IUCN/ WCPA, 1994. 11Munk Ravnborg, 2003.A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 115resources for the best environmental and social returns. This led to the significant engagement ofmany people and, over the years, the Comit\u00e9 R\u00e9gional de D\u00e9veloppement (CRD) du Menab\u00e9 became a model of civic engagement and partici-patory decision-making for the whole country andthe true \"development and regulations engine\" inthe region. As Mady used to say, the strength of theCRD was that, despite no legal mandate, it had allthe legitimacy one could desire! Energetic and enthusiastic individuals are invari- ably found in nearly all situations where a man-agement partnership successfully developed. Thesepeople may be local residents, project staff andconsultants, or government and NGO personnel.Community leaders may take the initiative to meetwith governments to claim specific rights and solvespecific conflicts and problems. NGOs andresearch professionals may seek alliances to pro-mote the conservation of a territory in manage-ment limbo or of a species in jeopardy. The staff incharge of a protected area may call for local actorsto discuss common issues and concerns and reachsome agreements for the benefits of both the terri-tory and the surrounding communities. 1122Such dedicated individuals usually prompt the creationof a local team to find the needed resources and toset the co-management process in motion (moreon this later). Some distinctions should be made among the impressive variety of \"potential beginnings\" for amanagement partnership. Co-management is, overall, a political process. The aimof many of its promoters is a more equitable management of natural resources.But the aim may also be the co-option of others, and the gaining of unfair advan-tages over established entitlements. As briefly discussed in Chapter 1 of this book,colonialism and the emergence of nation states and private property have progres-sively weakened and disempowered the traditional, community-based institutionsin charge of common property resources in many countries. From such a startingpoint, a co-management regime may offer new chances to local institutions\u2014 e.g., village committees and community user groups\u2014 to regain lost influence and positively affect the environment and society. Some indigenous peoples arealso using co-management agreements as a way of securing their entitlementsover their ancestral lands (this has been the case for some time in Canada,Australia and now in various countries in South America, see Box 4.4). From dif-ferent starting points, however\u2014 for instance where traditional structures are stilleffectively in charge of indigenous domains\u2014 a move towards shared manage-ment responsibility with the government and other actors should be carefullyevaluated (see Section 4.4 in this Chapter). 12It may seem paradoxical that government staff initiates a process to relinquish some of their powers. Indeed, this is still the exception rather than the rule, but conservation professionals are increasingly aware of the benefits to be expected from co-management a gree- ments. Many are willing to go well beyond the call of duty to improve the long-term chances of the protected areas they are ent rusted with. et al. , 2003) The Alto Fragua-Indiwasi National Park was created in February 2002, after negotiations involving the Colombian government, the Association of Indigenous Ingano Councils and the Amazon ConservationTeam, an environmental NGO focusing on projects to assist the Ingano and other indigenous peoples inthe Amazon basin. The Park is located on the piedmont of the Colombian Amazon on the headwatersof the Fragua River. Inventories conducted by Colombia's von Humboldt Institute determined that thesite is part of a region harbouring the highest biodiversity in the country and is also one of the tophotspots of the world. The protection of the site will assure the conservation of various tropical Andeanecosystems, including the highly endangered humid sub-Andean forests, some endemic species such asthe spectacled bear ( Tremarctos ornatus ) and sacred sites of unique cultural value. Under the terms of the decree that created the Park, the Ingano peoples are the key actors in charge of its design and management. The area\u2014 whose name means House of the Sun in the Ingano language\u2014is a sacred place for the indigenous communities. This is one of the reasons why traditional authoritieshave insisted that the area's management should be entrusted to them. Although several protected areasof Colombia share management responsibilities with indigenous and local communities, this is the firstone where the indigenous people is fully in charge. This has been possible thanks to Colombia's legis-lation that recognises traditional authorities ( Asociaciones de cabildos ) as legal subjects with faculty to develop their own development plans, including environmental management provisions. The creation of the Park has been a long dream of the Ingano communities of the Amazon Piedmont, for whom it naturally fits their Plan of Life ( Plan de Vida ), i.e.,a broad, long-term vision for the entirety of their territory and the region. The creation of Alto Fragua-Indiwasi National Park, with the Ingano asprincipal actors in the design and management of the site, represents an important historic precedentfor all the indigenous peoples of Colombia and elsewhere, and an example to follow. 13For a case of co-management derailed in mid-course in the Republic of Congo, see Box 9.25.There is no simple way of distinguishing between a co-management process that leads to increased social justice and more sustainable use of natural resources,and one that may \"sell-out\" existing entitlements or resources. The unique set ofentitlements recognised at a given time over a body of natural resources is asocio-cultural construct, a product of a negotiation in a given historical and socio-political context, which can only be appreciated in its light. It is clear, however,that important power differentials among the relevant social actors do notcreate a positive and constructive climate. And it is clear that some basic political andsocial conditions ( e.g., freedom to express needs and concerns, freedom to organ- ise, confidence in the respect of laws and agreements, some democratic experi-mentation allowed in society) need to be present for the process to develop.When these conditions are unclear, a co-management process can be complex,long, arduous and even distressing and confused. Rather than a smooth operation,one should expect surprises, conflicts, the emergence of contradictory informationand the need to retrace one's own steps. 1133And yet, with good will and political support, a co-management process can also be smooth and rewarding... Given the need to cope with social complexity and the dependence on political feasibility, we would venture to state that effective co-management regimes arethe expression of \"mature societies\". Mature societies can be defined as societieswhose institutions enjoy a widespread sense of legitimacy, whose collective rulesare generally respected and whose internal socio-political structuring is vibrantA POINT OF DEPARTURE... 11714Examples are the so-called \"weak states\" or societies dominated by examples are found among traditional societies, and some also among modern societies. The opposite are societies that combine utmostcentralisation of decisions, feeble respect of rules and the repression of free socialstructuring. 1144Indeed, mature societies tend to reject the myth of unique and objective solutions to manage natural resources. They instead realise that thereexists a multiplicity of suitable options compatible with both traditional and scien-tific knowledge systems and capable of meeting the needs of conservation anddevelopment... as well as a multitude of negative or disastrous options. The rele-vant parties in the co-management process analyse and choose among suchoptions in the light of their multiple interests, concerns, capacities and entitle-ments. They generally seek to define and foster both effectiveness and equity inthe management of natural resources but, in so doing, they also bear upon someof the most important aspects of social life\u2014 such as human and economic devel-opment, citizen participation and culture. In a generic situation in which one or more social actors are concerned enough to be willing to work towards a management partnership, they usually begin by thefollowing steps: zidentify the management unit and main social actors with interests, concerns and capacities to manage it (at times referred to as \"relevant social actors\") zre-assess together the need and feasibility of co-management in the specific context and for the specific unit; zif co-management is found to be needed and feasible, identify the human and financial resources available to support the process; zestablish a \"Start-up Team\" to promote and facilitate the process up to the set- ting up of the multi-party negotiating forum. The above are not always undertaken in a conscious fashion or in the order men- tioned. Sooner or later, however, an analysis of the relevant management unit andactors and of the needs, feasibility and resources available is done for all CMprocesses. These steps will now be explored in more detail. TThhee nnaattuurraall rreessoouurrccee mmaannaaggeemmeenntt uunniitt At the very beginning of the CM process, the territory or resources to be managed should be identified, at least in a preliminary way. This is very important and lessstraightforward than it may appear. A natural resource management (NRM) unitneeds to make ecological sense, i.e.,it should comprise the essential elements of an ecosystem, allowing the coherent planning and implementation of needed ini-tiatives (sustainable use, protection, restoration, etc.). The natural limits of anecosystem, however, are often hard to define, and even more so when we try tocomprise into a \"unit\" all the key factors impinging upon the ecosystem. Forinstance, a coral reef can be affected by the detritus and pollution brought to thesea by a river. Should the relevant NRM unit comprise only the reef or also theriver basins opening into it? If we wish to conserve the reef, it is apparent that weneed to act at the level of the river basins\u2014 a fact that significantly enlarges thescope of management. In addition, a management unit needs also to make economic sense, which can118 SHARING illustrated by another example. Let us say that most of the benefits of pro- tecting a given watershed are enjoyed by the inhabitants of a plain, while thecosts are felt by the inhabitants of the upper watershed alone. For the sake ofmanagement effectiveness, but also of equity and sustainability, the inhabitants ofthe plain should be involved in bearing some of the management costs and theinhabitants of the upper watershed should be receiving some of the relevant bene-fits. In this sense the whole river basin would be a more appropriate managementunit than the upper watershed or the plain alone. Thus, if we wish to make surethat a NRM unit is ecologically and economic coherent, we often see it grow insize. This is not necessarily a problem, but the larger the size the more numerousthe social actors that will ask/ need to be involved. In the example of the reef, wemay see the relevant communities multiply, as well as the affected municipalities,some of which may be centrally interested in the reef management and othersvery limitedly so. In addition, besides fishing and tourism operators, we will seethe agricultural and industry sectors becoming hotly involved. In other words, thedefinition of NRM unit brings us to face the complexity of socio-ecological sys-tems while the \"solution of the problem\" necessarily involves a compromiseamong competing requirements. In traditional societies there is generally a remarkable coincidence between a dis- tinct body of natural resources and a social unit (\"local community\") closely relat-ed to those resources. Many villages have been created to take advantage of thewater and forest products related to a patch of forest or a mountain system, or tothe fishery resources of a coral reef. Many nomadic tribes coincide with the man-agement of specific wintering and summering (or wet season and dry season) pas-ture grounds and the migration routes in between. Specific social groups or tribeshave been, through generations, the caretakers and users of a given spring, animalspecies or portion of a river. In fact, in traditional societies natural resource man-agement and social organisation are closely intertwined (see Box 4.5). As commu-nities manage and conserve natural resources they ensure other needs, such asfood production, dwelling, income and security, and they exercise and continu-ously re-build their identity and culture\u2014 all of which instil and strengthen their social interdependence. Inmore than one way, thus, theterritories, areas and naturalresources under the care of atraditional community identi- fya management unit in a rather straightforward andnatural way. This does not mean that at community level all is sim-ple. Overlaps between theterritories under the care ofdifferent communities, in particular nomadic andsedentary communities, doexist. They present particularchallenges today, in the con-text of diminishing resourcesfor livelihoods and larger A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 119numbers of people. Boundary issues between sedentary communities may also be thorny, as it may be the management of water and wildlife, not usually confinedto the territory of any one community. Ideally, issues related to broader problemsand opportunities would define a higher management level where the representa- tives of the communities and other relevant actors can meet and agree on com-mon decisions. In this sense, an effective management structure would comprise aseries of nested NR management units (for instance several micro-catchment unitsmanaged by different communities, nested within a river basin watershed, itselfpart of a larger island ecosystem). Besides linkages among management levels, the key challenge in nested systems is about the effective interaction between traditional and \"modern\" authorities.Most governments are organised in a compartmentalised manner, with separateline agencies handling different issues and objectives at different levels, andadministrative responsibilities that do not reflect ecological or socio-culturalboundaries. Because of this, communication and collaboration between commu-nities and governmental agencies at one or more of the nested levels may not beeasy. The fact remains, however, that territories and resources traditionally man-aged by different communities offer a natural way to subdivide an environmentinto viable management units, and that nested management bodies offer tonational governments ingenious ways to benefit from existing capacities 4.5 \"\"NNaattuurraall\"\" ggeeooggrraapphhiicc uunniittss iinn aabboorriiggiinnaall mmaannaaggeemmeenntt ssyysstteemmss (adapted from Weinstein, 1998) The aboriginal fisheries of coastal British Columbia (BC, Canada) were differently organised than the contemporary fisheries that derive from European fishing traditions. The geographic scale was very dif-ferent, as were the rules for who had access. The details of the organisation varied among different cul-tural groups. Some groups used formal, quasi-legal arrangements to limit and transfer rights of access toresources. Other groups controlled access more informally by limiting the distribution of critical knowl-edge about the territory and its resources. For the Nisga'a and the Gitksan, the lands and adjacent coastal and riparian areas were divided into territories. These territories belonged to house groups, or wilp, whose membership was defined by matrilineal descent rules. Typically, the boundaries of a territory radiated from a reach of the coast orriver shore up mountain slopes, framing a salmon stream in between. Each house had exclusive owner-ship rights to their territory and its resources. The separation of land into controlled territories was thebasis for the traditional management system for fisheries and for other natural resources. In general, contiguous territories, consisting of a drainage area or a coastal inlet and its tributary drainages, were recognised as belonging to specific tribal groups. These territories might be consideredthe geographic units for the aboriginal management systems. The tribal groupings were made up of kin-ship units, which often resided in one large dwelling, housing about 50 people. These house groupswere the coastal societies' economic unit. The house groups held recognised tenure to designated areasand resources within the tribal territories. A group's economy was based on the resources within thearea to which they held rights. The specifics of management varied among the different cultural groups,but all coastal BC groups appear to have had two institutions in common: 1) territorial resource harvest-ing rights held by residential corporate kinship groups, and 2) an obligation for the leaders of thesegroups to publicly demonstrate adequate resource husbanding through the ceremonial re-distribution ofharvested products.120 SHARING POWERA rather safe option for identifying a NRM unit may be to start from a relatively small and clearly delimited geographical territory or set of resources, selected aspreliminary. Alternatively, one can start from a recognised social unit and itsmanagement territory. When such a unit is fairly small, the actors who negotiatethe co-management agreements are likely to be the same ones later called toimplement the related activities, a characteristic often conducive to good man-agement. In addition, smaller units are easier to manage than larger ones. Infact, many professionals would maintain that the best management level is thelowest possible one with the sufficient capacity to take decisions and authorityto implement them. This criterion, which goes under the name of \"subsidiarity\",derives from various religious and cultural traditions, including Catholic socialteachings, and is now included in European Community Law. 1155The subsidiarity principle is also commonly applied in traditional resource management systems.One example is nomadic pastoral societies, where the management of range-lands, their rehabilitation and the resolution of disputes and conflicts are han-dled at the level of the camp, clan, subtribe and tribe, as appropriate, in thatorder. Another example is the traditional management of water in a karez sys- tem, where the neighbourhood, the boneh and the village are responsible for the hourly and daily management of the distribution, once the allocation ofshares and turns has been made at the level of the whole water source. As amatter of fact, subsidiarity often prompts the recognition of the existence andcapacities of local communities as environmental managers. South, Central and West Asia, the Asiatic Cheetah became a highly endangered species in the second half of the twentieth century, confined only to the peri-desert regions of Iran. Ajoint project of the Global Environment Facility, the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) and the Department of the Environment in Iran sought to respond by following a co-manage-ment strategy for its conservation. The basic analysis of the social situation was carried out in 2003by IUCN's Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy (CEESP), backed by theIranian Centre for Sustainable Development (CENESTA). The survey found that the same rangelandareas where the prey species of the Asiatic Cheetah (including gazelles, mountain sheep and ibex)normally live are shared by both nomadic pastoral communities, such as the Sangsari Tribe and localvillages and other communities of sheep and camel pastoralists, and that the local communities werejust as upset as anyone about the disappearing wildlife. In a workshop gathering all the contactedlocal community groups, they saw themselves as the stewards of their natural heritage, and identifiedthe causes and consequences of the wildlife loss. They pointed at the widespread ownership of heavyfirearms and at urban hunters, who at times come accompanied by cold storage trucks, ready to killlarge numbers of wildlife indiscriminately and make commercial use of it. Initially the Department of the Environment in Iran was considering a protection programme based on five specific protected areas. These had been established over the past three decades and were sup-posed to serve as relatively \"secure\" areas for cheetah. In reality neither cheetah nor local communi-ties pay much attention to the boundaries of these areas. Cheetah, in particular, is a highly mobilespecies, often going up tens and even hundreds of kilometres in search of prey and mate. A co-management Start Up Team (see Section 4.3 in this Chapter) was set up consisting mostly of staff 15Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty).A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 121from CENESTA with experience in co-management and linkages with the relevant communities. The Team also included a professional from the Government's Organisation for Nomadic Peoples Affairs.The Start-up Team proceeded to identify the stakeholder groups, in particular the local communitieswith a role and interest in the issue. They were all contacted and asked to contribute to the analysis.It was this enlarged Set-up Team that, after long discussions, realised that the NRM unit for theCheetah and its associated prey and habitat was a \"ring\" around the central desert in Iran, some 1500kilometres across. The \"ring\" covers the territory of eight official protected areas and the interstitial spaces among them, thus including the land and resources utilised by the nomadic and sedentary herders and their tradi-tional institutions of management. The best way to assure the protection of the wildlife throughout the\"ring\" is through encouraging local communities to create and manage \"Community ConservedAreas\" (CCAs). These could be set up by alliances among these communities and formally backed upby the government. In this scheme, all CCAs and all official protected areas would constitute manage-ment \"sub-units\" of the same overall habitat of the the official protected areas (numbered areas) and the migration routes of the Sangsari nomadic pastoral tribe (large arrows).122 SHARING POWERIn the USA, the Center for Watershed Protection1166carried out a study among watershed practitioners from a wide cross-section of disciplines (planners, munici-pal officials, consultants, scientists, and others) and found that most plans failed toadequately protect their watersheds. A chief reason was that they were drawn upon too large a scale\u2014 50 square miles or more. Too many sub-watersheds andtheir individual problems had to be consolidated, and the focus of the plansbecame blurred. As the number of relevant social actors proliferated, responsibili-ty for implementing the plans became diffused. In short, the planning processappeared too large and complicated, with a typical municipality or county incharge of 10 to 50 sub-watersheds. Based on such analysis of first-generationwatershed plans, the Center proposed a dozen elements that every plan shouldincorporate. Chief among them, the plan was to be developed around the sub-watershed unit\u2014 defined as having a drainage area between 2 to 15 square miles.Due to their size, many such sub-watersheds were entirely contained within a sin-gle political jurisdiction, which helped to establish a clear regulatory authority.Sub-watershed mapping, monitoring, and other study tasks could be completedrelatively quickly (6 to 12 months) and the entire management plan could becompleted within a year. A division into management sub-units can also beprompted by the existence of different ecological requirements. The area ofMount Cameroon National Park, for example, has been sub-divided into differentunits for the purpose of rationally managing different species ( e.g., Prunus Gulf of Bothnia, one of the continent's youngest landscapes is still emerging from the waters. The vast 116 km Liminganlahti bay, one of Finland's finest wetlands, is undergoing a processcalled isostatic uplift wherein its post-glacial bedrock is rising to its original level. Almost one third ofthe bay is less than 1 metre deep, with the coastline moving forward at 18 metres a year or 1.5 Km percentury. The exceptional natural wealth of Liminganlahti bay is reflected in the presence of a particular-ly rich and diverse wildlife, including 250 bird species and flora that include 20 species endemic to theBaltic. Centuries of traditional human activity have maintained the shore meadows, vital for many birdsand rare plants, as open grasslands. This went against their natural tendency, which was to succeed intoforests. Four townships and several settlements ring the bay with privately owned farmland. Underancient law and custom, the newly risen lands are collectively owned by the landowners borderingthem. A recent increase in waterfowl hunting, fishing and tourism has required an integrated approach to the different land uses as well as an extensive consultation process to reconcile site conservation needswith the socio-economic needs of the local community and interest groups. The Liminganlahti LIFEproject, approved in 1995, is run by a partnership among the Finnish Environment Ministry's regionaloffice, the five municipalities which govern Liminganlahti and its island of Hailuoto, two NGOs (WWFand Birdlife), two scientific institutes, several local schools and the regional council for the district con-cerned. Such a large cross section of local society in the project steering committee allows for it to airand solve many of the conflicts. But further, the project has embraced a bottom up approach and divid-ed the bay, its shores and its islands into five sub-regions. Each sub-region has established a working 16EPA, 1997. 17Mambo Okenye, personal communication, 1999.

By splitting the area into five, it was considered that problems in one corner ofthe bay should not hamper progress elsewhere! In this sense, the management \"units\" have beendesigned with effectiveness and efficiency of work in mind. The sub-regional plans are expected to be later merged into a general plan, including some strict nature reserves within it. The general plan will represent the nearest thing to the consensus of allcitizens and interest groups affected, and will be integrated into the official land use plans of the local municipali-ties. The initial sub-regional meetings have been lively, with attendance often higher than expected.People with very different backgrounds and agendas, many of them not used to formal meetings or pol-icy debate, voiced their wishes and concerns. The very fact that all interest groups are being heard bythe authorities (the hunters, in particular, claim they were previously ignored) is seen as a sign of posi-tive management unit should be large enough to accommodate an ecosystem or habitat, and small enough to accommodate a social unit in charge.A coherent socio-ecological topography is fundamental for management sustain-ability and the identification of the \"units\" and \"sub-units\" to be managed is acrucial decision, which bears upon all the subsequent co-management steps. Aseloquently expressed by Murphree (1977b): \"The institutional requirements of a local natural resource management regime include social cohesion, locally sanctioned authority and co-operation and com- pliance reliant primarily on peer pressure. This implies a tightly knit interactive social unit spatially located to permit this. However, while social topography sug- gests \"small-scale\" regimes, ecological considerations tend to mandate \"large- scale\" regimes. This may arise from ecosystem considerations or when key resources are widely dispersed or mobile, as in the case of elephant and buffalo. Economic considerations may also dictate \"large-scale\" regimes where market factors require that several ownership units manage and tender their resources collectively. There is no inherent reason why social and ecological topographies cannot be harmonised, although this requires context-specific institutional engi- neering through negotiation. Often this will involve nested systems of collective enterprise between proprietary units. Built upward in this fashion such larger ecosystem units of management have a built-in incentive to spread, even beyond national borders. Dissonance arises when larger ecosystem regimes are imposed rather than endogenous. Such impositions in the form of ecologically-determined project domains often force together social units which have not negotiated between each other. Worse still, they could cut through existing social units. In so doing they would concentrate on ecological sustainability at the cost of ignoring the institutional sustainability on which it depends.\"124 SHARING POWERTThhee rreelleevvaanntt ssoocciiaall aaccttoorrss Once a tentative management unit is identified, a second step in the co-manage- ment process is to compile a preliminary list of the agencies, organisations, groupsand individuals possessing interests and concerns relative to it. These are usuallyreferred to as \"relevant social actors\" or \"stakeholders\" (see Chapter 2). At thisstage, the purpose is not to conduct a detailed analysis of these actors (seeChapter 5), but simply to identify them. Checklists 4.1 and 4.2 offer a number ofquestions that may assist in the groups or individuals actually or potentially affected by the management decisions? Who lives and works in or around the territory at stake? Are there historicoccupants ( e.g., indigenous communities or regular transients and nomadic user groups) and other traditional resource users with customary rights of ownership or usufruct? Are there recent migrants?Non resident users of resources? Absentee landlords? Major secondary users of local resources ( e.g., buyers of products, tourists)? Are the territories or resources currently being accessed and used? Bywhom specifically? Are people of different gender, age, class or economic power differently affectedand concerned? Are there businesses and industries potentially impinged upon by the NRM deci-sions? How many employees (national and international) live in the area because of such projects?Are these people active in natural resource management? zConcerned ggroups. Are there communities, groups or individuals with specific concerns about man- agement decisions? Are there government agencies with a specific mandate to manage all or part ofthe relevant resources? Is anyone officially responsible for them? Which government sectors and min-istry departments share some such responsibility? Are there local associations or NGOs dealing withnatural resources? Are there research, development or conservation projects in the area? Are therelocal authorities or local and national politicians with a specific stake in territory or resources? Arethere national and/ or international bodies involved because of specific laws or treaties? zDependent ggroups. Are there communities, groups or individuals dependent on the resources at stake? Is their dependency a matter of livelihood or economic advantage? Are these resourcesreplaceable by others, possibly in less ecologically valuable or fragile areas? zGroups wwith cclaims. Are there communities, groups or individuals upholding claims , including cus- tomary rights and legal jurisdiction over the territory, area or resources at stake? Are there communi-ties with ancestral and/ or other types of acquired rights? Are indigenous peoples involved? Are tribalminorities involved?

Are resource uses geographically and seasonally stable ( e.g., are there seasonal migration patterns)? Are there major events or trends currently affecting local communities and othersocial actors ( e.g., development initiatives, land reforms, migration, important phenomena of popula- tion mobility or natural growth or decline)?A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 125Table 2.1 in Chapter 2 provides a list of 18 different relevant social actors identi- fied for Rajaji National Park, in Northern India, only on the basis of their own stat-ed interests and concerns. From that example one can easily appreciate the vari-ety of intertwining issues at play for a given territory. It is true that the stakeholdersidentified for Rajaji could be further subsumed under broader categories, such asthe following four: residents of local communities, government agencies with offi-cial mandates (including park authorities), NGOs and research/ training institu-tions. Yet, it would soon be apparent that conflicts of interest and concerns are ascommon within such categories as they are among them. An important area in which the initial promoters of a co-management process may play a role is the identification and recognition of those social actors who notonly have interests and concerns at stake, but also capacities and comparativeadvantages to offer for resource management. Some of them may be individualsor local groups already involved in managing natural resources, such as a usergroup in charge of a community forest patch, a fisherfolks association that estab-lished rules for a given fishing area, a committee in charge of a water source or acouncil of elders protecting a sacred grove. The following checklist offers someexamples of questions to identify social actors with capacities to offer for the man-agement of natural resources. Obviously, social actors with specific interests andconcerns and social actors with specific capacities and comparative advantagesoften the territory or resources? With what results? Who used to manage those in the past? With what results? Who has access to the land, area or resources at stake? Who is using the natural resources at present\u2014 whether permanently, seasonally, occasionally or temporarily? In what ways? Has this changed over time? zHolders oof kknowledge aand sskills.Who are the people or groups most knowledgeable about, and capable of dealing with the territory or natural resources? Are there examples of valuable \"localknowledge and skills\" for the management at stake? zNeighbours. Are there communities or individuals living in close proximity with the resources and thus able to monitor and survey them with relative ease and comparative advantage? zTraditionalauthorities.Who are the main traditional authorities in the area at stake? Are there respect- ed institutions , to which people recur in a variety of needs and circumstances? Are there agencies and organisations capable of offering human resources, technical capacities and financial resourcesto the management cause? zNational aauthorities. Which local or national authorities have the mandate to develop and implement rules, policies, legislation and accompanying measures for the benefit of the territory or resources at stake? zWell ttrusted iindividuals.Are there groups or individuals trusted by the majorities of the relevant social actors and possessing convening power , and/ or negotiation and conflict management skills? zPotential iinvestors.Are there local and non-local groups and individuals who may wish to invest human or financial resources in developing a more ecologically and socially sound situation in the local context?126 SHARING POWERzSpecial ccircumstances.Are there people who can convey lessons from examples of similar territories and resources managed with good results in relatively similar social contexts? Are there projects that may be willing to provide technical or financial help? Are there NGOs and associations that may pro-vide some form of assistance? By identifying not only the main actors possessing interests and concerns but also the ones possessing specific capacities and comparative advantages for the man-agement of the territory or resources at stake, one can enrich the preliminary listof key relevant social actors and begin to explore the potential management rolesthey could assume (see Table 4.1, below).

More parties may mean more controversies and discussions, but exclud-ing some of them may, in the long run, be even more costly. Factions and divi-sions rarely disappear spontaneously and, as they surface, they may direct theirenergies against the co-management process itself. In some cases, however, theoutright exclusion of one key actor from the negotiation forum appears to be thenecessary condition for all the others to be able to work together effectively, oreven to work at all. This was the case for the Galapagos Marine Reserve, wherethe participatory process that set up both the legislation and the practice of thelocal co-management regime decided to eliminate from the area and from theoverall management discussion the industrial fishing sector, whose goals andpractices were deemed incompatible with the conservation goals of the reserve.The artisan fishermen and tourist operators participate in the management discus-sions, but the industrial fishermen are de facto and de jure excluded.1188The deci- sion has been fiercely opposed, and the industrial fishermen have kept both con-travening the law, and fighting it in court. The last court case was for the allegedanti-constitutionality of the measure of exclusion, but the Supreme Court ofEcuador, in 2001, rejected nearly unanimously such a denunciation. The exclu-sion of industrial fishermen from the management of the marine reserve is nowthoroughly legal. The promoters of co-management should ask themselves whether the identified relevant social actors represent allmajor concerns at stake. In particular, does anyone speak for conserving local biodiversity, using resources in a sustainableway and preserving environmental functions? In many traditional societies thiswas the responsibility of the elders and chiefs, but cultural change has sometimeseroded these responsibilities. 1199In a number of countries, conservation and sus- tainable use are government statutory responsibilities, mandated to specific agen-cies. 2200When this is not the case, or when there is an ample gulf between stated responsibilities and actual performance, non-governmental organisations, conser-vation groups or even charismatic individuals may take upon themselves thedefence of sustainability. Once the process promoters have identified the preliminary \"relevant social actors\" they may find out whether they are clear about their interests and con-cerns in the NRM unit, whether they are organised to communicate and promotethem and whether they are willing to take on NRM responsibilities. Often, this isnot the case. Some may not be willing to invest time and resources. Others maybe willing but disorganised. Still others, willing to participate in management,might not have been identified as relevant actors. Basically, the \"list\" should bekept open and expected to change. The important point is that the promoters donot miss the social actors that obviously possess major and distinct interests, rights, concerns, capacities and comparative advantages in natural resource man-agement\u2014 and especially the local communities. What to do when an identified relevant actor (let us say a community in the vicin- ity of a forest) includes a variety of different interests, concerns and capacities vis- \u00e0-vis the natural resources? Should one or several actors be invited to participate in the management negotiation process? There is no simple answer 2002. 19A telling example can be found in McCallum and Sekhran, 1997. 20In the case illustrated in Table 4.1 sustainability is stated as the main interest of an involved NGO (WWF). In Table 2.1 of Ch apter 2, sus- tainability (expressed as \"wildlife conservation\") is the concern of the state agency in charge of park management (this is a r elatively spe- cial case, however, as it resource management capitalise on two main lessons. The first is that there exist a variety of interests and concerns at stake forany given set of natural resources, and what meets conservation objectives andbenefits one social actor, may harm another. The owners of tourist businesses maybe well served by a hunting ban, but the local hunters club may find it totallyinappropriate. The forest agency personnel may wish to restrict forest uses untiltimber can be felled and provide revenues to the district's coffers, but the localresidents may need timber on an on-going basis for their own domestic uses. Thewater resources utilised by the families living closer to a river may be interestingalso for the peasants owning plots far from it, who may wish to gain their equi-table water share. Even relatively homogeneous units ( e.g., a local \"community\") include among themselves a variety of interests and concerns and, as promoters may wish to explore the pros and cons of different solu- tions with the most directly concerned people and groups while assisting them toorganise (see Chapter 5). For instance, a united community has more weight atthe discussion table than several people who cannot agree on a common posi-tion. And yet, many communities may be willing to speak as one voice on certainoccasions and as many on others .In other words, the people who find themselves united as \"one relevant actor\" for some decisions may need to split and regroupfor another one. This phenomenon, at times referred to as \"multi-cultural charac-ter\" of stakeholders 2211should be acknowledged and recognised as normal. Allowing it to be accommodated in co-management settings would prevent theforced lumping of contrasting interests\u2014 a subtle but recognised problem of rep-resentative democracies. Another fundamental dilemma: are \"interests and concerns\" and the willingness to participate sufficient for a social actor to claim a management role? Shouldn'tthe promoters also ask: \"Who are the social actors entitled to manage the unit(s) at stake?\" They certainly should. And yet, the understanding of what constitutes a legitimate entitlement is an evolving socio-political phenomenon,best approached in a participatory way. The CM promoters could begin by askingthe potential relevant social actors whether they consider that they have a fairclaim to participate in the management of natural resources and, if so, on whatgrounds. In this way, they will obtain a list of factors and characteristics that atleast some people recognise as legitimate \"roots of entitlements\" in the local con- text. Some examples of such factors and characteristics are listed in Checklist 2.2in Chapter 2. 21Otchet, 2000.A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 129tioned, may wish to speak as one voice certain times and as many voices at oth- ers. Indeed, accepting the existence and legitimacy of a multiplicity of voices andinterests in resource management is a fundamental tenet of the co-managementapproach. The second lesson is that different social actors possess different and often com- plementary capacities and comparative advantages to optimally manage a set ofnatural resources . For instance, important regulatory and coordination faculties are usually with public bodies, often at the national or district level, but localknowledge and surveillance power most often stay with local communities. In thewords of Kothari: 2222 \"Communities lack the resources to tackle threats or ecological issues at a region- al scale, and in many places have lost their traditional ethos and institutions; gov- ernment agencies lack the necessary micro-knowledge, on-the-spot human power, or even often the necessary mandate when other agencies overrule them. With rare exceptions, neither local communities nor governmental agencies are able to face on their own the onslaught of commercial forces, or able to check the destruction caused by some of their own members \". Thus, both agency staff and local residents can broaden their perspectives and join forces to become stronger and more effective natural resource managers.Management partnerships can provide some protection against ineptitude andcorruption (at times associated with agency management) and the parochialismand other shortcomings sometimes associated with local communities and otherstakeholders. Examples of complementary capacities include entrepreneurialpower ( e.g., to set up a tourism initiative), uniquetechnical capacity ( e.g., understanding and actingupon the crucial conditionsfor the conservation of aspecies), business sense( e.g., for keeping accounts straight) and conveningcapacity ( e.g., to obtain that all relevant actors sit togeth-er and begin discussions).All of the above are rarelyfound in one social actoralone! Is it thus always appropriate to pursue a managementpartnership? Is it sufficientthat different social actors exist, with capacities to offer and interests and con-cerns to convey? Not really. In some situations the promoters need to use theirbest judgement before embarking in a process that may be unacceptably long ordestined to failure under the prevailing conditions. For instance, when the basicconditions for freedom of speech and personal safety are missing, a \"partnership\"loses its meaning and attempting it may actually endanger people. When a seem-ingly endless \"search for consensus\" is utilised by some parties may be rightly compelled to abandon the game. And when rapid decisions and action are required, e.g., to block the very fast ecological deteriora- tion of an area, it may be better to act unilaterally than to achieve a broad con-sensus on how to protect... a devastated territory. Most importantly, there are situ-ations of entrenched powers in which a confrontational strategy is more appropri-ate than a collaborative one. In such cases, promoting CM would mean support-ing an illusory \"social pacifier\", which may waste time and energy that can beused to muster a more useful opposition stand. In general, the decision to pursuea CM process is both technical and political, and should thus be based on ananalysis of technical and political needs. It has been proposed 2233that there exist situations in which a management partner- ship is clearly needed, namely: z when the active commitment and collaboration of various social actors is essential for the sustainable management of the natural resources; and z when the access to the natural resources is essential for the livelihood security and cultural survival of one or more social actors. In these cases, two fundamental values\u2014 environmental sustainability and liveli- hood security\u2014 need to be pursued together if they are to be pursued at all.Other conditions that would recommend embarking upon a CM process may berelevant from the perspective of particular social actors. For instance, from thepoint of view of government agencies possessing legal jurisdiction over a territory,area or resources at stake, it may be very appropriate to pursue partnership agree-ments and prevent wasteful conflicts when one or more of the following condi-tions apply: z local actors have historically enjoyed customary/ legal rights over the territory or resources; z local livelihoods are strongly affected by NRM decisions; z the decisions to be taken are complex and controversial ( e.g., different values need to be harmonised or there is disagreement on the distribution of entitle-ments over the land or resources); z the current NRM system has failed to produce the desired results and meet the needs of the local actors; z the relevant actors are ready to collaborate and request to do so; z there is ample time to negotiate. On the contrary, it may be inappropriate or not yet appropriate to embark on an entirely new CM process when very rapid decisions are needed (emergency situa-tions). From the point of view of local communities who have customarily enjoyed full access to the relevant territory, area or resources, it may be appropriate to pursuea NRM partnership when: z powerful non-local actors are forcing their way into the territory or extracting resources with no respect for traditional customary rules and rights (in thiscase a partnership agreement with the state government or some NGO orresearch organisation may help assure some protection and respect for sharing of management responsibilities among all the parties involved in the agreement lessens the burden of any one party in charge; zCM produces negotiated specific benefits for all parties involved (this point has major ethical implica- tions, as some negotiated benefits may be crucial for the survival of some local communities and/ orto compensate for losses incurred 2255or for the survival of wildlife species); zalliances between governmental agencies and local social actors tend to fend off resource exploita- tion from non-local interests, which often represent the main threat to conservation and sustainable resource use;2266 zCM promotes more effective management as a consequence of harnessing the capacities2277and com- parative advantages of various social actors ( e.g., local knowledge and skills for monitoring the status of natural resources, proximity for surveying the protected area's borders, maintenance of naturalresource uses that are beneficial to the local ecology); 2288 zCM reduces enforcement expenditures because of agreed, voluntary compliance; zCM enhances the capacity for resource management among all parties involved (as a consequence of enhanced communication, dialogue and shared experience); A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 131z customary practices are falling into disarray and an open access status has ensued with resources being extracted in unsustainable ways. z the state is willing to provide legal recognition to the customary rights as part of the co-management agreement. It may instead be not advisable to enter into a NRM partnership when: z in so doing the local communities would be renouncing a customary status of unique rights with no comparable advantage in exchange; z the political environment does not secure the safety of all negotiating parties. A mild version of participatory management, involving the consultation of key rel- evant actors and the seeking of a broad social consensus on management prac-tices can be maintained to be an essential component of any successful manage-ment setting. A strong version of CM, implying the inclusion of various socialactors in a management board endowed with authority and responsibility, may ormay not be appropriate according to the specific conditions at stake. In general, amanagement partnership offers benefits and has costs. Some examples of suchbenefits and costs 2244are summarised in Checklist 4.3 and 4.4. 24Lists adapted from Borrini-Feyerabend, 1996. 25In countries of the South, more emphasis may be placed on tangible benefits such as access to natural resources for food and in come, while in industrialised societies local residents may stress their active choice in the type of land uses they wish for an area . 26For instance, in Sariska Tiger Reserve (western India) villagers and local forest officials have fought together against mining interests (Kothari et al., 1996). 27See, for instance, Gadgil et al., 1993; Ruddle, 1994; and Poffenberger, 1997. See also the dedicated journals Indigenous Knowledge and Development Monitor , published by CIRAN in the Netherlands and Etnoecologica , published in three languages by the Centro de Ecolog\u20aca, Mexico. 28In Keoladeo National Park (India) buffalo grazing is an essential practice for the conservation of the local ecosystem and spec ies, yet the PA management initially banned the grazing, which resulted in violent clashes with local herders and residents (Kothari et al. , 1996). In the Royal Bardia National Park (Nepal) ecological management relies on human disturbance in the form of grass cutting, which is cur- rently \"permitted\" for a ten day period each year. All throughout Europe, the ecological conditions of many rural or Alpine env ironments are dependent on the permanence on them of local populations, engaged in cattle rearing and forest and water management.132 SHARING POWERzCM enhances the trust between state agencies and relevant actors, shared \"ownership\" of the conser- vation process, and strong commitment to implement decisions taken together; zCM promotes a sense of security and stability (of policies, priorities, tenure...) leading to increased confidence in investments, long-term perspective and enhanced sustainability of negotiated manage-ment; 2299 zCM promotes understanding and knowledge among all concerned about the views and positions of others, preventing or minimising conflicts and disputes due to miscommunication; zCM promotes the public awareness of conservation issues and the integration of conservation and sustainable use efforts within social, economic and cultural initiatives; zCM contributes towards participatory democracy in society (by promoting social communication, conflict prevention and resolution, and the development of rules, policies and laws via the directinvolvement of citizens and interest groups). 29For instance, co-management has a great role to play in so-called \"peace parks\" in trans-boundary situations (Sandwith et al. , 2001). 30This may be the case also for local communities. In South Africa, local communities will oppose the establishment of protected areas if no benefits are made available to them (Koch, 1994). 31As expressed by Baland and Platteau (1996, page 351) \"...even well conceived schemes of co-management become seriously stressed as market opportunities expand and cause an intensive commercial exploitation of certain natural resources.\" For instance, in N arayan Srovar Sanctuary (Western India) villagers welcomed the de-notification of the reserve to make way for a cement factory, since they got no income from the forest and are expecting jobs from the factory (Kothari et time, financial resources and human resources (high \"transaction costs\") in both the preparation of the partnership and negotiation of agreements. This is a seriousissue, as the time requirement may be unaffordable for short-term projects and/ or the financialrequirements may be unaffordable for some relevant actors. The human resources need to includeprofessionals with uncommon skills ( e.g., capable of carrying out a fair stakeholder analysis, support- ing the organizing of the relevant actors, facilitating participatory processes and the negotiation ofagreements, etc.) who may not be easily available. zpotential opposition by the parties required to share authority, substantially change their livelihood systems 3300or forego current advantages and benefits (the commitment of most parties in the CM process is a crucial condition for success); zexplicit conflicts among relevant social actors with different power bases, which, in the absence of protection measures, may bring about negative outcomes for the weaker ones; zchances of negotiation stalls when a co-management agreement cannot be achieved without compro- mising in a substantial way the interests and concerns of some parties ( e.g., some key conservation or development goals); zpoor sustainability of the negotiated agreements because of underestimated problems or new inter- vening factors ( e.g., changes in the economic conditions that make a management option viable and profitable,3311changes of political administration, emergence of new relevant social actors, violent unrest, etc.). Ultimately, a judgement should be made as to whether the expected benefits arelikely to justify the human and financial resources to be invested in the co-man-agement process, i.e., as to whether co-management is indeed needed . If so, thisA POINT OF DEPARTURE... 133information should be combined with the results of a feasibility analysis to decide whether a co-management process should be initiated. TThhee ffeeaassiibbiilliittyy aannaallyyssiiss A co-management feasibility analysis begins by a broad assessment of the existing management system,3322structure and practices, the recognised entitlements and the unrecognised claims for the territory or resources at stake. Together with thelist of preliminarily identified relevant actors, this offers a picture of the power sys-tem and relationships at stake. The promoters of the CM process should examinethis in the light of the legal, political, institutional, economic and socio-culturalcharacteristics of the context at stake. Some feasibility questions useful in such ananalysis are listed in Checklist 4.5. These questions do not spell out all the condi-tions that need to be met for co-management to be successful. They offer, howev-er, an idea of the potential obstacles and difficulties that may be encountered inany specific context. has the mandate to control the land and resources? Can a pluralist approach be accommodated within the existing customary/ legal frameworks? Examine traditional, customary law and modern laws,regulations, permits.... Is tthe pprocess ppolitically ffeasible? What is the history of land management and resource use in the territory or area at stake? Examine cur- rent political will and stability, the capacity to enforce decisions, the confidence in the participatoryprocess, the presence of phenomena such as corruption and intimidation.... Are there relevant actorswith strong interests to maintain the status quo ? If some actors are better served by the absence rather than the presence of co-management agreements (for instance they currently enjoy undue benefits and/or have others bear substantial costs in their place) they have no incentive to enter into a process ofnegotiation and may attempt to block it or sabotage it from the outside. This is sometimes expressed asthe presence of actors with strong \"better alternatives to a negotiated solution\" (BATNAs)\u2014 co-management. Is tthe pprocess iinstitutionally ffeasible? Is there a chance of building a pluralistic management institution for the territory, area or natural resources? Examine inter-institutional relations and their possible conflicts, existing examples of multi-party resource management organisations and rules, the capacity of social actors to organise themselvesand to identify representatives to convey their interests and concerns.... Is tthe pprocess eeconomically ffeasible? Are there economic opportunities and alternatives to the current, possibly inefficient exploitation of nat- ural resources? Examine local opportunities to reconcile the conservation of nature with the satisfactionof economic needs, examine the extent of poverty in the region, the availability of capital for localinvestments.... Is tthe pprocess ssoc io-cculturally ffeasible? Are or were there traditional systems of natural resource management in the context at stake? What are (or were) their main features and strengths? Are those still valid today? Are the traditional NRM systems 32This should involve not only an analysis of the de jure conditions (the existing legal entitlements) but also of the de facto conditions, i.e., the management roles actually taken up by various people and institutions. You may wish to answer questions such as: who takes deci- sions? Who knows about those decisions? Who is accountable to whom? Who plans? Who advises? Who has access to the resources?Who benefits from the resources? Who evaluates whether NRM activities need to change?134 SHARING POWERIt is important to understand whether some social actors with vested interests in the status quo may stall the process of change. In such cases the feasibility of co- management is severely reduced and outright opposition to the CM process canbe expected. Some special incentives, cajoling or even law enforcement andcoercive measures may be needed before all actors agree to negotiate. Outsiders,however, should carefully investigate the local situation before assuming that agroup is blocking negotiations to maintain an unfair advantage. A social actormay rightly feel better protected by a firm and uncompromising stand than byentering into a negotiation as the weakest among several parties. What can be done when the desired feasibility conditions are not in place, or the BATNAs 3344of several social actors are very attractive? One strategy is to proceed towards the partnership and, in parallel, attempt to modify the conditions andenhance the collaboration incentives of all relevant actors. For instance, limitedpilot agreements may be developed while changes in the relevant policies andlegislation are being discussed. People and institutions may be offered trainingprogrammes and seminars to familiarise themselves with the partnershipapproach. A public debate on management issues may be stimulated, enhancingthe social status and prestige of whoever will act to solve current problems. Whenobstacles and bottlenecks are clear, the relevant actors in favour of the co-man-agement process may also meet to identify, discuss and implement initiatives toremove them. Another strategy in the face of strong odds is simply to give up the particular site, and concentrate resources and efforts on territories with better chances of devel-oping successful management partnerships. This is the recommendation surfacingfrom a failed integrated conservation and development project in Papua NewGuinea. The project focused on an area important for biodiversity, but already tar-geted by a powerful logging operation, which had established linkages with thelocal communities and aroused vested interests. The project did not manage toreverse any of that, and wasted lots of time and resources in the process. Anotherlesson learned is that timing may be crucial. If external conservationists wish tostill in use? Regardless of the answer, why? Who is keeping them alive? What is specifically sustaining or demeaning them? If they are not being used any more, does anyone have a living memory of the sys-tems (for instance, are there elders who practiced them and still remember \"how it was done\")? Examinethe current population status, population dynamics and structure, the main socio-cultural changes underway. Examine social and cultural diversity amongst the relevant social actors and the history of grouprelations among them. Examine factors affecting opportunities for social communication, including: zlanguage diversity zvarying degrees of access to information zdifferent attitudes, for example with regard to speaking in public or defending personal advantages ztraditional and modern media currently used in the particular context An important question is also, \"For all main relevant actors, what are the best alternatives to a negotiat- ed agreement (BATNA)?\" If some of them are better served by the absence rather than the presence of co-management agreements ( e.g., if they enjoy undue benefits and/ or have others bear substantial man- agement costs, so that their BATNA is the maintenance of the existing situation3333) they will have no incentive to enter into the process of negotiation and they may attempt to block it or sabotage it fromoutside. This can be a crucial feasibility obstacle in any environment. 33LeBaron et al. 1995. 34This term is defined in Checklist rreessoouurrcceess aanndd ccrreeaattiinngg aa SSttaarrtt-uupp TTeeaamm As part of exploring feasibility, a most important question the co-management pro- moters ask themselves is: \"What human and financial resources can we counton?\" Fortunately or unfortunately, in fact, promoting a co-management process ispromote sustainable development initiatives, they may need an early entry withlocal communities and the careful building of rapport and trust. 3355 A summary of the results of a feasibility analysis carried out prior to the inception of a co-management process is reported in Table 4.2. Table 1998) In a feasibility study of collaborative management for the sierra Tahumanara, a list of important condi- tions were compared with the local socio-economic situation and consequently assessed. Five of themain conditions were found to be strongly satisfied (+++), three moderately satisfied (++) and two weak-ly satisfied (+).Three conditions were found to be variable relatively to the specific interest group. Thestudy concluded that a collaborative management regime would be feasible in the region. Conditions Assessment 1.

The process demands energy, passion, willingness, creativity, sacrifice, continuity... and itneeds at least one and possibly more \"champions\"\u2014 dedicated individuals forwhom work is a matter of personal satisfaction and pride more than a job or aduty. As stressed by professionals with direct field experience, the development ofco-management regimes has much more to do with informal than with formalrelationships. 3366For instance, it depends crucially on the capacity of some individ- uals to communicate with others on a personal basis, and elicit their confidence,trust and support. In addition to the uncommon human qualities of the processpromoters, specific capacities and technical support may also be required for avariety of tasks\u2014 from mediating conflicts to understanding ecosystem function-ing, from social organising to setting up economic enterprises. The co-manage-ment promoters need to be able to recognise when such forms of technical sup-port are needed, and where they can be accessed. Financial support to a CM process is very useful to sustain social communication activities, carry out specific studies or provide professional assistance to the nego-tiation process and to understand all the issues at stake. Conservation and devel-opment projects have played a useful role here, providing funds for events, pro-fessional facilitators for meetings and helping to overcome the \"culture of distrust\"that often inhibits positive relationships between governments and local groups. 3377 Yet, co-management should not be made to depend on large influxes of financial resources. It may even suffice to have the commitment of some individuals tochange a situation of \"business as usual\" and promote dialogue and agreements in place of hostility,and interest groupsmay provide in kindresources as neces-sary. Indeed, influx majorexternal moreproblems solu-tions by financialinflows provided ininappropriateamounts and withstrings attached. 3388 As soon as the need and feasibility havebeen assessed andthe necessary human and financial resources have been set aside, it is advisable to create a co-manage-ment \"Start-up Team\", to be in charge of preparing and launching the wholeprocess. 3399A Start-up Team (at times also called initiation committee, launch com- 36Daniel Ngantou, personal communication, 1999. See also Nguinguiri, 2003. 37Freudenberger, 1996. 38Sarin, 2003. 39National Civic League, undated.A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 137mittee, pilot team, etc.)4400is a small group of individuals dedicated to preparing and launching the co-management process. The group may play the main facili-tating role in the process, or it may decide to use the services of a third party tofacilitate the negotiation of the CM agreement. The number of Team members isgenerally fewer than ten, in extreme cases even one only, 4411with occasional help from others. Often, the Team is composed of volunteers. At times it includes somepaid professionals, especially when a project or other externally supported initia-tives are involved. It is important that the people in the Start-up Team have a highpersonal motivation but that they are also socially recognised as credible andtrustworthy. In most cases this amounts to a strong recommendation to involve local people in the Start-up Team, and sometimes to even compose it of local people only. In addition, the team should be \"diverse\", i.e., it should include peo- ple with whom all the relevant actors expected to take a role in the managementprocess are able to identify, relate and communicate. In other words, all socialactors concerned with the management at stake should trust and be able to relateeasily with at least one person in the Start-up Team, even if they do not feel repre- sented by him/ her. An interesting example of a Start-up Team, called Grupo Nucleo , facilitated the process that brought about the co-management setting for the Galapagos MarineReserve in Ecuador. In 1997 none of the institutional or legal frameworks that sup-port this setting today were yet in place. The local Grupo Nucleo , including indi- viduals close to the fishing and tourist sector as well as to the local research andconservation bodies, first gathered local interests and concerns in view of theupcoming special law of Galapagos. On the momentum created by such a law, itthen facilitated a broad social agreement on a new cooperative, consensus-basedinstitutional setting. For the Galapagos Marine Reserve, all the achievements oftoday have roots in the numerous meetings and tireless organising promoted bythe Grupo Nucleo and supported by a far-sighted project from 1997 to 1999.4422 A good Start-up Team is active, efficient, multi-disciplinary, transparent in all its activities and determined to launch but not to lead or dominate the co-manage-ment process. In fact, its role and responsibility are limited to only one phase ofthe process, namely the one in which the partnership is prepared and rooted inthe local context (see Figure 4.2). After that, the social actors themselves need totake charge. Already at this stage we are facing one of the main characteristics of a co-man- agement process: the iterative mode of work. Nearly every step in co-manage-ment is susceptible to subsequent adjustments and re-elaboration, but particularlyso the initial steps. These include the preliminary identification of the territory orresources to be managed and of the \"relevant social actors\" to take an active rolein that. These definitions are among the most delicate and controversial in thewhole process and thus, inevitably, they are a first approximation of what will beagreed upon by the relevant partners. They even present some circular dilemma.For instance, the management boundaries should be established by the partnersinvolved. But then, the \"partners\" are themselves determined by their own inter- 40In French, terms that are used are Comit\u00e9 de Pilotage or Noyau Dur , a co-management process was single-handedly promoted by a key forest official, native of the l ocal community and member of the local elite. His capacity to mediate between the culture of the governmental agencies and the local cul- ture, and the support provided by a dedicated project allowed him to win the confidence of all major relevant social actors. Se e Box 1 in Borrini-Feyerabend et al. , 2000. 42Heylings and Bravo, 2001. In some way this Grupo Nucleo was already a co-management platform, as it promoted a number of initia- tives and events with direct management results. On the other, however, it was only a Start-up Team, as it has now been disband ed and a legal pluralist decision-making system has taken capacities vis-\u00e0-vis the area to be managed! As mentioned, it may be wise to start out with a relatively small geographic area and its primaryactors ( e.g., the ones with longest tenure status, specific government mandate, highest dependence and highest capacities and comparative advantages vis-\u00e0-vis the territory or resources at stake), but then such actors should review the defini-tion of the management unit(s) and the list of recognised relevant actors. And soon. There is no recipe for developing a management partnership. While extremely valuable lessons have been learned in different cases throughout the world\u2014 andsome such lessons are the very heart of this book\u2014 in every new situation thepartners themselves need to decide on the most appropriate process to follow. Inother words, there is no \"right process\" to develop a \"right management partner-ship\" but the quality of the process is extremely important, as a partnership is gen- erally as strong, or as weak, as the process that generated it. In general, three phases in the co-management process can be broadly identified: 1.organising for the partnership; 2.negotiating the co-management agreements and organisations; 3.implementing and reviewing the agreements and organisations (learning by doing). These phases are schematically illustrated4433in Figure 4.2 and will be further described in Chapters 5 and 6 of Part II and in Chapter 9 of Part III of this volume. Box 4.8 TThhee ccoo-mmaannaaggeemmeenntt ccoonnvveenneerrss (adapted from Ram\u20acrez, 1998) Any group or organisation seeking to convene other relevant actors should first analyze its own role and objectives, and its relationship with those actors it seeks to invite. The questions to ask are: are wein a position to convene? What are the constraints of our organisation? Do we have the legitimacy,power and urgency required to bring the parties together? In the words of Gray (1989) \"The convenermay or may not be an actor in the issue or problem situation. The role of the convener is to identifyand bring all the legitimate actors to the table. Thus conveners require convening power , i.e., the ability to induce social actors to participate. Convening power may derive from holding a formal office, from along-standing trusted reputation with the relevant local actors, or from experience and reputation as anunbiased expert on the problem. The conveners' tasks are distinct from those of a third-party mediator,although at times one person can assume both roles.\" The decisions made by the convenor are biasedby the convenor's understanding of the nature of the issue, the boundaries of the issue, and the criteriato select the relevant actor that appear to be legitimate. These are always approximate decisions andbecome more accurate through a cyclical adjustment process.

The imposition of external values, technologies and livelihood systems has been a main feature of colonisation, imperialism and unequal relationships with tradition-al and indigenous peoples. Today's new ideas and concepts, such as sustainableuse or co-management of natural resources are easily perceived as a new versionof such imposition. However sincere the intention of co-management promotersmay be, it is a fact that indigenous control over territories and resources has beenand continues to be systematically diminished, not least because of conservationaims (in particular to incorporate territories into official protected areas). Thus,while some indigenous peoples and traditional communities may be willing to enter into man-agement 4.9). This may be a decision in view of cultural survival, especially where traditional knowl-edge systems are already fragile because of strong external influences, but localresistance to decisions and forms of \"development\" defined from outside has oftenbeen beneficial also to conservation. A POINT OF DEPARTURE... 141As only recently fully acknowledged and described, biological and cultural diver- sity are strongly linked, as are their alarming losses currently experienced in theworld. 4444By preserving cultural integrity, the conditions for maintaining a specific type of interaction with the environment and natural resources are also main-tained. The interests of indigenous peoples and conservationists may thus broadlycoincide and management partnerships may play a vital role to promote both thesurvival of cultural diversity and the safeguard of biological environments. In the light of the above, are indigenous peoples \"social actors\" on the same level as all others, such as a private firm or a governmental agency? Many would stressthat they are not. Indigenous peoples hold ancestral rights to the environmentswhere they have lived and worked for centuries if not millennia. 4455They usually do not possess the economic strength and legal backing enjoyed by modernentrepreneurs and affluent people. And, importantly, many of them have lifestyleswith limited impact upon the land (the very reason why, in their midst, there isstill much worth conserving and managing sustainably) and are bearers on the ancestral lands of the K'ich\u00e9 in the volcanic Sierra Madre ranges of T otonicap\u20acn were for territorial domination in the pre-Hispanic and colonial eras. More recent invasions have come in theform of the \"Green Revolution\": agricultural reforms and rural development projects over the last threedecades, which have manipulated use and access to natural resources. Rather than alleviating poverty,however, most interventions benefited the rich and created dependency on modern technology, unaf-fordable by most peasants. Indiscriminate logging, inappropriate agricultural technologies, \"improved\"seeds and inadequate water resource management generated pollution, diminished endogenous floraand agricultural biodiversity, and created serious socio-economic impacts and health problems for thenative Mayans (95% of the local population). Projects that tried to identify local needs, aspirations andpotential ended up reflecting more the opinions of external planners than of local people. \"Local partic-ipation\" has been usually sought only after the design of the project was done and established. The Mayan culture keeps alive its ancestral resource knowledge and social structures through an oral tradition rich in topographic vocabulary, and a world vision focusing on the value of nature, specificceremonies, social solidarity and consultation with the community elders. A recent welcome trend hasbeen towards re-evaluating indigenous resource management practices in communally owned forests.There has also been a strong, if not always successful, show of resistance to the unsustainable exploita-tion and degradation of natural resources by outsiders (loggers, entrepreneurs and transport companiesthat succeeded in gaining concessions). In one particular region the local people, jointly with the refor-estation committee and the municipality, reached an agreement to prohibit governmental and non-gov-ernmental agencies from developing projects in communally-owned forests. One Elder declared: \"...thegovernment wanted to impose on us a project to create a market for our wood. If we would hadallowed it, we would have nothing today. We do not think in the government's way, for we believe thatthe mountains can give us all we need, but all in measure. We take just what we need, and no onefrom our community makes a business out of wood or timber.\" Another community imposed gravesanctions against a park ranger who abused his authority for personal benefit, destroying the oldest andlargest tree in the forest, which was sacred to the people. In another case, a mayor was imprisoned forauthorising logging concessions without community approval. Since then, no mayor has dared toauthorise any logging concession. 44Posey, 1996; local knowledge and skills. In other words, they are both a com- paratively weaker and more benign and useful social actor. The Convention on Biological Diversity stresses that: \"special consideration [should be] given to the indigenous and local communities embodying traditionallifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biologicaldiversity\". 4466Such special considerations should involve not only respecting the cultural identity of indigenous and traditional peoples, but also ensuring mecha-nisms that guarantee fair communication and consultation processes, continuityand/ or revitalisation of their traditional lifestyles (as deemed appropriate by thetraditional societies) and the active education and enrichment of non-indigenouspartners concerning traditional values, knowledge and practices. In practical terms, a Start-up Team should make sure that the rights, needs and capacities of traditional communities are duly respected and recognised. It shouldalso veer to avoid their \"acculturation\", which may be one of the most insidiousdangers of co-management for an indigenous community. Many aspects of theparticipatory management model proceed from a mainstream logic and value sys-tem that, in the attempt of accommodating multiple interests, may overshadow oruproot the fundamental tenets of a traditional society. For example, practices suchas assigning economic value to natural resources or promoting gender equality innatural resource management may be perceived as appropriate to most socialactors but objectionable and destructive to some traditional communities. Thesedifferent views should be handled with respect. To this end, the Start-up Team hasto be well informed about the values, beliefs, lifestyles and management systemsof the indigenous and traditional partners, and aware of the benefits of local cul-tural cohesion. A Start-up Team is a herald of an opportunity to review andimprove resource management practices, not an active promoter of social restruc-turing and cultural change. It may assist different groups within a society to devel-op their own views on the issues at stake, but the ultimate decisions about how tohandle issues of internal consensus and representation belong to the peoplesthemselves. In the last decades, many indigenous communities have agreed on various forms of co-management settings for protected areas. In Australia, 4477relatively strong co- management arrangements for protected areas have been developed following thepassing of legislation that recognised aboriginal rights to land and naturalresources. In 1981, Gurig National Park became the first jointly managedNational Park in Australia and since then further co-management arrangementshave been developed for other parks in various Territories, according to several\"models\" (see Table 4.3). Joint management represents a trade-off between therights and interests of traditional owners and the rights and interests of govern-ment conservation agencies and the wider Australian community. In somearrangements developed subsequent to the Gurig model, the trade-off involves thetransfer of land ownership to Aboriginal People in exchange for continuity intothe foreseeable future of the national park status and shared responsibility for parkmanagement. The transfer of ownership back to Aboriginal People is thus condi-tional on their support (through leases or other legal mechanisms) for the continu-ation of the National Park. The land occupied by a Park is simultaneouslyreturned to aboriginal ownership and leased back to a government conservationagency under a co-management board and with the agreement of an arbitrationprocess in case of disputes. 46Convention on 1998, Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) have become officially recognised and promoted in Australia as part of the national protected area system.4488It was in fact realised that some aboriginal landholders were prepared to \"protect\" their land and part of the Australia National Reserve System inreturn for government funds and, if required, other types of management assistance. The first IPA wasformally proclaimed in August 1998 over an aboriginal owned property called Nantawarrina in thenorthern Flinders Ranges of South Australia. Several more IPAs were proclaimed in other states during1999. IPAs can be established as formal conservation agreements under state or territory legislation, or under Indigenous Law. Aboriginal land owners there have a variety of legal mechanisms to control activitieson their land, including local government by-laws and privacy laws. The declaration of IPAs is the firstoccasion in Australia whereby aboriginal land owners voluntarily accepted a protected area status overtheir land. Because the process is voluntary, and fully prompted and promoted by them, AboriginalPeople choose the level of government involvement, the level of visitor access (if any) and the extent ofdevelopment to meet their needs. In return for government assistance, aboriginal owners of IPAs areTable 4.3 Witjira mmodel Aboriginal ownership Aboriginal ownership Aboriginal ownership Ownership of land remains with the government Equal representation of tra-ditional owners and gov-ernment representatives onmanagement boardAboriginal majority No lease-back Agency Lease-back to governmentagency for long period Lease-back to government agencyin perpetuity Lease of the nationalpark to traditionalowners Annual fee to traditionalowners (for the use of landas a National Park) Annual fee to traditionalowners, communitycouncil or board No underreview...Example: WitjiraNational Park A further, more recent form of protected area established voluntarily on existing aboriginal-owned land\u2014 the Indigenous Protected Area model\u2014 presents a chal-lenge to all co-management models, as it is more advanced in terms of self-deter-mination of the aboriginal owners, and self-management practices (see Box 4.10). 48http://www.ea.gov.au/indigenous/ipa/index.html144 SHARING POWERrequired to develop a management plan and to make a commitment to manage their land (and/ or waters and resources) with the goal of conserving its biodiversity values. IPAs are attractive to some aboriginal land owners because they bring management resources without the loss of autonomy associated with co-management regimes (see Table 4.3). IPAs also provide publicrecognition of the natural and cultural values of aboriginal land, and of the capacity of the AboriginalPeople to protect and nurture those values. IPAs are attractive to government conservation agenciesbecause they effectively add to the nation's conservation estate without the need to acquire the land,and without the cost of establishing all the infrastructure, staffing, housing etc of a conventional nation-al park. Overall, IPAs can be seen as a particularly strong example of Community Conserved Area(strong insofar as the decision making power is entirely in the hands of the Aboriginal People and thegovernment has understood and legalised that). 4499 49Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2004 (in press). 50Solis Riviera et al. , 2003. 51Kaimowitz, Faune and Mendoza, 2003.

Under present circumstances in a number of Latin American countriesa protected area regime can offer them such security, besides also attracting fund-ing, support, visibility, and income from tourism to the concerned areas. Whenthis proves true, community benefits related to the establishment of a co-manage-ment agreement can be substantial. A POINT Winer, 2003) The Kaa-ya Iya National Park (83.4 million hectares) is the largest in Bolivia and contains the world's largest area of dry tropical forest under legal protection. Its most unique characteristic, however, is thatthe park was created in response to demands for territorial recognition by the Guaran\u20ac Izoce\u20aco people.This is the first park in the Americas declared on the basis of a demand by an indigenous people andthe only park in the Americas where an indigenous people's or ganisation (CABI\u2014 Capitan\u20aca del Alto y Bajo Izozog) has primary administrative responsibility. In fact, the Park's Management Committee com-prises staff of the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Planning and representatives of CABI, theWildlife Conservation Society (WCS, a foreign NGO), local municipalities, a community group ofChiquitanos, the Ayoreo Community of Santa Teresita and the group of women of the Izozog indige-nous communities. The indigenous representatives are the majority in the Committee, which partici-pates in the definition of policies for the management of the Park. By Bolivian law, the \"Capitan\u20acas\" are indigenous municipalities that own and administer the land under their jurisdiction. In 1993, the new Agrarian Reform Law first recognised Bolivia as a multiethnic andmulticultural country. This law allowed for the existence of community land ownership and legalisedthe creation of indigenous territories ( Territorio Comunitario de Origen \u2014 TCO). It was not until these provisions on legal land titling were implemented in the Kaa-ya Iya area that CABI and the indigenouscommunities could become fully involved in management of the Park, and that many conservationproblems started to be effectively addressed. CABI is the long-standing political authority structure ofthe Guaran\u20ac people of the Izozog. It has contributed significantly to the social mobilisation that usheredthe national decentralisation reforms. For the indigenous communities represented in CABI, legal recog-nition of their TCO was the primary condition for any meaningful conservation commitment for theirlands Having established the park has only partially fulfilled the historic objective of re-claiming land upheld by CABI. Currently, 1.9 million hectares bordering the park and straddling the river are titled in theirfavour and the rest has being gazetted as park territory. CABI would have preferred that all 5.3 millionhectares (the 1.9 m. ha. land settlement and the Park's 3.4 m. ha.) were titled in their favour. The park'screation, on the other hand, was a realistic political compromise on all sides. It served to halt the rapidexpanse of the agro-industrial sector, fanning out inexorably from its base in Santa Cruz de la Sierra(Bolivia's second largest city), and ensured that traditional lands were not to be clear-cut for farming.CABI has also been able to capitalise on its internal cohesion to pressure the hydro-carbon industry intomaking significant compensatory payments to them for the impact of that portion of the 32 inch-diame-ter gas pipeline with a total length of 3,146 kilometres that runs through their indigenous territory andthe park. Such compensatory payments, totalling $3.7 million, and the activities that came in with thehydro-carbon industry, ensured CABI's ability to invest significant funds in the running of the park. Thisstrengthened their standing as effective co-management partners. In addition, the hydro-carbon fundswere crucial to supporting the indigenous organisations themselves, promoting rural development andaccelerating the process of titling indigenous lands. Co-management would have taken hold in Boliviawithout these funds, but would not have developed so rapidly, or garnered as much enthusiasm fromthe governmental agency in charge.146 SHARING POWERChapter the partnership is the realm of the Start-up Team, which prepares and facilitates the work of the relevant social actors. This is a criticalmoment in the process. On the one hand, the initiators and Start-up Team areusually self-appointed and have thus limited legitimacy to take decisions. On theother, they need to deal with several substantive issues, even if only in a prelimi-nary way. The manner in which they shape the space and style of discussions, thelanguage they use (for instance, what they introduce as \"problems\", \"opportuni-ties\", \"resources\", etc.) and, most of all, their preliminary identification of the terri-tory and resources at stake and of the social actors to participate in the negotia-tion are the cornerstones of the co-management process. To be sure, the processwill be iterative\u2014 as the social actors get involved, they bring about refinementsand improvements in defining, understanding, deciding and taking action\u2014 but agood beginning positively affects all future outcomes. The members of the Start-up Team are usually well aware of the issues, problemsORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 1471Long term residents and resource users may be of great help in an ecological analysis. An interesting view of how to identify p riorities in biodiversity conservation within a socio-political context is found in Vane-Wright, 1996. 2Information is rarely, if ever, neutral, and confers power to the holder. For instance, legislation can be selectively enforced by the few who know the details. Market values in the cities, unknown to the producers, may be many times as high as the prices paid for t he same product in the countryside. The environment now heralded as \"pristine\" may have been inhabited for centuries, a fact that conse rvation- ists may prefer not concern various social actors about a territory, area or set of resources. They have reviewed them during the CM need and feasibility analy-ses, but they should refrain from discussing technical questions or the best ways tosolve problems or respond to opportunities, as this is not their role. In the organis-ing phase of the CM process, the Start-up Team prepares for, and enables, the rel-evant social actors to do that themselves. GGaatthheerriinngg iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn aanndd ttoooollss The Start-up Team may begin by gathering and listing available data and informa- tion on the \"management unit\" at stake. This includes historical data and reports(trend data and records of exceptional events are particularly useful), ecologicaland anthropological studies, maps (including old maps), copies of property andusufruct records, etc. Among such documents, an ecological analysis of the terri- tory and natural resources would be particularly useful as it could describe theirecological value, the threats they sustain, the impacts of current activities and thecurrent trends in biological diversity and performance of ecological functions.Even when such an analysis is available, there are benefits to be gained fromrevisiting it in a participatory way, with the input of local people as well as expertprofessionals. 11Other useful studies could deal with specific resources, such as water, mineral ore, or migratory wildlife; with the local economy and its potentialin the light of national policies (trends in volume and prices of key agriculturaland natural resource outputs, including timber and wildlife products; trends inproductive activities, such as tourism; etc.) or with population dynamics, such asreviews of human fertility, mortality, morbidity and migration in the concernedterritory. All such analyses should be considered background material on which toground substantial discussions and not \"final statements\", as they need to be vali-dated by all management partners in the light of other information and a sharedvision of the desired future. Besides gathering various information and documents, the Start-up Team may pre- pare a short summary report of the issues at stake, to be offered to the relevantsocial actors at the beginning of the negotiation process. The report could reviewthe particular NRM context from various perspectives (historical, social, legal,political, institutional) but the Start-up Team should refrain from stating the posi-tions of various parties. If there are controversies, the report may mention them,and simply say what they are about. Preparing such a preliminary report is notalways appropriate. It should be avoided when it is likely that the social actorsmay be intimidated or upset by it. Not only the report, but also the maps and other relevant data and information should be made available to all relevant actors, particularly to local communitieswho may otherwise be deprived of the information they contain. In fact, the Start-up Team may wish to constitute a small reference library at the disposal of all par-ticipants in the negotiations. The availability of such information may be a noveltyfor some social actors, and the Team should be aware that the effective useof information needs previous experience and adapting time and is, in itself, anempowering experience. 22 Even more empowering, as a matter of fact, is the generation of information. Mapping of ancestral territories, in particular, is a key148 SHARING POWERinstrument currently used by local communi-ties to re-vindicate landand resource rights 33and to illustrate of resourcemanagement (see Box5.1). The Start-up Teamusually begins by gath-ering existing informa-tion and using it to pro-mote social communi-cation, but it can alsoencourage the genera-tion of new information, which the social actorsthemselves substantiateaccording to their ownknowledge and experi-ence (see Section 5.2).Indeed, a most empow-ering moment in thepreparatory phase iswhen the social actors organise themselves by preparing maps, documents and reports, and by describ-ing features, uses and entitlements of land and natural resources as seen, known and recognised by them . Box 2001) A growing number of experiences in land use planning include participatory mapping of community land and resources assisted by NGOs. The Institute of Forest and Agriculture Certification andManagement (IMAFLORA), a non-governmental organisation based in Piracicaba (Brazil), has facilitateda number of such initiatives. The Tapaj\u20acs National Forest is located in Central Amazon, near Santar\u00e9m, along the T apaj\u20acs River. 18 riverine communities, including some descendants of last century's cabano 's movement, live within the National Forest and have a history of conflicts with IBAMA, the federal agency in charge of managingthe forest. From 1995 onwards, these communities have been engaged in a planning process thatincluded the participatory mapping of land and resources. The maps were validated in a public assem-bly, with the participation of all communities, IBAMA and observers from various institutions. The mapsshowed that the community ancestral rights extended over an area larger than what had been previous-ly claimed by the communities themselves. Unfortunately, their detailed claims have notbeen recog- nised by IBAMA, which produced its own maps without local participation. Nevertheless, the commu-nity mapping process has been useful, as it helped developing a zoning plan (the Management Plan ofthe Tapaj\u20acs National Forest), \"empowering\" local leaders and community members and setting thestage for the creation of a pluralist Board of Directors ( Grupo Gestor ) for the National Forest. The Municipality of Boa Vista do Ramos, located along the Amazon River near Manaus, comprises 43 3See, for instance, Colchester and Erni, 1999, and the examples collected in Section 5.2 later in this Chapter.ORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 149communities. In 1998-99 these communities were involved in participatory land use planning exercises that included the selection and training of local \"environmental defence agents\" in mapping techniquesand sustainable development concepts. The Municipality of Boa Vista do Ramos was very interested inthe participatory mapping process as a tool for inter-agency planning and as a means to bring rules toland tenure and promote economic development based on sustainable natural resource use. The prod-uct of the participatory mapping was made available to all agencies of the municipal government andincorporated into a geographic information system. Atlases have later been developed and used in localschools, in a municipal land tenure programme and to plan for community initiatives. A key lesson that emerges from these cases is that participatory mapping is an effective method to pro- mote land tenure regularisation, to value local knowledge and to strengthen cultural identity. It wasfound important that different groups (formal and informal, divided by gender, age, religion and origin)were asked to draw the landscape and the resource uses, that maps were used to discuss a variety ofissues ( e.g., health, transportation, education) and that great care was taken in the process of \"restituting information\", through special tools ( cartilhas ) prepared particular stakeholder group. communication, 1997; see also Decosse and Jayawickrama, 1996. 5Scott, 1998. The same has been true for other national parks experimenting with co-management processes in Uganda, in particula r for the pioneering Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. As for biophysical and ecological information, the collection and analysis ofsocial information begins with the work of the Start-up Team but needs to berefined through a discussion of the recognised entitlements and unrecognisedclaims by the relevant actors themselves. This is a sensitive task, and it must becarried out in a participatory and iterative way. As mentioned in Chapter 2, theassessment of the relative \"weight\" of different entitlements brings the manage-ment partners to distinguish between \"primary\" and \"secondary\" actors (and evenlesser important ones) who may consequently receive different social recognitionand benefits in management. The gathering and validation of the information nec-essary to assess the relevant entitlements (for instance: \"How old is the history ofoccupation and resource use of a community in an area?\"; \"Is a particularexploitation permit still valid?\"; \"Who is paying the opportunity costs of conserva-tion activities?\") have major political implications. For equity's sake, the peopleand groups with a limited capacity to represent and assert themselves should beassisted to organise and gather the necessary information in support of theirclaims. Several participatory management initiatives have commissioned substantial back- ground ecological and social research prior to the negotiating phase. For instance,in the Muthurajawela Marsh and Lagoon Area of Sri Lanka, detailed environmen-tal impact assessments of proposed activities, flora and fauna studies, socio-eco-nomic assessments of local communities, and other such factors were studied aspart of the participatory exercise to develop a management plan for the area. 44In the case of Mt. Elgon National Park, in Uganda, comprehensive studies on humanuse of natural resources and their impacts on the ecosystem preceded the negotia-tion of participatory management agreements between Uganda National Parksand local parishes. 55 The information base for the CM negotiation process can been strengthened by a growing confidence in community knowledge, moving away from an exclusivedependence on formal and \"scientific\" information provided by professionals fromoutside the community or even the country concerned. It is important, however,that such local knowledge is recognised beyond the rhetoric. Some large scale150 SHARING POWERCo-management approaches are uniquely suited to promote complementarity between traditional and modern knowledge systems77, in particular during social communication events and participatory action research. In this light, a particularconcern regards the safeguard of the intellectual property rights of local communi-ties. To this aim, models of conduct have been developed and detailed guidelinesfor researchers working with local communities have recently been published. 88programmes implemented by state governments and involving impressive multi- million budgets\u2014 such as the Eco-development Programme in India or the Parksand People Project in Nepal\u2014 affirm that local, community-based knowledgeshould be respected and utilised, but it is not clear how they actually translate thisrecognition into practice. The greatest use of local knowledge is usually found inthe case of community-initiated or NGO-initiated natural resource managementinitiatives, for instance among the Kuna peoples of Panama, the Chipko move-ment in the Indian Himalaya, or the forest protection committees of Rajasthan inwestern India, all of which are built around traditional knowledge and practicesabout forests and biodiversity. It is also important that community knowledge iscompared and discussed vis-\u00e0-vis other forms of knowledge. For instance, local knowledge about endangered species appeared to clash in an important way withinformation collected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, inAustralia. The local Aboriginal peoples were reported to believe that the manateesare sea marsupials (\"the small ones are capable of finding refuge in the body ofthe mother\"), and much more numerous than marine scientists found them to be. 66 Box 5.2 EExxaammpplleess ooff PPeeooppllee''ss BBiiooddiivveerrssiittyy RReeggiisstteerrss (adapted from Gadgil, 1996; Palmer et al. , 1991) In India, an innovative strategy of documenting local community knowledge and benefiting from its use has been devised during the last decade. Some groups and networks involved in environment, health,agriculture, and traditional science and technology prepared a simple guide/ format called the People's(or Community) Biodiversity Register. With the help of community-based organisations, they tested it inseveral villages, assisting villagers to record detailed information on their relationship with their biologi-cal surroundings, both in text and visual form. The Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) was asked to assist in spreading the guide/ for- mat widely, including by publishing it in regional languages, and providing the Register a legal status sothat it could be used in disputes over intellectual property rights. After the MoEF's lukewarm response,however, some NGOs translated the guide/ format on their own and used various versions of it in sev-eral states of India. They agreed with communities never to publish information that is sensitive or thatthe communities do not want publicised. In a similar effort, on the other side of the globe, high school students of Costa Rica's Talamanca coast have documented villagers' knowledge about forests and wildlife, as well as indigenous history andknowledge about the environment. In the process, they developed a deeper understanding of their owncultural roots, and an appreciation for the practices of the indigenous BriBri and Cabecar peoples. 6Graeme Kelleher, personal communication, 1995. 7On this, see also Chapter 1 of this volume. 8Laird, 2002.ORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 151SSoocciiaall ccoommmmuunniiccaattiioonn The heart of a co-management process is the negotiation among the representa- tives of various interest groups on concrete decisions, such as a managementplan and one or more complementary initiatives. Negotiations, however, are notmeaningful if they happen in an \"information vacuum\", with only a few peopleaware and concerned about what is being discussed and what consequences thedecisions will entail. On the contrary, the interest groups that participate in thenegotiation need to be well informed, knowledgeable and aware of issues andreciprocal concerns\u2014 all of which can be achieved by well-designed socialcommunication efforts. But there is more. Successful social communication can help not only to better understand the partners' perspectives and learn from different knowledge bases.They also yield new perspectives, synergistic innovations and innovative break- throughs. 99All too often, decisions are taken \"based on limited consideration of a limited number of options, or skewed by biases in cognition\u2014 limitations inhuman judgement that are similar to optical illusions\". 1100Well-designed commu- nication efforts may not completely eliminate these problems but can reducethem considerably. In the words of Wheatley (1992): \"Innovation arises fromongoing circles of exchange, where information is not just accumulated orstored, but created. Knowledge is generated anew from connections that weren'tthere before.\" 9Ram\u20acrez, from Lavigne Delville, 2000) In development and conservation initiatives the communication strategy is rarely taken as seriously as it deserves to be. The external agencies cultivate the illusion of local mechanisms assuring perfect socialcommunication. It is instead part of the responsibility of outside agents to assure that information anddialogue arrive to distant households and are not confined to the individuals holding positions of powerand local privilege. The habit of holding only few and formal field meetings with local elite and deci-sion-makers may make an outside agency completely blind with respect to what is really happening. Itis instead essential to have \"free time\" to discuss issues informally, in a direct relationship between avariety of work of R\u20acling (1994) we may see a few key tasks to be accomplished by social communication in natural resource management: zmaking things visible ( i.e., clarifying and raising awareness on natural and social phenomena); zfostering policy understanding and acceptance; zpreparing for, and supporting, the negotiation process. We use here the term \"social communication\" in the preparatory phase of a co- management process to describe the on-going dialogue and information flowbetween the Start-up Team and the interest groups, and among the interest groupsthemselves. This can be prompted by the Start-up Team through a specific event( e.g., a public party, a community meeting, a fair, a travelling theatre piece), but152 SHARING POWERneeds also to include an on-going component, such as regular meetings or a newsletter and a well identified focal point for information (a bulletin board, aphone number, a designated person) where questions and suggestions can beposted or heard and needs can be reported through time. While the planning and negotiation process will typically rely on meetings and similar events, the facilitators of CM processes must recognise that there willalways be people and groups who remain unwilling or unable to participate insuch events. It is therefore advisable to remain aware of the limitations of \"meet-ings\", and to design and use additional means of social communication that pro-mote the on-going information and, as much as possible, the inclusion and partic-ipation of all relevant social actors. Box 5.4 SSoocciiaall ccoommmmuunniiccaattiioonn ffoorr ccoo-mmaannaaggeemmeenntt (adapted from Borrini-Feyerabend et al. , 2000) Communication may be personal (one-to-one), inter-personal (among a few individuals) and social (when it involves groups, such as a local community). Social communication is about providing the conditions for interactive learning and informed decision making in society, i.e.,fostering the sharing of information and the discussion of problems, opportunities and alternative options for action. It is a com-plex undertaking, including a variety of avenues, from personal (one-to-one dialogues) to interpersonal(group meetings) to social ( e.g., via the use of mass media such as the radio, TV or Internet). Interactive learning is crucial for co-management initiatives, as these seek to overcome the logic of top- down expert authority and prescribed behaviour. Whenever there is a gap or a conflict between what islegal (prescribed) and what is legitimate (emerging from social consensus) efforts at merely transferringinformation, awareness or skills are likely to be in vain. Only interactive learning, built on the directconfrontation and dialogue among different views (thinking, discussing and acting together), can over-come the gap or help in managing the conflict. A few points to consider: z\"Communication occurs when people have something in common.\" (Fuglesang, 1982). If we wish to communicate with people we need to understand the language(s) by which they describe their own reality , including fundamental beliefs, values and concepts (such as time, space, matter). zEffective communication processes and tools do not discriminate against the weaker and less influen- tial in society ( e.g., people who do not feel confident enough to attend meetings, who are not liter- ate, who live far from main centres, etc.). In this sense, audiovisual presentations, such as picture sto-ries and community radio programmes or \"broad participation events\", such as street theatre, may beless discriminatory than the printed media. zAny information conveyed should be truthful, fair and reasonably complete . Information depends on context, and decisions are conditioned by the perception of available alternatives. Fairness in com-munication is thus a complex phenomenon, depending on completeness of information as much ason strict adherence of information to \"facts\". zAny awareness raising initiative ( e.g., a travelling theatre piece) should be respectful of local cultural traits and norms . Difficult subjects could and should be raised, but cultural features and beliefs should be treated with respect and not made to appear inadequate or ridiculous. zAny training initiative should be offered with an eye to its social implications. Training a few individ- uals in crucial new skills for local production systems can originate important power changes andimbalances, and should be done to enhance not only available skills but also social equity in the rel- evant context. zMost importantly, social communication initiatives should include plenty of occasions for dialogueORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 153In the CM preparatory phase, social communication promotes an open debate and critical understanding of issues, including content questions, such as: \"Do wehave any problem regarding our natural resources?\"; \"Are opportunities weshould seize?\"; \"What could be done words, onewould need to start witha discussion on existingenvironment and devel-opment problems andopportunities, and move,at a comfortable andunhurried pace, towardswhat capacities exist todo something aboutthose, and what roles dif-ferent actors may wish toplay. It is useful to have a good \"name\" for the co-management processbeing promoted and a good description (words, images, definition of problems,etc.) of the ecological and social issues to be tackled. Those are an important visitcard for the Start-up Team and need to be culturally valid and broadly understoodand accepted in the context at stake, even if they may last only a limited time(any good process ends up developing, though dialogue and discussions, its ownand unique \"accepted common language\"). The Start-up Team may wish to testand adopt some terms or phrase in the local language, which would hopefully beperceived as meaningful, appealing and inspiring ( e.g., \"Let's manage the forest together!\", \"Solidarity between people and the \"Save our Sea\", \"Designing our life\", 1111etc.). The local name of the CM process is usually important for local acceptance andsuccess. The terms and phrases should not be trite or resemble party slogans; onthe contrary, they should convey the spirit of non-partisan collaboration, solidari-ty, working together for the common good. It is also important to avoid \"picking agood name\" from the top of the head of a few professionals. Instead, the nameshould ideally evolve in informal conversations with members of local communi-ties and various relevant social actors. Possible problems and inadequacies withthe translation of the names and descriptions in various local languages shouldalso be given careful consideration.and discussion, and the opportunity for everyone to express their own views, to ask questions and todissent. This, in fact, represents the main difference between social communication and conventionalinformation, education and training initiatives. While in the latter information flows from the senderto the receiver of messages, in the former information flows in all directions and collective knowl- edge, awareness and skills are actually generated as part of that very flow and exchange ( e.g., by social dialogue in the Paute community (Ecuador), Andapa valley, in Madagascar, comprises a plain delimited by the mountain ranges of Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud, covered by high and low altitude forests of great biodiversity value. The valley,excellent for growing rice, started being inhabited at the beginning of the XX century, after some colonsestablished there the cultivation of vanilla beans. The fertile land and the opportunities provided by theproduction of vanilla, and later also coffee and rice, attracted thousands of poor peoples from the sur-rounding regions. The enormous growth of the resident population went hand in hand with uncon-trolled deforestation. In the last forty years, the local population tripled and many continued to useslash and burn practices ( tavy) to grow pluvial rice . The relative proportion between forest and people passed from 1 hectare per person to 1 hectare per 10 persons. Local land prices soared. A ten-year integrated conservation and development project started being implemented in 1993 by WWF around the protected areas of Marojejy et Anjanaharibe-Sud. The project begun by controllingaccess to the protected areas, carrying out some \"environmental education\" and diffusing alternativeproduction techniques (irrigated rice versus the tavy, houses made of bricks rather than wood, beekeep- ing rather than collection of wild honey). In 1996, however, a new law on the devolution of resourcemanagement rights to local communities (the so-called GELOSE law) allowed to change the approachand to offer a new and better chance to the local communities and the local environment. The project understood that what local communities lacked the most was information on their own situ- ation. It thus invited local peoples and, later on, local authorities, to re-read their own history and toexamine their future in the light of the conditions of their natural resources\u2014 their common patrimony . This created new ties among the families and communities that were discovering similarities of prob-lems across the region, and strengthened the local identity, which had been precarious given the vari-ous ethnic and geographic origins of most residents. As part of social communication initiatives, infor-mation was conveyed on the new GELOSE law, which foresaw the possibility of assigning to the localcommunities the management responsibility for their own forests, to give them security of tenure overthe cultivated land and to acquire specific management capacities. As the new opportunities got under-stood, the communities started changing their perspective of the situation and the project could alsochange its own role. Initially the project was a main partner of the state in controlling infraction to the rules that excluded people from the protected areas, it diffused new technologies and promoted rural credit... all with thetype of patron-client relationships that this implies. After the broad change of attitude, however, thecommunities started seeing the betterment of their lives as depending on the management conditions oftheir environment, for which they could now be in charge. Change became their own priority and they began demanding help to organise and learn how to use their resources in more effective and sustain-able ways. The project could then adopt a new role, providing advice and acting as intermediarybetween the communities and the government. One of the early objectives of social communication is to inform the public atlarge about the relevance of management concepts and practices for the localcontext. But people should be more than \"informed\". They should appropriatefor themselves what management is all about, and transform it as they see fit. Inother words, social communication initiatives should be much more open anddialogue-oriented than conventional information or education initiatives. Theyshould not merely aim at \"passing a message about an issue\" but at promotingits critical understanding and appropriation in society. In line with this, the mostORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 155important result sought by a genuine co-management initiative is not for people to behave in tune with what some experts\u2014 including the experts in the Start-upTeam\u2014 believe is right for them, but for people to think, find agreements and acttogether on their own accord. One aspect of the politics of information is that information moves among the dominant sectors of society, or between them and the less privileged, but rarelyit is allowed to flow among the less privileged themselves. In fact, lack of infor-mation and lack of control over the means and avenues of information is one ofthe ways by which marginalisation is created and maintained. And even wheninformation passes from one local community to another, it is often mediated byoutsiders (government agents, NGOs, commercial media houses, etc.).Simultaneous to this is the fact that the traditional means of communicationamongst rural communities across regions ( e.g., pilgrimages, local traders, wan- dering minstrels and jostlers) are disappearing, with the commercial aspects ofsuch contacts becoming dominant over the informal exchanges they used to rep-resent and convey. Fortunately, some participatory natural resource management initiatives have themselves revived people-to-people contacts. Communities are encouraged tovisit other communities where innovative resource management initiatives aregoing on, and other are supported to do so by NGOs or, more rarely, by govern-ment agencies. In Columbia, horizontal campesino to campesino (farmer to farmer) communication has enormous potential, especially in matters such asprotection or revival of native seed diversity. 1122Traditional healers have also been supported to meet and exchange their knowledge and skills as a way to promotethe survival of their unique bio-cultural heritage. 1133Indigenous peoples in many parts of the world, and in particular in South and North America, are comingtogether more and more frequently to learn from each other and to jointlyrespond to challenges from outsiders. In India, the time-honoured tradition ofpilgrimage ( yatras ) is also being revived. In 1995, a major such journey of com- munication and exploration involved tens of local community representatives,conservationists, officials and academics who travelled for thousands of kilome-tres through eighteen national parks and sanctuaries, initiating dialogues withcommunities and government officials along the way, examining local problemsand raising awareness of possible solutions. 1144 Such contacts and communication are also a powerful way of keeping the oral tradition alive. In the past, intra- and inter-generational communication waslargely oral, and this continues to be the case with many indigenous and ruralcommunities. The written form cannot possibly convey the richness, depth, andlasting impression of the oral form. Leopold Sedar Senghor, ex-president ofSenegal, urged anthropologists to tape and photograph what the shamans, streetperformers, and old people of Africa had to tell and show; he said that they were\"the final keepers of a long human history, entrusted only to their voices... andwhen they die, it will be as if for you, for your civilisation, all the libraries wereto be burned\". Much of those \"unwritten books\" contain precious resource man-agement information and, as documentation always reduces and misrepresentsto some extent, community-to-community contacts are necessary 1995.156 SHARING POWERA great diversity of tools and techniques can be used in social communication efforts, from informal face-to-face dialogues to global electronic conferenceswhere most participants never physically meet. No one tool is likely to be appro-priate for all occasions, even within the same socio-cultural and ecological set-ting. Community meetings, posters, maps, drawings, poetry, debates, films andphotos, radio, the print media, street theatre and other folk media... the tools areas diverse as the situations in which they have to be employed, and should beadapted to them. In Cameroon, a conservation and development initiative sup-ported by the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ) in a tropical forestenvironment organised a series of visits to local communities, mostly inhabited byilliterate people. Their communication efforts centred on the use of particulartool\u2014 a paper canvas of about 2.5 meter width, with a series of drawings in aspecific sequence. The images were exposed one after the other during the com-munity meetings and a facilitator helped the people to reflect on their environ-ment, discuss on the trends they perceived about it, identify possible solutions,identify the need for a facilitated dialogue/ negotiation among all the interestedactors and brainstorm about who could do what ( e.g., who could play a facilitator role among contrasting needs and concerns). These meetings were very useful forpeople to understand that the project staff was a \"distinct actor\" with respect tothe government or the park conservation staff, and could play a role as mediatoramong various actors and concerns. 1155 In Congo Brazzaville, a similar project encountered tremendous local opposition until a person of local tribal affiliation understood the issue at stake and agreed tovisit the local communities and initiate a series of open discussions. 1166In that case, until the local people accepted the carriers of information, the invitation to dia-logue fell on deaf ears. The carrier wasthe message! Again in the Congo, some cassette tapes were prepared containing both music and information about con- servation and developmentissues. The cassettes were soldat market places and distributedamong the drivers of the taxi- brousse (the only means of local transportation), wherepeople could listen to them andpossibly start discussing optionswhile sharing a ride.... Songs, drama, dance, story- telling, and other cultural formsare used to great effect all overSouth America. These momentsof social communication arenot separated from normal lifebut merged with it. Traditionalforms of mutually supportinglabour, such as the minga of the Andean region, are energisedby songs and special foods, andfollowed by a gathering wherepeople eat, drink and celebrate 15Karin Augustat, personal communication, communication events may merge into participatory action research, i.e., specific inquiries by which local and outside actors join forces to understand the current situation and respond to its problems and opportunities.Conventional research on natural resource management is an activity carried outby experts (usually outside experts), which involves local actors only as informantsor labour. Local people are asked to provide information, but are not let to elabo-rate on the context or meaning of such information, and even less allowed toshape questions, define problems or test solutions. This is unfortunate, as localpeople are depository of knowledge and insights critical for management deci-sions. As a concrete example, most natural resource management projects do nothave provisions for historical research (including oral history of local communi-ties). A Navajo teacher eloquently brings out the importance of such an under-standing: \"Ethnic history is like a bow and arrow. The farther back you pull the bowstring, the farther the arrow flies. The same is true with historical vision: the farther back you look, the farther you can see into the future. If you pull the bowstring back only a little, the arrow only goes forward a short way. The same with history. If you only look back a short distance, your vision into the future is equally short.\" Participatory action research1188(PAR) is based on the involvement of local and non-local partners in a joint learning process. It has an orientation towards thefelt needs of local people and institutions and locally-generated initiatives. It val-ues and respects local history and institutional memory. And it has a focus onaction, rather than on the collection of mere data and information. The results ofresearch are meant to feed directly into planning and concrete activities and aminimum time gap is expected between data collection, analysis and feed-back.Last but not least, PAR exhibits a strong focus on process, with an equal concernfor both final results and the process that leads to them, a built-in communica-tion strategy and the redefinition of the role of non-local professionals, evaluatednot so much for \"what they know\" but for \"how useful they are\" to local peopleand communities.together. In Ecuador, federations of local communities built a major irrigation sys-tem, planted a million trees, and carried out soil conservation measures on slopes,through such a system. 1177In this sense, informal social communication activities such as joint mapping and surveying of the natural resources to be managed,involving a variety of social actors (and especially the ones not formally recog-nised!) can help develop confidence and trust on the Start-up Team. Dialogues,mutual learning exercises and the participation in common events are some of themost useful tools in this respect. 17Kleymeyer, 1996. 18Fals Borda and Rahman, 1991; Jordan, 2003. 158 Talbott, 1995. 20Eghenter and Labo, 2003. 21Kleymeyer, 1996. et al. , 2003. 24Tache and Irwin, 2003.Collaborative management efforts throughout the world have involved a variety of social actors in both baseline research and analysis, often generating a syner-gy between traditional and modern knowledge and tools ( e.g., between visual tools such as maps, pictures, films and diagrams, and oral tools, such as openmeetings, traditional media and rural radio). For instance, people of easternPanama, threatened by logging, ranching, and a proposed highway, combinedcommunity-generated maps with government maps, aerial photographs, and theGlobal Positioning System (GPS) to show the extent of local natural resourceuse. When used in lobbying and campaigns, their composite maps provedextremely effective in convincing the government of the need for rethinkingdevelopment in the area. 1199In Indonesia, WWF helped villagers with similar mapping exercises, used to ascertain, clearly and factually, the customary rightsof local communities in the territories declared part of Kayan MentarangNational Park. This was an essential step towards developing fairer zoning plansbased on customary regulations ( adat) and a legal co-management structure for the park.2200In Bolivia, the people of Tiwanaku joined efforts with external scien- tists to understand the local irrigation problems and ended up reviving ancientfarm beds and interlacing canals. 2211Such a revival of local, traditional knowledge for water harvesting, used in conjunction with modern engineering science, hasbeen happening also in some parts of India, with remarkable results. 2222The meth- ods and tools of participatory action research are usually close to the communitylivelihood experience and thus generally effective and well accepted. A tellingexample are the \"family portraits\", 2233which examine and describe in detail the production systems and copying strategies of typical families in a given context.Another example is the focus group discussion of stakeholders rights, responsi-bilities and revenues vis-\u00e0-vis 1997) A number of methods for land use and occupancy studies evolved in the 1970s in the Canadian north, amidst the Inuit organisations in Arctic Quebec (Nunavik) and the Northwest Territories (Nunavut).These included the development of local maps (with supporting text) resulting from community-basedresearch involving interviews with elders and expert hunters and fishers. Each interview led to a person-al or family \"map biography\". Using traditional cartographical methods, these maps were then assem-bled to produce a comprehensive geographic statement about areas and resources traditionally used.These, in turn, were first used to negotiate land settlements, and later to develop resource inventories,management plans, environmental impact studies, etc. The Ye'kuana communities of Venezuela have been inspired by the Inuit experience, and received the support of Canadian and other organisations to replicate it in their own environment. In fact, theyadopted participatory mapping as a strategy to both demonstrate evidence of historical occupancy andevidence of capacity to manage resources. The process began in the early 1990s and was based on aningenious demarcation method, adapted to their immense and densely forested environment. The com-ORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 159munity members cut trails from the villages to strategic entry points to the Ye'kuana territory. Once they reached those points, they marked them by opening up circles of 20 or more 30 m. diameter, whichcould be visible from above. Intervening boundary markers were either rivers or straight lines. The workwas accomplished by several teams, each comprising thirty men and women, which covered agreedborder segments in about 2 months each. A light aircraft was then used to locate the circles and geo-code their positions with a GPS system. In Ottawa, 3 versions of the resulting map were subsequentlyproduced: 3,000 copies of the basic map for distribution to each Ye'kuana, several glossy enlargementsfor national officials, and about fifty work maps with all place names deleted save those of the commu-nities. In a subsequent phase, the work maps were used by the communities to assign Ye'kuana names to streams and places and identify their traditional resources and the places that are special for spiritualreasons. This kind of mapping is about what people do as much as what they know. The Ye'kuanaaffirm that knowledge in the form of named places and resources indicates regular use of the landwhich is tantamount to ownership. This employs an argument that has been used elsewhere in itsreverse mode: to deny indigenous ownership of resources. When used by mining interests during theNunavut negotiations, this argument held that Inuit do not qualify for land ownership on the groundsthat they lack the technical capacity to identify the presence of mineral resources, or to mine them:they couldn't own them because they couldn't know them. The mineral companies would qualify forownership by virtue of their capacity both to know where minerals are and to exploit these resources.Following this, the Grand Council of the Crees demonstrated the importance of using the land andbeing able to prove that use in their case against a major hydro project. The Cree disputed the claimthat the land to be flooded was unoccupied by showing heavily documented evidence of their intensiveand extensive land-based activities. The Ye'kuana were made aware of this and communities planned to maintain the boundary circles they had created, for instance by establishing a camp and garden nearby. This demarcation strategy, to showevidence of use at strategic entry points by cutting a manga, was also used by the Awa, in the early 1980s, in demarcating the Awa Ethnic Forest Reserve in Ecuador. The final phase of the mapping proj-ect foresees the development of a long-term environmental protection and sustainable plan, designed tofeature in negotiations as evidence of the local capacity to manage such a large territory. Elements ofthe plan and map include issues of conservation, inventories, domestication of plant varieties, locationof protected habitats and renewable energy resources, potential new village/ camp sites and locationand control of tourism. Conscious of having to defend a territory that amounts to 10,000 ha. per person, the Ye'kuana are tak- ing steps to convince both the public and officialdom that they are best qualified to look after it. Whena project coordinator, Simeon Jimenez, had his seven minutes on Venezuelan national television, heused them to reassure viewers about Ye'kuana intentions. He referred to pressure from intrusions of garimpeiro (gold-miners from Brazil), he cited incursions of Colombian narco-guerrillas across the Orinoco and proposed that the public think of the Ye'kuana as guardians of the national forest patrimo-ny, acting on their behalf. Their strategy is around the proposition that they are the people best quali-fied, by tradition, knowledge, intentions and capacity, to look after their traditional territory. In summary, the expanded interests and activities precipitated by the initial demarcation phase served two purposes: to reinforce the Ye'kuana case for legal recognition of their lands and to address presentsocial and economic issues confronting the communities. Quite apart from mapping, the project isbeing used as a medium for exploring new ways to utilise the traditional resource base. These are seento have survival value and would probably continue even if the Ye'kuana case for their land was even-tually to fail. In fact, the maps are useful, but equally useful is the way that the mapping process hasprovided opportunities for communities and individuals to become directly engaged in generating thecase for their land, to a depth that would not be possible if their case was conducted by proxy, and to160 SHARING POWERgradually assume command of the process. In addition, the local technical capacities generated went beyond expectations and, as the mapping proceeded, community members took advantage of newcontacts and information sources to pursue various lines of inquiry and development of local interest,such as the possibility of mini-hydro and solar fruit dryers, a pilot project in ecotourism and other waysto address the local economic opportunities and social problems. Importantly, the process promoted new inter-community relations, drawing together communities that had remained out of contact for over thirty years and renewing their solidarity. This is reflected in thecomposition of the project maps. Although communities accepted local responsibilities for demarca-tion, and agreed amongst themselves the border between different community territories, there was noplacing of community boundaries on any of the project maps. This collective approach implies an obli-gation to ensure contributions from all communities. The process also promoted some local strategy toprotect traditional knowledge. Tactics ranged from the \"just don't tell anyone\" method to community-based mechanisms for gathering and consolidating knowledge and advising individuals on how torecognise and treat overtures from bio-prospectors. The methods require a high degree of local cohe-sion, access to external information and means to disseminate local information. The Ye'kuana havealso started a systematic collection of local plant uses and are gathering the information needed toidentify and anticipate bio-prospectors. Ultimately, they are developing a way of conserving traditionalecological knowledge in the most effective way possible: by using it. 25Neema various subjects ( e.g., forest-based rights), in which interested people come together to discuss and invite outside experts to participate\u2014 but only on anequal level. 2255These initiatives help in keeping the people well-informed and aid in participatory research on matters of importance to the village. In the villages ofMendha-Lekha and Saigata these events brought powerfully to light the long-termdamages of commercial exploitation of forests\u2014 even when seen in the light ofthe immediate economic gains of forest exploitation. Through similar interactionsthe villagers have been able to solve complicated issues such as conflicts involv-ing illegal extraction of resources and encroachments (while forest officials arestill struggling with such issues in near-by areas). In Jardhargaon village, informa-tion from both within and outside, garnered by the Save the Seeds Movement( beej bachao andolan ) and the forest protection committee (van suraksha samiti) was crucial in initiating the switch back to traditional seeds and agro-practices. Unfortunately the local open discussion of basic information on natural resource management is still more the exception than the rule throughout India. Too often,people are not even aware of developmental or other schemes and plans envis-aged for their areas. Ideally, government officials and outside experts would bringin the larger perspectives not so easily perceived by the villagers given their limit-ed experiences and access to outside information. In turn, they could learn fromthe detailed site-specific information that only the local people have. Together,local people and outsiders could make the best of their combined knowledge andskills. 2266 The essential outcome of the preparatory phase in co-management processes are well-informed actors, willing to engage themselves, assume an active role in man-agement and negotiate a fair share of the related benefits and responsibilities. Forthis, the members of the Start-up Team may wish to organise specific meetingswith the identified parties, or at least with the \"primary processes are just as critical and inter-group negotiations . In other words, negotiation within organisations is bound to influence negotiations between organisations (Pruitt and Carnevale, 1993). 28Marilee Kane, personal communication, 1999. 29Andrew Inglis, personal communication, 2000.them. The members of the Team who feel most trusted by the relevant people meet with individuals deemed to be representatives of each of the parties and dis-cuss with them the possibility of their participation in a co-management process.This is not a straightforward task. Even when social communication initiativeshave aroused their attention, the parties may not be clear about their managementinterests, concerns and capacities and/ or not be internally organised to promotethem 2277. At times, even getting together to discuss issues is a controversial matter, and the Start-up Team has to devise special mechanisms to ensure that a group isallowed to contribute. In Pakistan, for instance, women in rural areas are rarelyallowed to meet with people from outside their village, and basically never withmen from outside their families. The staff of a FAO project devised an interestingway to overcome this restriction and assign to local women their role as \"separateactors\" in natural resource management. They had local women and men dis-cussing together a variety of issues by partitioning a room with a curtain and ask-ing people of different gender to take place in separate compartments. 2288People were thus in no direct contact but could express their views and hear one another. Whenever possible, a useful setting for an initial contact between the Start-up Team and one of the \"relevant actors\" is a joint visit to the NRM unit(s) at stake.On the spot, issues and problems can be discussed with the help of participatoryappraisal exercises such as transect walks, interviews with spontaneous groupsand key informants, land use mapping, historical mapping, etc. In these, a basicaim of the Start-up Team may be to elicit views on the major problems the peoplewould like to solve, and the major opportunities they would like to see exploited.These views should be later refined and possibly brought into the negotiationprocess. Interestingly, these field visits may be important to dispel incorrect beliefs prior to the negotiation meetings, as it happened some years ago in Albania. During thedesignation process for a Ramsar site, a few prominent academics representingnational conservation NGOs kept lobbying the authorities and consultants for avery strict, no hunting and no local use management regime because of what theydescribed to be a \"huge recent rise in the population of the settlements around thesite\". They stated that many people were moving into the area from northernAlbania and that this was going to cause an unsustainable destructive pressure onthe lagoon. As evidence, they showed pictures of new houses being built in thesettlements around the lagoon. And yet, during a participatory public consultationexercise, immigration and emigration mobility maps were drawn by the residentsof those settlements and it emerged that in 11 out of the 12 villages around thesite immigration had actually been decreasing in the last decade, and the newhouses were being built by and for local residents only. This was confirmed byfurther analyses and took the wind out of the sails of the conservation lobbyists. Amore appropriate and relaxed conservation regime, including limited huntingzones, emerged in the final management plan. Without the participatory consulta-tion and the mapping exercise, there would probably have been a complete hunt-ing ban imposed on the whole area and the management plan of the Ramsar sitewould have been deeply unpopular and likely ineffective. 2299 Care should be taken to ensure that the views of the individuals preliminarily identified by the Start-up Team as possible representative of one of the parties arenot automatically interpreted as the \"views of that party\" on step should, in fact, be meetings and discussions with more people expected to share the same interests and concerns of the ones initiallycontacted. In other words, if early contacts were held with a fisherman leader, thelater meetings may be held with various fishermen associations. If they were heldwith a forester or a park ranger only, the later meetings may be with staff fromvarious government agencies. If they were held with a traditional chief or thelocal teacher, the later meetings may include the community at large. In such larg-er gatherings and in informal consultations, the NRM issues and problems identi-fied thus far can be introduced and discussed, and thereby validated, made morespecific, or entirely re-interpreted. The goal of these meetings is for the relevantsocial actors to identify and clarify their own NRM interests, concerns and capaci-ties, as well as to decide for themselves if and on what grounds they wish to claim any management entitlement (examples of such grounds were described in chap-ter 2 as the \"roots of entitlements\"). In addition, they may also clarify what type of entitlement they claim. For instance, are they interested in drafting and approvinga management plan, including setting up resource use regulations and zoning?Are they interested in taking-on management jobs? In drafting policy changes onthe basis of the management results? Or simply in achieving the legalisation ofsome forms of access to, and use of, natural resources? The separate meetings in the organising phase offer an occasion for the Start-up Team to deepen and refine the preliminary situation analysis and stakeholderanalysis with the help of the social actors themselves. Each one actor, in fact, canbe asked to discuss about other actors, and about their relative rights and respon- sibilities to participate in managing the territory, area or natural resources at stake.This can be prompted by some simple questions, such as the ones of [name X, the specific territory, area or natural resources at stake]? zWhy? What does it represent for you? Why is it important? zDo you have any specific worry about what is happening or may happen to X? zWho is managing X? zAre you at all involved? zDo you have any special knowledge or capacity to manage X? zShould you be involved in managing it? zIf yes, would you wish to take an advisory role? A decision-making role? An executive role? zWould you wish to have a share in the benefits deriving from the natural resources? zIf you wish to take on a management role and receive NRM benefits, do you believe you are entitled to it? If yes, why (on what grounds)? zIn light of the above, what management responsibilities are you ready to take on? zBesides yourselves, who are the main social actors ( e.g., agencies, groups, entities, individuals) whoORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 163can contribute to and should receive benefits from the management of X? zWhy, in your view, are they entitled? On what grounds? zWhat do they have to offer? Specifically, could they contribute to developing the situation analysis, taking decisions, advising decision makers, planning, implementing activities, monitoring and review-ing results or to any other useful activity? zWhat management responsibilities could be confided to them? zWhat benefits should they receive in compensation for what they would offer? zIf some management decisions need to be taken, who among all the actors you identified should sit in a \"committee\" in charge of taking decisions? zWho should be advising that committee? zWho should entitled\" to take management decisions? zWhy? zBetween actors A and B, who is \"more entitled\" to assume management responsibilities? zWhy? zBetween actors A and B, who is more \"more entitled\" to receive benefits from the overview of the main NRM stakes in the specif- ic context, and inform the Start-up Team of controversies likely to surface duringthe negotiation phase. On the basis of both the collected perceptions of the rele-vant actors and the legally recognised claims in the territory at stake, the Start-upTeam can draw a preliminary broad picture of who are the \"primary\" actors, theones that must be engaged in the subsequent management negotiation.Ultimately, their total number is also a consideration. Too many social actorswould complicate and slow down the process. Too few may end up leaving outkey players. 3300It should be clear, however, where and how the groups and individ- uals who believe to be \"legitimate actors\" can claim such a status and argue theircase on the basis of explicit \"grounds\". Not all societies or groups within a society recognise allmanagement claims from allsocial actors. They may recognise some but not others. They may recognise claims only in combinations with others ( e.g., dependency for survival + long- term relationship with the resources + uses based on traditional knowledge). Somesocial actors may recognise their respective claims, but other actors may denythem. In some cases, the participatory stakeholder analysis does not present anyproblem. In others, it may trigger latent conflicts. For some parties the recognitionof anyclaim of other social actors poses an insurmountable obstacle. For instance, a set of natural resources may be sacred to a traditional community andconsidered by them non-negotiable. Or a government agency may go by thebooks and not be willing to recognise any interest or concern besides its own gov-ernment mandate. Or some conservation NGOs may chose civil disobedience164 SHARING POWER55..33AAssssiissttiinngg llooccaall ccoommmmuunniittiieess ttoo oorrggaanniissee Community organising to manage natural resources is a natural occurrence, at the heart of human livelihoods in all cultures. Today, however, new actors, from stateagencies to private entrepreneurs and corporations, have taken centre stage for it.Policies and practices that subtract authority and responsibilities from local com-munities have been promoted now for several centuries\u2014 from the enclosure ofthe commons to the imposition of \"development\" initiatives on a huge scale, fromcolonial systems to disruptive agricultural advice and related credits, from schoolcurricula that devalue local customs to the daily brainwashing of advertisements.All this may explain why so many communities, today, are less than well organ-ised to manage their natural resources and may need new efforts or even externalsupport to re-gain the necessary capabilities. To be sure, all social actors to beinvolved in co-management processes need to organise for it. But local communi-ties are likely to be the ones most in need of re-empowering themselves for thetask. Kothari (2000) reports that several Indian villages gained new social respect and became politically stronger by organising around the restoration and sound man-agement of their natural resources. Jardhargaon is a typical village in theHimalayan foothills of Tehri Garhwal district, Uttar Pradesh. About twenty yearsago, faced with serious shortages of fuel, fodder and water, residents took chargeof the protection and management of the slopes above their village. Today, theirregenerated forests are providing them with their basic needs. These forests nowharbour significant wildlife and biodiversity, and professional botanists haveshown them to be amongst the most diverse in this region. Jardhargaon's farmersare also getting increasingly disillusioned about the short-term lures of chemical-rather than accepting government decisions that affect the survival of a given species. If this is the case, the Start-up Team may need to dedicate much energyto open up a social debate on the basic principles and advantages of co-manage-ment. Among those, it may stress that all relevant actors are expected to both con-tribute and benefit from resource management and that agreements can be devel-oped in an \"experimental\" way, according to adaptive management principles.No one will be compelled to relinquish authority or renounce acquired rights, butall can profit from solutions that are satisfactory and acceptable to everyone. Even before the relevant actors meet, the Start-up Team may be confronted by a variety of old and new natural resource conflicts. The analysis of such conflicts isquite relevant in view of future management agreements and the Start-up Teammay wish to engage in it with the active participation of social actors themselves.Care must be taken not to rekindle or exacerbate controversies but simply to clari-fy issues. 3311 31A number of ideas and options for action to deal with conflicts will be discussed in Chapter 6, Section 6.4. A special case, whic h needs particular attention, is the one of traditional and indigenous communities, discussed in Section 4.4 of Chapter 4. ORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 165intensive farming, and are switching back to some traditional practicesand reviving their traditional seeddiversity. Some of them, through tra-ditional journeys on foots ( padaya- tras) to the remote villages of their region, have collected several hun-dred varieties of seeds lost elsewhere(up to 250 varieties of rice, 170 vari-eties of beans, and many others). Thevillage is also maintaining its ownequitable system of irrigation, withspecific individuals ( koolwalas) appointed by the residents to lookover the traditional water sharing pat-terns, ensure that no-one misuses orover-uses the water and maintain thechannels in good operating condi-tions. Jardhargaon has also fought offattempts by outside forces to startmining on some of its slopes. Similarly, Mendha is a small Gond tribal village in Gadchiroli district(Maharashtra). The early interactionwith government officials has meantfor them only exploitation and extor-tion. The forests in the vicinity of thevillage were taken over and access tovillagers was restricted while the gov-ernment was extracting commercialtimber, gave permission to the paperindustry to harvest bamboo andawarded contracts to outsiders togather non-wood forest produce. Inthe 1970s, Mendha's villagers participated in the massive and successful tribalmovement against the Bhopalpatnam-Ichhampalli dams, which would have sub-merged their homes and forests. Subsequently, with the help of a local NGOcalled Vrikshamitra, the villagers form the govern- ment in Delhi and Bombay, but we arethe government in our village\"). They formed a Village Forest Protection Committee to manage the surrounding forests,and forced a stop to commercial destructive practices by both locals and outsiders(including the government and the local paper mill). Since then, the village hasexplored various avenues for generating employment, and has ensured year-roundjobs for all residents. Today the village assembly ( gram sabha ) is so strong that no programme, with or without government backing, can be implemented withoutbeing first discussed and approved by the villagers... Biogas production, fishing,irrigated agriculture, sustainable forest production and handicrafts are commonactivities. Indeed, the study circles initiatives described earlier in this chapter pro-duced, in 2002) From unmemorable times, Mongolia's nomadic herders have been the managers of the natural resources at the basis of their livelihoods\u2014 the very resources upon which the country's economy stilldepends today. Their traditional practices were based on common property of pasture and mobility as akey management strategy. Those, however, have been altered over the decades of centrally-plannedeconomy and during more recent socio-economic changes, resulting in unsustainable practices(increased numbers of herding households, changes in herd structure, lack of proper grassland manage-ment, indiscriminate cutting of shrubs and trees for fuel wood). These practices, as well as changes inclimate, appear to be at the roots of the current processes of land degradation and desertificationthroughout the country. To face both ecological and economic problems, some Mongolian communi-ties in the Gobi and the Altai Tavan Bogd areas, bordering China, are re-organising themselves. Theyformed Nukhurluls (support groups) attempting to combine the benefits of both traditional and modern learning. In the Nukhurluls , for instance, the community initiatives are typically led by young couples (in fact, mostly young women) but in the background remains the support of the community elders,who keep sharing their wisdom and knowledge rooted in community history and traditional resourcemanagement practices. Unlike with previous socialist collectives, the new community organisationsand initiatives are all on a voluntary basis. Their current thrust is to increase the community capacities,diversify its sources of livelihood, add value to its products and assert its natural resource rights. As rightholders, they can negotiate and agree with other stakeholders on rules and mechanisms for the man-agement of natural resources and protected areas. Some external technical cooperation agencies have played an important role in this, facilitating the analysis of problems and opportunities within the communities, promoting an exchange of experienceamong them, supporting linkages between communities and private and public sector organisationsand civil society as a whole, and fostering consensus as the basis of co-management decisions.Different local co-management models are now emerging. Park facilities, such as visitor centres, are co-managed. Local communities assign member families to patrol certain valleys, and \"Volunteer Rangers\"are authorised by the park. The vigilance of local communities who have a strong sense of stewardshipover local resources helps to control poaching and illegal trade, for example of falcons. Tourism deci-sions and related income are shared between park authorities and local communities. Importantly, self-organizing of community groups is occurring also in the absence of project support and contracts fortransferring natural resource rights to local communities are currently being discussed between gover-nors and community organisations in several districts. Those concern medicinal plants, wildlife andcommunity-based tourism. A working group including representatives of local governments, communities, research organisations and policy makers has also been established to develop appropriate concepts for community-based nat-ural resource management in the whole of Mongolia. The group is examining issues of transfer ofresource rights and management responsibility to local community institutions, long-term custodian-ship, ecological and economic viability of resource uses, capacity building of organisations, and devel-oping policies in support of all of the above. The Nukhurluls , strong of the experience of several years of work, are taking community organizing into a new era by forming district-wide associations andexploring legal and structural aspects of establishing an overall apex institution. This genuine grassrootsorganizing is playing an increasingly important role in rural development and sustainable naturalresource management in Mongolia. Unfortunately, the experience of Jardhargaon and Medha, the Mongolian commu-nities described in Box 5.7 or the Iranian nomads described in the Case Example1.3 in Chapter 1, are the exception rather than the rule in much of the rural areasORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 167of the world. Local communities, groups of natural resource users, and especially disadvantaged groups such as women or ethnic and religious minorities, are rarelycapable of defending their interests and concerns with competence and forceful-ness through avenues and systems too often defined and controlled by outsiders.To be sure, however, if they wish to participate effectively in negotiation process-es, they need to do so. In other words, they need to \"organise themselves.\" What does it mean? Three main components of a generic organising process (not neces-sarily in the given order) may be particularly important and will be discussedhere: z acquiring specific capacities (e.g., to attend meetings, to negotiate, to be recog- nised as a legal entity, to survey natural resources, to monitor biological diversi-ty, etc.); z developing an internal agreement on their own values, interests and concerns about the territory or natural resources at stake; and zappointing a representative to convey such \"internal agreement\" to the negotia- tion forum. In all these components, some external support may play an important role, and the Start-up Team is well placed to assist in the process. To begin with, however, itis important to respect the cultural differences at play. \"Organising\" is a differentconcept for different peoples and situations (see Box 5.8) and particularly so whendone through traditional procedures ( e.g., via extensive rounds of community consultations). In the mid-nineties, an IUCN-supported project in East Africalearned this at its own cost. It assumed that the presence of two local Maasai inthe round of discussions leading to an agreement over the Ngorongoro manage-ment plan was equivalent to the participation and consent of their whole commu-nity. It was not! A wave of protests followed the approval of the plan, which wasin fact rejected by the Maasai communities. More than the specific content of theplan, the Maasai protested about the lack of respect during the negotiations. Thespecific requirements ( e.g., time and communication support) needed to gain their collective consensus and approval had not even been foreseen, let alone provid-ed. Of course, if indigenous peoples have reservations about the ways of other social actors, other social actors have reservations about the ways of indigenous peo-ples. In this sense, questions and dilemmas sometimes arise regarding democraticprocedures and the respect of human rights (gender equity, age equity) within dif-ferent cultural settings. In some societies \"... people do not have opinionsbecause... it would be offensive towards village elders if they had.\" 3322These dilemmas are sensitive and should be approached 1997) The current local organisation and representation mechanisms in the rural Altiplano of Guatemala are fairly complex. They include: the Communal Sessions ( i.e.,village-level discussion and decision-making forum); the Council of Elders (whose decisions on regional and natural resource issues uphold the cul-tural integrity of the community and are final); the Community Leaders (including Mayan professionalsfrom diverse sectors); the Auxiliary Municipality (which bridges community interests with state institu-168 SHARING POWERAAccqquuiirriinngg ssppeecciiffiicc ccaappaacciittiieess We understand the term \"capacities\" as to encompass the attitudes, knowledge, skills, resources and social recognition that allow a social actor to take part mean-ingfully in the CM process. This covers an ample variety of issues and themes,from the trivial to the lofty. If a group lacks the resources to travel to a meeting, orlacks a good translation of the discussions into its own language, it would do it lit-tle good to have been identified as a \"legitimate actor\" or to possess unique localknowledge of the natural resources at stake. Vice versa, if the group does not mas-ter the basic conditions for conservation of the natural resources, no amount ofrhetorical skills in meetings will compensate for the fallacies of their misunder-standing. In general, external support can help, but \"local motivation\", an attitude that can- not be provided from outside, appears to be an essential condition for success. Agood example of this is provided by the village of Som Thom, in Cambodia,which responded in an exceptional way to the opportunity of a local UNDP ini-tiative. The village demonstrated great willingness and motivation to develop amanagement plan for the village forest, developed the plan and was soon there-after granted forest management rights. In contrast, other villages in the sameprovince of Ratanakiri demonstrated far less motivation and failed to acquire simi-lar rights. Likely, the motivation of Som Thom was a function of community soli-darity and the willingness to act together, while most other villages had adoptedmore individualistic livelihoods approaches, perceived by them as \"more mod-ern\". Som Thom could also benefit from the energy and activism of a powerfullocal leader. Interestingly, a difference in attitude (motivation and willingness toact) proved essential for both effective NRM and the acquisition of NR rights. 3333 A variety of social actors, including governmental agencies, benefit from or even require support to build their capacity towards more participatory forms of naturalresource management. This may comprise changes in their structure, organisation-al culture, attitudes, skills and work programmes. In Nepal, bold pronouncementsof \"handing over forests to village user groups\", with forest officials working asextension agents rather than control and command agents, remained for a longtime mere statements on paper. The agency staff needed re-orientation towardsunderstanding people's needs and rights, appreciating their knowledge and prac-tices, and grasping the social complexities of community rules. 3344A thorough analysis in the conflict-ridden Rajaji National Park, in northern India, realised asimilar type of shortcoming and tackled it directly with capacity-building pro-grammes for agency staff. 3355In Australia, when the Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority looked for key actors with whom to discuss the management plan of thepark, they found that conservation groups had already formed their umbrellaorganisations but the tourist operators had not. The Authority called for a majortions, holds significant responsibility in natural resource issues, and is highly accountable to the locals); and the Local Protection Committees, dedicated to conservation. In the Communal Sessions, communi-ty officials are elected, projects are approved and conflicts are resolved. No one in the communitymakes individual decisions on issues that are within the competence of the Communal Sessions. Theresistance of the Maya K'ich\u00e9 has been one of principle and integrity, validated by experience.Gradually, Totonicap\u20acn is consciously reaffirming its autonomy and ORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 169conference of tourist operators and supported them to form an association.3366 Regarding the capacities of local communities, many NRM projects have specific initiatives developed as part of their field operations. In Sri Lanka, for instance, aproject supported the development of Community-Based Organisations (CBOs)for natural resource management and development purposes. Soon, however, itrecognised that the CBOs were not entirely able to carry on their agreed tasks.Specific initiatives were then set up to train the members of the CBOs to gain amore in depth understanding of environmental phenomena, to collect relevantinformation, to keep systematic records and books, to write proposals andreports, to handle their own field projects, and so on. 2002) From its experience in capacity-building for participatory natural resource management in the insular Caribbean, the Caribbean Natural Resources Institute (CANARI) developed a framework for understand-ing and assessing organisational capacities. The framework includes the following elements: zWorld view : a coherent frame of reference that the organisation or group uses to interpret the envi- ronment in which it operates and define its place within it. This includes a vision and mission for theorganisation, providing a rationale for all other aspects of capacity; zCulture : a way of doing things that enables the organisation or group to achieve its objectives, and believe it can be effective and have an impact; zStructure : a clear definition of roles, functions, lines of communication and mechanisms for account- ability; zAdaptive strategies : practices and policies that enable an organisation to adapt and respond to changes in its operating environment; zSkills : needed knowledge, abilities and competencies; zMaterial resources : needed technology, finance and equipment; zLinkages : an ability to develop and manage relationships with individuals, groups and organisations in pursuit of the organisation vision and mission. In the experience of CANARI it is the collective sum of these elements that constitutes capacity and that can be rather simply assessed to determine the extent to which the organisation is able to participatemeaningfully in management processes and institutions. 36Graeme Kelleher, personal communication, 1995. 37Jayatilake et al. , 1998.Several conservation programmes limit their capacity-building role to \"environ- mental education\", often interpreted as \"teaching\" people about the value of theenvironment and natural resources around them. This is a limited and limitinginterpretation. Understanding the broad ecological picture of one's own environ-ment is indeed important, but equally so is the awareness of the various forces atplay (including markets, policies and laws), and the rebuilding, where it has beenlost, of the ability to value and manage natural resources on one's own terms.Some \"capacity-building\" initiatives have taken this path. In Iran, local Baluchand Kurd communities have been assisted to evaluate the problems environment on the basis of their traditional knowledge and skills, decide what they can do and implement what they have decided.3388The first \"capacity\" they were supported to develop was thus the capacity to think collec-tively and develop an internal consensus on what needed to be done. After that,the communities identified their \"capacity needs\" as they arose (for instance theneed to control a few pest species without chemical pesticides, the need to keepclear and detailed financial accountings, the need to develop a project proposal).Because the capacity needs had been identified by them, they had a strong moti-vation to acquire the relevant knowledge and skills. They asked for what theyneeded and the supporting NGO responded positively. As the Start-up Team assists the social actors to organise, it may face a variety of requests for assistance. Certain types of assistance are generally non problematicfor the promoters of a co-management process ( e.g., financing meetings to select a representative, or travel costs to allow the representative to participate in thenegotiations). Other types, however ( e.g., supporting the establishment and legal recognition of a new association), imply more continuous and onerous commit-ments and may take on a political connotation that not all Start-up Teams areready to embrace. The Start-up Team should keep in mind that support may be needed for allactors to understand what co-management is and entails. In this sense, orientation ses-sions, time for questions and answers and exchange visits to sites where CM isalready in operation are extremely valuable. As participatory management initia-tives become more common throughout the world, local expertise is developed,recognised and better utilised. This is especially true for the countries of theSouth, where field-based networking, exchange of experience and mutual supportamongst actors involved in co-management initiatives have proven powerfulavenues for building local capacities and achieving environmental and socialresults (see Box 5.10). A relatively costly but powerful option is to organise exchange visits betweencommunities, at least one ofwhom has taken interestingand possibly unusual actionfor natural resource manage-ment. This has proven enor-mously effective not only toincrease the knowledge ofthe relevant communities,but also to improve their atti-tudes. 3399As a matter of fact, local/ national and regionalnetworks have scaled upimpressively the capacity ofcivil society to affect theirbroader social context and,in particular, to influencenational policy for the man-agement of naturalresources. 4400 38This was part of a UNICEF-supported project implemented by the NGO CENESTA. 39Chatelain et al. , 2004. from Nguinguiri, 2000) Since the 1980s, several countries of the Congo Basin have experimented with co-management (CM) approaches towards the sustainable management of their natural resources. Their main challenge hasbeen \"how to do it?\". GTZ, the IUCN Regional Office for Central Africa and the IUCN/ CEESPCollaborative Management Working Group have been working together to provide answers to the ques-tion. Since 1998, they supported a partnership among relevant field initiatives in the region, whichcalled themselves Learning Sites ( sites d'apprentissage ). Ten such sites agreed to become involved in a joint process of \"learning by doing\". At the beginning of the initiative, the personnel from the Learning Sites were not enthusiastic. They just saw a further demand of time and efforts placed upon them. Through time, however, they realised thatthey were acquiring a variety of capacities (information, skills, tools and methods, new ideas and vari-ous forms of specific support) that helped them clarify their work strategy and improve their perform-ance. After the first meeting of the network of Learning Sites and the first technical assistance missions,the perception of the members in the network became overwhelming positive. After the first two years,the participants in the initiative demanded its continuation. After the completion of the fourth year, they promoted further joint initiatives, this time focusing on basic training for natural resource managementand involving all key professional schools in the region. Regular meetings among social actors from the Learning Sites have been the key steps in the group learning process. Each meeting was dedicated to a specific CM topic, such as \"negotiation processes\",\"conflict management\", \"monitoring and evaluation\", \"social communication\", etc. A typical meetingstarted with the Sites presenting their experiences on the specific topic, followed by group discussion toidentify common problems and explore possible solutions. The presence of resource persons helped tofill the gaps and illustrate relevant methods and tools. The meetings usually included a field visit andsome joint planning sessions, through which the participants acted as consultants for each other.Through these regular meetings, a relatively stable network of CM practitioners developed a commonlanguage to discuss co-management issues and a \"regional vision\" of what CM entails\u2014 a vision re-dis-cussed and pursued in practice in each Learning Site. The achievements of the initiative include: zbetter understanding of key process steps of CM; zbetter and more widespread knowledge about it (also through the diffusion of dedicated publica- tions); zbroadly improved attitudes (more confidence of practitioners in the CM process, enhanced mutual trust and willingness to dialogue among local stakeholders, aroused interest among key actors andinstitutions in the region); zgreatly enhanced skills among the members in the network (for instance in terms of stakeholder analysis, social communication, facilitation of negotiation, participatory evaluation); and zconcrete field results, such as effective negotiation processes, multi-party agreements and new plural- ist management organisations. It is highly desirable that similar initiatives are repeated in the future, hopefully with improvements deriving from the lessons learned in the Congo Basin. For instance, while the Congo Basin network wasnearly exclusively constituted of project staff and government officials, it would have been more effec-tive to include more representatives of local actors, and especially of local communities.172 SHARING POWER41On this, see especially Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of this Chapter. 42The World Bank has often been singled out port social actors to: zunderstand what co-management entails and how a social actor can organise to participate; zmaster knowledge and information about the natural resources at stake, includ- ing knowledge of existing environmental problems, needs, constraints andopportunities (comprising the costs and benefits of various managementoptions), and assess relevant change; 4411 zbecome a socially recognised (legitimate) actor (this may imply taking on a legal identity); zdeal effectively with agenda of meetings, records, accountings, financial reports, proposals, etc.; zcommunicate clearly with other social actors, listen to them with an open and respectful attitude and think afresh, including about new management optionson the basis of various points of view; zparticipate in preparatory and NRM negotiation meetings through covering the costs of travel and accommodation. Two last considerations. First, the capacity building process is inevitably time-con- suming and effective results may take years to unfold, a fact that clashes againstthe shorter time spans of usual \"projects\". Second, while external support is oftenimportant to stimulate new capacities and action, care should be taken that suchsupport, for instance to attend meetings and training sessions, does not becomean \"end in itself\". Too many meetings are attended by people interested only inthe payment of honoraria and generous \" per-diems \" offered by international organisations eager to show that people \"participate\" in their initiatives.4422In some cases, such people may be nevertheless exposed to debates and new knowledge,and benefit despite their lack of care. More often, however, the meetings whoseparticipants are not specifically motivated to attend are shallow and ineffective. Inthe long run they may even prove counterproductive, as they \"take the space\"that could be productively occupied by other has a \"place\" at a negotiation table insofar as it presents the coher- ent point of view of a cohesive unit or group. In Chapter 4 we discussed anexception to this rule, i.e., the so-called \"multi-cultural character\" of stakeholders (meaning that a social actor may speak at times with one voice but, at othertimes, may need to split into different points of view). In general, however, anysocial actor willing to participate in a negotiation table needs to form its opinionon the values, interests and concerns to take forward and on the desired outcomesof items in the agenda of the negotiation. For this, it needs to organise internally,with mechanisms to exchange ideas and arrive at a common position. Ideally, thiswill be a consensus position, implying a well-informed constituency and, as nec- essary, a rich internal debate. More commonly, this will be a majority or an expert position, with one form or another of voting or expressing a preference.Traditional decision-making systems may rely on either of the above. For instance,ORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 173the internal organising of the Maya K'ich\u00e9 in Guatemala relies heavily on collec- tive consensus, indirectly informed by the ancestral values preserved by the com-munity elders (see Box 5.8). The Anishinabe Ojibwa in Canada, on the otherhand, keep their elders in direct and full control of decisions on the use of naturalresources. 4433Traditional communities in Laos value both community consensus and leadership experience (see Box 5.11). Box 1999) In Khong district, in the southern province of Lao PDR (see Box 3.11), the communities interested in the aquatic resources of the Mekong usually learn about the possibility of setting up a co-managementscheme from neighbouring villages, friends and relatives, or from government officials. If their leadersare in agreement, they write a short letter to their district authorities, who later come to visit and assistin the process of developing a co-management plan. The communities are never pressured into estab-lishing management regulations. They are only assisted upon request. The process begins with the village and its leaders asking for the relevant government permission. During the time in which the permission is being sought, extension workers remain in contact with thecommunity and provide information and advice on the process to come. They also collect informationon what village leaders expect to achieve and encourage them to consult with their community. The leaders call their fellow villagers to meetings and explain the kinds of regulations previously estab- lished by other villages in Khong and how the implementation and enforcement of those regulationshave worked out. On the basis of those experiences, they then draft a list of regulations that the com-munity can agree to respect. Such advance discussions are important, because villagers feel more com-fortable if the regulations are discussed and debated within the community before any outsider isinvolved. The villagers need ample time to carefully consider the implications of establishing particularrules. In this sense, co-management is not as much about regulations being established as it is about thecommunication and collaboration process through which such regulations are identified and agreed upon . Usually about a month or more is allowed after the extension workers visit a village before a for- mal co-management workshop is organised in a community. Unfortunately it is not uncommon that the position of a \"social actor\" is deter-mined not by a well informed internal consensus but by the opinion of one ormore persons in power within the group. In some cases, the opinions expressed inthe name of the group may even be contrary to its best interests (see Box 5.12). Box and Bravo, 2001) The Special Law of Galapagos stipulates that artisan fishermen are to be represented in the Management Board of the reserve. In turn, all individual bona-fide fishermen need to be \"organised\", i.e., registered as a Cooperative. After the promulgation of the Law, a moratorium was established for the registration of new fishermen, with the intention of identifying and legitimising the existing membersof the sector, together with their entitlements to the resource. This was to strengthen their sense of common identity, responsibility and ownership of the marine resources. Paradoxically, the announce-ment of the formal process of registration gave rise to an uncontrolled increase in the number of mem- 43Peckett, 1996. 174 SHARING POWERAnother common occurrence are political representatives elected by a fairly large electoral college being requested to \"represent\" their constituency for very specif-ic management decisions, which chiefly concern only a minority of people intheir college. The risk, in those cases, is that the interests of such minorities are notfairly represented. For instance, in the United Kingdom the politicians who represent urban zones (who in Europe usually outnumber those representing ruralzones) are the dominant voice with regard to protected area issues. 4444The people living in and/ or next to protected areas find it hard to get their voice heard andtheir rights, needs and aspirations taken into account, despite being the peoplemost directly and powerfully affected. The process is deeply frustrating for manyof them. Urban people need protected areas as recreation space. Tourism companies depend on growing numbers of visitors and are a powerful lobby. The media tendto concentrate on issues that affect large numbers of people and thus, whenreporting on protected areas, they side with urban interests. It is only too under-standable that politicians cater to the same interests and pay much less attentionto the views of smaller rural communities. Yet, this can become a serious obstacleto good protected area management, as the concerns of the local communitiesmay never get properly discussed or solved. For example, the statutory bodies incharge of national and regional protected areas in Italy include, as representativesof the interested local communities, the majors of the municipalities that comprisesuch communities within their administrative territories. Not uncommonly, theseare large urban municipalities, the interests of whose residents may end up prevailing. Even in the case of innovative forms of protected area governance,such as the Parcs Naturels R\u00e9gionaux of France (see Box 7.10 in Chapter 7), thebers registered in the Cooperatives. The number of registered members nearly doubled between 1998and 2000, reflecting an influx of both new migrants from outside and of opportunistic islanders previ-ously unconnected with fisheries. This was the consequence of particular concurrent factors, such asthe reopening of the extremely lucrative sea cucumber fishery, but also of the poor dialogue within thefishing sector and the dominance of the views of people with vested interests. A traditional fishing community with a strong sense of property rights over the local resources would have used the registration process to legitimise and protect their acquired custodian and ownershiprights. The Galapagos fishing Cooperatives, however, were young, weak, and several of their leadersvulnerable to corruption and political interests. New members\u2014 many of whom with no local fishingbackground but plenty of political and economic influence\u2014 were registered without proper proce-dure. Such newly registered members were not part of the process that had defined the common visionfor managing the Marine Reserve and their interests focused on privileged access to lucrative resourcesrather than on an integrated system of sustainable fisheries. This led to profound divisions within thefishing sector and has had a destabilizing effect on the leadership of the different Cooperatives. Since 1999, different agreements were reached between the fishing sector and the relevant authorities as to how to rectify this situation, but none succeeded. Fortunately, in February 2001, at the last negoti-ation of the Participatory Management Board on the annual fisheries calendar, a consensus was reachedon the fact that the management of fisheries was dependent on \"a system of closed access\". A largegroup of legitimate fishermen are committed to this. The challenge is now dealing with those who con-sider to have acquired some \"rights\" in the recent registration frenzy and marginalise those among thefishermen leaders who still put personal advantage above the collective advantage of their sector. 44Inglis, 2002.ORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 175politicians elected in large electoral colleges are considered fair representatives of local interests. This may or may not be true. The above considerations touch the nerve centre of the difference between partic- ipatory and representative democracy. Ideally, a social actor willing to participatein co-management should develop an internal debate and a consensus positionwith regard to the specific NRM issues at stake. Elected professional politicians,however, rarely engage their constituencies in the analysis of specific issues, e.g., what is needed to manage a territory or body of natural resource. More often theysimply assume management responsibilities\u2014 i.e., they take and enforce deci- sions\u2014 even when they hardly master the relevant implications and subtleties.4455 Such failures in internal organising are one of the least analysed and most insidi- ous problems in co-management, which ultimately corrupt and spoil its meaningand value. In a nutshell, \"participatory management needs participatory roots!\", i.e., some measure of effective dialogue, discussion of issues and participatory democracy internal to all relevant social actors who wish to take part in the negotiation process need to identify and appoint one or more individuals to represent them vis-\u00e0-vis other actors (see also Box 2.5 in Chapter 2). For some ( e.g., an established government agency, a cohesive traditional community, a well organised modern municipality), this mayrequire little effort. For others ( e.g., a heterogeneous community or a resource user group some of whose members may be in internal competition), this may requirea major investment in time and resources and the Start-up Team may be request-ed, again, to provide support. In some cases a split between the NRM opinions and views of community mem- bers and those of the people officially in charge of representing them becomesapparent. For instance, a resource management committee was established in the1990s to act as liaison between the Djawling National Park (located at the deltaof the Senegal river, in Mauritania) and the local administrative authorities. Thecommittee was staffed with the \"intellectuals\" of the area, namely the local teach-ers who had left their villages many years before for teacher training. Having lostcontact with the local ecosystem and having being imbued with a concept of\"development\" as something measured in cubic metres of concrete, these peoplewere visceral against the national park. Instead of the park, they supported theconstruction of a dam, despite the fact that such a dam would entirely destroytheir delta ecosystem and traditional landscape. In contrast, most local villagers,who made a living from the resources of the delta, could see the logic of what thepark management was trying to do to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem, andagreed with it. 4466 The Iranian NGO CENESTA, which promotes community-based sustainable liveli- hood initiatives, devised a simple and ingenious way to help communities toidentify who should take on a role on behalf of the whole community ( e.g., a rep- resentative for a given forum, a project animator, etc.). They call for a generalmeeting in which people are encouraged to brainstorm on the main qualities andcharacteristics of an ideal person to take on the requested role. Views are IInn listed, discussed and agreed upon through open discussion. On the basis of the list of criteria thereby produced (including, for instance, factors such as\"knowledge of the local NRM situation\", the community\", or even \"having lots of children and needing a job\") thegroup is later invited to list, discuss and prioritise the names of \"individuals whofit the criteria\" and could effectively play the requested role. In this way, the com-munity is freed from having to choose the most obvious persons, such as the oneswho usually deal with government officials, the relatives of the chief, etc. Learning from the experience of CENESTA, it should be stressed that the criteria to identify a representative need to be genuinely identified by the community orinterest group, and not by the Start-up Team, and that the decision should betaken in a congenial atmosphere, free from rush and coercion. Time is also need-ed to gauge various factors, and the community or group, ideally, would havetime to discuss in detail the pros and cons of various options on its own. An alter-native to this method is the voting system, open or secret. Usually, this is framedby the obliged choice among self-appointed candidates, and the group does nothave the time to openly discuss the pros and cons of different choices. The choiceof representatives of a rather large community of people can be the fruit of deli-cate compromises and needs to pay attention to a variety of considerations,including respect for gender, ethnic and tribal differences (see, for instance, Box5.13, as well as Box 2.4 in Chapter 2). a project supported by UNDP was engaged in the promotion of sustainable livelihoods among numerous communities in the Darfur region of Sudan. As part of the initiatives supported by the...... tribe of Baqqara (cattle herding) pastoralists needed to be represented in a deci- sion making body for the purpose of a tribal ceremony. Since a history of interventions from the govern-ment had weakened the tribal system of governance, the tribe at first decided to convene a representa-tive from each of the forty communities into which many of the tribespeople had settled. Once con-vened, this group was named \"The Committee of the Forty\" and was clearly at odds with the normalorganisation of the tribe which consisted of twelve clans. As if by magic, as soon as the Committee of the Forty met, it became clear to everyone that it would not work. They decided to select from among themselves a small group of twelve representatives to handle the work of deciding, planning and organising the events more efficiently, and, lo and behold,each of the twelve representatives happened to be from one of the twelve clans of the Beni Helba tribe!Things went very smoothly from then on until the tribal chief, who was a bit dishonest, convinced themthat if a group of twelve could work better than forty, then a still smaller number would do even better.No sooner had he appointed a few of his cronies to handle the considerable money that had been col-lected from the whole tribe, than the money disappeared. This caused a great uprising against him, andthe Grand Council of Elders of the whole tribe met with a single agenda item\u2014 to start impeachmentprocedures for the chief. Only when the existing chief made a public apology and promised to neverindulge in such behaviour again, and restored the Committee of the Twelve, did the Grand Council ofElders agree to forgive him and restore him to his chiefdom. All went smoothly afterwards! In general, identifying a representative involves finding an effective compro-mise between two interpretations of what \"participation\" entail. As mentionedabove, representative democracy sees people's participation as mediated bypolitical leaders, usually professional politicians (in the best of cases locallyelected and in touch with their constituencies; in the worst, imposed by partypolitics and detached from local sentiments and aspirations). Participatorydemocracy stresses the direct involvement of communities and individualsthrough their active roles in a variety of social duties. In this latter sense, repre-sentation is a more complex process, and each act of representing a group isbacked by prior discussions, collective analyses, and even referendum-baseddecisions. The specific person assigned the representation role is also morelikely to rotate though time. Some professional politicians are actually endors-ing this mode of operation in their work. The Start-up Team should be supportive but \"hands off\" with regard to the choice of representatives of each social actor. Before representatives areadmitted at the table of negotiation, however, it should make sure of a fewpoints. Is each representative actually an agreed spokesperson for the group heor she is representing? Can this be independently verified? Also, what report-ing mechanisms are in place to ensure that the local communities or otherrepresented social actors will receive comprehensive information on the par-ticipatory management processes and decisions? If the CM process is done inisolation from the grassroots, the result may be their disaffection or even theiropposition to the decisions taken in their name. A genuine participatoryprocess accommodates the grassroots involvement in the discussions throughtheir representatives, but also allows enough time for the information to flowamong the relevant peoples and to be internally discussed before decisions aretaken. This can and should be explicitly monitored in G.N. Jamy, personal communication, 1997) In the northwest province of Sarhad, Pakistan, at the border with Afghanistan, China and Russia, a new participatory process has been reaffirming the old tradition of Jirga for nearly a decade . Jirga is the cus- tomary tribunal system of the Pathan people, where a community gathers in an open space before itselders to discuss important matters and resolve conflicts. Applying this method to discussing environ-mental issues gave birth to cross-sectoral \"roundtable\" consultations on issues of environmental sus-tainability in Sarhad. 4477In a roundtable the representatives of various social actors\u2014 including govern- ment sectors, NGOs, media, women's groups, academics, and the private sector\u2014 sit together to dis-cuss issues of economy, environment and development. There is no permanent Chair, and no specialrecognition of power positions. Facilitation is on a rotational basis, usually carried out by one of theparticipants. The roundtables have the important recognition of the government, which \"notifies\" theexpected participants to attend the gathering, but, at least at the beginning, they encountered somemajor resistance. The resistance was due to their non-hierarchical process and was only partially miti-gated by the fact that the model was related to the local tradition (the model is also similar to themodel of roundtable consultations practiced in Canada). Sarhad is a tribal area where the Pathan people continue to practice customary law, conserving a strong sense of collective decision-making. Consultation is the basis of Pathan society. Many Pathanpeople function through a non-monetary economy and harvest the same resources on a rotation sys-tem. The province encompasses barren mountains that, because of various causes, have sufferedheavy deforestation. There is little agriculture and industry, with activities relevant actors are organised to take part in the negotiation, the CM process is quite advanced. The next task for the Start-up Team is to identify a pre-liminary set of procedures and rules about how the negotiation should be held\u2014 an advice charged with cultural and political implications. The task also involvesthe organisation of the logistics for the meetings. PPrroocceedduurreess,, rruulleess aanndd llooggiissttiiccss Traditional societies have arrays of procedures for negotiating agreements, such as discussions of facts among community elders or in larger gathering in the occasionof a religious festivity or a market fair. Many of those procedures are convivial,simple, effective and inexpensive. A Start-up Team in tune with the relevant socialactors will know about the existence of such procedures, and eventually agree onlinking the natural resource management negotiation with appropriate, culturally-specific institutions and events (see Box 5.14). 47To fit local customs more appropriately those could have been called \"roundrug\" discussions. ORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 179stock rearing. Land ownership is in the hands of a few, and the small landholders are usually pastoral- ists. The literacy level is low, except among the non-Pathan Pakistanis. Sarhad is unique in that it hasthe largest refugee population in the world (more than 40% of the residents of Peshawar are actuallyAfghan refugees), a fact that exercises a strong influence on the economy, business and transport sec-tors. The official language is English, with Urdu and many others spoken. The initial roundtable gatherings took place in the mid nineties and were held every 3-4 months, each including 40-45 members, some of whom in charge of bridging ideas from and to villages and grass-roots communities. Special efforts were made to recruit educated women to communicate with villagewomen who, by custom, do not talk to men who do not belong to their families. The groups generatedideas, discussed issues, made recommendations, and reached consensus on strategies for action, onwhich they reported back at the following meeting. Written inputs were submitted to the roundtablemembers in the meeting interim periods. Overall, the roundtable process proved inexpensive, as thecosts incurred were only the venue and travel/ accommodation for the participants. Round tables usu-ally took place in the capital city of Peshawar, with rotating venues. A key to trust-building in the Jirgas on environment was the fact that meetings did not to start by tack- ing controversial issues, but rather with discussing positive topics, such as exploring what is involvedin a conservation strategy. One of the most productive effects of the round tables is that they led tochanges of attitude among government officials. In the presence of the press and NGOs, the govern-ment had to make concrete efforts to take on a protagonist role, and, as a direct result of trust-building,it invited to meetings some of the social actors and sectors that were formerly excluded from decisions.The visibility promoted transparency, as decisions could no longer be taken behind closed doors. Thisis particularly significant for Pakistan, where the communication gap between government and civilsociety tends to be large. In the Jirga meetings people began to see that relevant actors are not neces- sarily juxtaposed in their aims, that decisions need not to be taken in isolation, and that, gradually,civil society can affect governance issues. Concurrently, the NGO sector was also gaining strength. Atthe end of each session, the participants made an assessment of the proceedings. The collected assess-ments were reviewed at the beginning of each year, for an inventory of lessons learned to refine theprocess. In the mid-1990s, two of the 22 districts in Sarhad had roundtable processes in place to discuss their district strategies. In 1996, six specific roundtables were initiated, all with environment and conserva-tion as an underlying theme, but each with a distinct focus: Environmental Education; Industries;Agriculture; Urban Environment; NGOs; and Communications. Later, a roundtable on CulturalHeritage and Sustainable Tourism was added, as well as 2 specific ones for the Chitral ConservationStrategy and the Abbottabad Conservation Strategy. In 2002, the roundtables are a broadly acceptednorm of public decision-making in Sarhad and have also being adopted in Balochistan and NorthernAreas provinces. Some topics, such as Forestry, have proven extremely difficult to handle, as the ForestDepartment, with some support from the military government, resented what it perceived as a threat toits authority. After a long delay due to such resistance, the Forestry roundtable has been only recentlynotified in Sarhad. The roundtables on Industries and on Agriculture, on the other hand, have beenparticularly active, while the ones on Environmental Education, Communications and the CulturalHeritage exist but appear dormant. An important lesson from the experience of the roundtables is thatthey require a clearly defined role to fulfil\u2014 best if including a realistic policy agenda. The issue ofleadership and support is also critical as the roundtables are rarely self-propelled and need some ongoing facilitation and incentives. In all, however, roundtables have proven to be a useful and creativevehicle. They reinforced the concept of participatory decision-making, even though their policy influ-ence remains somehow limited.180 SHARING POWERIn some cases convivial gatherings may not be sufficient for negotiating a fair and sustainable NRM agreement. This is especially true when the relevant actors donot share the same cultural backgrounds, values, attitudes and habits. A hand-shake equivalent to a sacred pact for some may just be a pleasant discussion ofpossibilities for someone else. Some people may not speak the same language,both literally and metaphorically, in the sense that the meaning of terms and con-cepts may need a careful \"translation\" between them. There may also be largepower gaps or unsettled conflicts among the social actors, so that people may notfeel comfortable or even safe, to volunteer their views and expose their interestsand concerns. In such cases, the Start-up Team would better take a pro-active role and propose a schedule of meetings, some rules and procedures for participation, and some pro-fessional support to facilitate the negotiation. The relevant actors could well dis-cuss and modify such proposed rules and procedures but it is important that anentity trusted by all parties takes the initiative to plan in detail at least the firstmeeting among the relevant actors. To begin with, an agreement should beobtained on the participants, agenda, place, date, hour, working language, lan-guages in which translation will be available, logistics and facilities necessary forthe meeting that will launch the CM process (see Checklist 5.2). The Start-upTeam is best placed to propose such procedures and obtain an agreement be present at the negotiation meetings? (Who are the main relevant actors in NRM in our specific context? Have all been contacted? Have we missed anyone so far? Can new partici-pants \"volunteer\" to attend? What are the procedures for new \"relevant actors\" to be accepted?) zThe representation shall be formal (written affidavit ) or accepted also in informal ways? (The appro- priateness of a written affidavit should be gauged according to the context, including the relative number of literate versus non literate people in the communities.) zWhat percentage of the total relevant actors has to be present to declare the meeting valid? (Consider possible coalitions of social actors who may wish to boycott meetings.) zWhat language(s) shall we speak? Is there a need for interpreters?

Will it be recalled, discussed and finalised during the first meeting? By whom? zWho will act as Chair of the first meeting? Is there a need for one (or more) facilitator(s)? Could the facilitator be a local person, or should we call for a professional from outside?

(Consider seasonal changes in workload ofORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 181rural communities.) zApproximately, how many times are the actors expected to meet during the negotiation phase?

Are those in good working conditions? zAre refreshments to be served? Meals? Drinks? If not, can those be found near by the meeting venue? Where will drinking water be made available? zWhat is the total budget available to support the negotiation phase? Who provides those resources? When and how will the providers be acknowledged? zOn which basis shall travel costs be reimbursed? If people cannot afford to advance the travel costs, how can such costs be disbursed in advance? Who handles the money? zIs there a need for chairs, tables, rugs and mats, lamps, boards, paper, cards, felt pens, sticking tape, soft boards, pins, projectors, microphones, standing tables and/ or other materials to support discus-sions and presentations? Will everyone feel comfortable using those means for presentations? If not,how can cultural sensitivities be accommodated? zAre special requirements catered for? For instance, for vegetarians, for Ramadan observers, for people needing to stop work for prayers, for people with handicaps, for women in need of someone to carefor small children? zWho is responsible for the smooth functioning of the logistics ( e.g., send a reminder to the agreed participants, get the premises opened, cleaned, make sure that light is available if the meeting willlast after sunset, etc.)? All relevant actors should be informed in advance about the proposed agenda forthe first of a series of meetings and receive an invitation for their chosen represen-tative to participate in it. The note will make reference to the name and processdescription already adopted during the social communication events. The goal ofthe meetings to come may be set quite high, for example a series of meetings \"..tounderstand the main challenges to our natural resources in the next twenty years,and prepare together to face them\" or be simple and specific, such as \"...todecide together the best fishing rules for the part of the river comprised betweenvillage A and village B\". It should be specified that substantive issues of relevanceto the social actors will be discussed and the main points of the proposed proce-dures, logistics and rules should be included. Whenever possible, the convenersshould be a respected local authority or a governmental agency with local pres-ence and legitimacy, although the Start-up Team could also play that role. The rules of a negotiation process are cultural rules. This cannot be stressed enough. But, modern societies always include a multiplicity of cultures. How canthe process be fair if it risks being culturally alien or imposing for some of its par-ticipants? A possible answer is \"by embracing cultural pluralism\". Cultural plural-ism basically sees human beings as cultural beings. Their cultural diversity isrecognised and appreciated and their dialogue encouraged. Cultural minoritiesare protected against conscious or unconscious discrimination and of the Start-up Team are not only of a practical nature. Indeed, the Team is also the prime guarantor of fairness and equity throughout the CM process. Forthat, it is never too early to carry out a specific reflection on equity, and on how itcan be fostered. The results of such a reflection can be made explicit and incor-porated into the rules and procedures of the negotiation. What does \"equity\" mean in a co-management process? The question has been examined in some detail in Chapter 2.3. As it was discussed, specific answersdepend on specific contexts but, in general, equity can be sought by: zpromoting the recognition of entitlements held by unprivileged groups; zpromoting the recognition of entitlements rooted relevant actors are invited to the negotiation meetings and participate via formal repre- sentatives; zparticipation is voluntary but whoever does not come is taken as not being interested in taking part in decisions; however, if more than 40% of the relevant actors are not present for a meeting, the meet-ing will be adjourned; zlanguage should always be respectful (people should refrain from insults and verbal abuse) and disre- spectful individuals shall not be recognised as legitimate representatives; zeveryone agrees not to interrupt people who are speaking but also no one is allowed to speak about a specific point for more than 3 minutes (or 5 minutes or...); zeveryone agrees on talking only on the basis of personal experience and/ or concrete, verifiable facts; zeveryone agrees about notputting forth the opinions of people who are not attending the meetings (and are not represented officially); zconsensus is to be reached on all decisions and voting should be resorted to in most exceptional cases only; z\"observers\" are welcome to attend all negotiation meetings; za facilitator will always be present to moderate the discussion and ensure its fairness, but he/ she will never discuss or take side on substantive issues; zmeetings will never last more than 4 hours; evening meetings will always end before or at 10:00 p.m.carry out their life differently from others within a range of permissible diversity that is, for each society, historically determined. Between assimilation and laissez-faire, this third way of cultural pluralism implies an on-going\u2014 and very demand-ing\u2014 political judgement\" exercise. For instance, an important step of such politi-cal judgement involves devising a set of preliminary rules for the negotiationprocess. The Start-up Team is in charge of that, and should propose such prelimi-nary rules to the relevant actors during their first negotiation meeting. Checklist5.3 presents an example of a set of rules, which may be appropriate in some situ- ations and quite inappropriate in others, and which should be discussed, revisedand eventually approved by all actors involved in the negotiation.ORGANISING FOR THE , 2000) zdisseminating information on the environmental values, opportunities and risks of relevance for all social actors; zdisseminating information on various natural resource management options; zensuring freedom of expressing views and organising for action; zproviding support to the social actors, and in particular the weakest actors, to organise ( e.g., to build their own capacities, to develop and internal agreement on NRM issues, to develop a fair system ofrepresentation); zpromoting a fair setting (forum, platform) to negotiate management functions, rights, benefits and responsibilities; this should be non-discriminatory, follow agreed procedures and be assisted by animpartial and competent facilitator; zhelping the social actors, and in particular the weakest actors, to participate in the negotiation process ( e.g., by supporting them to travel, by offering translation service, by providing training in negotiation and conflict management techniques); zallowing a fair hearing to the \"grounds for entitlement\" and views put forth by every actor; zutilising a variety of forms of participation (consultation, advice, technical committees, etc.) to reach the broadest possible mutual satisfaction of all relevant actors; zutilising a variety of flexible NRM mechanisms (zoning, detailed rules of use, etc.) to accommodate the interests and concerns of different actors; zpromoting a tight proportionality between the management entitlements and responsibilities and the benefits and costs assigned to each relevant actor; zadopting deliberations by consensus (coupled with fair negotiation rules) among the key relevant actors; zkeeping an open door to new actors who may identify themselves as the discussion develops, and offer to contribute; zsupporting participatory action research, adaptive management and a fair measure of democratic experimentalism (learning by doing), allowing to adjust NRM plans, agreements, organisations andrules on the basis of concrete experience; zassuring that the negotiated co-management plans, agreements and rules are fairly and effectively enforced. grounds (as defined by the relevant society) versus entitlements rooted in the exercise of some form of power (see Checklist 2.3 in chapter 2); zpromoting a fair share of management functions, benefits and responsibilities among the entitled actors, and a fair negotiation process to decide about it. Checklists 5.4 and 5.5 offer some concrete examples of how to go about that.184 about to whom conveners and facilitators are accountable; zgive disadvantaged groups the options of notparticipating in negotiations (avoid being more \"visi- ble\" to powerful stakeholders); zcreate possibilities far disadvantaged groups to use alliances with more powerful groups in negotia- tions; zacknowledge the right of disadvantaged groups to identify \"non-negotiable\" topics, or items they view as inappropriate for discussion in the negotiations; zacknowledge that not each group may wish to support fully and unconditionally the agreements to be developed. Encourage stakeholders to express their doubts about impending agreements.

As a matter of fact, the more advantaged in societies are also likelyto be the people best capable of exploiting participatory approaches and par-ticipatory management systems. This can only be counteracted by some formof affirmative action, i.e., special support for marginalised groups. In order to promote more just outcomes, the politics at work should be discussed openly.Some steps can be taken to help place the vulnerability of the disadvantagedgroups at the centre of concerns (see process open to public scrutiny? zWere all the groups who wanted to participate given an adequate chance to do so? zWere all parties given access to the technical information they needed? zWas everyone given an opportunity to express his or her views? zWere the people involved accountable to the constituencies they ostensibly represented? zWas there a means whereby a due process complaint could have been heard at the conclusion of the negotiations?ORGANISING FOR Game Reserve is situated in the heart of the dense humid forests of Southern Cameroon. It is part of the world network of biosphere reserves and has been declared a World Heritage Site. Themanagement of this reserve affects and concerns several social actors, including the Bantu and Bakaresidents, the timber exploiting companies, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and the localadministration. The Baka are pygmies. They are a hunter and gatherer society characterised by nomadic customs. Under the influence of the government settlement policy, some Baka communities have been com-pelled to settle down in villages located in proximity of Bantu villages. This unprecedented co-exis-tence has perturbed the organisation of the Baka society and modified their customary relations withthe Bantu. The settled Baka found themselves obliged to abide by the norms regulating the social rela-tions of the Bantu. Thus, the Baka were deprived of their traditional rights to land and naturalresources: the Bantu recognised for them only the right of subsistence. As a matter of fact, the Bantuhave a prejudicial image of the Baka. For them, the Baka are inferior people. It is in such a context that the project Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biodiversity of the Dja Reserve, financed by the Dutch Cooperation Agency and implemented by the IUCN, decided to pro-mote a co-management process. For that, it appeared necessary to ensure that the Baka would be ableto sit at the negotiation table, and that the Bantu would recognise them as a social actor with validresource entitlements. To this purpose, activities were designed to address both the Bantu and Bakacommunities. Regarding the Baka, the project facilitated the recognition of the Baka chiefdom by thegovernment administration, the rightful remuneration for Baka work by the Bantu employers, the gov-ernment's attribution of community forests to the Baka, the self-reliance of the Baka women in theConspicuous differences in privilege and power are quite common betweensocial actors, for instance between governmental agencies and local communi-ties. But local communities are also ridden with internal inequities, based oncaste, class, gender, ethnic origin, age groups, etc. These inequities can be sig-nificant deterrents to participatory management of natural resources and conser-vation of the environment as they are of any other democratic process. Thereare many examples where local communities have tackled this problem on theirown, but there are probably many more cases where this has not happened (theinability of lower caste families to secure their own land and the many cases ofpolitical and economic discrimination about women are typical examples). Unfortunately, conservation initiatives can exacerbate such inequities 48and it is only too rare that they may attempt to redress them. Some unusual examples aredescribed in Boxes 5.15 and 5.16.zassess the legitimacy of processes, decisions and agreements in terms of the role and implications for disadvantaged groups; for each group participating in negotiations analyze the reasons far participa-tion or non-participation, how groups are represented, and the history of relationships amonggroups; zview negotiations as a long-term, iterative process and be ready to monitor impacts and adjust strate- gies to assist disadvantaged groups accordingly. 48Sarin et al., , 1998) Joint Forest Management (JFM) in India represents a radical departure from the tradition of centralised forest management. In less than a decade some remarkable results have been achieved: 16 states haveissued JFM orders; large numbers of forest officers, NGOs and village men and women are experi-menting with new approaches and relationships; and between one to two million hectares of degradedforests are regenerating under local care. The participatory management institutions in JFM play amediating role between the forest department and its general body membership. To be able to play thisrole in a gender and equity sensitive manner, the local institution should be able to articulate and rep-resent the interests of all user sub-groups of a forest area in the partnership agreement. All state JFM orders, except those of Gujarat and the draft JFM rules of Haryana, use the household as the basic unit of membership for the local institutions. The initial JFM orders prescribed eligibility ofonly one\"representative\" per household as a general body member. This automatically denied the majority of women, and some marginalised men acutely dependent on forests, the right to participatein JFM on their own behalf. The rule prevented them from gaining an institutional identity and directaccess to all the tangible and intangible resources and benefits available through the new participatorymanagement institutions being promoted. This is so because the one representative is invariably theman who is socially and culturally perceived to be the \"head\" of the household. Only exceptions areall-women households or households of widows without adult sons. In order to make JFM more gender and equity sensitive, several changes were suggested in the existing JFM framework and especially in the membership norms of the participatory management institutions. For example, it was proposed that each household be represented by at least two persons, one beingmale and the other female, and that all states make the presence of 30 to 50 percent women mandato-ry for completing the quorum for JFM institution meetings. In addition to these proposals, several prac-tical strategies have been being tried out to increase the influence of forest-dependent women andacquisition of their cooking salt, etc. At the beginning, the support of the project was geared towards the internal sharing of information and discussion among the Baka themselves about their entitlements and about what they recognised to bethe entitlements of the Bantu. As a second step, opportunities for discussion were provided alsobetween the Baka and Bantu communities. The two ethnic groups recognised to be interdependent fora number of reasons, including the practice of barter, which makes them fully complementary withrespect to several needs, and the custom of blood pacts, which binds some Baka clans and Bantu fam-ilies. The project stood on the ground of this interdependence to promote a dialogue on issues hitherto considered taboo and to bring the Bantu to accept to lose certain prerogatives by ensuring just remu-neration to the Baka and by recognising their chieftaincy and their rights to have access to communityforests. In this way the project succeeded in bringing both the Baka and Bantu to agree on the dailywages for the Baka who work in the fields of the Bantu. This agreement has been legitimised in a cere-mony in 1988, during which the Baka and Bantu delegates embraced each other\u2014 a truly remarkablefeat in the local context! Unfortunately, the severe scaling down of the operation of the Dja Project in1999 has all but interrupted the efforts towards the co-management process in the area.ORGANISING FOR THE PARTNERSHIP 187men. For example, gender-separate meetings have been organised, Some women organisations and some local associations and coalitions based on people-to-people processes have been promoted.More women staff are employed in Forest Departments. And some new silvicultural practices, respon-sive to gender and class-differentiated survival needs, have been developed. 188 SHARING POWERChapter 6. NEGOTIATING THE CO- MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT tthhee rruulleess aanndd pprroocceedduurreess ooff nneeggoottiiaattiioonn actors is the heart of the co-management process. It is wise to invest as much energy as possible in it, as the co-management agreementsand organisations are generally as good as the process that generated them.Typically, the social actors involved in the negotiation face two main challenges.The first one is process-related and concerns \"communication\" in its richest sense.How can a partnership be developed among people who, besides having differentinterests and concerns, often do not share the same values, attitudes, capacities,ways of working, reference systems and languages\u2014 in a word, people whobelong to different \"cultures\"? This implies overcoming serious communicationdifficulties, both verbal (co-management meetings have been known to need toaccommodate five or more languages!) and non-verbal. And yet, communicationdifficulties are not insurmountable, and plenty of examples exist of collaborativeagreements among groups that, at the beginning, appeared very distant or evenincompatible (see Box 6.1). The secret, if one is there, seems to be a combinationof determination, time, resources and an encouraging social environment.NEGOTIATING AGREEMENT Collaboration between Maori and Pakeha (non-Maori, predominantly of European origin) is a funda- mental constitutional requirement of the Treaty of Waitangi. A number of initiatives to involve Maoriand Pakeha in co-management have emerged on the west coast of the North Island. Their principles embrace both traditional ecological knowledge and relationships with nature (expressed in Maori tradi-tion as kaitiakitanga ) and modern scientific understanding of interconnectedness and interdependence (expressed through the concept of ecosystem, concerns for the conservation of biodiversity and assump-tion of stewardship responsibilities). The agreements developed under these arrangements recognise the mana (a fundamental Maori concept meaning influence, prestige, power, authority and control) of each iwi (tribe) and give effect to their status as a Treaty partner and traditional kaitiaki (environmental guardians ensuring the mauri or life force) of their resources. The agreements also recognise the respon- sibilities of statutory agencies that have specialised knowledge in the areas of interest. One of the innovative steps of these agreements is that they had their first meetings in the local marae (the courtyard in front of the Maori meeting house). These marae -based gatherings, open to the whole community, helped to create a basis for mutual understanding, trust and dialogue. The kawa (traditional protocols followed by each iwi) have much to contribute to the development of effective NRM agree- ments, starting from putting to use the tradition of dynamic debate and decision making by consensus,and the building of a common spirit through the sharing of meals and spiritual invocations. Forinstance, such discussions have taken place regarding the traditional harvest of the titibird, which is locally very important, both as food and for local cultural practices. A joint research project on titiecol- ogy and the impact of its harvesting practices has been developed, including \"cultural safety\" rules. Thecontract foresees that Maori people guide the research in consultation with a university research team.The data gathered will be published, but with a delay clause, so that the Maori could meet and formu-late their collective view on the research and specific responses, if need main challenge is more related to the products of the co-management partnership than to its process. Is it possible for a partnership to distribute the ben-efits and responsibilities of natural resource management in an efficient and equi-table manner, starting from a situation that, quite likely, is neither efficient norequitable? As described in Chapter 2.1, the starting point of a co-managementprocess may even be an existing conflict, as for the Galapagos Marine Reserve(Ecuador) or the Makuleke land (South Africa). To move from an acute conflict toa peaceful and just situation is a challenge indeed. The learning-by-doing experi-ences throughout the world summarised in this volume do not provide a recipefor solution, but nevertheless offer several insights. Importantly, for instance, thefairness of the process by which an agreement is developed has lots to do withthe quality of its results and overall impact. Some authors refer to this as \"proce-dural justice\". 11 No matter whether the relevant social actors identified by the Start-up Team are many or few, whether they are formally or informally organised, whether theyshare interests and concerns or are opposed by strongly contrasting positions andvalues, they need to meet and discuss issues of common concern. The basic ingredients of the negotiation phase are thus: zthe social actors themselves (hopefully well-informed and organised, as described in Chapter 5); zan agreed place and time where they can discuss (a discussion forum or 190 SHARING POWERplatform); zsome rules and procedures for those discussions (at least suggested); and zsome competent support to facilitate the communication, assist in the negotia- tion and mediate conflicts, as necessary. Every negotiation process is unique and needs to respond to the specific condi- tions and needs at hand. Nevertheless, some broadly similar steps are taken bymany processes of negotiation for the management of natural resources. These,which can be taken to represent some \"process milestones\", include: za long-term shared vision (ecological and social) for the NRM unit(s) at stake; zan agreed strategy to approach such a vision, based on a common understand- ing of the issues and obstacles that currently prevent the realisation of that vision; za specific agreement on how to implement the strategy (usually including a co- management plan for the natural resources at stake and complementary accords , as necessary, to address relevant socio-economic issues, cultural issues, etc.); za pluralist organisation set up to implement the strategy and review it, as neces- sary, on an on-going basis. (adapted from EPA, 1997) No one entity alone can solve all the management issues in a given watershed. That is why it is essen- tial to pull together a management partnership. Ideally, this will represent the key interests in the water-shed, will be of manageable size and will create many synergies. In the USA such partnerships arecommon. Some are loosely structured, while others are quite formal. Some are open, while others areclosed, meaning they do not allow anyone else to join besides its founding members. Regardless ofhow they are structured, making partnerships work is challenging and takes commitment. Commontasks that partnerships face include: selecting a leader, ensuring that all the right people are involved,and moving beyond any hostility that may exist among members. A group able to develop its esprit de corps can be very effective indeed. Partners can include any group that has an interest in the watershed. They may be conservation groups, local elected officials, chambers of commerce, environmental education organisations, local militarybases, farm groups, students, senior citizens groups, religious organisations, financial groups, creditunions and land developers, among others. The important thing is to include all the key interest groupsso that the partnership can tap into their strengths, increase its credibility, reduce duplication of effort,and make optimal use of limited funds. To get past the \"forming and storming stages,\" some groups that formed for the management of specific watersheds set their own ground rules. Examples: one group has decided that individuals can complainfor only a certain amount of time, after which they must move on; some groups have decided to saythat issues that are too divisive will simply... not be discussed! Essential ingredients for effective part-nerships include: focusing on common interests, respecting each participant's view point, thankingeach other, being willing to learn about others' needs and positions, and building trust. Experienced watershed co-managers say that one-on-one contact is most effective THE CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 191TThhee ffiirrsstt pprroocceedduurraall mmeeeettiinngg The first step of a multi-party negotiation process is an initial collective contact, a gathering or workshop where the social actors meet in a rather formal way. Asmentioned in Chapter 5, one of the fundamental tasks of the Start-up Team is thegood organisation of this first meeting. Attention should be paid to the venue (a\"neutral\" forum such as a school building, a community market or a theatre ispreferable to a forum that some could see as partisan\u2014 such as a church or gov-ernment office), to the timing (which should be convenient for people with nor-mal working schedules and should strive to accommodate also particular groups,such as women responsible for cooking for their families) and to the seatingarrangement (a circular arrangement without hierarchical dispositions, on theground or around a table, on rugs, mats, or chairs, is usually appropriate). Theagenda should be made available to the relevant actors in advance, to allow themtime to discuss their views internally. At the beginning, the convenor greets the participants and the members of the Start-up Team introduce themselves and recapitulate the work thus far. It is impor-tant to be transparent on who has facilitated and financially supported the Team'swork and why. In turn, the representatives of the social actors introduce them-selves and explain how their groups have internally organised and identified theirrepresentatives. The Start-up Team may then wish to recall and clarify what theCM process is set up to achieve. This is relatively easy when the meeting of theparties refers to a specific mandate, but more elusive when the parties face incom-plete or unclear legislation, policy and competencies. Also, the more complex thenatural resource unit to be managed, the more vague the situation may be. Forinstance, some biosphere reserves set up a forum of concerned parties with themandate of \"coordi-nating\", \"providingimpulse\" and\"watching it would beseen a sort of \"par-allel government\",which would bepolitically unaccept-able .22And yet, a forum of may build upits own legitimacy tosuch an extent thatits proposals get tobe invariably accept-ed by the politicalFurther, building partnerships takes time and commitment, and once built they need to be nurtured.However, their benefits are clear, as they lead to wider acceptance and quicker implementation of allsorts an explicit mandate for decision-making, an effective stakeholder forum can influence local land use plans and NRM regulations, the concession of permits, the sharing of costs, benefits and revenues and the orienta-tion of research. In some cases, it can even be asked to develop the technical pro-posals to be later decided upon, 33indeed an extremely important way of affecting decisions! In a first procedural meeting the members of the Start-up Team or a facilitator (if one is present) can illustrate a proposed set of procedures and rules for the negoti-ation phase (see some examples in Chapter 5, Checklists 5.2 and 5.3) as well as aproposed schedule of meetings. The discussion can then be opened until a broadaccord is achieved. In this context, the participants can be invited to state a com-mitment to fairness and equity in the process. All of them (and especially the pro-fessional experts!) can also be invited to agree to a mature, non-paternalist andnon-ethnocentric attitude, and to acknowledge the legitimacy of values, interestsand opinions different from their own. A skilled facilitator 44 Lay succeed in getting this point included as part of the basic rules for discussion. At the moment of agreeing upon who shall attend the next meeting, some people may object to the very presence of others and attempt to exclude them. The facili-tator can help diffuse these potential disruptive objections by assuring that aninclusive approach at the discussion table does not mean that everyone will equally share in entitlements and responsibilities for natural resource management. It will be the task of allrepresentatives together to identify every- one's role and weight in terms of substantive issues and decisions. Some peoplemay also push to discuss substantive issues well before the procedures and rulesare agreed upon. A skilled facilitator will not allow this to happen. He/ she canremind the participants that substantive agenda items will be discussed in futuremeetings, as the rules need to be agreed upon before the discussion can go aheadin an effective way. A productive and friendly first meeting is an importantfoothold for the subsequent ones, in which specific and often sensitive problems,needs, resources and opportunities will be identified and discussed. The facilitator may also remind the participants that for every unit of natural resources there exist a multiplicity of good and poor management options (theterms good and poor referring to the wide range of goals and objectives to be defined by the process), and that conflicts of interest among the social actors areinevitable but, in most cases, manageable. The concerned parties do not evenhave to agree on the same goals or priorities, provided they can reach a practicalcompromise. Importantly, in the light of the complexity of ecological and socialsystems, the best approach is generally one of adaptive management (learning-by-doing). This means that the decisions taken at the negotiation forum should bestrictly adhered to until they produce some measurable results, after which theywill be revisited and evaluated. On the basis of the evaluation and other interven-ing change, the decisions could then be adjusted or changed. As a matter of fact,even a satisfactory NRM solution does not remain valid forever, as the surround-ing ecological, economic and social conditions do change and management rulesand practices need to change in response to them\u2014 something everyone has tobe prepared for. Flexibility can be embedded in the final agreement through specific monitoring and evaluation procedures (sometimes called \"a follow-upprotocol\") that allow the agreement to adapt and respond to change. 3See Box 6.13 in this Chapter. 4Here and in the rest of the Chapter we will use the term \"facilitator\" with the understanding that the role may be played by on e or more external professionals or others, including the members of 8Geoghegan al. 9Egeimi et al. , 2003. 10Lewis, 1997.After the first procedural meeting, there are various possible courses of action, depending on the level of engagement that is being sought. It may be that the firstmeeting is followed by extensive public consultations lasting several months (thiswas the case for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia 55). It may be that only two main parties are going to be involved ( e.g., an agency in charge of a protected area and a local community) and that substantive matters can be agreedupon in a series of workshops (this was the case for several National Parks inUganda 66). Or it may be that months or even years of negotiations are about to begin among a variety of parties (this was the case for the Galapagos MarineReserve in Ecuador 77and for the Soufriere Marine Management Area in Saint Lucia88). In most situations, if the relevant actors are expected and willing to take an active role in management, a series of meetings and workshops is plannedahead, often beginning with the development of a common vision of the desiredfuture. TThhee rroollee ooff tthhee ffaacciilliittaattoorr Negotiation processes have to be firmly anchored in the culture and mores of the actors concerned. Many traditional societies know extremely well how to negoti-ate in convivial manners as part of normal life and do not need external facilita-tors, who may actually complicate rather than ease up matters. In other cases, themembers of the Start-up Team are sufficiently various and broadly respected to beable to facilitate themselves the co-management process. An external facilitatormay be essential, however, when there are strong power imbalances, unresolvedconflicts or communication problems among the concerned parties, when theparties belong to very different \"cultural\" backgrounds or when there is lack ofclarity regarding local authorities and rules. Many societies are today charac-terised by multiple and competing decision-making systems and actors ( e.g., cus- tomary systems and legal systems, traditional leaders, state administrators, agencypersonnel, project advisors) and people can \"shop around\" among institutionsuntil they obtain the decision favourable to them. 99These are situations in which positive and lasting agreements are unlikely to generate spontaneously and someexternal facilitation and the provision of a clear system of reference and rules maybe crucial. One of the key tasks of the process facilitator\u2014 whoever is playing that role\u2014 is making sure that all the relevant actors express their concerns, that no one domi-nates the meetings and that the discussion is adequately structured and proceedstowards the shared objectives. The facilitator can also assist in managing conflicts,usually by helping people to move from apparently irreconcilable claims andpositions (for instance \"we want a road across the forest\" and \"we want to elimi-nate access to the forest\") into the fundamental interests of the parties 1100(\"we want access to the zone north of the forest because it is an important market for one ofour major products\" and \"we want to maintain a viable habitat for this animalspecies\"). This is actually best done when the parties have taken the time toexpress, listen to and reflect upon their fundamental interests, and have articulat-ed a long-term common vision (see Section 6.2).194 involved in the negotiation; zcapable of relating with everyone in the negotiation; zextremely able to listen; zcalm, insightful and capable of posing the key questions (for example, on the root causes of the various problems and the feasibility of the options put forward); zcapable of eliciting the best out of the participants and helping them to see a different future for themselves and their communities. Tasks oof aa pprocess ffacilitator: zhelping the Start-up Team and the relevant actors to identify and agree upon the rules and procedures of the negotiation meetings; zbeing responsible for the logistics of the meetings ( e.g., selection of venue, agenda, seating arrangements, translation services, discussion tools, transportation arrangements, etc.); zensuring that the process takes place in accordance with the agreed rules (ensuring a comfortable situation in the meetings) and that everyone has a fair chance to participate; zchecking out that the representatives of the social actors truly represent them ( e.g., they are not merely self-appointed); zhelping the group to be conscious of itself and of its goals, mission and opportunities; zrefusing to state his/ her opinion on substantive issues and never deciding for the group on substan- tive matters; zpromoting the best possible communication among social actors, e.g., by re-phrasing points, asking questions, suggesting the exploration of key ideas in depth; zhelping the group to broaden the range of its options and open up to constructive attitudes, for example encouraging and assisting the group members to: \u0017talk to each other directly, if this was impossible before; \u0017take time to listen to and respect the positions of other groups; \u0017raise new points of doubt and self-doubt; \u0017clarify and enhance their own perception of the situation and opinions of other participants; \u0017bring new information to the attention of everyone; \u0017discover points of agreement that promise to be sustainable and deal with them before other contentious subjects. The facilitator is also called to prevent the process from being unduly deter- mined and run by \"partisan politics\". Party positions are often rigid stands madefor the sake of visibility, and clever politicians are more capable of arousing divi-sive tendencies than collaboration and agreements on common concerns.NEGOTIATING THE CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 195Indeed, this is a sensitive issue. Professional politicians may see the negotiation of an agreement over natural resource management as an excellent opportunityto exploit for their own partisan or private interests. This, for instance, was arecurrent problem in the early stages of the local agreements between parkauthorities and local communities in Mt. Elgon (Uganda) 1111where some local politicians saw the negotiation forum as an electoral platform. Because of prob-lems like this, some bodies tend to exclude professional politicians from repre- sentation roles in the CM process.1122This is an intriguing and controversial sug- gestion, hard to achieve in practice. As a matter of fact, many legally-sanctionedCM bodies, such as the pluralist management boards of protected areas inEurope, recognise as representatives of \"local communities\" only elected politi-cal representatives, such as the mayors of the main relevant municipalities. FFaaiirrnneessss,, ccoonnfflliiccttss aanndd ppoowweerr ddiiffffeerreennttiiaallss Politicians or not, it is logical to expect that the parties will be using all sorts of means to advance their interests in the negotiation process. This is inevitableand, given the existing power differentials among people usually engaged at thesame forum for negotiation, it seems to present a major and possibly insurmount-able obstacle to fairness in negotiation. As aptly expressed by Edmunds andWollenberg: 1133 \"...a truly level playing field is impossible to achieve. Power differences persist, if in no other way than through historical relationships among stakeholders. Rather than assuming that neutral conditions can ever be achieved, we need to assume that we can only work towards this ideal. We need to be vigilantly alert to and deal explicitly with power differences. Instead of assuming we have elimi- nated or temporarily neutralised political differences within negotiations, practi- tioners need to acknowledge power relations in negotiations and work actively to increase the decision-making power of disadvantaged groups. [...] a more politically sensitive approach to negotiations can yield better benefits for disad- vantaged groups.\" Indeed, power differentials are a serious obstacle to fairness, but they should beseen in the light of what is happening all over the world outside the enhanced visibility of a pluralist negotiation forum. The existence of an open negotiationplatform, the agreement on rules and procedures and the presence of a compe-tent external facilitator are important steps towards guaranteeing at least a meas- ureof fairness in the negotiation even when strong power differentials exist. An experienced facilitator can help the parties take the best advantage of the open-ness and visibility of the process, making sure that correct behaviour is acknowl-edged and incorrect behaviour discouraged. The aim is to develop agreementsthat are as equitable as possible and that do not leave any major social actorsout of the picture, humiliated, exploited or treated unfairly. Equitable agreementsare desirable per se , and some maintain they may have better chances of remaining valid through time.1144 One of the important elements to agree upon in advance is what to do in the case for the Junta de Manejo Participativo of the Galapagos Marine Reserve. 13Edmunds and Wollenberg, 2002. 14In the words of Phillips, for instance, \"An iron rule\" is that \"no protected area can succeed for long in the teeth of local op position.\" (Borrini-Feyerabend et al. , 2002). Others, however, stress that injustice can be sustained for the sake of conservation with remarkable robustness (Brockington, 2003). 196 SHARING POWERserious conflict among the parties, such as blockages in the negotiation, different interpretation of agreements or seemingly unsolvable procedural disagreements.The facilitator may stress that internal consensus-seeking procedures are the firstand most promising option. Basically this involves the thorough discussion of theissues and reasons for the parties to uphold their positions, as well as the explo-ration of any nook and cranny for agreement and compromise. If this is not suffi-cient to resolve the dispute, a number of possible advisors (individuals or bod-ies), arbiters and judicial resolution systems can be called to help. Ideally, thosewould be identified well before disputes arise, as part of a hierarchy of disputeresolution mechanisms agreed upon early in the process. The facilitator should be well aware of local customs, cultural peculiarities and relevant experiences and institutions, in particular customary ways and institu-tions capable of managing conflicts, and which could be called in to help in dif-ficult circumstances. Box 6.4 cautions against attempting to understand conflictresolution processes without a sophisticated degree of cultural sensitivity. InNepal, the Forest Department took nearly two decades to discover that the vil-lage-based Panchayats provided more effective and respected forms of conflictresolution among forest users than the western-style law enforcement introducedin the 1970s. 1155In Canada, it has been found that conflicts between the Inuit people and the government biologists could only be resolved through extensivecommunity-based communication efforts and mutual respect. Only if that waspresent, modern technology could help. A major dispute over the size of aKaminuriak caribou herd, for instance, was resolved through the use and analy-sis of videotapes, but this was achieved only when everyone had learned to lis-ten and ensured to the others the full respect of their dignity and a fair share in the final decisions. 1166 Box 6.3 CCoonnfflliicctt mmaannaaggeemmeenntt\u2014\u2014 CChhiinneessee ssttyyllee (adapted from Cao and Zhang , 1997) In China, it is said that management of the forest can never take place without conflicts, both within and among communities. Intra-village conflicts usually take place over the sharing of forest productsamong members of the same family. Excess want and unfair allocation are the main reasons for theconflicts. The conflict is usually settled within the family with the village committee as mediator. Inter-village conflicts usually have a long history, at times traced to the very first local settlements. Most dis-putes are about boundaries of control areas, resulting from the changing patterns of village settlementsand immigration. Mr. Li, a former headman of Dongda village, in the Yunnan province (south-central China), explained the way in which Chinese villages deal with conflicts: \"Solving inter-village conflicts involves the par-ticipation of local government officials. When two villages debate on the ownership of a certain patchof forest land, the neighbouring committees come in for a debate and the local government is requestedto send its representative. The discussion is held alternatively in each of the villages\u2014 one day in oneand the following day in the other. During the discussion, the host village provides food and accommo-dation for the visiting village committee. The hot debate is always after the meal, not during the meal.Each side presents all the documents and materials supporting their case, even from the pre-Communistperiod, and the conflict-solving process takes at the most three days. In case the conflict cannot be set-tled by the discussion, the local government gives a final judgment and ends the conflict.\" 15Don Gilmour, personal communication, 1996. 16Snowden, Kusagak CCoonnfflliicctt mmaannaaggeemmeenntt\u2014\u2014 IIrraanniiaann ssttyyllee An American anthropologist was doing his doctoral research on conflict resolution in the \"bazaar\" of Tehran. After several months of work, he was exceeding frustrated and wrote a letter to his thesis advi-sor. \" I've now been preparing to observe this process for 6 months. I've learned the language and haveput myself in positions of trust. I've been present at various occasions in meetings where a conflict isexpected to be resolved. I turn on my tape recorder, and wait endlessly. These people just keep drink-ing tea and talking about everything in the world except the issue that is the cause of the conflict to beresolved! Please tell me, Professor, how can I make them talk about the conflict to be resolved, so that Ican collect the data I need for my thesis? Help!\" The advisor wrote him that he had just missed the most beautiful way in which they traditionally resolve conflicts: being hospitable and friendly, drinking tea and conversing about all the other things inthe world that are not conductive to conflict, until the problem goes away! 1177 17John Bennett, personal communication, 1971. 18For a simple guidance to visioning exercises see Borrini-Feyerabend et al. (2000). Many resources are also available in the Internet, for instance the beginning of the substantive negotiations, after the partners have agreed on the rules and procedures to guide the process, one or more meetings can bedevoted to establishing a base of common interests and concerns among all therelevant actors. In such meetings, the participants are encouraged to discuss theirlong-term wishes for the NRM unit(s) at stake, i.e.,the kind of environment, natural resources and living conditions they would like, ideally, to leave to their childrenand grandchildren. The time frame is usually set to twenty or more years from thepresent, so that people can free themselves, if at all possible, from pressing needsand current controversies. This is a crucial moment in the development of a co-management setting, as it is the first time in which different values and viewscome to face one another openly and publicly. One of the most powerful con-frontations is likely to take place between \"local\" perspectives and values, oftenpractical, hard-headed and locally wise, and more \"general\" and abstract per-spectives and values, including scientific and ecological views, biodiversity con-servation values and the \"development\" concerns of national governments andprivate sector interests. Acknowledging the existence of such differences, the facilitator can nevertheless help the participants to develop a consensus on a common vision of a desiredfuture, with specific descriptions\u2014 as visual and concrete as possible\u2014 of theecological and socio-economic situation in the NRM unit(s). This can be donethrough visioning exercises, scenario-building or simply through dialogues andbroad discussion sessions. 1188Visioning exercises are commonly done in many environments and they can be more or less comfortable for the people involvedaccording to local customs and to the homogeneity of participants. In Ghana, avisioning exercise done at the district level proved that local people\u2014 rangingfrom traditional chiefs to bank officials, from small farmers to transport operators,198 SHARING Twenty years from now Wenchi is an exceptionally rich district, including a large, well-planned and functional town. Its economy is based on modern, mechanised, irrigated and biologically sound agri-culture, with diversified production for both the export market (cashew, yam, palm oil) and the domes-tic market (grains, vegetables, legumes, palm oil). Livestock production is centred on stall-fed animalsproducing manure to fertilise the land, and small poultry farms. Revenues also come from the mining ofstone and gold (with great care to prevent environmental damage), some industrial production ( e.g., a brick and tile factory making use of a local clay deposit, a textile factory, a soap factory making use ofpalm oil products) as well as from handicrafts ( e.g., pottery) and other tourism activities (there are sever- al hotels in Wenchi, and even an airport). Agricultural and industrial activities are based on a well-planned zoning of the district and a conscious- ly sought-out diversification of the economy. The Bai dam near Benda is providing the electricity supplyfor many small processing facilities and some larger ones (cassava chips, cashew and vegetables). Agriculture and local food sufficiency are sustained by: zsecured access to land of small farmers on equitable leasing and sharecropping systems; za vibrant market system, well linked with Ghaneian and foreign buyers, making use of standard weights and measures in the whole district (today not yet available!) and allowing full and free circu- lation of products and people; zan excellent road network and telecommunication system, providing farmers with timely information and connection to local and distant markets; zsuperb agricultural advice (the Wenchi Farm Institute has evolved into an Agricultural University), including advice on how to grow crops organically and conduct farm-based experimental trials; zcommunity credit schemes to assist both agriculture and industry; zgreat care to protect environmental resources such as soil fertility ( e.g., intercropping, crop rotation, use of compost, legumes, farm manure) sustained by long term land leases; zfull literacy of farmers; zcommunity organisations sharing irrigation facilities, transport vehicles, storage facilities and farming and processing machineries. The whole Wenchi district is a beautiful mosaic of well-planned farmland, forest patches sustaining a variety of local plants and animals, and human settlements. More than forty forest patches of sacredgroves remain undisturbed since times immemorial. The river banks are lined with vegetation and par-from local government authorities to charcoal producers\u2014 succeeded to achievea fairly harmonious outcome. Different people could indeed harmonise their goalsand develop a new willingness to work together. This required some work, how-ever, as the original visions of different actors were not entirely compatible. Forinstance, some actors saw a future centred on industrial development for the dis-trict, while others wanted to maintain its agricultural vocation and stressed envi-ronmental sustainability. Eventually, a compromise was developed. Interestingly, itwas not a minimum common denominator compromise but a specific and mean-ingful vision agreed by all (see Box 6.5).NEGOTIATING THE CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 199A visioning exercise should not be taken lightly. If done with appropriate prepara- tion and care it is a powerful moment in the life of a community and should berespected as such. Unfortunately, many projects and donor agencies promotevisioning as just \"another step\" in a rapid appraisal exercise, raising hopes andexpectations and later failing to respond to them. 1199This is a dangerous pitfall. External actors should refrain from promoting participatory visioning and planningexercises if they do not have the intention of helping the community carry themthrough, at least in part. ticularly beautiful river sites, including waterfalls, are renowned as tourist attractions. The actualincrease in forest extension in the district in the last twenty years has brought about an improved rain-fall pattern. Natural resource management is regulated by the District Assembly. Local by-laws ( e.g., for the protec- tion of sacred groves, the collection of non-timber forest products, the collection of poles, the creationof windbreaks, the protection of water bodies, the prevention of bush fires) are proclaimed andenforced by local relevant institutions, which include representatives of traditional leaders, farmers,elected representatives and the government. Private and community-owned tree plantations are scat-tered all over the district, and trees are also found in most farms. Bush fires are a very rare occurrencecaused by lightning, no longer intentionally lit by hunting parties or farmers (slash and burn methods). Services in health, education, electricity, drinking water, sanitation, markets, etc., are available in all district villages. Everywhere children have access to good primary education and infant and maternaldeaths are rare. As a consequence, people have no need to move to town, and enjoy being farmers andliving in the countryside. The population of the district is relatively stable, and couples plan their familywith the help of safe and effective methods. The services are sustained by a tax system locally collected and managed by the District Assembly. Decentralisation policies have been in place for many years and have developed effective and transpar-ent form of local government. Private houses are well built, with effective ventilation systems and often surrounded by gardens. Most cooking stoves make use of liquid pressured gas, which has freed the district from destructive charcoal-production practices. The district hosts many schools and colleges, producing a skilled labour force.Due to improvements in food availability, hygiene, housing and health care, diseases such as malaria,polio and Guinea worm are a memory of the past, while measles, bilharzia and diarrhoeal diseaseshave become very rare. A health insurance scheme is available in the district. A distinctive feature of the district is the unique disposition of its people to collaborate. Individuals are ready to work together and many productive follow-up are carried out by community-based organisa-tions (CBOs). This is rooted in the cultural traditions of the various ethnic groups inhabiting the district,such as the nnoboa work solidarity schemes. There are even special events such as an annual festival that has become an occasion for participatory democracy, when people engage together in a variety ofplanning and organising activities. Other festive celebrations are often held in the communities scat-tered throughout the district. People are sensitive towards avoiding all sorts of discrimination ( e.g., public structures are accessible to disabled people; women and men have equal access to higher education; relationships among differentethnic groups are cordial). People are generally healthy, wealthy, well educated, satisfied, free to speaktheir mind and practice the religion of their choice. There is safe and adequate food supply for all.People enjoy a peaceful and good life. 19An example is the donor agency that promoted the visioning illustrated in Box 6.5 but failed to respond to the raised expectati ons.200 SHARING POWERIn North America, community visioning and scenario building exercises have been practiced for decades with inspiring success. One early example amongmany is the one of the city of Corvallis in Oregon. 2200A complex visioning process was started there in the late 1980s and involved developing a profile of the com-munity, articulating a statement of community values, analysing major trendsaffecting the community, preparing alternative scenarios of the future and, on thebasis of the results of the prior exercises, developing a final vision statement.Local citizens were involved at every juncture through special \"focus groups\"(including some of children only), neighbourhood meetings and community-wideforums to examine the alternative scenarios. The final result was compiled in acolourful, tabloid-style vision statement with a feedback form inviting citizencomments, and was mailed to literally every household in the community. Thedocument mailed to everyone included a large, bird's-eye view illustration of theterritory, with highlights for foreseen new initiatives. The process lasted welllonger than a year but resulted in a vibrant vision that sprouted new activities and initiatives and served as pioneerfor many other communities inOregon. The social consensus on a vision of a desired future is extremelyimportant for the negotiation ofeffective co-management plansand agreements. If conflicts anddisagreements will surface duringthe negotiation process, the facil-itator will be able to bring every-one back to the vision theydeveloped together. For this, it isuseful to record the agreed com-mon vision on a large sheet ofpaper (or other appropriate sup-port) and pin it on a visible sur- face at the site of the negotiation. It is also good to transform the vision into acharter of principles or other appropriate form of social contract. In many cases itis also appropriate to develop a drawing, portrait or tri-dimensional map of thevision. 2211When different stakeholders develop their own drawings and show it to one another, they often discover previously unappreciated commonalities.2222Last but not least, it is important that people feel free to describe their vision in thelocal language, as local languages are very rich and in translation may lose part ofthe meaning that a common vision needs to convey (see Box 6.6). Box 6.6 AA vviissiioonn ffoorr MMoollookkaa''ii ((UUSSAA)) (from a personal communication by Tarita Holms, 2003) This is the transcript of the result of a long process in Moloka'i : \"Moloka'i is the last Hawaiian island.

The proposed site includes fishing areas important to the SouthAustralian fishing industry. By involving the affected users and, in particular, the regional fishing indus-try, Environment Australia managed to develop a credible proposal for a marine protected area, whichnow enjoys reasonable public support. Valuable lessons were learned in the process. Here are the mostimportant: zthere are benefits in entering the negotiation process without pre-determined outcomes; zthe boundaries of the proposed protected area, as well as the proposed management intentions, need to be negotiated with the relevant resource users; za shared vision and common agreement must be rigorously pursued; however,kupuna' s (elders) historic legacy of pule o'o (powerful prayer). We honour our island's Hawaiian cultur- al heritage, no matter what our ethnicity, and what culture is practiced in our everyday lives. Our truewealth is measured by the extent of our generosity. zWe envision strong 'ohana (families) who steadfastly preserve, protect and perpetuate these core Hawaiian values. zWe envision a wise and caring community that takes pride in its resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and resilience, and is firmly in charge of Moloka'i ' s resources and destiny. zWe envision a Moloka' that leaves for its children a visible legacy: an island momona (abundant) with natural and cultural resources, people who kokua (help) and look after one another, and a com- munity that strives to build an even better future on the pa'a (firm) foundation left to us by those whose iwi(bones) guard our land.\" As there can be many visions of the desired future for any given environment, theact of choosing one takes on a strong political value. For instance, the Gulf ofFonseca (Honduras) is a Ramsar site. The Bay of Algesiras (Spain) is a biospherereserve established under UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme.Such international labels are social and legal sanctions to a vision of a future ded-icated to conservation and sustainable development, in the respective cases cen-tred upon artisan fishing and ecotourism. Currently, there are attempts to revisitthose visions\u2014 attempts that are not getting by unnoticed. The destruction ofcoastal mangroves for industrial shrimp farming in the gulf of Fonseca (Honduras)and the starting up of oil prospecting in the Bay of Algesiras (Spain) bothapproved by the relevant authorities but in contrast with what the same authoritieshad earlier espoused, generated open popular protests in 2002 and 2003. As amatter of fact, an agreed vision of the future, and especially a vision with interna-tional recognition and visibility, has good chances of being internalised anddefended by the local people. This is beginning to be recognised by communitiesall over the world. Setting an environment under some form of national and inter-national protection or restriction constitutes an important strategic move to assurea community vision of its desired future. In chapter 4 we discussed the examplesof Miraflor (Nicaragua), POWERzthe risks of compromising conservation objectives because of the involvement of resource users are potentially significant. when it is accepted and recognised as binding not only by the social actors who developed it, but also by society as a whole. Theprocess by which such legitimisation is achieved, however, is different accordingto the importance of the agreement. A simple local rule is easily accepted andeasily undone. A common vision of the desired future of an entire community,instead, is a sort of constitutional agreement. In many cultures this calls for astrong ritual, respected and acknowledged by the whole society. Such a ritualhelps raise the common vision to the spiritual and symbolic level, making it validin the long term and particularly difficult to disavow. The choice of the appropriate type of ritual is a culturally specific act, concerning the moral, spiritual and often religious values of the social actors at stake.Traditional practices are often at the heart of such ceremonies. When non-tradi-tional actors and/ or governmental representatives are involved, however, it isadvisable that they also produce and sign a written document. In this case, theceremony held to ritualise the vision could include both a traditional ritual and amodern ritual. The latter could be the public reading, signing and celebration of adocument, such as a charter of principles for natural resource management anddevelopment approaches in the territory at stake. The common vision of a desired future is a most appropriate type of agreement to ritualise. If such a vision is ritualised, in fact, it will be regarded as intangible andsacrosanct. As such, it will be possible to use it as a common ground where allsocial actors can reconcile the controversies and conflicts that may present them-selves in the course of negotiations. It cannot be said, on the other hand, when it is best to hold the ritual ceremony. In certain cases, the ceremony precedes thenegotiation of specific plans and agreements. In others, the ritual comes only afterthe agreements, as some partners need to see that something concrete can comeout of their vision before committing the time and social capital necessary to cele-brate it with a strong ritual. Box communication by Jean Claude Nuinguiri, 2000 and Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2000) The Conkouati-Douli National Park is situated in the coastal region of the Republic of Congo and char- acterised by a diversity of ecosystems (savannah, forest, lake, lagoon, etc). From 1994 to 1999, theIUCN supported a co-management process that offered to a variety of local stakeholders an opportunityto develop a common vision for the future of their natural resources. On the basis of such vision, theyagreed on the basic elements of a management system (particularly a zoning arrangement and somespecies-specific rules) and to institute a multi-stakeholder management authority\u2014 le de Gestion des Ressources Naturelles de Conkouati \u2014 COGEREN. The vision of the future was facilitated and developed through a series of meetings between stakehold- ers and was legitimised and ritualised during a major ceremony that took place on 8 May, 1999. Theceremony merged aspects from traditional village rituals and administrative and political ceremonies.NEGOTIATING THE Once a shared vision of the desired future has been agreed upon and, possibly, ritualised, the social actors may wish to compare it with the current ecological,social and economic situation and trends, and thus identify issues and obstaclesthat currently prevent the realisation of that vision and need to be addressed. Thisis done in one or more subsequent meetings, where the discussion can start onthe basis of a short report illustrated by the Start-up Team (possibly submitted inadvance to all social actors), taking care that the report does not define the limitsof the discussion. Some of the parties in the discussion, for instance governmentagencies and conservation NGOs, may also have specific information and analy-ses to offer to the attention of the others. It is particularly important to review reli-able data on issues perceived by the parties as \"urgent problems\" in NRM. Othergood starting points are participatory exercises, such as historical mapping of themanagement unit at stake, discussion of desirable and undesirable trends with theparticipation of local elders, or a transect walk. A facilitator can accompany theseexercises and pose the crucial questions: \"what are the main points of differencebetween the situation as it is and the situation as we would like to be, i.e.,our shared vision? Is society moving towards or away from our vision? What are thekey problems and obstacles blocking progress towards it? What opportunities,resources and assets can we rely on?\" A realistic discussion of these points mayOn the one hand, there were prepared speeches, a chart to be signed, banners, tee-shirts with slogans,a cameraman filming the event for the national television and all the usual paraphernalia of modernevents. On the other, there were songs during which spirits were invoked, oaths taken by the local tra-ditional land authorities ( fumu si orchefs de terre ) and dances performed\u2014 the same dances usually exhibited during the supplication of spirits for the fertility of women and natural resources ( cianga ). In other words, there was a fusion of rituals: a modern ritual dominated by the signature of the charter onthe management of natural resources and a traditional ritual characterised by fertility cults offered to theclan spirits. The fused ritual was not organised immediately after agreeing on the long-term vision, but nearly a cou- ple of years later, after the zoning of the national park's land and the pluralist management authorityhad been agreed upon. There were at least three reasons for this: zEssentially, a vision is an anticipation on time. The local stakeholders did not have the habit of pro- jecting or speculating on future events. The visioning exercise was totally unfamiliar to them and they did not feel particularly confident after having it done. zThe vision appeared to people as an abstraction, dangerously similar to the promises of the political parties, which the local populations consider with considerable scepticism. zThe most important ritual in prior years\u2014 the hand washing ceremony of the political class in June 1991\u2014 has not been respected despite its \"sacred\" value: the armed conflicts that brought the coun- try to mourn many deaths were evidence enough of the violation and transgression of oaths. By organising the ritual only after the specific agreements had been achieved, the co-management facil- itators departed from abstract considerations and founded it on concrete and transparent engagements,a fact which re-assured aand sstructured bbrainstorming. A basic technique employed to gather the views and per- ceptions of a group of people. Ideas are offered freewheeling after the facilitator puts forth an open-ended and somewhat provocative question, such as \"What are the main obstacles that forbid us to livein the ideal community we visualised for our children?\" or \"What needs to change for us to attain ourvision?\" Opening statements and questions should be general and non-leading, i.e., should not stress or overemphasise a point of view that could bias the participants. It should be clear that brainstorming is afree and non-committal way of exploring ideas, i.e., no one commits himself or herself to something by suggesting it in a brainstorming session. At times people offer ideas orally, one after another, and thefacilitator writes or illustrates the ideas up on a board. The grouping and refining of ideas is then doneby general discussion. If the participants in the exercise are all literate it is also possible to utilise a structured brainstorming exercise. In this case the facilitator asks a question and leaves time for people to think about their ownanswers and write them down in large letters on colour cards (there should be one idea per card, repre-sented by a few words). Each participant then presents her/ his ideas to the rest of the group. After eachidea card is illustrated, it is pinned up on the wall and the whole group decides where it should be set,to cluster it with related ideas. The final result is a series of \"clusters of cards\", each dealing with a mainissue. Each cluster is usually later assigned to a sub-group, which examines it in depth and synthesisesfrom it ((SWOL).SWOL 2244is a powerful tool for a group to assess an issue of concern, in particular a project, organisation or public service, and to identi-fy opportunities for improving it. Basically, it is a group brainstorming on the positive factors (strengths),the negative factors (weaknesses), the possible improvements (opportunities) and the constraints (limita-tions) related to the initiative or entity at stake. Usually the results of the brainstorming are listed on afour-column matrix, drafted on flipcharts pinned on a board or wall. Participants may have widely different opinions or express statements that are mutually contradictory. In such cases, the facilitator can ask further questions to deepen the arguments, but a consensus among thegroup members is notnecessary. Contrasting views and alternative options can be listed on the sametake some time, and result in agreed lists of problems and opportunities. It is thenthe time to focus attention on a short- to medium-term strategy to achieve thecommon vision. \"What needs to change for us to attain our vision?\" What wouldbe the main components (dimensions of work, key performance areas) of an effec-tive strategy towards it? What tangible results could constitute its \"buildingblocks\"?\" A variety of methods and tools can be utilised to facilitate the development of an agreed strategy. Some groups rely on a free-flowing discussion on issues andopportunities in a non-committal form ( i.e., anyone can launch ideas without being committed to agree on them later on). If this moment is truly open andvisionary, it can actually free people from the sectoral positions they may beentrenched in. Others are more systematic, examining problems and opportunitiesin depth, and comparing different options for action. Some relevant methods andtools are briefly described in Checklist 6.2. 24Sometimes called SWOT (T for threats).NEGOTIATING THE CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 205column in the matrix. It may be useful, however, to gather more information on the controversial issues once the meeting is over\u2014 information that will be communicated to the whole group in the next meet-ing). Situation aanalysis aand pproblem aanalysis.Depending on the questions posed to the group, a strategic component may be expressed in different forms ( e.g., \"managing the watershed in a sustainable way\" or \"stopping soil erosion in the watershed\"). In all cases, the situation, issue or problem needs to be clari-fied and analysed by the social actors with the help of the facilitator. \"Clarifying\" means obtaining a coherent common understanding of the situation, issue or problem at the present moment. In particular, does everyone agree on what are the major \"problems\" to face? If peopledisagree on what a problem actually is, the facilitator may propose that a problem is \"an effectiveblockage towards the achievement of the common vision of our desired future\". If the main componentsof the strategy end up being described in a concise and effective manner, it is a good idea to have themwritten up on a large sheet of paper and posted on the wall on the premises of the meeting, possiblynext to the description of the agreed vision of the desired future. An experienced facilitator takes alsocare of encouraging the group to be as specific as possible. For instance, instead of \"lack of money\" theproblem may be better described as \"scarce capital to invest and lack of entrepreneurial activities thatcould generate local income\". \"Analysing\" means setting the situation/ issues/ problems within a meaningful context of root causes and consequences, in particular with respect to the vision of the ideal future agreed upon by everyone. Suchan analysis is vital to directing energy and resources in an effective way. Can everyone see the samecauses and consequences for a given issue or problem? A good analysis is comprehensive and investsseveral dimensions of a given context, but canbe completed in a reasonable amount of timeand, most importantly, is understood by every-one. Graphicconceptual fframework.Graphic con- ceptual frameworks are tools to systematise andcommunicate a situation or problem analysis.They basically consist of a schematic illustra-tion of the relationships between an issue orproblem, the phenomena contributing to creat-ing and maintaining it, and the consequencesarising from its existence. A usual form is a setof text boxes, with arrows representing causalrelationships among them. Another form is asketched drawing of a tree. On the trunk of thetree is written the name of the problem, at theroots are its causes and at the tip of the branch-es the effects (see the drawing on the side, pro-duced in Yemen). Ideally, a conceptual frame-work is coherent and comprehensive, forinstance able to accommodate the potentiallymulti-sectoral nature of problems, but also sim-ple. If possible, it includes some considerationof the time dimension (history, seasonality,processes of social and environmental change,etc.). 206 SHARING POWERWhatever the methods employed, the collectivethinking of the groupabout what needs tochange and what needs tohappen must be devel-oped and expressed. Thediscussion should contin-ue until everyone is satis-fied or at least \"can livewith\" the collectiveresults. Importantly, theresults and possiblyaccompanied by graphs,pictures or other graphicsupport that would make communication easier. At this broad level of planning it is important to make surethat everyone has understood the key points of agreement but it is unwise to enterinto very precise details. For instance, in the last decades so-called logical frame-work analyses have been used too early in planning processes and in mechanical,uninspiring ways to the impatience of scores of workshop participants. Often, theyproduced apparently precise results ( e.g., indicators and targets for third level objectives) that did not stand any wind of reality. Effective strategic approachesachieve a balance between specificity ( e.g., what do we seek to achieve? What needs to change for that to be achieved? How can we track progress?) and theneed to remain open to the inevitable changes and adjustments that reality alwaysdemands. If that balance is kept in mind, logical framework analyses and otheranalytic tools can indeed help. An example of a broad strategic agreement isreported in Table 6.1. Table Borrini-Feyerabend, 2000) After agreeing on a shared vision of the desired future (see Box 6.5), the stakeholders of Wenchi district compared it with the lists of key district problems and resources (elements of strength) they had alsoidentified. They asked themselves: what crucial change is necessary to achieve our vision? Six mainareas of needed strategic change were identified and sub-groups were formed to work on each area.Each sub-group identified the specific objectives for the strategic component, but also who were to bethe key actors, what they were to accomplish (activities) and with what means. The six identified areasof needed strategic change were the following: Six mmain leasing contracts; natural rresourcesManage the forests, waterways and wildlife of the district in a sound way by: zpreventing and the variety of plants and animal species in the district. Capacity oof llocal ccommunities and iinstitutionsSupport various local actors to enhance their own capacities to manage natural resources and/ or assist others to manage. In particular: zimprove the capacity of people, CBOs and communities to utilise natural resources in a sustainable way; zimprove the capacity of extension officers to serve the needs of farmers; zimprove the capacity of the administration to provided needed social services and assist communities. Local aaccess tto ffunds aand ccreditAssist small farmers to access credit via: zreduced interest rate of loans (which will promote higher repay- ment rates); zstrengthened funding of enterprises iin tthe policy for the district by: zpromoting strong and democratic farm trade organisations; zestablishing effective market centres; zproviding easier access to credit from financial institutions; zattracting investors by developing foreign exchange revenues. the efforts of the Local Chiefs and the Central Government towards: zaddressing problems associated with the land tenure system; zpeacefully resolving conflicts of interest; zensuring religious and cultural tolerance; zusing cultural celebrations for recreation and relaxation; zbuilding the capacity of CBOs and social organisations to make them functional, committed, democratic and effective; zencouraging the creation of new NGOs; zsupervising the activities of the CARE project; zidentifying developmental constraints, needed support to vulnera- ble groups and ways to influence policy decisions to facilitate community growth and prosperity. As shown in the example of Table 6.1, some of the components of a strategy dealdirectly with natural resources ( e.g., through management plans for specific forests, a water body, or wildlife throughout the district) whereas others bear uponit in indirect and complementary ways, such as via interventions for economicdevelopment, capacity building, governance and culture. Indeed, it would be nei-ther effective nor wise to conceive a strategy to improve the status of the environ-ment and natural resources in isolation from the socio-economic reality thatembeds them. In particular, coordinated interventions in several sectors are cru-cial to allow an equitable distribution of the social costs and benefits of sound208 SHARING POWERnatural resource management. In this sense, a strategy is a broad, interdisciplinary and multi-level setting of intents and main ways to attain them. The managementof a specific set of natural resources ( e.g., a given watershed or forest) may be its key concern, but a strategy \"links\" that to the surrounding environmental, socio-economic, institutional and cultural landscape, and grounds it as part of local andregional land use plans. Obviously, the group negotiating the NRM managementagreement needs to be conscious of the institutional setting in which it is nestedand identify ways to connect with other social actors and institutions at variouslevels. This is essential for all those bodies and authorities whose decisions willbear upon the plans and agreements to be discussed by the specific group ofstakeholders. A strategic agreement does not need to enter into the details of everything that is to happen but needs to specify: zthe key areas or problems to be tackled ( i.e., the components of the strategy); and zthe broadly desirable outcomes (objectives) for each such component. zthe main ways chosen to attain them. If the discussion proceeds well and the key components of a strategy are agreed upon by the relevant social actors, the facilitator may challenge the group to go astep forward, i.e.,to understand and evaluate the relationships among the compo- nents of the strategy, watching for thepossible synergies or oppositions amongthe identified objectives and checkingfor its overall coherence. In this sense, the relationship between territories and resources dedicated toconservation and their neighbouringfarming systems ought to be consideredin particular detail. There are more thana few examples of protected areas dedi-cated to ecosystem and species conser-vation surrounded by agricultural areaswhere ecologically-destructive practicesare promoted and subsidised. Oneexample is the Park of the W of Niger, inWest Africa. Park W is a World HeritageArea and a refuge of savannah wildlife shared by Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. In Benin and Burkina Faso the plantingof cotton, heavily dependent on pesticides, is subsidised up to the physical borderof the protected area. The pesticides have a deleterious effect on pollinators andpollute the waters flowing into the park. Further, the cotton cultivation exhauststhe soil and new lands are needed after a few crop cycles. Last but not least, smalland landless producers often end up impoverished and destitute, as the cash-dom-inated crop enriches moneylenders and larger land owners. Many peasants in theperiphery of the park have no alternative but trying to find some land byencroaching into the protected area. In this light, the government promotion ofconservation side by side with cotton production is inherently non-sustainableand needs to be mended through a broader strategic approach, more at the level facilitators should also be aware that specific factors and forces may encourage or oblige some of the actors to drop out of the negotiation exercise.Powerful groups, for example, may be inclined to use their political and econom-ic influence to seek desired results outside of the agreed process. Weaker actorsmay find themselves progressively marginalised, or may at some point lose confi-dence in the ability of the process to deliver a fair outcome. Facilitators should beconsistently vigilant to such occurrences, they should look out for signs of possi-ble exclusion, and use all available means, including mass media and other formsof public scrutiny, to encourage all actors to remain faithful to the process. The multi-stakeholder meetings have several types of results. If all goes well they manage to achieve important agreements on substance, such as a shared visionand strategy for the environment or resources at stake. They also, however, estab-lish an on-going space for common discussion, where people get to know eachother and hopefully learn to respect the views of others and build some mutualtrust. A measure of mutual trust is essential in any form of co-management despiteor actually, because of, the different interests and positions of the different parties.of the regional landscape than at the level of a specific body of resources.2255 While the shared vision begins to be articulated and made specific, one or more people may distinguish themselves for the extent and quality of their engagementin the process, for their charisma and their capacity to focus the energy of thegroup. This is sometimes referred to as \"leadership quality\". The facilitator maywish to assign to them the responsibility of some important task, while nourishingtheir capacity to elicit the support and concurrence of others rather than the ten-dency \"to advance alone\" shown by some such very valuable (adapted from EPA, 1997) Leadership is a critical factor in managing a watershed. Watersheds can be large or small, urban or rural, degraded or pristine. They can have resources of local or national importance, and can have littleor great development pressure on them. Government may be trusted and relied upon, or distrusted andfeared. As watersheds can differ so much, so can their leaders. A leader can be a farmer, a rancher, acoal miner, a member of a non-profit organisation or of a local council, a government staff person, atribal leader, a federal agent. Leadership can also come in the form of a group or entity, such as a localboard, state agency, or the federal government. Essentially, leaders are individuals or groups whostrongly care about the watershed and its future. Leaders tend to reflect the values of the local community and know what works there. They generally are good communicators, have the ability to bring about change and set things in motion, and are com-mitted to making their (or a group's) vision a reality. They also tend to know how to engage, respect,and empower others and are able to find new or leverage existing resources. Because leadership is soimportant, many seek to encourage and nurture it. Some states offer grants to budding watershed asso-ciations. Several non-profit organisations maintain lists of watershed leaders who are willing to talk toothers about their success. Other groups offer training and leadership workshops. Focusing on improv-ing environmental conditions and developing inclusive common goals, rather than simply implement-ing policies and regulations, tends to be vital for the success of the common efforts. the vision to the strategy, matters become a bit more explicit, but not yet enough.... The identified strategic objectives are generally still broad ( e.g., \"to manage the forest on top of the hills in a sustainable manner\") and need to betransformed into agreed work plans that answer specific questions by Rodney Salm, 1997) Trust-building between government officials, local villagers and project personnel was, from the very beginning, identified as a project priority in the Tanga Coastal Zone Conservation and Development ini-tiative, in Tanzania. A history of patronising attitudes toward villagers and poor government relationshad created a deep sense of alienation and distrust between villagers and government officials. Howcould they work together for the management of the coastal resources? The environmental problems were also serious. Dynamite fishing in coral reefs by commercial groups had greatly depleted the local fish supply, destroying the breeding grounds. Because of uncontrolledmangrove cutting, the area was also suffering from beach erosion. Since natural resources had alwaysbeen abundant, the local communities had not developed new management rules to cope with chang-ing conditions. Following the recent depletions, their normal fishing activities amounted to resourceover-harvesting. The villagers blamed the government for not enforcing dynamiting regulations in thearea. The government blamed the villagers for being wasteful in resource use. Lacking effective NGOsor other major potential partners, the only two actors interested in finding a solution were the villagersand government officials. It is in this context that an Irish-funded and IUCN-managed conservation initiative intervened in the early 1990s. The initiative started with a three-year phase meant to build the conditions for a partner-ship, beginning with some measure of trust and willingness to dialogue between the parties. During thisphase, communication efforts were crucial. Participatory appraisal exercises were facilitated in everyvillage to analyse problems in natural resource use. The government officials who participated in thesemeetings were soon impressed by the extensive knowledge of the villagers, in sharp contrast with theirprior stereotypes. After some time, government extension workers took on the role of facilitators of assessment exercises and providers of technical advice. In turn, villagers became capable of doing their basic action plans,they carried out their own cause and effect analysis, identified objectives, drew timetables and selectedand monitored progress indicators. To verify the extent of reef damages, villagers helped fisheries offi-cers collect biodiversity information and review the results in a rapid survey. The villagers also set upspecific committees to discuss topical issues, all reporting to the village assembly. As a result of the trust-building and co-management efforts between government and local communi- ties, in the space of a few years dynamite fishing has decreased tenfold in the area, and the coral reefsare being revitalised. Under Tanzania's recent decentralising efforts, government officials are seeing theadvantages of greater involvement of village committees in management actions.NEGOTIATING THE CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 211exactly shall be done? Who when? How? With what finan- cial means and human resources? To what specific aims? What indicators will beused to measure progress?\". This is the moment when everything becomes con-crete, a multiplicity of options and choices becomes apparent to everyone, differ-ent points of view abound, and conflicts surface in all their power and complexi-ty. The parties in the negotiation have to find an agreement that answers thesequestions for each one of the strategic objectives, or at the very least for the onesthat are of high priority. In addition, they have to identify or create a body toremain in charge of implementing, reviewing and modifying the agreement, asnecessary through time. The discussion will likely focus on a management plan and organisation for the territory or resources at stake, but a variety of complementary accords and initia-tives will need to be associated with it to make the plan viable and acceptable toall. These may span new by-laws and policies, changes in local taxation systems,improved services, contracts assigning exclusive rights, training and research proj-ects, as well as investments in a variety of initiatives, from productive activities toconservation measures and communication infrastructures. In other words, theagreement will cover a \"package\" including a management plan for the naturalresources at stake as well as various complementary accords. The accords\u2014which can be seen as conservation incentives or compensations for relevant loss-es\u2014 create a concrete link between the interests of the parties and the interest ofconservation. The negotiation meetings are in charge of conceiving such a pack-age agreement and figuring out the conditions for its setting into operation. In thissense, an enormous challenge emerges if the management plan demands impor-tant changes in the livelihood system of one or more parties. The complementaryaccords may need to identify nothing less than alternate means of livelihood for apotentially large group of people, a daunting task indeed! For each dimension of the strategy the actors need to consider the various options for action to reach the agreed objectives and, among them, select the one bestsuited to the conditions and needs of the context and to the capacities availableamong the parties. The discussion may involve examining the experiences andlessons learned in other natural resource management situations, assessing com-petencies, requirements, procedures and regulations, and refining options throughextensive bargaining and compromising. Complex problems require complex anddetailed solutions, and everyone should contribute. For this type of discussionsmall groups work better than large ones, and a dedicated committee or workinggroup may be formed for each component of the strategy, making sure that itincludes representatives of the actors most directly affected by the issues underdiscussion. Since different avenues and options bring different costs and benefits to different social actors, some such actors are likely to have strong interests and concernsattached to one course of action versus another. How can they all reach a consen- sus or at least a broad accord among themselves? The tools already used to arriveat the long-term vision and strategy ( e.g., brainstorming, problem analysis, con- ceptual frameworks) can help again, but other methods and tools can also be use-ful, such as the ones described in Checklist 6.3. In some cases the comparison ofalternative options vis-\u00e0-vis a number of criteria identified by the parties in the negotiation can be delegated to an external resource person or group, for examplean NGO, a research group or a consulting firm, which will present its results in over a compro-mise solution. 2266At times the representa-tives of some parties inthe negotiation needto report to their con-stituencies and consultwith them beforeadvancing discussionson a topic and possi-bly agreeing on a con-sensus position. Atother times it may benecessary to call inexpert advice or findout new information(market trends, costs oftechnologies, etc.).These are some of thereasons why a long time and several planning meetings may be necessary before a full agreement isreached. strategic objective that is too broad and complex is difficult to treat. A way of overcoming a related impasse is to break it down into smaller sub-objectives and to assign those for discussion to sub-groups and task forces. Moments of commondiscussions and an overall strategic view, however, should be Why it is thought that a certain action will lead to a desired outcome? Taking a natural resource management plan as an example, the expected results of implementing the plan should be madeexplicit ( e.g., by specifying the expected change in biological and environmental indicators) and the ecological plausibility of achieving those values should be addressed. The results to be expected fromsocio-cultural or economic interventions should also be made explicit, for example by identifyingexpected change in social or economic indicators. The plausibility of the assumptions should beexamined in the light of the lessons learned from similar interventions in the past or in other places. zCalling uupon eexpert oopinionon controversial issues. If disagreements among the social actors exist over matters of fact, it may be useful to call upon the service of expert professionals (such as a biolo- gist to explain the characteristics of a viable habitat, a hydrologist to estimate how much water canbe extracted from a source in a sustainable way, a community elder to recall instances of localextreme weather, and so on). This is not to say that expert opinion should be followed, nor that,indeed, different experts may not disagree. On the contrary. But expert opinions (especially when freefrom economic and political conditioning) can be helpful to elucidate a controversial discussion. zProviding eeffective cconflict mmediation.Conflict mediation focuses on the fact that an agreement that satisfies every party is likely to be more long-lasting and more satisfactory than win-lose results. In the 26Tom Nesbitt, personal communication, 2001.NEGOTIATING THE CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 213long run, compromise may be the best way to serve everyone's interests, especially when overt con- flict is replaced by the stability and predictability of a mutually agreeable solution. An effective medi-ator brings the conflicting parties to agree upon a compromise solution with the help of several expe-dients. One expedient is to provide space and time for everyone concerned to clearly explain their views and positions: what they want and why. They should not be interrupted except for points of clarifica-tion. Another expedient is to recall the common vision of the desired future (coming back to the pres-ent from the future). If all relevant actors have agreed upon, and perhaps even ritualised, a commonvision of the desired future, it is difficult for anyone of them to abandon the negotiation table. Themediator can explain the disagreements as a matter of different paths to reach the same goal. If this isclear, then such paths can be compared with respect to various criteria (see below). zComparing aalternative ooptions vis-\u00e0\u00e0-vvisa nnumber oof ccriteria. Alternative paths, positions and options can be examined with respect to various criteria, such as effectiveness; feasibility; cost in human, material and financial resources; expected benefits and impacts (in particular impacts in terms ofenvironment and social equity, and contribution to social needs, such as community identity and sol-idarity); sustainability; and so on. The open comparison of alternative options is a very useful tool tohelp a group decide on selecting one option over many. The discussion can be easily summarised ona board, with alternative options listed in columns and criteria in rows. First the group agrees on thecriteria. Second, for all the criteria chosen by the group, the alternative options are assessed and\"scored\". The matrix is compiled to offer a broad comparative view of options and scores.Importantly, scores should notbe assigned from the top of the head, but only after a discussion of concrete issues. For example, regarding feasibility, who is ready to take on the major responsibilityfor each alternative option? In what time frame? With what material and financial resources?Regarding the impact, what are the expected environmental but also the social, cultural and econom-ic consequences of the proposed options? To what degree of certainty are those foreseen? Are thereoptions expected to have a positive impact on most or allof the components of the strategy to reach the agreed vision? Are there options expected to have a negative impact on some components of theoverall strategy, regardless of the positive impact they are expected to have on the one being exam-ined? AAggrreeeemmeennttss,, ddiissaaggrreeeemmeennttss,, ccoonnsseennssuuss aanndd ccoommpprroommiissee The ideal method of deliberating in a co-management negotiation is the consen- sus. Deliberations by consensus are based on the informed, conscious, voluntaryand active development of an agreement among various parties, which often ben-efit from facilitation and conflict resolution support. Contrary to what is common-ly believed, consensus does not mean that everyone is entirely and totally satisfiedby the decision collectively taken, but that no one feels strong enough to blockthe wishes of everyone else over a point of disagreement. Given the multiple perspectives involved and the importance of perceptions and values in forging agreements, deliberations by consensus are commonly devel-oped through incremental compromise, accommodation and inventiveness.Working by consensus also implies collective responsibilities for the partiesinvolved, as the agreement brings at least some benefits and some response to theconcerns of every one of them. Decision-making by consensus has been the tradi-tional way of reaching an agreement over a common decision for local communi-ties all over the world, and still is a superb path for co-management regimes today(see The most important official step in establishing government-recognised co-management regulations of village fisheries in Khong district are one-day workshops (see also Boxes 3.11, 5.11 and 9.11). All theadult members of the community are requested to attend such workshops (usually one or two membersof each household participate). Government and project officials also attend, as well as the villageheadmen of neighbouring communities. Government officials generally arrive in the village the dayprior to the workshop, to advise on the necessary arrangements. Since villages initiate the co-manage-ment process, the government of Khong feels strongly that communities also need to control the work-shop proceedings. Government and project guests act mainly as observers and facilitators and not asactive participants. Officials are concerned that problems could arise if villages become overly depend-ent on government support, leading to a lack of village initiative. They want villagers to own theprocess. The village headman chairs the co-management workshops, and opens the proceedings by explaining its objectives and how the agenda will unfold. After short presentations by the government and projectofficials on the experiences of other villages, the village headman presents the draft of the co-manage-ment regulations developed by the community. The community is then divided up into two gendergroups for open discussions regarding the draft regulations. Apart from considering the regulations to beendorsed, the groups are required to consider what sanctions (level of punishment) should be mandatedfor those who break the regulations. Villagers are free to make recommendations regarding manage-ment strategies, but they are not allowed to advocate regulations that either conflict with already estab-lished national laws, result in increased degradation to natural resources, or cause serious conflictsbetween or within communities. The district officials are there to ensure that such problems do notarise. There is no time limit for the villagers to discuss the proposed regulations, but discussions generally last between one and two hours, depending on how much preparation has been conducted prior to theworkshop, and the level of internal controversy regarding the management strategies being considered.The discussions, which are not attended by government officials or other guests of the workshop, aregenerally spirited and lively, and broad villager participation is the norm. Most villagers in Khong pos-sess a great deal of traditional knowledge regarding aquatic natural resources and can easily converseon detailed and specific aspects of management. When group discussions have ended, the men andwomen rejoin government officials and other guests in the main meeting area, which is generally thevillage school or the main hall of the village Buddhist temple. Representatives of each of the two dis-cussion groups present their respective conclusions, including recommendations regarding managementregulations proposed by the village, and additional regulations which were not considered in the origi-nal draft of the management plan. Men generally concentrate on management issues related to largebodies of water and large and valuable fish species. Women tend to focus on issues related to smallwater bodies and aquatic-life in streams, ponds and rice paddy fields. This gender-related divergence ofspecial interest helps to balance and broaden the final content of management plans. After the grouppresentations, all the participants debate the regulations to adopt. If the recommendations of thewomen differ from those of the men, or if one or both groups have ideas that conflict with those of theoriginal proposal, discussions continue until consensus is reached. While Lao villages are not withoutconflict, they are typically governed by consensus. If disagreements cannot be resolved, the governmentrepresentative generally recommends that the issue be deferred until later, so as to allow time for resolv-ing any differences that remain. Nobody has ever suggested that a vote be taken to determine whethera regulation should be adopted! Once a community has agreed upon a set of regulations, the host village headman asks the headmenNEGOTIATING THE CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 215Deliberations by consensus are facilitated by the use of flexible instruments , such as the zoning of the territory or area to be managed and/ or the specification ofmultiple uses and detailed conditions of resource use (such as by type, time, sea-son, users and technology). Zoning basically involves subdividing a territory orarea into sub-areas subjected to different objectives, conditions and rules.Multiple uses refer to one or more resources in the same area and the relevantrules that balance their utilisation by various stakeholders. Multiple use arrange-ments are striking when involving people engaged in different types of livelihoodsin the same territories, such as pastoralists and sedentary agriculturalists or fisher-folk. While there are plenty of opportunities for controversy, there are also for syn-ergy and mutual benefits. Finally, an important flexible instrument in NRM arerules detailing the conditions of resource use. Examples include quantities ofresources that can be harvested, level of maturity, time of day or season, legiti-mate users, and extraction and processing technologies that can and cannot beemployed. Specifying the zoning of an area, its allowed multiple uses of resourcesand the detailed conditions of such uses greatly enhances the spectrum of optionsavailable to the negotiation partners. Overall, it enhances the flexibility of anNRM plan and the chances of its fitting the needs and capabilities of a givensocial environment. As a matter of fact, zoning is one of the most common mechanisms utilised in nat- ural resource management to develop a broad consensus on objectives and regu-lations. At times, a specific zoning proposal is prepared by some resource man-agement professionals and later submitted to the various stakeholders for theircomments and desired changes. This, for instance, happened for the CairngormPartnership 2277in Scotland and for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, in Australia. For the latter, legislation mandates \"public participation\" in management and theAuthority in charge carried out extensive inquiries with stakeholders prior todeveloping a draft zoning plan. The draft was then supposed to go to the publicfor at least one month, but the Authority extended this period to three months toensure a larger feedback, and organised several specific workshops where thedraft plan was discussed in detail. 2288In other cases, the parties prepare their own separate zoning proposals and those are later confronted and merged towards aviable compromise, at times with some external facilitation and support. This wasthe case for the management plan of the Conkouati-Douli National Park, in theRepublic of Congo. 2299The most typical example where sub-areas are designated and regulated is a biosphere reserve, with its \"core\", \"buffer\" and \"transition\"from neighbouring villages to comment on the appropriateness of individual regulations. Although guest chiefs rarely object to the decisions of the host community, they sometimes suggest improvements andprovide new perspectives. If suggested changes are justified, the host village adjusts its regulations inorder to maintain good relations with its neighbours, which is an important cultural norm. However, ifthe request is considered unreasonable, villagers from the host community have no qualms about refut-ing ideas. Government officials sometimes act as mediator. When a final set of regulations has beenagreed upon and recorded by villagers, the regulations are read back to all the participants one lasttime. Any errors in recording regulations are corrected as they are read out. Before the village headmancloses the workshop, the district chief endorses the decisions of the community. Government supportfor community-based management is important to villagers, and is certainly a major factor in successfulco-management, as the signed plan is officially recognised as \"village law\". Four copies of each planare made. One copy remains with the village, one is filed by district officers in Khong, one is given tothe provincial officers, and one is kept by the et al. , 2004.216 SHARING POWEROther flexible instruments that facilitate the development of consensus decisions regulate the access to natural resource and the sharing of benefits and rightsassigned to the relevant social actors. Rather than \"yes or no\" answers to accessproblems, a plethora of instruments such as leases, concessions, use permits,licenses, quotas, collector's identity cards, certificates and customary rules can beutilised to regulate access. In particular, access to resources can be assigned to specific groups only and on conditions of the use of certain types of technologyand not others. An important example is provided by the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin (PNBA) in Mauritania. PNBA is engaged in some mild form of co-man- agement in which the government staff developed a package of agreements withthe representatives of the park's residents\u2014 local people known with the name of Imraguen (fishermen). The Imraguen are allowed to reside within the park bound- aries and to fish in its marine portion, but only if they do so with artisan fishingequipment and sail boats, without the use of a motor. In addition, they agreed ona number of fishing restrictions, including the ban on fishing sharks, in exchangezones. One of the characteristics of zoning is that it is usually impossible to devel-op it if not \"on the ground\", and thus it requires that various social actors spendtime together in the field and in meetings, and that they discuss very concreteissues, a fact that can do wonders to develop more transparent and collaborativerelationships. This was proven, for instance, for the Galapagos Marine Reserve. 3300 Mapping techniques of various sophistication (from hand mapping to electronic GIS systems) can be of great help in developing a zoning system (see Box 6.12). Box al. , 2002) Ja\u20ac National Park is the largest National Park in Brazil. Located in the Amazon region, it is managed through an agreement comprising an environment NGO called Funda\u00e7\u20aco V it\u20acria Amaz\u00f4nica (FVA) and IBAMA, the Brazilian agency responsible for environmental issues. The NGO took upon itself to inte-grate in the management decisions the park residents (locally known as caboclos or riberenos ), greatly knowledgeable about natural resources but generally illiterate and unaccustomed to deal with modern\"management plans\" as understood by the authorities in charge. To accomplish the task, the NGOopted for the use of a sophisticated Geographical Information System (GIS) in a fully participatory way. Work began by digitalising a database. This included physical features of landscape (vegetation cover, soil types, geology, etc.) from secondary data provided by the government. It also included social andeconomic characteristics of the park resident population, such as natural resource uses, demographicand migration indicators, life history and family relationships\u2014 all from primary data collected espe-cially for the database. The information from the residents was collected through participatory assess-ment exercises and in meetings where concepts such as \"planning\", \"zoning\" and \"sustainable use\"were also discussed at length. The information on the use of natural resources was incorporated into themaps by using small flags (for instance, flags that depicted vegetal fibres, game animals, fish, turtlesetc.). These maps were then discussed in workshops among park dwellers, researchers, local decision-makers, and FVA and IBAMA technicians. Ultimately, the maps were the key to delimit the special use zone , where extractive activities are now fully allowed . The remainder of the park was considered primitive zone , except a small area indicated by the dwellers as recuperation zone . Each zone has its own rules of access and use. Currently, the FVA and the local communities are developing further zon-ing details, allowing for clearer day-to-day use decisions. In all, participatory GIS demonstrated to be avery useful tool, which allowed the integration of information from several sources and the promotionof the engagement of different social actors. and Bravo, 2001) Located approximately 1,500 km from the Ecuadorian mainland, the volcanic Galapagos Islands con- tain remarkable terrestrial and marine ecosystems and became, some years ago, the focus of complexand violent multi-stakeholder conflicts. The rapid economic and demographic change, the presence ofunregulated industrial fishing, the appearance of high-value fisheries for Asian markets, the state-imposed policy and regulations and the general non-compliance with the management plan of theMarine Reserve were all factors fuelling those conflicts. In 1998, in response to national and interna-tional concern about the threats facing them, Ecuador passed innovative legislation through a SpecialLaw that, amongst other measures, introduced the control of migration to the islands, created one of thelargest marine reserves in the world (some 130,000 km\u00b2), prohibited industrial fishing and establishedinstitutions for co-management of the reserve. The creation of the Galapagos Marine Reserve was thefruit of a local exhaustive participatory planning process, which took two years (74 meetings of themulti-stakeholder planning group called the \"Grupo N\u20accleo\", 2 fisheries summit meetings and 3 com-munity workshops) and produced a consensus management plan. The implementation of this plan,through a legally based participatory management regime, has been in progress now for several years. The Galapagos co-management institution essentially consists of a tree-pole arrangement (see Figure 6.1) uniting a local Participatory Management Board (PMB), an Inter-institutional ManagementAuthority (IMA) and the Galapagos National Park (GNP). The Participatory Management Board is madeup of the primary local stakeholders whilst the IMA comprises representatives of Ministers and localstakeholders. In the PMB, the members introduce specific management proposals ( e.g., concerning reg- ulations of fisheries and tourism) which are analysed, negotiated and eventually agreed upon by con-sensus. The consensus-based proposals are channelled for approval to the IMA and then to the GNP, forfor some development benefits. It is extremely important that the Imraguen remain in the park, as they represent the most powerfulsocial defence and provide a wide-spread and effective form of surveil-lance against the motorised fisher-men who surround the park'sboundaries and could easily helpthemselves with the park'sresources. 3311 Similarly, one of the first agree- ments between Uganda WildlifeAuthority (then Uganda NationalParks) and the local communitiesliving around Bwindi ImpenetrableNational Park was about the collection of medicinal plants and lianas from thepark. It was agreed that these products, essential for local livelihoods, would becollected only by specialised individuals, selected by the communities and actingon the communities' behalf. The authorised collectors had a quantity limitation,received some training and carried with themselves a special identity card. In thisway, some of the many and profound conflicts that opposed the local communi-ties and the park agency could be solved. 31Pierre Campredon, personal communication, 2002.218 SHARING POWERIf the negotiating parties identify a management option that is particularly interest- ing but demands major costs and sacrifices from one or a few of the relevantsocial actors, all the partners could figure out how to compensate the losers foreveryone's benefit. This could involve the provision of specific incentives andclauses in the plans and agreements. The very actors who would be compensatedmay advance suggestions about the incentives that they would like to receive,which could then be discussed by everyone (costs, feasibility, assurance of bene-fits to be obtained, etc.). Among the incentive mechanisms intended to benefit awhole community rather than specific individuals are Community InvestmentFunds. A case encountered rather frequently is the one of communities with customary entitlement to a set of natural resources (say a forest, rangeland or a fishing area)but who have been deprived of their customary rights, or who are not wealthyenough or organised enough to invest the means and human resources necessaryto manage it productively or to defend its own acquired rights. As a consequence,the natural resources may be falling into an open-access status, and may be usedin an exploitative fashion by all sorts of other entitled and un-entitled actors. Inother situations the local resources may be well managed, but the communitymay badly need funds for sustainable development initiatives. In such cases it ismost useful to establish a productive partnership among the community as aimplementation and control. Proposals that have reached a consensus in the PMB carry an importantsocial weight at the IMA level. If no consensus is reached in the PMB, the different stakeholder posi-tions are submitted to the IMA, where the decision is left in the hands of a majority of mainland minis-terial officials. Statistics are compelling. Basically one hundred percent of consensus-based technicalproposals developed by the PMB (which, incidentally, managed to secure excellent conservationresults) are approved without modification by the IMA. Clearly, the fact that consensus proposals areinvariably approved creates a very strong incentive for local stakeholders to develop and agree uponviable technical arrangements in the PMB.

The productive partner-ship is set to work ( e.g., the community land is laboured by community members with a tractor, water and seeds provided by an external party; the community fish-ery zones are exploited by local fisherfolk with a boat provided from outside) andthe benefits are divided among the production partners, one of which is the com-munity in its entirety. The community share of such benefits (and, at times, alsothe share corresponding to an initial \"factor of production\" donated from outside,such as pumps for irrigation water, boats for fishing, tractors for ploughing fields orvehicles for transport) can be utilised to set up a Community Investment Fund. The rules to manage a Community Investment Fund need to be devised by the members of the specific community, who may also set up a managing committee.In general, the fund is not loaned nor replenished by payments. It is insteadinvested in productive activities, which generate a suitable wealth for the commu- nity and income for those directly involved in its operations. This tends to make aCommunity Investment Fund grow rather than shrink under the effect of inflationand missed repayments. At the end of each production cycle the fund can be par-tially or totally re-invested for community-based productive initiatives, with orwithout partnerships with other groups or individuals. Community InvestmentFunds for sustainable development have important and natural applications in thefield of co-management, both as an approach that promotes and strengthens col-laboration in society and as a co-management institution in its own right, withinternalised incentives for using natural resources in a sustainable way. They arealso, however, critically dependent on the viability of the related productive initia-tives. In Iran, Community Investment Funds are called sanduqs and have roots in ancient traditions of communal solidarity, also supported by Islam. Sanduqs are now being utilised as part of agreements for natural resource management, forinstance in the Hable Rood watershed, east of Teheran, and in the Qashqai territo-ries (see Case Example 1.4 in Chapter 1). The management partnerships involvelocal communities, several departments of the Ministry of Agriculture, theDepartment of the Environment and a national NGO. The sanduq resources are being utilised to boost organic production of fruits, vegetables and cereals and torestore the viability of pastoral livelihoods as well as to promote local community-based trade. MMaannaaggiinngg ccoonnfflliiccttss Conflicts in natural resource management can be latent or manifest and generally exist when different parties believe that their aspirations cannot be simultaneouslyachieved. Conflicts may be rooted in structural power imbalances among the par-ties or in a power vacuum, in ambiguous land and resource tenure regimes or inrapidly changing environmental and socio-economic conditions. A perceived orreal scarcity of natural resources to meet survival needs is one of the most seriouscauses of conflicts in NRM, but less tangible issues, such as dignity and recogni-tion, physical access to territories, and unresolved historical events can also beinvolved. Today, new ecological and conservation dimensions have been addedto the more usual moral, political and economic issues at the roots of conflictsover the last centuries, more and more conflicts have been generated by the impos- sibility of ensuring survival or cultural continuity within newly imposed legal sys-tems and market conditions. The forced breaking down of traditional institutionsand community entitlements rendered authority unclear. The imposition of newvalues and modes of NRM without the consent of the most directly affected peo-ple was bound to generate conflicts. As a matter of fact, many NRM conflict situa-tions are related to the perception of a violent or excessive exercise of power byone party over others. Box 6.14 and Checklists 6.3 and 6.4 include a number zPower iimbalances. There are often serious disparities among the parties in terms of access to techni- cal, administrative, economic and organisational resources. Authoritarian local government leaders, major commercial or political interests and, in some places, the presence of a strong military or otherarmed group, can severely constrain the dialogue and choice in resolving conflicts. A general rule isthat unequal power leads to unequal agreements. The perceived legitimacy of the conflict resolutionprocess can obscure these dynamics but forced accommodations, cooptation, or \"coercive harmony\"results in agreements that are often oof iinterests wwithin aany oone ssocial aactor. There are obvious distinctions among the interests of local communities, conservationists, developers and the state, but distinctions also exist within these groups. \"Communities\" in Southeast Asia, for instance, may consist of mixed caste, clan, ethnicand economic groups, and may include migrants or squatters with little official recognition. Anotherexample: jurisdictional disputes between line agencies within a national government are often thecentrepiece of controversy over resource management. Thus, what is being portrayed as \"the posi-tion\" of a given social actor, may actually be the position of a special subgroup, with little force andrepresentational quality. and facilitator wield considerable authority, and can introduce serious biases in defining the domain of discourse, the relevant actors and the negotiation methods and atmosphere. In particular it is often the case that the facilitator roleis played by an \"insider partial\" rather than an \"outsider neutral\". This is not a problem a priori \u2014 a community leader or a concerned public official may be very capable of assuring participation, fair-ness and trust\u2014 but it can become a serious problem if they misuse their position. zThe iinfluence oof cculture. The importance of values and cultural norms in creating, maintaining and solving conflicts is often underestimated. Traditional forms of dispute resolution, such as those prac- tised in rural Indonesia, emphasise communal inclusiveness and the role of respected elders as arbi-trators, in sharp contrast to the Western model of rationalist dialogue facilitated by a neutral third-party. Indigenous conflict resolution techniques can provide effective local mechanisms for dealingwith community-level disputes. At the same time, the complex nature of modern common propertyconflicts\u2014 involving larger ecological units, multiple communities and ethnic groups, sophisticatedtechnical aspects, market forces and various institutional jurisdictions\u2014 has little precursor in tradi-tional systems.

Among the rules to be set up ahead it is useful toinclude that withdrawal from discussion is certainly a possibility, but all parties engage themselves todo so only after clearly explaining their problem(s) and seeing if those problem(s) can be addressedwith the help of the larger group of stakeholders. This may require separate meetings among eachconflicting party and are rooted in chronic situations of privilege and corruption that could not stand the light of day if openly recognised and assessed. Visibility and the presence of independent parties maybreak such deadlocks. In this sense, transparent negotiation processes and the potential or actualample publicity about a controversy may be in themselves effective to change the status process of conflict management should not be an excuse to make a blank slate over past injustices and major losses, often sustained by the weakest parties. Processes of \"truth and reconciliation\" arenot only more equitable than glossing over a painful and often violent past\u2014 they are the only wayto bring a sense of closure to them, and the willingness to build up a different future. In many cases, even when no major injustices and irreplaceable losses have been felt, people have the need to \"vent\" their frustrations. Some local debates, possibly with the presence of the mediatorand other external actors, can provide a way to channel the accumulated negative energy andaggressiveness. Often, people need to be heard and recognised before a deep seated distrust of the intention of the other parties acts as a stumbling block for dia- logue and meaningful negotiation. In such cases it may be helpful for some parties to break the dead-lock by announcing and carrying out some friendly unilateral innovation that encounters the favourof the Often a possible solution to conflicts exists but the parties do not manage to see it because they are stuck in their long-term grievances and positions. Translating their case into a different setting mayproduce a refreshing change of perspective and inspire the parties to act. 33Some of these are also discussed in Lewis, 1997. 34Chatelain et al. , 2004.222 SHARING POWERDespite best efforts, a working group may not arrive at an agreement on any one given option for a strategy component because of a variety of contingent reasons(see some relevant considerations in Box 6.14). In this case, a possibility is topresent all the retained alternatives to the larger group and ask for advice. Theassembly may again examine and compare alternative options vis-\u00e0-vis a number of specific criteria but also with respect to the actions retained for the other com-ponents of the strategy. Examining at once all the strategy's components mayreveal, for instance, that the \"losers\" in one of the dimensions are the \"winners\" inanother one. Or the discussion may advance with the help of proposals for cross-component compensations and incentives. TTaakkiinngg tthhee pprroocceessss ttoo aa pprroodduuccttiivvee cclloossee The final aim of the negotiation phase is a broadly shared agreement on what needs to happen for each component of the agreed strategy, including specificaims, actors, means, activities and a follow-up protocol. 3377As mentioned, this is likely to include specific co-management plans for the relevant unit(s) of naturalThe conflicts opposing the parties are often a complex combination of social ele-ments intertwined with all sorts of NRM problems. In such cases the negotiationmay need to address the various aspects of \"local peace\" and can take severalmonths if not years to get to a satisfactory conclusion. The issues at stake need tobe explored thoroughly and external mediators are crucially useful, as also maybe a variety of tools and external inputs. 3355For instance, some social conflicts have been resolved by external inputs that helped to enhance the security and produc-tivity of natural resource use (see Box 6.15). 2003) Successful conflict resolution linked with conservation benefits and the generation of local wealth took place around the Itoh community grazing area, at the border of the high altitude mountain forest ofKilum, in north-west Cameroon. The grazing area is exploited by both Mbororo pastoralists, who settledin the area about 30 years ago, and by local agriculturalists of a different ethnic origin. For years, thearea has been the theatre of bitter confrontations among these people, while the forest was not spareddeforestation and encroachments that lowered its water retention capacity and endangered biodiversity.Fortunately, with some appropriate financial and technical help, the situation has now been entirelytransformed. Fencing with live sticks has been created around the pasture area to prevent both cattleencroachment into the cultivated fields and the unilateral extension of fields into pasture, as well as sta-bles and paddocks for the animals. The pasture has been improved with the planting of new types offorage and deforestation reversed by the planting of over 30,000 multi-purpose trees. A safer water sup-ply has also been set up for both humans and livestock and very many training initiatives implemented. The combined impact of these (project-based) interventions has been dramatic. Local wealth and capacities has been created, human and animal health have greatly improved, the Kilum's biodiversityis much better protected and water is reliably available to all. Peaceful coexistence and new bounds ofcollaboration and mutual exchange have ensued among the previously conflicting social groups. 3366 35Ram\u20acrez, 2002; UNDP Cameroon, 2003. 37This includes results anticipated, progress indicators that will be monitored, individuals and organisations in charge of colle cting and communicating data, specific plans for evaluation from Amadou et al., 2003) Taki\u00e9ta Forest Reserve is located in the agro-pastoral zone of the department of Zinder, Niger, at the heart of a Sahelian environment with scarce and highly variable rainfall. The reserve represents thelargest non-cultivated area in the region and is a crucial silvo-pastoral resource in a zone where land isotherwise entirely occupied by agricultural fields (it is rare to find even a few square metres of idleland). Created in the 1950s and, theoretically, owned, managed and protected by the state government,Taki\u00e9ta Forest Reserve soon became subject to uncontrolled and destructive exploitation by local peo-ple and outsiders, with unchecked and rapidly expanding agricultural clearance taking place both atthe boundaries of the forest and within the forest itself. Pressure on the dwindling and degraded pas-toral resources within the reserve progressively increased as sedentary communities diversified into live-stock production, which brought them into increased competition with transhumant pastoral groups.Despite its degraded state, the reserve continued to play a strategic role in local production systems, butwas also threatened by an influential local \"de-reservation\" lobby that aimed to convert what was a de facto common property resource (because of local community traditions and the absence of manage- ment/ presence of state agents) into private land. The Taki\u00e9ta Joint Forest Management Project was set up in 1995 to promote a process towards the sus- tainable, decentralised co-management of the reserve. It was implemented by SOS Sahel UK. In 2003,with the project terminated and its objectives fully achieved, it is interesting to review the key steps inthe process (see also Figure 6.2). These included: Stakeholder iidentification. Clear identification of the natural resources at stake and their limits, and identification of all direct and indirect actors affecting and affected by the management decisions ( e.g., local communities subdivided according to their main interests, transhumant groups, government agen-cies, iindividual \"\"actor\" llevel. This involved an analysis by each group of the natural resources at stake and the role they play in their system of production. It coveredhistorical NRM strategies/ roles; the current situation; decentralisation, including stakes and perspectivesfor local management; and changing roles and relations. Information ssharing aamong aall t the aactors. The collated and unmodified information from the different groups was shared among all the actors, exposing each of them to the analysis made by others. A sseries oof sstakeholder wworkshops. Three workshops were held, where 180-200 representatives debated subjects as varied as: the situation, their joint interest and commitment to doing something about it andresources, but also complementary accords rendering viable the building blocksof the common vision of the desired future. The co-management plans specify ashare of functions, benefits and responsibilities for the various parties and are usu-ally co-signed by them (see Chapter 7 for more details). The complementaryaccords are approved as appropriate (they may include project implementationcontracts, letters of intent, municipal by-laws, the endorsement of traditionalauthorities, etc.). The more actors and the more important the resources involved,the more advisable it is for the plans and agreements to be made binding (such asformal or legal contracts). The signatories should be those individuals who aredirectly assigned responsibility in the plans and agreement (and notthe authorities who may represent them!).224 SHARING POWERhow it should be done.

Preliminary mmeetings oof aall tthe ddelegates tto tthe LLMS. These meetings served to allow delegates to get to know one another, share information about the resources to be managed, retrace the process leading tothe creation of the LMS, discuss and reach agreement on the LMS structure and proposed function,determine internal \"roles and relationships\" as well as rules and regulations, define what \"management\"means to the LMS and the people it represents, elect an Executive Committee from amongst the dele-gates, and formally present the members of the LMS Executive Committee to the local and regionaladministrative and traditional authorities, which had also been present at stakeholder workshops. Themeetings thus included: zplanning and with other LMS (inter-structure exchange); zfinalising the internal rules and regulations for the structure and presenting them to the relevant com- munities for their comments and juncture, information regarding the natural resources and their potential, including an inventory and base maps,was collected, analysed and shared; all known users were listed and uses analysed. On the basis of allthis, an analysis of the resources and their trends was developed; actual and potential conflicts wereexamined; a vision of the desired future for the resources was developed; and basic rules of good gov-ernance were progressively drafted. Options for improving the resources over time were explored. Aproposed management document was drafted. Establishing iinstitu tional rrelations aand ccommunication ssystems.

Participatory eevaluation oof tthe pproject.A participatory evaluation of the project including both process and results was conducted. Project cclosure... aand ccontinuation is recommendable that, in the sharing of management functions, rights and responsibilities, the social actors take to full use their comparative advantages andcapacities. For instance, government agencies can contribute a variety of techni-cal and administrative functions, ensure that legal and policy frameworks arerespected, enforced and protected against negative interferences with the agree-ment ( e.g., by external encroachers). In addition, government agencies are well positioned to provide economic incentives and financial support, to process anddiffuse information 3388and to make sure that initiatives in various sectors ( e.g., natu- ral resource management, agriculture, fishery, forestry, education, training, healthand credit schemes) are effectively harmonised. As the impact of economic forceson CM agreements is considerable, market forces may need to be tamed for thebenefit of conservation. This is another role government partners can take on.Non-governmental actors can provide specialised knowledge and skills on boththe ecological and socio-economic environment (ranging from the responsibilityof monitoring biodiversity to the responsibility of assuring a steady flow of touristincome to the natural resource area). Most of all, NGOs often have a uniquepower of convening actors from various parts of society.

On the contrary, one should expect that pluralist management is bound tobe affected by a certain amount of incoherence and uncertainty, especiallywhen voting and majority rule are taken as decision-making method in place ofconsensus. For some, this is to be expected from all types of democratic deci-sion-making, which can hardly be called \"rational\": 4411resource use by unauthorised people are responsibilities of great comparative advantage. Para-wardens and para-scouts can be appointed among the local resi-dents with, at times, the power to arrest violators of CM agreements. 3399Local tradi- tional resource knowledge may also be applied to the regeneration of biologicaldiversity. Ultimately, the effectiveness of an \"agreement package\" depends on a number of factors, including the capacity of the relevant social actors to take on the agreedfunctions and responsibilities and to absorb the agreed benefits. In this sense, ithas been found that well-organised social actors are more capable of takingadvantage of incentives, and especially so when the incentives are providedthrough time and distributed equitably. 4400Another important feature of successful agreements is their expected capacity of providing benefits on the long-term (seeTable 6.2) Table 6.2 BBeenneeffiitt sshhaarriinngg:: aa ccoommppaannyy-ccoommmmuunniittyy aaggrreeeemmeenntt (adapted 1998) In Cameroon, the company Plantecam Medicam and the villages of Mapanja and Bokwongo signed an agreement for the sourcing of Prunus africana bark\u2014 the Agreement for Sustainable Management of the Species and Production of Prunus africana.

Decisions by numbers or by rules do not have prima facie rationality. The everyday life of democratic politics is not a spectacle that inspires awe: an endless squabble among petty ambitions, rhetoric designed to hide and mislead, shady connections between power and money, laws that make no pretence of justice, policies that reinforce privilege. This experience is particularly painful for people who had to idealise democracy in the struggle against authoritarian oppression, people for whom democracy was the paradise forbidden. When paradise turns into everyday life, disenchantment sets in.\"4422 And yet, despite a strong chance of disenchantment, collective decision-making carries with itself a liberating power. On the one hand, the dialogue and trans-parency are bound to reduce malpractices and corrupted deals. On the other,the knowledge of the rules of the game is a powerful de-mystifier. It creates, littleby little, a political culture of informed and active citizens, it reduces thechances of populism and demagogy. Participatory decision-making is not a guar-antee for intelligent or successful decisions. But it brings about decisions that are\"owned\" and can become part of the knowledge of the ones who made them. Once an agreement ( e.g., a consensus over a management plan and a given sharing of rights and responsibilities) is reached, it should be recorded in termsclear and comprehensible to all and in both official and local languages. Theagreement may not be written on stone, but it should certainly be written onpaper (various copies should be kept by various parties) and publicised as wide-ly as possible within the relevant communities and among the relevant actors.As mentioned below, it is also good to underline its importance by means of aspecific event or ceremony. As far as possible, the signatories should be peopledirectly taking on management responsibilities ( e.g., the Head of a village, the President of a fisherfolk cooperative or the District Chief Administrator)\u2014 notdistant authorities who have little to do with the agreement. The parties shouldcommit themselves in public (see an example in Box 6.8), and the agreementshould be given ample visibility, e.g., a copy of the agreement could be posted in local communities as well as in the premises of an agency in charge of thenatural resource area, if applicable. A good agreement includes provisions for how to deal with exceptional situa- tions ( e.g., who should take responsibility for what in case of acute ecological stress or social crisis). It also makes clear what results are expected and howthose are to be monitored and evaluated. Following such evaluation, certainprovisions of the management plan may also be reviewed and modified. Someforms of complementary accords, such as a memorandum of understanding, arealso usually flexible and allow for revisions. Other forms, such as contractsamong legally-recognised parties and involving substantial economic and finan-cial resources, are less easily modified. Even less so are agreements formalisedas a local by-law or enshrined in legislation. While, as discussed earlier in thisChapter, it is useful to have flexibility embedded in an agreement, it has alsobeen observed that co-management agreements incorporated in legislation\u2014including in \"weak\" legislation that calls for voluntary compliance\u2014 arestronger and tend to be better respected than communication, 1995.228 SHARING POWERAs the co-management plan and the complementary accords requireon-going monitoring, evaluation,experimenting and learning, theprocess of negotiating and imple-menting the agreement is never\"finished\". A pluralist organisationusually needs to remain in chargeof reviewing the agreement(s) onan on-going basis (more on this inChapter 8).

The process was built around intensive, repeated rounds of information sharing, awareness rais-ing and consultation. In addition to public meetings in each of the four towns in the area, letters werewritten to all Richtersveld residents to explain the process and to brief them on progress. Besides broadconsultations with the general public, a range of more focused consultations took place with key play-ers, such as SANP (South African National Parks) and the mining industries that are active in the area.Local capacity to conduct public meetings and manage conflict was also strengthened and the processhad a unifying and empowering effect on the local communities, who are now able to express clearlytheir priorities and commitments. The core planning process, built around these consultations, went through to the following steps: zagreeing on a development vision for the Richtersveld; zidentifying development priorities; zfiltering the vision and the priorities through a situational analysis of the area, which helped to assess how much was feasible; zdevising development strategies; zadjusting these strategies in the light of the Land Development Objectives also drafted as part of the public process; zpreparing the integrated development plan through a series of drafts, including an initial Working Plan, submitted to the provincial government for review; zfollowing initial approval of the plan, sending it for approval to provincial government. NEGOTIATING THE CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 229identify or set up several CM organisations for the same NRM unit(s), for instance an advisory body, a body to originate technical proposals, an executive secretari-at, a decision-making board. Regardless of the type of organisations developed though the negotiation process, it may be useful that the social actors involved in it engage in reflectionon what constitutes \"good governance\", and on whether they are actually devel-oping such a system for the natural resources of their concern. 4444It can be argued that, if good governance principles are upheld, the CM organisational setting willbe stronger and rendered more sustainable. 4455It is also likely that the very process of a pluralist negotiation enhances the chances of every participant to under-stand what governance is all about and how to attempt to improve upon it. Table6.3 provides an overall view of principles and conditions of good governancederived from the work of the United Nations. Table 6.3 women should have a voice in decision-making, eitherdirectly or through legitimate intermediateinstitutions that represent their intention.Such broad participation is built on free-dom of association and speech, as well ascapacities to participate constructively. Consensus oorientation: Good governance mediates differing interests to reach a broadconsensus on what is in the best interest ofthe group and, where possible, on policiesand procedures. Views are freely expressed, with no ddiscrim- ination related to gender, ethnicity, social class, etc. Dialogueis active and consensusis often achieved.There is a measure of trustamong stake- holders. Agreed rulesarerespected because they are \"owned\" by people and not solely because of fear of repression. Accountability: Decision-makers in govern- ment, the private sector and civil societyorganisations are accountable to the public,as well as to institutional stakeholders. Thisaccountability differs depending on theorganisations and whether the decision isinternal or external. Transparency: Transparency is built on the free flow of information. Processes, institu-tions and information are directly accessibleto those concerned with them, and enoughinformation is provided to understand andmonitor them. All management partners possess adequate knowledge, andquality oof kknowledge, about what is at stake in decision-making, who is responsible for what and howresponsibilities can be rendered account-able. The avenues to demand accountability are accessibleto all.

The relevant actors review the common vision of thedesired future, the components of a strategy designed to move from the presentsituation to the common vision, the co-management plan for the naturalresources, the agreements set up for each component of the strategy and theorganisations and rules developed to accompany everything through.

This meeting is an excellent opportunity to acknowledge the work of the negotiat- ing parties as well as the co-management convener, Start-up Team andfacilitator(s) and, in general, to celebrate the new hope generated for the entirecommunity. At the meeting, the key actors can also publicly vow to respect and\"collectively guarantee\" the co-management package, which is described and dis-cussed as openly as possible. The co-management agreement and the pluralist organisations possibly identified or established to implement and review it should be confirmed and celebrated,but not ritualised to render them sacrosanct, as it might have been the case for thecommon vision of the desired future agreed upon by all relevant actors. On thecontrary, the plans, agreements and organisations are to be monitored, evaluatedand modified in an on-going way, according to their performance, results and eventual impacts. Trial and error, experimentation and even some slightly erraticmanagement adjustments may be quite healthy, as NRM decisions need to bemade regularly, and demand the on-going participation of the relevant socialactors. This is not to mean, however, that an agreement can be changed at will bythe unilateral decision of some parties. Unfortunately, many powerful stakeholdersare the most reluctant to enter into the negotiation process because they \"fear thatthe local communities will not respect the agreements\" but later on they are theones who actually break the agreements and fail to deliver. 4466For some, this poten- tial lack of robustness of the agreements vis-\u00e0-vis the most powerful stakeholders is the most insidious problem of co-management.4477Where is the guarantee that the agreement will be respected and that the organisation set in place by theprocess will remain recognised through POWERThere is no standard co-management agreement, as each must be tailored to its specific subject context and scale, and negotiated with the relevant actors.11In particular, different types of agreements exist at the local, national and interna-tional level. At the local and national levels, agreements may involve local communities, indigenous peoples' organisations and private enterprises as well as state, provin-cial and territorial authorities, government agencies, research and educationalinstitutions, international agencies and development cooperation agencies.International agreements may be multilateral or bilateral and be related to a gen-eral convention or specific ad hoc situations. Here is a non exhaustive list of the many forms that agreements can take: zad hoc and non legalised pacts ( e.g., via traditional ceremonies, public declara- tions, public handshakes, etc.) among various parties interested in managing a given body of natural resources; zwritten bylaws or customary rules concerning natural resource management, developed cooperatively by local governing bodies, such as village or local councils;Chapter 7. for a body of natural resources, such as a local woodland, forest, pasture, fishing area; zlegislative protection and regulation of sustainable use rights as framework within which to develop NR management plans; zagreed provision of NR management assistance from government to resource users ( e.g., a memorandum of understanding); zagreed settlements of NR conflict among various parties, from government to resource users; zlegal contracts between two or more parties regulating the costs and benefits of NR use; zproject-based agreements between donors and recipient communities and rele- vant authorities, which may include operations of community investment funds and revolving funds with a link to sound environmental management; zconditional licenses issued by public sector agencies following negotiation with actors and interest groups on resource extraction and management; zmemoranda of understanding between local communities and protected area agencies; zformal and informal agreements among local actors and public or private sector agencies and organisations, specifying their entitlements, rights and duties, and providing incentives to encourage local integrated conservation and develop-ment activities; zcontracts between different levels of government ( e.g., federal, state, local, indigenous) or between various government agencies within a level ( e.g., a forestry department and a national park agency); zinternational treaties and conventions concerning biodiversity and environmen- tal issues. Some of the components of a co-management agreement deal directly with natu- ral resources and are usually referred to as \"co-management plans\". Others bearupon natural resources in more indirect and complementary ways, such asthrough interventions for economic development, health, education, social organ-ising, governance, culture, etc. Indeed, it would not be effective nor wise, noreven feasible to conceive a co-management approach to improve the status of anenvironment or a body of natural resources in isolation from the socio-economicreality in which they are embedded. Coordinated interventions in several sectorsare important to allow for an equitable distribution of the social costs and benefitsof sound natural resource management. In this sense, a co-management approachis a broad, interdisciplinary and multi-level setting of intents. Even if the manage-ment of a well defined set of natural resources is at its heart, the strategy \"links\" itto the surrounding environmental, socio-economic, institutional and cultural land-scape, and grounds it as part of local and regional land use plans. In practice, thismeans that a co-management agreement is often developed as a package, includ-ing a co-management plan for the natural resources at stake as well as one or more complementary accords addressing relevant socio-economic and cultural issues . Such complementary accords are crucially important, as they make the management plan acceptable to all parties and thus ensure its sustainability.Natural resource management agreements are world. Whilst some agreements are reached after complex and lengthy negotiations involving lawyers and mediators, others are simply made byfarmers or nomads shaking hands under a baobab tree or in the village hall.Several specific examples of ad hoc covenants, customary treaties and legally- sanctioned resource management agreements are presented throughout this chap-ter and in Table 8.1 of Chapter 8. 77..11CCuussttoommaarryy aanndd nnoonn-nnoottaarriisseedd aaggrreeeemmeennttss Indigenous peoples and rural communities negotiate and enforce a wide spectrum of norms (customary law and practice) and procedures (for law making, conflictmanagement, dispute settlement) to govern the use of natural resources. Suchnorms and procedures are often unique to a given culture or local society anddeveloped as that culture evolved over many generations in a particular environ-ment. Indigenous knowledge is the foundation of such customary or ethnic 22gov- ernance systems, and its evolution through experimentation and innovation is thebasis of local decision making in natural resource management. Examples includethe customary land tenure systems of Papua New Guinea, which specify the con-ditions under which forests and forest products can be harvested, used, collectedor hunted; the migration patterns of the Oromo Borana communities of Ethiopia,carefully responding to ever changing climatic and political conditions 33; and the customary harvest restrictions (s asi) practiced by communities living in the Molucca islands of Indonesia and in the Pacific islands to ensure sustainable useof marine species. 44 There exist many unspoken agreements embedded in local culture, history, social systems and cultural practices such as reciprocity and solidarity. Indeed, mostindigenous management agreements spring from, and are shaped by, cosmologiesthat recognise linkages between human and environmental health, local dietaryand medicinal sources and spiritual well-being, and livelihoods and naturalresource management practices (see Box 7.1). There is a close associationbetween a cosmovision, or how the relationship between people and nature in itswidest sense is perceived, and customary resource management systems andagreements. 55 2Bassi, 2003. cited in IUCN, 1997) Andean culture perceives \"nature\" as if it were a living and highly sensitive being, capable of respond- ing positively when handled well, but also of responding furiously when mistreated. The Andeanwomen and men see the flora, fauna, soil, and water as parts of a whole also including management and knowledge systems include regimes to sustainably harvest and process materials from individual species. For example, Ficus natalensis and F. thonningii bark harvesting in Buganda (Kenya) involves elaborate protocols, including the tying of banana leaves to the de-barkedtree, followed by the application of cow-dung to protect the tree. In Shona country, rural Zimbabwe,the many totems of the residents of Kagore are all linked to animals. In Shona society the individual hasa special relationship with a totem animal. One injunction is that meat of the totem animal should notbe eaten. Both types of rules reduce pressure on certain species. Custtommaryy rrules ffor ffisheries aand wwatter mmanagemmentt In the South Pacific, ritual restrictions based on area, season, and species prevent overfishing. Religious events often open and close fishing seasons. Canadian Pacific tribes believe salmon spirits give theirbodies to humans for food but punish those who waste fish, catch more than they can use, or disruptaquatic habitats.\"We are part of the earth\". This relationship does not imply immobility but rather continuous transfor-mation and domestication of the environment, not for the unilateral benefit of humankind but for thereciprocal benefit of nature and society. Andean culture is agro-centric since the prime concern of the society is to assure adequate and suffi- cient food, and to produce raw materials for processing. Agro-centrism means that the social organisa-tion, science, art, philosophy, religion, perceptual frameworks, language, and technology (includingnatural resource management agreements) are all functions of the farming activities. The Andean socie-ty seeks an integral relationship with its medium, as reflected in the careful organisation of space andthe eagerness to create beauty that benefits nature and society. For example, the construction of irriga-tion systems benefits society as it allows an increase in production. At the same time, it benefits naturein the sense that it allows greater total biomass production, i.e., a greater quantity of life in the environ- ment. For the technician, a plot is no more than a medium for production. For the campesino it is at the same time the source of food, a meeting place and a sacred place where rituals are carried out. The customary management agreements of indigenous farmers, fishers, pastoralistsand hunters-gatherers generally value the diversity of available ecological zonesand allocate resource use in ways that are conscious of the spatial, distributionaland ecological consequences on the landscape-wide mosaic (see Box 7.2).Agreements can include rules for allocation of resources within a community and/or between communities and be mediated by a variety of cultural processes. Evenmarriage may reinforce a desired management agreement. For example, Tukanoanfishing communities in the rich waters of the upper Amazon are responsible fordistributing fish to other Tukanoan communities with fewer fishery resources.Marriage rules require out-marriage between resource-rich and resource-poor vil-lages, thus supporting this custom of solidarity, equity and reciprocity. 66 6Alcorn, 1999.238 SHARING POWERIn general, indigenous peoples and traditional communities have developed, and continue to follow, rules and regulations that govern their use of and relationshipto natural resources. Sometimes formalised and codified, often informal and sel-dom written, these rules and regulations define collective behaviour, and providea valuable basis for co-management arrangements that may also involve non-localpartners. Within the diversity of customary systems around the world, a few com-mon characteristics of such \"internal agreements\" seem to emerge: zland, water and biotic resources are assigned livelihood values but also symbolic and religious significance: they contribute to determine the culturalFor coastal peoples in Benin and the Ivory Coast, the great fishing period (May to October) is initiated by an opening rite over the \"Aby\" lagoon, sometimes carried out simultaneously in the different areas.It is the priest of the spirit called Assohon who opens the fishing in May and closes it in October.Sacred catfish of Sapia are sheltered by the Dransi river which is formally forbidden to fisherfolk.Together with sacred crocodiles from Gbanhui, all the aquatic species are covered by food prohibitionsto the villagers. During the day dedicated to sacred and venerated crocodiles, it is forbidden to go tothe Yonyongo river. The customary management agreements of the fisherfolk of Jambudip (India) help coordinate the com- plex variables of seabed topography, seawater conditions and sequences of tide with fish behaviour, toensure both successful catches and the safety of fisherfolk at sea. In their selection of the appropriateseabed over which to conduct their activities, these fisherfolk are like the agriculturists who tend toclassify the soil according to its relative fertility and the types of crops grown. The \"soil\" of the seabed isclassified by its capacity to support the net poles and by its fertility regarding the types and quantity offish in the waters above it. Such management agreements and practices have helped to conserve a con-siderable amount of marine diversity. Several water bodies (village tanks, ponds, rivers and others) are attributed sacred qualities in India and are protected against over-fishing or over-extraction of any other resource available. Some of them existwithin the bounds of sacred groves. Management agreements based in spiritual beliefs help preserve thewater bodies, allowing for the underwater forms of life, even at the micro-level, to flourish undisturbed.The only surviving population of Trionyx nigricans , the large freshwater turtle, is found in Chittagong (Bangladesh) in a sacred pond dedicated to a Muslim Saint. Custtommaryy mmanagemmentt oof fforestts Integral to traditional forest management agreements is the use of elaborate taboos, myths, folklore, and other culturally-controlled systems that bring coherence and shared community values to resource useand management. In the Eastern Amazon, for example, hunters who are greedy, or do not heed thewishes of the giant cobra, giant sloth, and the curupira , will become lost, or otherwise suffer some pun- ishment. These creatures require respect for the forest, and what might be called \"sustainable\"approaches to the harvesting of game and plants. Interdicts, totems, and sacred forbidden species and areas based on religious beliefs, and implemented by religious chiefs, are widely used throughout West Africa to control the use and management offorests and resources. For example, in Benin the panther is venerated by the Houegbonou clan, whocan neither kill nor eat it. The Houedas people adore, protect and breed pythons. Fon and Torris peopleidentify monkeys with twins, which leads to the protection of some monkey habitat. Milicia excelsa (iroko) is a sacred tree, protected and revered throughout West and Central Africa. On the western edgeof the Gola Forest Reserve\u2014 the largest element in a complex of four surviving areas of high rain foreston the Sierra Leonean side of the border with Liberia\u2014 villagers have a taboo against bringing thewood of Musanga cecropiodes into the village for use as fuelwood. CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 239identity of a group; zrights and responsibilities are usually collectively held; zindividual, heritable rights in land (and wetlands) can be accommodated, but mostsuch rights are either rights of use subject to a superior group right; rights to particu-lar resources (such as tree oranimal species); or rights toharvest a particular cultivat-ed spot; zland tenure, resource tenure and access rights are not necessarily the same, andone parcel of land or area ofwater is often subjected to avariety of rights held by different persons and groups; ztraditional rights over land, waters and natural resources are rarely recorded in maps or written documents; generally, orders and \"ownership marks\" make use of natural features and mutual understandings that are more significant to thecommunity of users than to outsiders; zlimits are frequently set on the exploitation of resources, often on the basis of seasonal regulations, and some areas and resources can be placed completely off limits ( e.g., sacred groves); zlittle conceptual or practical separation exists between resource useand conser- vation . Whilst indigenous and local governance of natural resources respond to many of the needs of local peoples, the diverse concerns of different groups within com-munities are often differently accommodated. Indeed, in all societies (indigenous or not) various types of co-management agreements may be more or less fair andcapable of accommodating the specific interests of different social actors (see Box7.3). Adams, 1996) Resource management agreements must be located in their cultural context. In the Solomon islands customary law has a profound influence on the capacity to participate in decision making. Land andmarine tenure systems define the rights and entitlements to speak about and for resources. Individuallegal titles to specific marine or land areas do not exist. It is membership in corporate, kinship basedclans or butubutus that defines a person's relationship to resources. Although resources are claimed and controlled by the butubutu as a collective, there are clear distinctions between the power to speak about resources (and frame the resource management agreements) and the rights to merely use them.Rights and entitlements are unevenly distributed within and among communities, and are coming The aquatic resource co-management system in Khong district is part of the existing administrative structure of Lao villages. No attempts were made to establish new levels of bureaucracy at the villagelevel, although certain villages have established their own informal or ad hoc working groups to deal with particular issues. Regulation, implementation and enforcement are left up to the community. Froma legal perspective, Khong district administrators consider that the aquatic resource co-managementregulations of villages fit well into what is known as \"village law\" ( kot labiap ban ). The legal system of Lao PDR allows villages to make certain regulations regarding local issues, provided that they do notconflict with national laws or the constitution. In the recent past, village regulations were rarely utilisedto deal with natural resource management issues (except for some security issues, or the tying up orreleasing of water buffaloes). Now, Khong district officials believe that the village law system accommo-dates well for aquatic resource co-management not only within a village but even among villages. Aincreasing pressure from new commercial forces. In the Solomons, women have inherently weak negotiating positions in traditional community institu- tions and decision making processes. They are often uninformed about resource management issuesand do not participate in public debate and in the framing of resource management agreements. Bycustom it is male relatives who speak on behalf of a woman landholder. However, customary law doesnot oblige them to consult with the women. \"In decision making processes, a male relation's vote isseen as equivalent to her choice\". Where women do find the confidence to talk as a group against the decisions made by men, it is likely they will be ignored. When the Tobakokorapa Association took the decision to designate an area usedby women as protected, Michi women expressed their dissatisfaction at a general meeting. They wereoverruled by the older men and were told they would get \"used to\" the idea. Gender bias is thus expressed not just in community structures but, more fundamentally, in intra-com- munity power relationships and in the type of resource management agreements negotiated between members of the community. Informal resource management agreements are constantly negotiated among avariety of parties. For example, the arrangements to establish a livestock corridorthrough a farmers' field in semi-arid northern Senegal are usually the product ofinformal discussions at the village mosque. 77Such ad hoc agreements have no for- mal legal status and are not enforced by the government. Conflicts between twoor more parties are informally arbitrated by respected authorities such as the vil-lage chief, a village council, or a wise elder. Among indigenous peoples, resource management agreements are usually enforced through social sanctions according to customary law, with decision-mak-ing in the hands of local institutions. The recognition of such agreements by gov-ernmental agencies can foster very effective co-management systems (see Box7.4). In Rajasthan (western India), self-initiated forest protection committees evenlevy fines on offenders (the amount often depending on the ability of the offenderto pay) besides imposing social sanctions, a practice that is informally condonedby official agencies. 88 7Freudenberger and Freudenberger, 1994) The Community Biodiversity Development and Conservation (CBDC) Programme is an inter-regional initiative developed by agricultural non-governmental organisations in Africa, Asia and Latin America,in cooperation with northern partners. Its purpose is to strengthen the ongoing work of farming commu-nities in conserving and enhancing the agricultural biodiversity that is vital to their livelihoods and foodsecurity. The CBDC programme is also a unique attempt to establish a working relationship betweenfarmer communities and institutional systems of innovation (national agricultural research systems anduniversities). The CBDC's Programme Protocol was adopted in Barcelona in 1994 and spells out the agreements which CBDC partners have reached with one another. It was developed to guide relations concerningintellectual property, rights and responsibilities in relation to genetic resources, information, funds, tech-nologies, methodologies and systems. The partners recognise that one particularly difficult element tothis programme is the relationship between institutional and farmer/ community innovation systems. Allpartners believe that farmers, and humanity at large, are best served through the full and free exchangeof plant genetic resources unfettered by the constraints imposed by intellectual property or othermonopolistic market practices. Partner NGOs do not wish to cooperate with institutions (public or pri-vate) that impose or facilitate intellectual property control over plant genetic resources. The Protocol assumes that the partners have mutual trust, confidence and are willing to cooperate, and that a highly-legalistic document is not necessary. It also recognises that other partners at the regional,national and community level may not know all their colleagues and, therefore, basic working relationsshould be spelled out adequately. In addition, the Protocol recognises that there is an imbalance in theability of partners to access genetic resources, information and financial resources. The occasional andsometimes long standing tension between the community and institutional system, and a history ofmutual misunderstanding, should be taken into account. For these reasons, the Protocol operates on thefundamental issue with regards to any aquatic resource co-management programme relates to bound-aries of management jurisdiction between villages. For several years no major conflicts between villageswith regards to boundaries and aquatic resources have been reported. There seems to be a great poten-tial for utilising village law for dealing with other natural resource management issues as well. The village structure is the foundation of ethnic lowland Lao society. Villages are self-sustaining com- munities relatively unconnected with larger political and social units, have very limited social and eco-nomic stratification and possess a strong sense of social equality, cooperation and mutual dependence.Currently, disparities in wealth and power within villages are growing, but villagers are still able tospeak with one voice when dealing with outsiders, a fact that positively influences the outcome of co-management regulations. There appear to be three interlocked and mutually reinforcing elements main-taining Lao village cooperation and solidarity: (1) a village ideology of mutuality, (2) successful eventsof cooperation, and (3) shallow socio-economic stratification. Informal resource management agreements are also increasingly being negotiatedbetween local communities and rural development and conservation projects.Covenants, memoranda of understanding, project and research agreements suchas the ones described in Box 7.5 rarely have a legal standing. Yet such non-notarised written agreements can be effective in formalising the roles, rights andresponsibilities of the rural communities and external agencies involved.242 SHARING POWERassumption that decisions are taken \"bottom up\" (from the community to the global level) and that the authority will rest, as far as possible, at the community level. The Protocol is divided into two operational parts: the first addresses issues of intellectual integrity intended to assure that germplasm, information, funds, technologies, methodologies and systems, andthe rights and responsibilities that go with them, will be respected. The second section addresses issuesof institutional integrity intended to protect and promote the interests of the partners. The Protocol isseen as an evolutionary document that is modified and adapted as partners learn how to work with oneanother at the local, national, regional and global levels. To date there exist few examples of written agreements between communities andresearchers. Despite the international calls for the requirement of prior informedconsent, respect and local control over the use of knowledge and resources, theexamples offered by the Awa in Ecuador (Box 7.6) and the Soufriere MarineManagement Area in Saint Lucia (see Box 3.9 in Chapter 3) are the exceptionrather than the rule.

The Awa acquired legal recognition of communal title to theirland in 1995. Prior to this time, they were considered \"wards of the state\", and their territory was a \"for-est reserve\" of the communal settlement of the Awa people. Since 1995 the Awa have demarcated theirterritory by planting a 50 meter wide border with fruit trees, and patrolling and securing their bound-aries. Due to the botanical and ethno-botanical wealth of the Awa and their lands, a number ofresearch institutions have begun collaboration with the Awa.

Forexample, a natural resource management agreement may be codified in nationallaw but signed locally. Conversely, local agreements may influence national levelprocesses and legislation for resource management. And international treaties maydeeply affect national policies and local resource management regimes. There has been a trend in some countries ( e.g., Australia, USA, and Ecuador) towards increased use of conservation agreements over private land. Examples arethe land use and conservation easements now numbering in the thousands in theUSA (see Box 7.7).

The agreements are effective until terminated or revoked, may be registered and can be amended if so provided in the agree-ment or in legislation. In general, where an area is under a conservation ease-ment, the authority of the landowner is affected in accordance with the terms ofthe covenant or the regulations corresponding to the management plan for thearea. Mitchell, personal communication, 2003) The fastest growing tool for conservation in the Americas is the easement, or deed restriction, which prohibits certain land uses and allows others. Easements are especially popular among private landown-ers, and particularly useful in working landscapes, allowing traditional land uses such as farming orforestry while prohibiting future conversion in use, e.g., for industrial or residential development. Easements are based on a concept that rights to land are plural and divisible; that is, rights to farm, cut wood, build a house, mine material, etc., are \"bundled\" into the idea of land ownership. From thatconcept springs the idea that a landowner may not only sell or transfer all his or her rights to land, butthat these rights may be separated, and one or more may be transferred while the others are retained.Thus a farmer might voluntarily transfer development rights to his land but continue farming. He there-fore protects his land from future land conversion, continues farming, and may reap benefits from the(technically) decreased land value (lower property taxes, for example). While securing conservation \"in perpetuity\", an easement allows a landowner to retain ownership and rights to uses deemed appropriate to the land. Landowners may thus benefit materially by donatingland or a restriction ( e.g., tax relief), but it is to be stressed that the most common motivation for the easements is a sense of responsibility for the land and the resources, and a concern about what mayhappen to them in the future. Because of that, the present landowners restrict the choices that futurelandowners might take. Easements are attached to the deed (legal title to the property) and futurelandowners are bound by the conservation restriction. In most cases, and always in the US, easementsare legally binding in perpetuity, i.e., forever. Benefits to conservation include: easements are permanent; they cost less than acquiring all rights to the land; and they encourage maintaining traditional land uses. Presently, a very large number of conserva-tion easements are protecting working forest land from future development. There is some on-goingcost however. The transferred rights do not simply disappear; they must be held by someone else, oftena non-profit land trust or corresponding government authority. The receiving entity has a legal obliga-tion to monitor and enforce easement violations. Though easements have been legally possible for a long time, they have been applied in large scale in the US only in the last 30 years or so. Their use reflects a trend toward voluntary, less-than-absoluteland conservation strategies, and has been aided by the development of various tax and policy incen-tives. Easement legislation has recently been passed in most Canadian provinces, accompanied bynational efforts to create more incentives for landowners to grant them. Similarly, model easements and/or precedents have been established in several Latin American countries in the past five years.CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 245group management. The land may include woodlots, orchards, springs and valued hunting or plant collecting grounds that need special protection. TheUpper Guinea Resource management agreements are an example of such privateland cession relationships (see Box In Upper Guinea, private land cession agreements are known as ententes. Theentente is a written con- tract of cession which is translated into French and local languages and certified by a governmentnotary. Copies are made for all the parties to the agreement, and for the government authorities. Thesecession agreements are not transfers of ownership, but long term leases with stated terms rangingbetween 20 and 30 years. For example, the agreement between Elhadji Amadou Diallo, MaamadouOrz Diallo and the villagers of Tzankoy in the Fouta Djallon in Upper Guinea, which became officialon 3 February 1994, stipulates the following: zthe proprietors make the plot of land available to the village for reforestation; ztrees will be planted at the head of the spring of Diaberehoun; zthe proprietors have no rights to the trees planted; zthe trees belong to the entire village; zthe proprietors have the right to plant and exploit individually fruit trees in the zone; zother villagers do not have the right to plant trees in this area; zthe clauses contained in this agreement cannot be modified, added to, or subtracted unless an agree- ment is reached between the two parties in presence of a qualified authority. 246 SHARING POWERThe so-called \"contractual approach\" is becoming common place in conservation and development initiatives. A recent review has highlighted the growing use oflocal conventions and contracts throughout the Sahelian region of francophoneAfrica. 1111This is partly because the contractual approach offers the flexibility required for the implementation of both integrated conservation and developmentinitiatives 1122and agreements that need to change in content and scope as relation- ships between social actors evolve and as natural resources are regenerated orbetter managed over time. For example, gender and equity concerns are increas-ingly reflected in agreements on natural resource management (Box 7.9). et al. , 2003) In 1965, just one year after the creation of the first national park in France, the government adopted also a further, more flexible approach to protected area management than the Parc National model. Based on the German approach to landscape management, the French concept of Parc Naturel R\u00e9gional aimed to conserve fragile environments and regenerate rural economies and to offer relaxing spaces for urban populations. The Parc Naturel R\u00e9gional was and still is the embodiment of an innova- tive policy that seeks to build the future by combining natural, cultural and human assets within a giventerritory. In the Parcs Naturels R\u00e9gionaux , all conservation and development activities are regulated by the char- ter of the park. This is a contract endorsed and signed by the local authorities and the private and pub-lic partners who have a stake in the future of the area defined by the park. The charter is based on aparticipatory planning and implementation process towards local sustainable development, but it alsoprovides for the respect of other national and international programmes, acting as a useful mechanismfor policy coherence at a number of levels and across various sectors. With the signing of the Tall, 2004) Article 2Women have priority use over lowland rice paddies. Article 3Each resident woman in the village has the right to a plot of land in the valley. Article 4Each woman has the right to share part of her land with her husband or a close relative living in the village. Article 5Any person who leaves the village to live elsewhere no longer has rights of access and con- trol over land. All his/ her rights to land are automatically ceded back to the village community. Article 6In case of the death of a woman, either her daughter in law or/ and daughter resident in the village will inherit the plots of land. 11Tall and Gu\u00e8ye, 2003; see also Box 3.15 in Chapter 3. 12A review of experience with integrated conservation and development projects that recommends the contractual approach is availabl e in Larson agreements for regional parks and protected areas include natural resource management plans as well as complementary accords orcontracts with state authorities and the private sector involved in broader socio-economic development (see Box 7.10). CO-MANAGEMENT PPaarrkk ((AAuussttrraalliiaa)) 2001) For thousands of years, the Cobourg Peninsula and its surrounding sea formed the traditional lands of four Aboriginal clans. In 1924, the peninsula became North Australia's first Flora and Fauna Reserve.During the 1950s, all the remaining Aboriginal traditional owners were removed to a government set-tlement on nearby Croker Island. In 1981, the establishment of Gurig National Park was agreed to bythe Northern Territory Government and the Aboriginal traditional owners, to resolve a pending landclaim under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northern Territory (NT). Rather than proceeding withthe claim, the traditional owners consented to the establishment of the National Park in return forregaining title to their traditional lands. The key features of the joint management of Gurig NationalPark are: zthe declaration of the park under its own legislation- The Cobourg Peninsula Land and Sanctuary Act 1981 (NT); zthe vesting of the land in a Land Trust on behalf of the traditional owners; zthe establishment of a Board of Management comprising 8 members, of whom 4 are traditional own- ers and 4 are representatives of the Northern Territory Government; the Board is chaired by one of the traditional owner members who also has a casting vote; zthe payment of an annual fee by the Government to traditional owners for use of their land as a National Park; the fee was set at 20,000 Australian Dollars in 1981 and increased annually by a per- centage equal to the percentage increase in the average male wage in Darwin; zthe placement of the responsibility for day to day management with the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory (now the Parks and Wildlife Commission); zthe recognition of the rights of traditional owners to use and occupy the park. The Cobourg Peninsula Land and Sanctuary Act 1981 (NT) sets out the respective functions of the Board and the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory. The functions of the Board are: zto prepare the management plans; zto protect and enforce the rights of the traditional owners to use and occupy the park; zto determine, in accordance with the plan of management, the rights of access to parts of the sanctu- ary by persons who are not traditional owners; zto ensure adequate protection of sites of spiritual or other significance in the Aboriginal tradition; zto make by-laws with respect to the management of the park; and zto carry out other functions as imposed on the Board by the plan of management. The functions of the Commission are to act on behalf of and subject to the direction of the Board in:the local authorities and other partners agree to respect and follow the rules and agreements they have themselves developed and laid out in a democratically negotiated contract. Success chiefly depends onthe inclusion and participation of all actors dependent on the relevant territory for livelihoods and cul-ture. Agreements over the management of protected areas have been tried out to lessenconflicts between people and park authorities and reduce pressure on the govern-ment staff responsible for managing large parks (See Boxes 7.11 and 7.12). 248 SHARING POWERThe actual subject matter of protected area management agreements can vary considerably. An example of such diversity can be seen in the agreementsreached between conservation agencies and communities neighbouring protectedareas in South Africa. Twelve protected area management agencies have devel-oped innovative agreements with local neighbours to cover issues of access anduse of different types of protected resources as well as benefit sharing arrange-ments. 1133Examples include: 1. Land uuse aagreements. The 1620 sq km Richtersveld National Park is leased from the Nama for a period of 30 years with rights to graze an agreed numberof livestock and to controlled harvest of natural products. The lease paymentsare paid into a Trust appointed by the community to manage the funds. 2.Revenue ssharing.Twenty percent of the gross revenue for a reserve in Kwa Zulu Natal is allocated to a neighbouring Tribal Authority and fifty per cent of therevenue generated by the protected area is passed on to the Tribal Authority inLebowa. 3.Fuelwood ccollection rrights.In KaNgwane, people from the neighbouring are allowed to remove one head-load of fuelwood per week. Thewood has to be from fallen trees or from areas shortly scheduled for burning aspart of the range management programme. People from more distant villagesmay collect fuelwood only for ceremonial purposes, provided they havereceived the permission of the local Tribal Authority. 4.Rights tto hharvest mmedicina l pplants.Tribal herbalists or Inyangas are permitted to collect plants or plant parts in Bophuthtswana and KaNgwane National Parks.zthe preparation of the management plans; and zthe control and management of the park. The Act also states that where differences of opinion arise between the Board and the Commission with respect to the preparations of plans of management or the control and management of the park, thematter shall be resolved by a resolution of the Board. The plan contains many practical details relatingto the exercise of the rights and interests of traditional owners over the park, including: zthe location of Aboriginal residential areas; zthe recognition of traditional hunting and fishing; za commitment to train and employ Aboriginal people as rangers and in other capacities on the park (subject to budgetary constraints). In 1996, the Cobourg Peninsula Land and Sanctuary Act 1981 (NT) was amended to extend the powers of the Board to include supervision of the management of the adjacent Cobourg Marine Park, whichincludes customary marine clan estates of the traditional owners. In summary, the joint managementarrangements for Gurig National Park provide the Aboriginal people with secure tenure over their tradi-tional lands, as well as nominal control over policy and planning matters via their voting majority onthe board. The Northern Territory Government, through its representation on the Board and through theoperations of the Parks and Wildlife Commission, maintains a strong role in determining the manage-ment of the park. It is significant that these arrangements do not require the traditional owners to leasetheir lands to Mutebi, 1996) The Forest Use Agreement between Mount Elgon National Park and the People of Ulukusi Parish, Uganda is a good example of an agreement designed after a careful investigation into the types of resource use and the spectrum of resource users. The agreement begins with an area description inwhich the buffer zone between Ulukusi Parish (comprised of nine villages, of which four border on thepark) and Mount Elgon National Park is divided into three contiguous zones, of which the third is locat-ed within the outer rim of the park limit. The communities bordering the park are essentially involvedin agriculture, but many seek additional livelihood sources from the forest, such as collecting bambooshoots and stems, bee-keeping and sawing wood timber. The next section declares the general manage-ment objectives of the agreement, of which the first is the integration of community's use needs withthe conservation objectives of the park. The agreement is explicit in its aim to gain people's acceptanceof the national park and the respect for its boundaries through a constructive working relationship. The third section of the agreement touches upon the mode of representation of the community and the park in the form of a committee. The Kitsatsa Forest Use Committee is composed of forty representa-tives from the bordering communities (each of the 9 villages elect 4 to represent their interests), in addi-tion two specialist groups (the herbalists and the pitsawers) each get to elect two members to the com-mittee. The agreement designates the Regional Council Chairman, its Secretary for Women, the ParishChief, the Mount Elgon National Park Boundary Ranger and a parish-based extension worker as co-opted members of the Kitsatsa Forest Use Committee. Five sub-committees have been named, formedby villagers located on each of the five trails leading from the parish to the park. These sub-committeesare responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of compliance to the agreement and are accountable tothe Kitsatsa Committee. The fourth section divides the management and enforcement tasks between the four villages, and along the five trails. Four use categories are distinguished: 1.forest uses open to all people of Ulukusi and for which no prior permission from the committee is required; 2.forest uses which are open to all people of Ulukusi but for which prior permission is required from the sub-committees or the committee on a case by case basis; 3.forest uses which are restricted to a limited and registered number of people only; and 4. forest uses on which there is a total ban. These use categories are applied for the three management zones that have been identified in the park territory, in which the type of use, the user group and the time period and resource allocation are speci-fied. This is clearly derived from a detailed inventory of resource uses, in their spatial and temporalvariability. There is also mention of Cultural Sites in the innermost sector of the park (Zone III), such asPina, a sacred site to which villagers may have access for religious rituals. A fifth section of the agreement defines the mechanisms for monitoring and control of forest use. The sub-committees located along trails leading to the park are responsible for monitoring activities anddenouncing abuses. The law-enforcement and policing functions are left to the warden in charge andthe park rangers, particularly in the case of smoking bamboo shoots through fire. Sanctions, however,are decided by the Kitsatsa Committee, and justice is administered through a graduated system. Finesare defined for first and second offenders, while third offenders are sent to court in the justice system ofthe state of Uganda. Leases and charges for bee-keeping and bamboo collecting are also fixed andlevied by the committee. There is an explicit difference between insiders and outsiders, as outsiders are250 SHARING POWERcharged higher rates for access to the resource. Additional linkage activities are also contemplated in the sixth and seventh section of the agreement, in which the Kitsatsa Committee serves as an intermedi-ary or nested institution to link to other community development initiatives. International legal agreements focus on the management of natural resources ofgreat value for residents of neighbouring countries. Large free roaming herds ofanimals or fish that regularly migrate across international boundaries between twocountries may be the subject of such bilateral management agreements (see Box7.13). The subject of agreements can also be water or air ( e.g., in pollution pre- Government of Canada and Government of the USA, 1987) This international agreement acknowledges that there are various human uses of caribou herds, that for generations peoples of Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories in Canada and rural residents ofthe state of Alaska in the United States of America have customarily and traditionally harvested porcu-pine caribou to meet their nutritional, cultural and other essential needs, and that these peoples willcontinue to do so in the future. The agreement starts from the premise that local people should partici-pate in the conservation of the porcupine caribou and its habitat. The main objectives of the legal agreement signed by both countries in 1987 are: zto conserve the porcupine caribou herd and its habitat through international cooperation and coordi- nation so that the risk of irreversible damage or long term adverse effects as a result of use of caribou or its habitat is minimised; zto ensure opportunities for customary and traditional uses of the porcupine caribou herds by rural residents and indigenous peoples while prohibiting the commercial sale of their meat. Under this type of agreement the parties are asked to establish an advisory board known as the International Porcupine Caribou Board. The Board's main function is to seek information from manage-ment agencies, local communities, users of porcupine caribou herds, scientific bodies and other inter-ested and to make recommendations on all aspects of the conservation of the porcupine caribou herdsand their habitat that require international coordination. Whether formal or informal, simple or comprehensive, detailed or principle set-ting\u2014 different agreements are shaped by the social and ecological context inwhich they are negotiated. An important aim of these negotiations is clarity ofmeaning and purpose, which should be reflected in the contents of the co-man-agement agreement. This is important to avoid ambiguities and divergent interpre-tations and on-going conflict during the phase of implementation of agreements,and learning by doing.CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 25177..33TThhee zthe agreement's purpose, the parties in the agreement and the relevant territory, area or natural resources; zbenefits and responsibilities assigned to the parties to the agreement; zmeans of protecting the investment each party makes in the agreement; zmeans of resolving disputes; zspecification of the duration of the agreement; zschedules and procedures for review, reporting, monitoring and evaluation; zconfidentiality and other special clauses. We review below primarily written and legal CM agreements, providing a general checklist for their usual components. No attempt is made to describe the diversityof non-written agreements rooted in customary law and indigenous institutions, which indeed are as varied and rich as human cultures. TTiittllee The title of the agreement or process usually includes a reference to the manage- ment of resources or territory at stake and specifies whether it is a contract, amemorandum of understanding or otherwise. PPrreeaammbbllee aanndd ssttaatteemmeenntt ooff ppuurrppoossee A preamble is the opening statement to an agreement, and it may describe its history, principal characteristics, and the principles on which it is based. It the institutional actors (stakeholders) interested in the natural and cultural resource management and commit the parties to cooperation, coordination, mutu-al recognition, trust and respect. It may acknowledge the importance of appropri-ate resource management to those stakeholders and wider communities. It mightrefer to the rights of relevant stakeholders under local, state, national or interna-tional law, to the values of the particular resources that are the subject of theagreement, and to the relevant authorities that authorise the agreement or renderit legally binding and enforceable. Ideally, a common vision would have beenachieved and ritualised among the parties for the territories or resources at stake.If so, the preamble should make explicit reference to it (see Chapter 5), andshould enunciate clear, realistic and measurable objectives. A preamble is not justan issue of symbolic importance because it can identify the principles and ration-ale that will guide the implementation of the agreement, and thus assist in itsinterpretation. DDeeffiinniittiioonnss All parties to the agreement and those abiding by it need to understand the mean- ing of the terms used within it. A definition section assists with this. Defining territory, area or set of resources at stake is relatively easy in those coun- tries where a tenure system is recognised. The real property description may beused, and it may be helpful to attach a map. If the agreement refers to works in aspecific part of the land ( e.g., \"clear the south paddock of weeds\"), such areas should also be clearly described and/ or marked on a map. In marine and coastalareas, the agreement should recognise the difficulty inherent in defining maritimeboundaries; in the absence of physical demarcation, these will be expressed by adistance from shore, or by depth, or with respect to landmarks on shore. With respect to the parties, if these are simply individuals (\"real persons\" in legal terms) and the agreement amounts to a common law contract, things are relative-ly simple. However, each party should check carefully that the others do have thelegal right to contract with respect to the land (for example, a manager or memberof the family of a registered owner may need to demonstrate power of attorney; itis never wise simply to take someone's word that they have such rights). Carefulchecks may be needed in the case of a company, consortium or community cus-tomary rightholders. In the case of indigenous communities, deciding who is the appropriate \"party\" with whom to enter a legal agreement is often a complex issue, legally, politicallyand culturally. Clan or tribal relationships, intra-community politics, land claims,relationships between councils of elders and members of modern governing struc-tures, tribal members who live elsewhere, gender issues, and tensions between\"traditional\" owners and people more recently arrived can all cloud the picture. Awrong choice of \"appropriate party\" can not only result in serious legal complica-tions, it can also cause grave offence and lead to breakdown in communicationswith the community or indigenous group. If the agreement is to have legal validity, it is important that the parties have the legal power to enter into such an agreement. Further, if the agreement incorpo-rates works to or on land, or financial transactions relating to these, it is equallyimportant that the land itself be defined. Some caution, however, not imposing definitions of land and resources that are incompatible with customary governance and management systems, which are usually quitecomplex (see Box 7.14). A small area of outstanding beauty and biodiversity\u2014 100 square kilometres of untouched forest and alpine areas within the Retezat Massif\u2014 was declared national park in 1935. The area around the parkis rich in natural and cultural reserves and the local people are engaged in traditional agriculture.Romanian and foreign visitors come mostly in the summer to this remote area. The Retezat NationalPark Management Authority (PMA) was established in November 1999 with the main role of setting upthe park management infrastructure. Early in 2000, the park area was enlarged and a stakeholder analy-sis was undertaken. In 2001, a Consultative Council with representatives from main concerned actorswas established. The Council comprises representatives of twenty-five relevant social actors, includingeight local communities, forest districts, NGOs, mountain rescue teams, school inspectorates, local sci-entific bodies and county level institutes. All were identified and included in the Consultative Councilas landowners, administrators, representatives of the natural resource users and/ or social actors whoseactivities may impact the park or be affected by the park. The Consultative Council holds two meetingsper year to express opinions on park management activities and develop solutions to problems jointlywith the PMA. All important management decisions are to be made only after consulting the Counciland, if necessary, also the public governance systems, land and resource tenure are normally ascribed to several actors at the same time. These may include households, extended families, villages, lineages, clans, etc. Usually,customary land use patterns recognise overlapping claims on the same territory, connected to collectiveidentities of different importance and defining different types of rights. In addition, mobile indigenouspeoples traditionally manage land in migration patterns that are changeable according to climate andother variable circumstances. The definition of their territories and migration routes needs to accommo-date for \"porous\" and changing borders and requires a less-than-sharp definition of the area to whichthe management agreements ultimately apply. Such complex governance and management systemsrequire substantial flexibility in in the agreement include all relevant actors and are usually identified in the preamble of the co-management agreement. The scope of the authority ofparties to the agreement should be clearly defined. It may be broad or narrow. In defining the scope of authority, the agreement should clearly enunciate the dis- tribution of power, taking into account pre-existing legal mandates. In manyinstances, co-management agreements do not actually change these existing man-dates, but they provide a new mechanism for the co-ordination of existing man-agement functions, while filling the voids and empowering civil society actors(see Box 7.15).254 SHARING POWERGGeenneerraall ccoovveennaannttss The general covenants of an agreement specify the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to several relevant areas, and are often compiled into a coher-ent management plan. Legislation may specify, or parties may agree on, whetherthe agreement should bind the land or waters which is the subject of the agree-ment.

Box Sylvo-pastoral areas in southern Mali include non-arable lands and long term fallow. These woodlands are common pool resources used for grazing and supply of firewood, timber, fruits and other forestproducts. Degradation of these resources prompted six villages to unite and develop a more sustainablemanagement system. With the help of the district extension services and an agricultural research insti-tute, the villagers developed a Local Convention\u2014 a co-management agreement made possible underMali's new forest law. The Local Convention starts by stating its main aim as reinforcing respect for regulations developed by the Village Councils and expresses hope that the official village forestry legislation will also adhere tothis objective. It then deals with various natural resources such as firewood, timber, fruits and pastures.CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 255Conservattion aand rresource uuse iissues zbiodiversity management including wildlife and flora protection, ecosystem maintenance, monitoring and surveys, species reintroduction, habitat protec- tion and restoration (revegetation, rehabilitation, weed heritage management (site protection, interpretation); ztourism management (including interpretation, visitor experience, codes of con- duct regarding photographs, drugs, feeding wild animals, etc.); zwaste disposal; zidentification of threats and recovery processes; zallowed harvest times and quantities for specific plant and animal species; zsustainable agricultural practices; zfarming and other income generating activities; zmarketing arrangements for local produce, products and services; zrules and procedures for mining, quarrying and fossicking; communications infrastructure; communication avenues and initiatives;The Convention lists all trees that are to be protected. Trees for timber may be cut only with permission from the village chief. Planting timber trees is encouraged. Regarding firewood, a woman may not cutmore than three carts full of \"green\" firewood per season. Use of improved stoves is an obligation. Extrataxes are proposed for commercial firewood cutting and charcoal production. These are additionaltaxes paid to the Forestry Department. Non residents pay more than residents. The start of the harvest-ing season for N\u00e9r\u00e9 and Karit\u00e9 trees is also fixed. Sanctions are proposed for non-compliance with regu- lations, and proceeds from confiscations, fines and firewood taxes are to be divided among the villageco-management bodies (Siwaa). Ultimately, such proceeds are to be used for financing reforestation, the installation of anti-erosion structures and the Siwaa's operating expenses. The villagers also proposed that the Siwaa is charged with the supervision of the Local Convention. The elaboration of the Local Convention has been the major activity of the Siwaas. The six villages took two years to reach an agreement among themselves. The document they compiled was then sent to theForestry Department, which took another two years to deliver comments and approval.256 SHARING POWERBox 7.17 PPrrootteeccttiinngg tthhee iinnvveessttmmeenntt As co-management agreements often involve considerable investment of time, money and other resources, the parties who wish to protect their investment to the greatest legal extent possible attemptto ensure that the other parties are bound to keep the agreement. Many agreements are common law contracts. In this case, each party needs to check them carefully and be satisfied that the contract offers an acceptable level of assurance. Less commonly, the agreementitself may be enshrined in an Act of Parliament. An interesting example of this kind is being tried out inLebanon, where three new national parks have been created and local NGOs have been given respon-sibility for the running of each park. A separate act has been created for each park. Each act is brief,and sets out the responsibilities of the parties, along with broad term administrative arrangements. In the most common form of \"one-on-one\" agreement, the government provides resources in return for some action by the landholder. It is therefore the government agency which has the greater interest inprotecting its investment, since it will hand over the money, equipment, etc. at a specific time, whilethe actions of the landholder may be ongoing. Possible mechanisms for protecting the investmentinclude: zsetting out a timetable for works, with a schedule of payments related to achievement of agreed mile- stones; zpenalty clauses, including \"payback\" provisions (with or without interest) if the landholder fails to display \"stewardship\", undoes or fails to maintain the agreed works, or acts contrary to the agree- ment at some time in the future; za monitoring programme, with \"payback\" or \"make good\" provisions. zdescription of ad hoc training and continuing education initiatives; zdescription of rules to be adopted in local research; za follow-up protocol for monitoring; and, zplans for internal and external evaluation. Financial iissues zfinancial planning, programme funding, compensation for lost income from conservation activities, taxation benefits and other incentives (including rate relief, payments, education, health, housing services, information, etc.), protec-tion of investments (see Box 7.17); zland swaps, offset and debt-for-nature arrangements; zaffirmative action employment policies for local residents including equity in income earning ventures; zsupport to local employment and commercial initiatives; zinterest payments, royalties and bounty payments; and, zcost allocation for co-management meetings and processes. Other issues dealt with in the general covenants may include: linked negotiations, amendment procedures, agreed schedules of meetings, protection of local cus-tomary practices and traditional approaches to resource management, etc.CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 257Durattion Co-management agreements may be temporary or permanent. The general covenants may also specify amendment and termination procedures, if any. Agreements may be: zeffectively unrelated to the passage of time ( e.g., an agreement about the pur- chase of a capital item\u2014 \"if you contribute labour to dig the well, the govern- ment will contribute the pumping equipment and the pump will become com-munity property to all effects\"). Agreements of this kind relate to specific eventswhich occur at some point in time and are not repeated; zobviously time limited\u2014 e.g., an agreement about restricted access to certain resources until a recovery threshold has been reached. When the threshold is reached, the agreement comes to an end; zapplicable over an extended time\u2014 e.g., an agreement that requires ongoing maintenance of certain agreed responsibilities: i.e., \"the community will have access to limited harvesting of vines in the protected forest and biodiversitymonitoring reports will be delivered each month to the rangers' office\". As therequirement for maintenance cannot be effectively enforced indefinitely, it isusually good to set a realistic time limit; and, zopen ended (in this case, the agreement is meant to apply \"for all time\"\u2014 e.g., \"the state will support the freeholding of a land lease and declare the land a wildlife refuge, and the landowner will promise to protect and preserve the val-ues of the wetland areas for all time\"). While the landholder may agree to pro-tect the heritage values of the forest in perpetuity in return for certain consider-ations from the government, agreements of this kind can be very difficult toInclusions of this kind need to be handled carefully. They can appear unfair, the ability to enforce themwill decrease over time, and the government agency needs to weigh up the likely effectiveness of anysuch provisions against the negative impression they may create. Protecting the government's investment can be even more difficult if the land is sold in the future. The most effective way to do this is to register the agreement on the title as a form of covenant, easement orother legal protection which runs with the title of the land ( i.e., all future owners are bound by the terms). Some forms of agreement lend themselves to this, while others do not. Some jurisdictions maybe reluctant to register such agreements as constraints on title. An alternative is the use of a novation of deed on transfer as part of the cooperative management agree- ment itself. In essence, a novation means that the landholder agrees to sell the land only to a purchaserwho agrees in turn to be bound by the terms of the original agreement. If the purchaser breaks theagreement, the original owner may be liable. Novations are unlikely to be enforceable after the firstcouple of property transactions. Landholders also seek to protect their \"investment\", i.e., the natural resource/ conservation values or the land they have managed, in this way. Many wish to protect the land \"forever\" or at least for their chil-dren. In this regard, registration of some form of covenant on title is the most effective mechanism. Eventhis, however, cannot provide absolute certainty, as governments can (and do) revoke protectivecovenants if they wish to use the land for other purposes ( e.g., transmission corridor for an extended time, even with agreed penalty provisions, unless registered on title. Agreements of the last kind mentioned above are often requested by landholders in the North, who seek to protect the land permanently without giving up title toit (see Box 7.7). There is also a growing demand for this kind of agreement fromcitizens mistrustful of the real degree of protection offered by natural resourcemanagement schemes operated by governments. Increasingly, people with astrong conservation or sustainable development ethic are seeking to protect landthrough private ownership and some kind of covenant on title. If governmentviews this trend in a positive light and is prepared to assist with appropriate legalmechanisms, a good deal of valuable conservation can be achieved at minimalcost to the taxpayer. At any rate, all parties should be clear over what period of time the agreement applies and what are its main implications. The duration should be specified inthe agreement. It may also be appropriate to specify what happens after the agree-ment expires.

Itmay deal with issues such as theregularity of meetings, expresscommitments to co-operation andgoodwill, etc. Co-managementorganisations tend to complementthe work of government resourcemanagement agencies rather thanreplace them. Some commenta-tors have suggested that fundingfor co-management organisationsshould be sufficient to supportindependent secretariats or joint resource centres. This may be particularly necessary where traditional knowledgeis not articulated in the professional language used by resource managers, orwhere the scientific research on which management plans are based has notincorporated traditional knowledge. 1144Co-management organisations are described at some length in Chapter 8 of this volume. DDiissppuuttee rreessoolluuttiioonn aanndd aammeennddmmeenntt pprroocceedduurreess Disputes may arise in co-management situations concerning competing access to resources, restrictions on their use, etc. In several jurisdictions, such conflicts areresolved by the courts, which are also often guided by specific recommendationson how competing claims to resources might best be resolved (see Box 7.18). 14Canada Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996.CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 259Although disputes over legal contracts can be resolved in court, it is highly desir- able to build into a co-management agreement a non-court dispute resolutionmechanism trusted by all parties. This may include: ztime limits for resolving disputes directly among the parties, or for responding to requests, notices, etc.; za requirement that parties attempt informal dispute resolution before having recourse to the courts; zidentification of an agreed independent mediator or arbiter and the circum- stances in which the services of this person or body shall be required, and whether their decision shall be final; zwhether the parties shall be legally represented in arbitration; and, zcircumstances in which either party shall simply have the right to terminate the agreement. The level of detail adopted will depend on: zthe extent to which the parties feel they can trust each other; zhow much is at stake; and, zhow much the parties wish to avoid the courts if the agreement does break down. The procedures set by the agreement should be culturally appropriate and the parties must ensure that suitably skilled people will be available to implementthem. It is also important to remember that the agreements are about the manage-ment of natural resources and should not be overloaded it with dispute resolutionand/ or penalty clauses. Disputes are often a symptom of more deep-seated problems and deficiencies in the management regime. If they are frequent, the agreement is probably not work-ing in some fundamental way. Even without active disputes, circumstanceschange, people change and knowledge grows\u2014 either party may wish to changethe agreement at some time in the future. A mechanism for this should versus Canadian Court of Law, 1990) Canadian case law suggests that conflict resolution over natural resource use should follow the princi- ples of priority for conservation and the public interest, with reasonable and objective regulation beingacceptable, followed by priority for subsistence or indigenous/ customary users. The interests of recre-ational and commercial users follow with lowest priority. For example, as aboriginal and treaty rightshave Constitutional protection, in the decision of Sparrow versus Canadian Court of Law it was estab- lished that fisheries regulations do not extinguish aboriginal peoples' customary rights to fish unless aclear and plain intent to do so is manifest in the legislation. The court noted that government regulationthat impinges on aboriginal rights must be shown to be justified, and that the court shall determinewhether the regulation is reasonable, whether it imposes undue hardship, and whether the limitationdenies the holders of the right their preferred means of enforcing their right. The court held that whenassessing government justifications for interfering with aboriginal peoples rights, court priorities shouldbe: 1) conservation, 2) subsistence needs, and 3) commercial and recreational fishers' rights.260 SHARING POWERseen as part of the original agreement, so that: zamendment is possible with the minimum of expense and complication; zthe risk of acrimonious debate is minimised; and, zprocedures are fair and equitable, and respect the interests of all parties. Individuals involved in the original negotiations may feel a strong sense of owner- ship of an agreement in its original form. Any request for amendment may beseen as a threat or an implication of failure or inadequacy. A request to change anagreement, however, should be seen simply as evidence that the world changes,not as a reason for frustration or recriminations. Building amendment proceduresinto the original agreement may help everyone to accept and understand thatagreements are designed to meet the circumstances of a particular time in historyand unlikely to remain appropriate forever. In the case of natural resource management, the path to needed amendments is smoothed if the parties agree beforehand on some form of monitoring, designedto be at least partly independent of the parties or their aspirations for the treaty.This might mean that the monitoring is done by an independent body, or a teamwhere parties are equally represented, or that it consists of objective measure-ments that are recorded by mechanical devices. If the monitoring reveals that anagreed threshold has been passed notwithstanding that the treaty conditions werescrupulously observed, it will be difficult to argue that a change is not needed. It is crucial, however, that agreements are never changed unilaterally. Any agree- ment that can be changed unilaterally is not a co-management agreement by defi-nition, since the parties are not equal in a matter of fundamental importance.There is little point in negotiating an agreement in good faith if one party can laterchange it at will. The rights of the parties in this respect should be fully protectedby law. At the very least, the need for all parties to agree to any amendmentsshould be clearly stated in the agreement itself. IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn,, ccoommmmuunniiccaattiioonn aanndd ccoonnffiiddeennttiiaalliittyy ccllaauusseess Information and communication issues can have considerable significance for many parties, and are a major element of a well designed agreement. In particu-lar, information that affects the status and operation of the treaty needs to be treat-ed with care and an agreed balance of transparency and discretion. The kind ofinformation involved might include: zany proposed legislative or policy changes; zany proposed tenure operation of the agreement itself; znumber and recipients taken, trees felled, etc.; znoticeable changes in size or distribution of animal populations; zbreaches of the agreement, or law breaking by others ( e.g., poaching); and, zeffects of traditional management practices ( e.g., burning, swidden agriculture). In general, the constituencies of all the parties in the agreement (and not just their representatives who participated in the negotiation process) need to be informedabout the agreement as a whole. What is it about and why was it thought neces-sary? This will be especially important if the terms of the agreement may lead toconflict with other users of the area. Sufficient funds will need to be set aside toinform all the parties and the public at large. 1155 There should be clarity within the agreement on who, when and how will set up and maintain a communication flow with all the parties and with local communi-ties in particular. Implementation arrangements for positive provisions also needto be clear. For example it should be specified who will receive the tourism bene-fits, who is allowed to tap water from a given source, who is allowed to collectmedicinal plants from the wild. And it should be specified when, where and howoften; who will monitor outcomes; whether a monitoring protocol is to be fol-lowed; and what specific mechanism should be used to alert the parties if prob-lems arise. If agreed management practices include traditional practices, and/ or people returning to live on their ancestral land, it may be important to include also astrategy for communicating and explaining these decisions to the general public.In Richterveld National Park in South Africa, for example, the park land is leasedfrom the Nama people, who retain rights to graze livestock and to harvest naturalproducts in a controlled way. 1166This needs to be clearly explained to the public at large. Indigenous people may also wish to have general cultural education initiatives included as part of the deal ( e.g., interpretive signs inside a park explaining cultur- al history, use of particular plants, spiritual significance of landscape features). Forindigenous people and other communities and societies emerging from a historyof oppression, it may also be important to have such history acknowledged pub-licly, either in the agreement itself or in explanatory material associated with it. Agovernment party not prepared to be understanding and transparent about thismay not get very far in the agreement process. Notwithstanding the above, one or more parties may wish to keep at least some of the agreement confidential. Although it is generally better to make the whole doc-ument public and easily accessible, the parties may wish to respect their mutualconcerns. In some cases, landholders seek a confidentiality clause in the contractbecause they do not wish to be known that they are dealing with a conservationagency in a community where there is little sympathy for conservation. Or theymay not wish others to know they are accepting financial assistance. Some peoplesimply wish to keep their affairs private and will not enter an agreement unlessconfidentiality is guaranteed. Confidentiality may be a particular issue when dealing with indigenous peoples, 15Farley, of public recognition can be stipulated as part of a management agreement. Government agencies are often surprised by how important this is toindividuals and communities, and how much people are prepared to do for littlemore than social recognition. Recognition may take the form of an attractive signfor the front of the property identifying it as a Wildlife Refuge, sustainable farm, orother \"special place\", preferably identifying the resident community or landownerby name. Recognition of this kind costs little and can have excellent spin-offs forconservation. Government agencies can address communities with a known pridein their history and citizens who are influential within their community for thiskind of public recognition. Once a few signs go up in a district, the local accept-ance level increases, the co-management concept gets talked about, and new par-ties ask to join in. Other forms of recognition may include a press release, presen-tation of an award, or hosting of a public ceremony in the relevant space. Theadded status that comes with this kind of public recognition is important in ruralcommunities, and a significant incentive for others to join in the efforts. InVictoria, for example, the Land for Wildlife Scheme ran a feature on Landline, therural programme on the national Australian television network in early 1995. Inthe weeks following the screening, interstate inquiries averaged one cultural and spiritual information as well as intellectual property rights over knowledge on the uses of plants, animals and micro-organisms. If, forexample, part of what an indigenous community seeks from the agreement isassistance in recording the cultural knowledge of its elders, the governmentagency may need to accept that the information gathered at its expense willremain the property of the indigenous community, who may not even wish toallow it access. Government parties need to be sensitive and flexible aboutrequests for confidentiality that relate to culturally sensitive information. A usefulcompromise might be to specify that no communication material will be publiclyreleased until the indigenous community signs off on it. While confidentiality issues are important, the money or other assistance provided by a government agency comes ultimately from the public purse and there is avalid argument that its application should be transparent\u2014 perhaps especiallywhen being applied to individual private landholders. As a matter of fact, manycountries have Freedom of Information provisions that apply to these cases andneed to be respected. SSppeecciiffiicc ccllaauusseess In relation to the benefits and undertakings, more detailed clauses may outline who will do or provide what, and how. Examples of what different parties mayask for or provide vary according to context and the institutional actor's relation-ship with the resources. ssuuppppoorrtt ffoorr eexxiissttiinngg eeffffoorrttss This is closely allied to public recognition, but is often less tangible. It may require no more than an enthusiastic government officer who offers to explain ecologicalprocesses and lend books, or a community leader convincing government agen-cies of the importance of a community conserved area for regional conservation.Very often, individuals and communities ask for flora and fauna surveys to bedone of their land. They may not want to do anything specific with such invento-ries, but they greatly appreciate \"knowing what's there\", especially if they canwalk around with the botanist and learn the scientific names of trees, or help thezoologist check the mammal traps. The increased understanding and appreciationof the land which is gained, along with the moral support of the professionalsdoing the survey (whose very presence affirms their existing conservation efforts)is all some communities and landholders need to continue practising their stew-ardship\u2014 or to step up their efforts. This recognition is actually crucial for com-munities and landowners whose land and resources are included in government-established protected areas. \"\"AA lleeggaaccyy ffoorr ffuuttuurree ggeenneerraattiioonnss\"\" Landholders already committed to good stewardship will often seek some form of guarantee that the conservation values they have worked to protect will be pro-tected \"for all time\". This can be difficult to achieve, for reasons that will be dis-cussed further below. MMaatteerriiaall ccoonnttrriibbuuttiioonnss Communities and landowners committed to good stewardship may not have the financial or other resources to do what is needed. They may seek material ( e.g., seedlings for planting, stones for terracing) or cash contributions ( e.g., tied to the purchase of equipment, fences, etc.) to support their conservation work. Weedcontrol, replanting, demarcation of land, compensation for community guards andprevention of human-wildlife conflicts are often in need of specific material orcash contributions. TTaaxx ccoonncceessssiioonnss One of the most commonly sought inclusions in a co-management agreement with private landowners is some form of tax or rate concession or rebate (localgovernment tax). Such a rebate provides recognition that the landowner is manag-ing responsibly and possibly foregoing some material gain in the process. It alsorelieves him or her of some financial burden without the need for the governmentto make actual cash payments. Tax concessions are widely used to encourageprotection of the environment in many countries (See Box 7.7 in this Chapter). TTeecchhnniiccaall aaddvviiccee This is frequently sought by indigenous and local communities and private land- holders. It may range from the very specific ( e.g.: \"What should we plant here?\" \"Where should we place the pig traps?\") to a full scale plan of management forthe land. A request to prepare a management plan offers boundless opportunitiesfor improved management on a cooperative basis. It is crucial, however, that thepreparation of the plan involves the relevant parties at every stage. Training is fre-quently sought by individuals and communities, and some form all parties involved should be a routine component of any co-management agreement. SSttrraatteeggiicc aaddvviiccee This is something of a variant on the above. An example will serve to illustrate. An aboriginal community which sought a co-management agreement in NewZealand was concerned at the level of visitation by commercial tours and individ-ual tourists to a waterfall on their traditional land. They did not want to keep peo-ple out, but they wanted the site respected. They did not want rubbish left behindor damage done to roads or forests, and they wanted some benefit for the com-munity (since the visitors were simply driving into their traditional lands withoutso much as asking permission). The government agency agreed to discuss a strate-gic plan for dealing with tourism. One idea discussed was charging commercialtours access for entry in return for a roster system which guaranteed they would be the only visitors at thefalls at a specified time. TTrraaddee-ooffffss These are sought when one of the parties in theagreement wants to do, orhas already done, some-thing which one or moreof the other parties wouldnot normally support. Forexample, a farmer whoseoperations have over theyears (and perhapsunknowingly) encroachedonto a national park mayseek to have that part ofthe park excised in returnfor transfer to the govern-ment of another part of theproperty. This can often be mutually beneficial. In a real example in north Queensland (Australia), a land-holder was prepared to hand over to the Crown a large area of forested land inreturn for excision of a small area of flat land. The flat land had been clearedmany years previously and planted to sugar cane every year since. Its conserva-tion value was zero. The forested land was very steep and of no value for agricul-ture, but was biologically important. Obviously, arrangements of this kind represent something of a tightrope for a gov- ernment agency with natural resource management responsibilities. They shouldnot be allowed to become the means for excusing landholders from breaking thelaw providing they \"make it up\" afterwards. Nor should they be allowed to beseen as an invitation for others to break the law and be rewarded for doing so. SSuuppppoorrtt ((oorr tthhee wwiitthhhhoollddiinngg ooff ooppppoossiittiioonn)) This item has some overlap with the item above. Some parties may seek to have most fundamental matter for agreement and acknowledgement in co- management documents is the relationship of the indigenous peoples and localcommunities to the land in question. All other inclusions, and how they are dealtwith, will flow from the extent to which ownership of the land, including custom-ary ownership, is acknowledged in writing and in the law. One of the most important benefits sought by indigenous peoples and local com- munities in a co-management agreement is an acknowledgement of their custom-another party (often a governmental agency) offer support ( e.g., by a letter) to assist them in negotiating with another agency. For that, they may be ready tomake some important concessions. For example, a letter from a protected areaauthority to the local government authority might say \"On behalf of agency X, Isupport the proposal to build a car park and boardwalk to allow tourists to viewthe swamp forest at Laguna Grande in the land customarily owned by the Y com-munity.\" The Y community may then agree to support the maintenance of theswamp in it original extension and conditions. More active support may also berequested, such as assisting the community in face-to-face negotiations. As a variation, it may be routine practice for the department which administers land tenure to seek comment from a conservation agency when, for example, aleaseholder is seeking to buy land or extend the terms of a lease. In some cases,the conservation agency may have legal power of veto over the dealing. Thelandowner may seek an assurance that the agency will not oppose the sale inreturn for some agreed management action, or trade-off. This kind of landowner benefit contains significant risks for the government agency agreeing to it, which must be very careful to ensure it is not acting illegal-ly, or contrary to government policy, or promising something it cannot deliver. Inmost cases, it is sensible to involve a \"third party\" department or agency at anearly stage, even if only informally, to avoid unexpected and undesirable out-comes. Indigenous peoples and local communities tend to hold an inclusive view of the world, and thus of what needs to be comprised in a resource management agree-ment. Government negotiators need to be prepared to adopt an inclusiveapproach that respects and accepts indigenous rights and aspirations. 1188As the BCCTF suggested: \"There should be no unilateral restriction by any party on thescope of negotiations.\" 1199 18Farley, 1997. 19British Columbia rights or affiliation with the land and resources at stake. While this certainly has moral force, its power as a negotiating lever is greatly overtakenin Western societies when the recognition is translated into legal ownership. InAustralia, the USA and Canada, the indigenous peoples that managed to obtain alegal title to their land found out that governments and industry that previouslydismissed their claims came to actively seek negotiation. The extent of \"owner-ship\" often marks the watershed between the role of supplicant and peer for theindigenous or local party in the negotiation process. If ownership or affiliation is acknowledged with an indigenous people or local community, the question of who will be the formal party to the treaty must beconfronted. This may be a council of elders, a corporation, a community councilor other representative body. If the land has been successfully claimed by a groupor body under an established legal mechanism, the decision is much easier. If thissituation does not apply, however, this should not be used as an excuse for notembarking on negotiations. Government negotiators will simply need to workclosely and cautiously with the indigenous people or community and assist themto identify the most appropriate formal representative of the right holders. WWhhoo eellssee iiss iinnvvoollvveedd?? A key matter for early determination is who should be involved in the agreement. This can be a vexed question. Inclusion of new parties and their interests is oftenopposed by the original parties (\"primary stakeholders\") who may see such addi-tions as a means of \"outnumbering\" them, and who may feel anyway that otherparties do not have legitimate rights to be involved. While the latter may well betrue, inclusion of some new legitimate parties in negotiations\u2014 and inclusion oftheir interests in the agreement\u2014 may prevent a good deal of troubles. For protected areas or wilderness such parties frequently are recreational users, including powerful hunting lobbies. Recreational users, however, have achievedvariable results in their efforts to be involved in co-management agreement nego-tiations in protected areas, e.g., in Alaska and Canada.2200 Where resource use is part of the agreement, or the land involved is resource-rich, existing or prospective mining, logging or grazing interests need to be carefullyconsidered. In Australia and Canada, it is common for indigenous peoples andmining companies (with or without government support) to enter into formalagreements over resource use before work begins. Such agreements commonlyconcentrate on financial compensation, rehabilitation, ongoing access, and theconduct of operations in ways, and in places, that respect the spiritual values ofthe land. In Bolivia, an agreement between a gas and oil company and indige-nous peoples provided the essential conditions for a major co-management agree-ment for the country (see Box Park Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco was established in September 1995 in Southern Bolivia. This park of 3.4 million hectares is the largest in Bolivia and contains the world's largest area of dry 20Sneed, 1997.CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 267FFiinnaanncciiaall oouuttccoommeess Many conservation agreements refer to land and resources that belong, or belonged to, an indigenous party or a local community or one or more privatelandowners. On this basis it is agreed that there should be some financial com-pensation for their loss, and/ or that the land should return an ongoing income toits customary or legal owners. Agreed financial outcomes may take the form of: zrental paid by the government (for instance, Aboriginal peoples in Kakadu, Nitmiluk, Booderee and Mutawintji National Parks, in Australia,2211lease their land to the government for an independently-determined market value return); zproportion of income or profits (for instance, the Anangu people receive 25% of entrance and other fees at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in Australia;2222in 1994, this arrangement returned them 600,000 Australian Dollars fromentrance fees alone; in South Africa, where the revenue from entrance fees maybe considerable, from 10 to 15% of revenue 2233is allocated to neighbouring trib- al authorities in various provinces and homelands\u2014 a type of arrangementoften used also in agreements with mining companies; zguaranteed employment (this is a very common provision for protected areas throughout the world, but it may benefit only a small proportion of the community);tropical forest under legal protection. Its most unique characteristic, however, is that the park was creat-ed in response to demands for territorial recognition by the Guaran\u20ac Izoce\u20aco people. This is the firstpark in the Americas declared on the basis of a demand by indigenous people and assigning to anindigenous people's organisation a primary administrative responsibility. The co-administration agree-ment that set up the park is a model document that creates new opportunities for both indigenous peoples and the under-staffed and under-funded national conservation authorities. Having establishedthe park has only partially fulfilled the historic objective of re-claiming their own customary landupheld by CABI (Capitan\u20aca de Alto y Bajo Izozog), the traditional representative structure of the Guaran\u20ac Izoce\u20aco. Currently, besides what is gazetted as park territory, another 1.9 million hectares bor- dering the park and straddling the river are being titled in their favour. How was this possible? CABI was able to capitalise on its internal cohesion to pressure the hydro-car- bon industry into making significant compensatory payments to them for the impact of that portion ofthe 32\" diameter, 3,146 Kilometres gas pipeline that runs through their indigenous territory and thepark. Such compensatory payments, totalling $3.7 million, and the activities that came in with thehydro-carbon industry, ensured CABI's ability to invest significant funds in the running of the park. Thisobviously strengthened their standing as effective co-management partners. In addition, the hydro-car-bon funds were crucial to support the indigenous organisations themselves, promote rural developmentand accelerate the process of titling indigenous lands. Co-management would have taken hold inBolivia without these funds, but would not have developed so rapidly, or garnered as much enthusiasmfrom the government agency in charge. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has been the principal broker supporting the negotiations for the park, the indigenous territory, the park's management plan and its administrative structures. It hadthe vision of a successful co-management agreement and the wisdom to know that this would takeyears of on-going support. In the 1.9 million hectare indigenous territory adjacent to the park, WCS hasalso worked closely with CABI since 1991, fostering the full appreciation of the links between wildlife(a crucial element of Izoce\u20aco cultural heritage) and the management decisions in their habitats. 21See Table 4.3 in Chapter 4. 22De Lacy and Lawson, 1997. 23Anderson, 1995.268 SHARING POWERzfinancial compensation, either on-going or once-off, used where government acquires the land and/ or the desired use is considered incompatible with ongoing indigenous use or ownership. The latter type of arrangement is envisaged, for example, by the Native Title Act 1993 (Commonwealth) of Australia, which provides for acquisition (with compen- sation) of native title rights, and regional agreements by which the Aboriginal peo-ple agree to yield their native title rights in return for agreed compensation. Thiskind of agreement modifies in a most important way the rights of indigenous peo-ples and should be subjected to very careful consideration and strict provisionsfor prior informed consent. In 2004 2244the Programme of Work on Protected Areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity actually ruled out forcible expropriationand resettlement of indigenous peoples for the purpose of establishing new pro-tected areas, and upheld the principles of prior informed consent. Resource extraction companies frequently seek to negotiate one-off compensation arrangements, or compensation that is ongoing but unrelated to profits ( e.g., pro- viding schools, housing, vehicles). Arrangements of this kind need to beapproached with great caution, as they can be superficially attractive (greatlyneeded benefits, expected to arrive quickly) but are often unfair and inequitablein the long term, especially if the resource extraction operation destroys naturalresources on which the people depend for their subsistence. Also, often promisesare forgotten soon after they have been made. The Finima community on Bonnyisland (Nigeria) learned this the hard way, as they ended up reaping all sort ofmisfortunes and social and environmental costs for their initial consent to estab-lish a liquefying gas plant in their midst. 2255 The agreement should be very clear on what financial outcomes is to flow to which parties, for how long and in what circumstances. What happens in the caseof ongoing compensation tied to profits, for example, if the operation makes aloss? How can the local community know if there really is a loss, or how muchthe profits really are? Any conditions and obligations should be clearly spelt out,be verifiable, and be understood by all parties. As well as setting out who gets what funds, the agreement should specify who decides how funds available for the management of the natural resources are tobe spent. Generally speaking, this decision should be taken by the co-manage-ment organisation, but in some cases a proportion of the funds may be directed toanother body that decides how to spend it within broad guidelines. In any case, itis important that the government party is not paternalistic and does not attempt totake control of this aspect. Avoiding long transfer lines for the funds destined tolocal communities is equally important. Long transfer lines, the \"safeguarding\" ofbank documents by state agencies and the deposit of money on state accounts,which often lasts much longer than anticipated, can hamper the communityaccess to, and decision on, the use of financial resources. GGoovveerrnnaannccee ooff pprrootteecctteedd aarreeaass A number of authors have pointed out that basing conservation on a \"protected area\" model is proper of a western understanding of nature, wildlife and wilderness, which is foreign to many indigenous peoples. 2266It is important for gov- ernments to remember this in negotiating treaties over AGREEMENTS 269high conservation values. Indigenous peoples will value the land and wish to pro- tect it, but their ways of doing so and their priorities may be different from thoseof government agencies. 2277 Yet, over half of protected areas in the world (and much more than that in some regions) have been created in areas inhabited by indigenous and local communi-ties. Many of these communities still live there, or maintain close interests andrelations to those areas and resources. In addition, a sizeable part of the remainingbiodiversity in the world\u2014 in forests, rangelands, mountain environments, wet-lands, freshwater bodies and coastal and marine environments, including man-groves, coral reefs and sea grass beds\u2014 exists in areas inhabited by indigenouspeoples or areas held as \"commons\" by local communities outside of official pro-tected areas. Fortunately, despite the lack of incentives and even the presence ofdisincentives, many such indigenous peoples and local communities are stillengaged in various types of management efforts. Some of those efforts have anoutright orientation towards the production and sustainable use of one or morenatural resources. Others aim at fully conserving an area for its spiritual, culturalor aesthetic values. In general, community rules privilege livelihood sustainability,risk-aversion, flexibility, social reciprocities and use-values. 2288Within such broad terms, relatively strictly protected elements of the land\u2014 such as sacred groves orareas with well-regulated access and use\u2014 can still be found in many inhabitedterritories. 2299A typical resulting landscape is a mosaic pattern of resource units under different use regimes and regulations, including conserved areas andresources of relatively limited size. 3300 For most indigenous peoples and local communities, protecting the land means living on it, close to it, and with it\u2014 still a difficult concept to accept for manynational parks staff, foresters and rangeland managers. Frequently it will alsomean some form of subsistence on the land or its natural resources, and somedegree of ecosystem manipulation. 3311Negotiations on land management therefore need to be conducted with care, sensitivity and open minds, and as few precon-ceived ideas as possible. It is important to arrive at \"mutually acceptable planningand management objectives,\" 3322agreeing on the objectives of management before the mechanisms are discussed. Often the mechanisms will involve a combinationof traditional and \"modern\" land management practices, and much can belearned and achieved in an atmosphere of good will. Although people and parkconflicts still endure throughout the world, community conserved areas andresources are being increasingly recognised as very important for conservation.Community engagement in the conservation of official protected areas is alsobeing increasingly appreciated, as theory and practice move from the old percep-tion of PAs as \"islands\" of conservation to the more current perception of PAs asintegral elements of a landscape/ seascape in which multiple management objec-tives effectively co-exist. 3333 27A draft synthesis of regional studies prepared in the eve of the Vth World Parks Congress is available at: http://www.iucn.org/themes/ceesp/Wkg_grp/TILCEPA/community.htm#synthesis . See also Borrini-Feyerabend et al. , 2004 (in press). 28In contrast, state-established protected areas generally privilege stability, legal authority and market values ( e.g., mega-fauna species). 29A typical example is the landscape of the Karen villages found in Ob Long National Park, in Thailand. While alarmed park authori ties point at the plots of land where the communities practice swidden agriculture, the villagers point at the areas they strictly c onserve as sacred or actively protect from forest fires, and stress that they use only about 10% of the land in the park, as shown in the maps they have prepared. 30In contrast, state-established protected areas generally privilege large scale gazetted environments surrounded by un-regulated territories. 31Pimbert and Pretty, 1998; Pimbert and Phillips, 2003; the Accord, Action Plan and Recommendations developed by the Vth World Parks Congress, 2003 ( http://www.iucn.org/themes/wcpa/wpc2003 ); the CBD Programme of Work ( http://www. biodiv.org/programmes/cross-cutting/protected/wopo.asp Areas(CCAs) and Co-managedProtected Areas (CMPAs). 3344The most direct way to support aCCA is to attribute a clear legalstatus to communities and entrustthem with the authority andresponsibility to conserve theirland and resources, in continuitywith established patterns andstructures. This is currently donein places as diverse as Senegal, Colombia, and Australia. 3355For CMPAs, specific agreements need to be developed to clarify the rights and responsibilities of each party in the agreement. It is alsoimportant to agree on how the decisions are to be implemented and enforced. If,for example, the parties agree that a certain threatened species will not be hunteduntil an indicator of its population passes a particular threshold, there should beovert agreement over who deals with offenders who break this rule. The proce-dures for enforcement need to be workable, and understood by all. Whileenforcement should to be done sensitively, failure to do it at all may cast doubt onthe credibility of the agreement as a whole and the likelihood that other aspectsof it will be adhered to. These questions apply equally (though with somewhatdifferent problems) to offences by those affiliated with the parties to the agree-ment, and to offences by outsiders. HHuunnttiinngg,, ffiisshhiinngg aanndd hhuummaann-wwiillddlliiffee ccoonnfflliiccttss The right to use and dispose of resources is likely to be one of the more contro- versial aspects of any co-management agreement. The concept of hunting andfishing in protected areas, in particular, is anathema to many conservationists,especially when modern rather than \"traditional\" weaponry and techniques areused. The cultural significance of the hunting itself and its political symbolism asan act of self determination are resented by conservationists as well as other par-ties in society. The problems often arise as the national economy relies on touristsbeing able to see wildlife at close range in protected areas. During the phases ofnegotiation it will be important to establish agreed management objectives,enforcement procedures and social communication strategies, in particular toconvey to the public at large the special significance of hunting and fishing for theindigenous and local communities. Ultimately, however, traditional hunting andfishing is likely to receive public sympathy (and government support) only if it canbe done in ways that do not endanger species and ecosystems, or the safety ofother users of the area. In some cases, the parties to the agreement have set up aspecial body to preside over such sensitive issues ( e.g., the Mackay Council of Elders decides on the issue of permits to traditional owners for taking marine 34A review of related issues and options for action can be found in Borrini-Feyerabend et al., 2004 (in press). 35See the special issue of Policy Matters (No.12) on Community part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park). At times, the mechanisms for regulating hunting or fishing are developed with minimal govern-ment guidance, but the practice is submitted to some form of joint or independentmonitoring. The existence of customary hunting practices should not detract attention from the fact that sport hunting is often practiced by foreign tourists, in elite conditions andenvironments. In West Africa, for instance, many hunting concessions are estab-lished in territories just adjacent to protected areas. Local communities bear thecost of not being able to hunt, fish, farm, graze animals or even legally collectwater inside the protected areas dedicated to supporting wildlife. This samewildlife, however, ends up feeding lucrative sport hunting and tourism businessesexploited by local and foreign elites in their strategically located concessions. An increasing number of agreements, starting from the CAMPFIRE examples of the late 1980s, deal today with a fair community share of the benefits deriving fromwildlife, including from hunting, fishing and tourism. These have provided somecommunities with much needed influxes of financial resources, but problemshave not been lacking. Depending on where infrastructure and tourism invest-ments are made and the ways in which benefits are allocated, there may be largediscrepancies among communities in adjacent territories, and within communi-ties. 3366Also, there may be artificial separations between wildlife management and management of other types of natural resources ( e.g., water, pasture, trees), and governments may maintain a paternalistic attitude, remaining reluctant to devolveeffective wildlife management authority and rights, and requiring that communitymembers be \"trained to the purpose\", while other partners, including tourismoperators, are not. 3377 Apart from native animals for hunting, other resources considered in a co-man- agement agreement may include rules and procedures for the use of fuelwood,vegetation for thatching, medicinal plants, canes and vines for basket weaving,wildlife as a source of protein-rich food (as distinct from the cultural needs ofhunting as an activity), feral animals ( e.g., wild pigs), carcasses from culling pro- grammes, grass and other vegetation for grazing livestock, and even intellectualproperty rights ( e.g., collecting a plant for personal medicinal use is quite different from providing sampling and explaining its use to a pharmaceutical company; ifthe company decides to market the active ingredient, the question of who ownsboth the plants and the knowledge becomes important). Underlying all these issues is the question of who owns the resources and the land. Do indigenous peoples and local communities have the right, for instance,to claim ownership of forests, waters, wildlife and/ or mineral resources, andtherefore decide on their use(s)? If the government retains ownership and wishesto sell them, will the indigenous party or local community have rights of veto,rights to impose conditions, or the right to expect a portion of the proceeds? The\"rights to negotiate\" are also likely to be an important aspect of any co-manage-ment agreement. These rights allow indigenous parties, local communities andother actors to negotiate directly with a resource extraction company over condi-tions and compensation payments. The recommendations on indigenous peoples that were adopted in 2003 at the 5 thWorld Parks Congress address future co-man- agement agreements that involve indigenous peoples in protected areas eemmppllooyymmeenntt A better economic lot for members of the indigenous and local communities is usually a key concern of one or more parties in the agreement. While this may addressed in Sept. 2003 to governments, inter-governmental organisations, NGOs, local communities and civil society, and were to be implemented in partnershipwith the freely chosen representatives of indigenous peoples. Several of them were later incorporated inthe Programme of Work on Protected Areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity (Feb. 2004): zEnsure that existing and future protected areas respect the rights of indigenous peoples. zCease all involuntary resettlement and expulsions of indigenous peoples from their lands in connec- tion with protected areas, as well as involuntary sedentarisation of mobile indigenous peoples. zEnsure that the establishment of protected areas is based on the free, prior informed consent of indigenous peoples, and of prior social, economic, cultural and environmental impact assessment, undertaken with the full participation of indigenous peoples. zRecognise the value and importance of protected areas established by indigenous peoples as a sound basis for securing and extending national protected areas networks. zProvide support and funding to indigenous peoples for community conserved, co-managed and indigenous-owned and -managed protected areas. zEstablish and enforce appropriate laws and policies to protect the intellectual property of indigenous peoples with regards to their traditional knowledge, innovation systems and cultural and biological resources, and to penalise all biopiracy activities. zEnact laws and policies that recognise and guarantee indigenous peoples' rights over their ancestral lands and waters. zEstablish participatory mechanisms for the restitution of indigenous peoples' lands, territories and resources that have been taken over by protected areas without their free, prior informed consent, and for providing prompt and fair compensation, agreed upon in a transparent and culturally appro-priate manner. zEnsure respect for indigenous peoples' decision-making authority and support their local, sustainable management and conservation of natural resources in protected areas, recognising the central role of traditional authorities, institutions and representative organisations, as appropriate. zRequire protected area managers to actively support indigenous peoples' initiatives aimed at revitalis- ing and applying, as appropriate, traditional knowledge and practices for land, water, and natural resource management within protected areas. zEnsure open and transparent processes and genuine negotiation with indigenous peoples in relation to any plan to establish or expand protected area systems, so that their lands, waters and natural resources are preserved and decisions affecting them are taken in mutually agreed terms. zEnsure that protected areas are geared towards poverty alleviation and improve the living standards of the communities around and within the parks through effective and agreeable benefit sharing mechanisms. zEncourage international conservation agencies and organisations to adopt clear policies on indige- nous peoples and conservation and establish mechanisms for the of grievances.CO-MANAGEMENT also often seek guaran- teed employment clauses. Employment and trade or professional skills offer amore powerful road to self respect and self determination than mere financialsecurity. In fact, having a large bank account but no work or profession is seen bysome communities as counter-productive as it can reinforce a welfare mentality. Wherever possible, financial benefits should be associated with guaranteed train- ing and identified prospects for advancement, to reduce the risk that the outcomewill be a small number of people in low paid menial jobs. This is especiallyimportant if the agreement is structured round a resource extraction operation thatwill come to an end in the short or medium term\u2014 leaving the people with nofurther to incorporate clauses about NR access for all parties. These may specify: zany places where either party agrees not to enter ( e.g., a site of spiritual signifi- cance may be off limits for government staff, who may in turn seek to limit access to an ecologically sensitive area undergoing rehabilitation); zthe positive rights of access of each party ( e.g., a government agency may seek to retain rights of access for fire fighting purposes across indigenous lands from which other non-indigenous people may be effectively excluded; similarly, itmay be important for indigenous people to have ongoing access for ceremonialor traditional purposes to areas where other park users are constrained fromentering); zconstraints on access for the general community, and information on who will control such access. If the agreement effectively acknowledges the land asbeing under indigenous ownership and/ or manage-ment, then it may be appropriate for the indigenousowners to exercise control over access directly. Thismay involve nothing more than the need to obtaina permit to cross the land. Even if no charge islevied, the system allows the traditional owners tobe aware of who is on their land and how manyvisits they are receiving. In the case of an agree-ment over a national park, or similar area, directcontrol may continue to be exercised by park staff,but only after agreement with the treaty partner onsuch matters as entrance fees, camping sites, permitconditions, etc.; zconstraints on access for commercial purposes ( e.g., tourism, mining, bioprospecting). All parties may wish to exercise a degree of control over commercial activities such as tourism. In somecases, such activities will simply be inappropriate andthe treaty should make clear that they will not beallowed. Otherwise, the agreement should address anumber of practical questions, such as: 274 SHARING POWER77..66CCrruucciiaall iissssuueess ffoorr ggoovveerrnnmmeenntt aaggeenncciieess In broad terms, what government agencies should seek from co-management agreements is to further their legislated objectives and policy aims. The relevant\"benefits\" should be for the land, the natural resources, \"conservation\", \"sustain-able development\" or other similar goals rather than for the agency itself or itsindividual staff. But specific agreements may also, of course, benefit the agencydirectly by saving it money, staff time or other resources, or by helping to spreadits \"message\" and/ or perpetuate itself as a \"legitimate organisation\". In the sensejust described, crucial aspects of the agreement include: GGoooodd mmaannaaggeemmeenntt\u2014\u2014 sstteewwaarrddsshhiipp Good management of the land ensures the conservation of species and ecosys- tems and the sustainable use of natural resources. A government agency may usefinancial incentives or other rewards to encourage landholders to agree to: zlimit clearing; zstock pasture at sustainable levels; zkeep livestock out of forests or away from stream banks ( e.g., by paying for fencing); zrotate use of areas for grazing or agriculture; zuse sound productive methods and inputs ( e.g., no chemical pesticides and genetically modified organisms); zlimit the number of visitors how?

CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS 275PPrrootteeccttiioonn ooff sscceenniicc vviieewwss Siting of a house or road may be negotiated to limit the visual impact on an other- wise natural scenic view (as well as the impact on conservation values).Communities and landholders may be willing to paint existing structures in cam-ouflage colours for the cost of the paint. AAcccceessss Access for management purposes or for the public to visit a notable feature may be negotiated with the relevant customary or legal owners. A community or land-holder may agree to allow access across a relevant property that is essential for,say, fire control, if the fire authority does a little annual maintenance on the road.In north Queensland (Australia), several landowners agreed to guarantee publicwalking access across their property to a popular waterfall in return for assistancein closing an unofficial vehicular track and some minor construction to define thewalking route more clearly. PPrrootteeccttiioonn ooff llooccaall ccuullttuurraall hheerriittaaggee On the ancestral lands of indigenous peoples, significant locations of rock art, cave paintings and other important indigenous cultural sites often occur on com-munity or private land. The relevant communities and landholders may be enthu-siastic about protecting these, but may need advice or financial assistance. Aresponsible government agency will include the relevant indigenous groups, com-munities and landowners in planning and negotiating an action strategy. Theagreement will likely include access arrangements for traditional custodians oraccess regulated by law or custom. RReehhaabbiilliittaattiioonn ooff ddeeggrraaddeedd aarreeaass The government agency needs to be confident that: zthe agreed work will get done; zthe reforestation initiatives will be followed up ( e.g., communities and land- holders may undertake planting of seedlings with volunteer help only, but later they might lose interest in regular watering or weeding; careful choice ofspecies and sites can minimise the need for follow up care, and automatedwatering systems can be a wise investment); zappropriate species of local origin will be used; zchemicals pest control will be avoided. For an effective outcome, the government agency or a reliable contractor will need to be closely involved in the planning and execution of this component of aco-management agreement. Some form of ongoing monitoring is desirable. DDiiffffuussiinngg tthhee ccoonnsseerrvvaattiioonn mmeessssaaggee Signs, media events, presentations and other communication avenues that acknowledge the efforts of various local parties at conserving natural resourceshelp to diffuse awareness and relevant information in a positive way. Many socialcommunication methods and tools can be used, especially with tourists or othervisitors. If a governmental agency is assisting a community or build a car park, boardwalk or walking track, for example, it should include in the agreement the provision of interpretive material. Smallposters and signs can explain forest ecology, conservation issues or indigenoushistory effectively and unobtrusively. The community or landowner may also bepleased to have a small shelter or pergola built to house educative material, ormay agree to maintain and display a or insect collection. CCoonnttrrooll ooff wweeeeddss aanndd ppeessttss This is another area where a governmental agency can reap significant benefits from co-management agreements, but will need to be closely involved in design,training and monitoring to ensure that: ztraps or chemicals are avoided and, if needed for subsistence livelihoods, trapped animals (including feral) are treated humanely; znon-target species are not affected; zthere is no risk to human safety or health; zequipment is looked after, and returned in sound condition if that is part of the deal; zfollow up action is taken as necessary (the initial investment may be wasted if this is not done). FFiirree aanndd fflloooodd mmaannaaggeemmeenntt Fire management is a genuine and often emotional issue, and will require careful explanation and negotiation, not only with the particular communities andlandowners, but with neighbours, conservation groups and other relevant govern-ment bodies. \"Natural\" fire management regimes, which include the intentionalsetting of fire when required for the maintenance of a specific habitat, and theireffects on ecosystems are often not well understood. The risks to human life, prop-erty and conservation values may be enormous if something goes wrong. Thechances of bad publicity and irretrievable damage to the reputation and credibili-ty of a governmental agency are also very high (as is the risk to its budget if dam-age leads to compensation claims!). Inclusion of fire management in co-management agreements therefore requires great caution. A \"safe\" inclusion might be no more than purchase or loan of firefighting equipment. Any inclusion of fire manipulation or prescribed (controlled)burns in the agreement should specify the involvement of qualified professionalfire management or control experts. This may include both biologists and profes-sional fire fighters. A wise government agency might also seek to specify what willhappen in the event of a managed fire (lit under the terms of the agreement) goingout of control\u2014 though this will be no protection if negligence is involved, andmay not help in the case of a public liability suit. The management of flooding and water regimes also needs to be approached with caution. Along the Murray River and its tributaries (Australia), where irrigationfarming is widespread and flooding regimes tightly controlled, landholders arenow being encouraged to allow regular flooding of river red gum forests which isessential for forest ecology. This offers considerable scope agreement based on this concept is a little different from the others, and is often more closely akin to a straight commercial transaction. Thebasic discourse (from the government agency's perspective) is \"I will agree thatyou are entitled to benefit X, if you promise to do (or not to do) Y\". In this case, Ywill be an activity which would improve (or damage) the values of the area. Itmay be planting, maintaining and caring for desirable species, or conversely,clearing, building a structure, subdividing, burning, starting up a tourist operation,diverting a watercourse, mining, quarrying or any number of other activities. In some cases, it will be possible to negotiate a change of location, or way of doing Y which minimises the damage. In some cases, the agency (assuming itdoes not have the legal powers to stop Y) will need to find a powerful incentive.Often this will be simply money, and may (if the landholders are willing and theagency wealthy enough) lead to voluntary acquisition of the land by the govern-ment. When this is not possible, the government agency may need to find an alternative which provides the same outcome as Y. In this respect, it is important to establishin negotiations what the actual desired outcome is (which is not always immedi-ately clear). A landholder seeking to subdivide his or her land, for example, maywant to provide a house site for each of her or his grown children. Negotiationswith the local government authority may suggest ways of providing for multipleoccupancy of a given plot without subdivision. A community may wish freeaccess to a water resource inside a protected area. A new water point outside theborder may give it exactly what it wants without any need to compromise onaccess. In dealing with the above kind of co-management agreements, the agency is often \"on the back foot\", as it is likely to be entering negotiations after a community orlandholder has already made the decision to do Y; presumably, it has also nolegal means to prevent Y. It will need to be very creative, and use its most skillednegotiators. It will also need to be pragmatic, and realistic about what can beachieved. Preventing Y may be the preferred outcome, but minimising the dam-age is better iinn aa mmaannaaggeemmeenntt ppllaann Where a complex mixture of management regimes and initiatives is proposed by various parties at various times, it may be desirable to prepare a comprehensiveco-management plan. The plan can set out agreed objectives and strategies and adetailed work schedule. It is to be signed off by the parties and it is the heart ofthe overall agreement. In some cases it may be possible to make the plan a legal instrument in its own right. A statutory management plan will need to have the strong support of all par-ties, as it will be legally binding on the social community at large, not just the par-ties, and will be much more difficult to revoke than a contract under commonlaw. The positive side of this is that such a plan represents a more secure and longterm form of protection for the land than a simple contract, and especially sowhen the latter does not run with development and the management of natural resources require experimenting and learning on an on-going basis. As a matter of fact, the processof negotiating and implementing the co-management agreements is never \"fin-ished\", and some \"body\" or organisation needs to remain in charge of executing,monitoring and reviewing such agreements through time. Such organisation maybe very similar to the negotiation platform among the parties that developed theagreements in the first place and, in fact, it may just continue that negotiationspace on a more stable basis. Importantly, as the negotiation platform was pluralistand included various parties, so should be the co-management organisation. Organisational forms vary among regions and depending on whether initiatives are self-mobilised or externally catalysed. Their composition depends on therange of institutional actors interested in the given natural and cultural resources.Their powers span from full management authority to consultative status. Andtheir structure and rules of the game include a very large range of possibilities andmay even vary of different types ( e.g., a board, a council, a formal or informal association, a fund) and span different levels ofauthority and responsibility. They all, however, share at least two characteristics:they include at least two parties (and often many more), and they deal with themanagement of a given area, territory or body of natural resources. The key typesof co-management organisations include: zdecision-mmaking bbodies\u2014 which are fully responsible for the management of a given territory, area or set of resources (examples may be a co-management board in charge of a state forest or protected area, or a trust in charge of man-aging an area jointly owned by several people; see Boxes 6.16, 7.11, 8.3 and8.6); zadvisory bbodies\u2014 which are responsible for advising decision-makers, e.g., by developing technical proposals, playing a brokering role, etc. (examples may be a committee in charge of developing a consensus over resource use thresh-olds and a fishing calendar or a high-level task force in charge of overseeingnegotiations and managing conflicts; see Boxes 6.13, 7.15 and 8.1); zmixed bbodies\u2014 which hold a combination of responsibilities, such as partial management responsibility and partial advisory responsibility (an example may be an advisory or management committee responsible for advising on parkmanagement issues but fully in charge of decisions pertaining to the naturalresources in its buffer zone; see Box 8.2); zexecutive bbodies\u2014 which are responsible for interpreting and implementing decisions within a broad framework provided by others (an example may be a local co-management committee in charge of applying a national legislation ina specific local context; see Box 8.4).

All the recommendations of the Task Force were accepted by government,including the establishment of a British Columbia Treaty Commission (in 1992). The Commission wasset up to be an \"impartial body which will facilitate and monitor treaty negotiations\". 11It includes two Commissioners nominated by the First Nations Summit and one each by the governments of Canadaand British Columbia, respectively. A Chief Commissioner is nominated by all parties. The Commissiondoes not negotiate treaties but coordinates the process, acts as an \"honest broker\" and provides disputeresolution services. It also allocates government funds provided for the treaty process. 1British functions of a co-management organisation at the local level usually relate to analysing situations, appraising different types of interventions, making strategicdecisions, developing plans and agreements, implementing, monitoring and eval-uating activities and adjusting them on the basis of lessons learned. Co-manage-ment organisations at regional, national and international levels, on the otherhand, are more concerned with enabling conditions, scaling-up concerns andinstitutional learning. The authority and terms of reference may be specified inlegislation or in participatory management agreements, and the members of theorganisations may be paid or voluntary. Co-management organisations can be further distinguished on the basis of: zlegal status and form ( e.g., board, council, authority, association, trust, compa- ny, etc.); zfunctions, responsibilities and legal powers to carry them out (including deci- sion making powers, enforcement provisions and assets owned); zcomposition, including the proportional representation of the parties who nomi- nate or elect the chair and other key members, decide what is their terms of office and in what circumstances their appointments can be terminated; zto whom the chair and key members ( e.g., the bureau) report and what are the meetings' schedules and reporting arrangements; zfunding received and by whom; zwhether members are paid, voluntary or need to pay to be members; zwhether a secretariat or some technical staff is available to work for the organi- sation; zconfidentiality or transparency of meetings and decision-making procedures; zquality of the relationship between members and the \"constituency\" they repre- sent (depending also on the constituency internal organising and representation procedures). , 2000) The Waza National Park, situated in the Extreme North province of Cameroon, was created some decades ago. Following the national legislation, the residents of the villages situated inside the park'sterritory were forcibly relocated outside, right at the park's borders (actually all communities were relo-cated except one, which possibly had important connections in high places...). The relocated commu-nities never resigned themselves to the decision, in particular regarding the prohibition of collectingnatural resources necessary for their own livelihood. Throughout the years they continued to claim fish-ing rights on the ponds excavated and managed by their ancestors inside the park, the right of harvest-ing certain plant products (for instance gum Arabic) from within the park, the right to take their animalsto graze inside the park in times of drought, etc. The ensuing conflicts between communities and parkmanagement brought the Waza Logone project, implemented by the IUCN and financed by the DutchDevelopment Agency, to initiate a co-management process to secure the natural resources of the parkvia agreements among the different stakeholders. The process of negotiating among stakeholders brought about the establishment of a multi-stakeholderCO-MANAGEMENT ORGANISATIONS 281Deciding about the institutional arrangement that best suits the co-management situation(i.e., what type of organisation, composition,rules, functions, powers, responsibilities) isinvariably an iterative process. To someextent, institutional arrangements arise fromthe reality on the ground (i.e., what is to bemanaged? How much is there to be shared?).On the other hand, the degree of flexibilitythe parties have about institutional arrange-ments (which includes the legal frameworkfor decision making) determines what canreasonably be included in the agreement andthe type of co-management organisation thatcan be developed. Examples of substantiallymanagement structure, with the aim of approving the conventions that would regulate the management of the park and the natural resources at its periphery. Noticeably, the definition of the mandate of thestructure encountered the strong reluctance of the park conservation service. After months spent insearch of a suitable compromise, the parties agreed on a \"double mandate\": a consulting role regardingthe management of the park (whose mandate stays with the conservation service), and a full manage-ment role regarding the zone at the periphery of the park. With this double role in mind, the structurewas named the Consultative/ Management Committee of the Waza National Park and its Periphery. The Consultative/ Management Committee of the Waza National Park and its Periphery was legalised by the Minister of Environment and Forests of Cameroon with a decision pertaining to its internal organ-isation and functioning rules. The structure includes members possessing full rights and members withconsultative powers only. The members with full (voting) rights are: z4 representatives from the Park Conservation Service; z1 representative from the Provincial Delegation of Environment and Forests; z3 representatives of the Central Service of the Environment and Forests Ministry; z5 representatives of the men from the settled communities in the park's periphery; z5 representatives of the women from the settled communities in the park's periphery; z2 representatives of cattle-rearing nomads (a man and a woman) and 1 representative of transhumant cattle-rearing people interested in the pasture of Waza National Park and the surrounding plain; z2 representatives of youths (a man and a woman) from the settled communities in the park's periphery. The members with consultative powers only are: zthe mayors of the interested rural municipalities (Waza, Zina, Pett\u00e9); zthe head Ngodeni, Fadar\u00e9, Kossa); za zthree representatives of the Waza Logone project; za representative of the Management Committee of the Waza-Logone Plain (another multi-party man- agement structure in the same province, also promoted by the Waza Logone project). 282 SHARING POWERdifferent types of co-management organisations are given in Box 8.1, Box 8.2 and Box 8.3 and several more are listed in Table 8.1 along with a selection of theiraims, functions and powers. Noticeably, several organisations with different func-tions, powers and responsibilities may be needed for a particular area and act incomplementary ways (see, for instance, Box 6.12, on the sophisticated co-man-agement setting for the Galapagos Marine and Folke, 2001) Local fishing associations are common in Sweden. These associations, which in many respects resem- ble common-property systems, manage many of Sweden's vast number of lakes, rivers and streams.National laws introduced in the 1980s and 1990s make it possible for freshwater associations not onlyto manage lakes and rivers but also watersheds. Fishing associations have the right to Scotland have developed community-based organisations specifically to coor- dinate and implement woodland management on a wide area. In Assynt, for instance, the local farmers(called crofters) established in 1992 the Assynt Crofters' Trust, with some 130 members spread across13 townships. The trust raised the money for the purchase of the former North Lochinver Estate by pub-lic subscription, grants and loans from public bodies. The members elected directors to the trust's boardon a township basis, and the trust was then run by an executive company chairman and various offi-cers. Since then, the trust has developed the potential of the estate, including through a native wood-lands programme. Nested co-management institutions can develop different agreements at differentlevels of detail within the same co-management scheme. In Sweden for example,the institutional framework for the management of freshwater fisheries is made upof a nested set of institutions at different organisational levels that combine gov-ernment bodies and fishing associations (see Box 8.4). In Canada, the YukonUmbrella Final Agreement created two levels of wildlife co-management boards:a Fish and Wildlife Management Board for the Yukon as a whole, and separateRenewable Resource Councils in each Yukon First Nation's traditional territory.The Board is the primary instrument for fish and wildlife management in theYukon as a whole, and the Councils are the main bodies responsible for develop-ing agreements on, and implementing, local renewable resource management.The structures include approximately equal numbers of government and Inuvialuitrepresentatives, except in a few specified cases. Similar institutional arrangementsare foreseen in many other comprehensive agreements on wildlife managementthat have been negotiated throughout the Canadian North. 22Wide-ranging co- management responsibilities are usually assigned to co-management boards andextensive self-regulatory responsibilities devolved to of these nested co-management organisations worktowards the conservation of resources through processes that determine howmuch of the total allowable harvest is allocated among aboriginal peoples andother users. One of their salient characteristics is the flexible and creative use oflegal and economic instruments while striving for open negotiation in the state of Rajasthan is registered under a unique law known as the Rajastan Gramdian Act 1971, which givesexecutive and legal powers to the gram sabha (village council). The entire adult population from 100 households is directly represented in the gram sabha . The gram sabha elects the karyapalika (the execu- tive), as well as the adhyaksh (chairperson) for a definite period. The executive committee, which is made up of unpaid representatives from all sections of the community, cannot take decisions unless aresolution to that effect has been taken by the gram sabha, which meets at least once every month. Seed's gram sabha has formed six committees to oversee different types of work in the village: crop loans, forest and nursery development, water resource management, legal problems and disputes,development programmes and finances. The gram sabha has full control over the use of land within the village boundary. In managing this territory, it also has the power to judge, penalise and prosecute. The gram sabha has also devised rules for protection of the village common lands by dividing them into two categories: one where both grazing and leaf collection is banned, and the other where grazing is concerning fishing and fish conservation. The national government, however, is still in charge of broad-er decisions, such as instituting bans on certain fishing methods or granting permission for stocking fishand shellfish. A detailed study of the management of the Lake Racken watershed has highlighted the key role of local fishing associations in sustaining crayfish populations and the larger ecosystem. The institutional frame-work for the management of crayfish populations is made up of a nested set of institutions at differentorganisational levels. Rules for the management of crayfish are both informal and formal, and are devel-oped by both the local fishing associations and the government. Much of the learning by doing for theco-management of fisheries, however, is carried out by the local fishing associations, whose membersdevelop site-specific ecological knowledge as well as adaptive organisations and rules. Some co-management organisations are created as interim measures during the resolution of title claims over natural and cultural resources. For example inCanada, representatives of Inuit and Haida communities were called in to partici-pate in processed around the management of two National Parks while their terri-torial claims were being resolved. Both processes ended up establishing co-man-agement agreements. 33Similarly, in the South Moresby/ Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, co-management structures were initially created as an interim dis- pute resolution mechanism. Nine Inuit representatives participate today in themanagement of the Auyuittuq National Park Reserve on Baffin Island, with threeParks Canada staff acting as advisors. The committee advises on general parkmanagement, including wildlife harvesting and interpretation programmes, and isreported to have reduced local conflicts over the area. Under the Sub-agreementon Impact and Benefits of the Nunavut Final Agreement, issues such as employ-ment and economic benefits, zoning, and new committees are also examined. CCoommppoossiittiioonn As mentioned, a co management organisation is necessarily multiparty, i.e., it includes at least two, and often many more, social actors. These actors may repre-sent broadly similar or different interests SHARING POWERpermitted but leaf collection or harming trees is banned. This local management organisation also has jurisdiction over trees in private lands, where cutting is allowed only for domestic reasons but not Committees (FPCs), whose members are drawn from the local communities dependent on forest resources, were firstset up in the 1970s and 1980s in the states of West Bengal, Gujarat and Haryana. The National ForestPolicy (1998) and the circular regarding community involvement in forestry issued by the Governmentof India, emphasised the increasing importance of Joint Forest Management between state agencies andlocal communities. For the FPCs, the important issues include adopting and implementing regulationsfor community collection and allocation of fuel wood, minor forest products, grazing access, labour forforestry activities, sharing the proceeds from timber and polewood harvests, and managing intra-andinter-village conflicts. The presence of primary and secondary stakeholders in the CM bodies manifestsitself in the differing priorities each stakeholder group assigns to forest management as well as the formand degree of benefit sharing. For example, in most areas JFM is used as a strategy to regeneratedegraded forests and improve survival in plantations; in other words, for meeting the objectives of theForest Department, which often do not coincide with the needs and interests of forest-dependent vil-lagers. The capacity of a social actor\u2014 a public or private agency, a group, an organisa-tion or an individual\u2014 to become a member of a co-management organisationdepends on the social status of that actor, i.e., on the acceptance by the othermembers of the organisation (and by society at large) of its claims to participate inmanagement. In other words, it depends on its recognised entitlements (seeSection 2.2 of this volume). Legal issues, including customary or legal tenure,jurisdiction and authority also need to be addressed. For example, if lands areheld under leasehold, the written consent of the relevant owners, tenants, occu-piers and security holders (such as mortgagees) may be required in the develop-ment of a co-management institution. Some jurisdictions and legislation mayrequire that organisations are formally incorporated as legal persons before theycan take part in a management body. In other cases, the government has to recog-nise the validity of customary laws and allow for management authority andresponsibility to be taken up not in individual but in collective ways (see Box 8.6) Box Kayan Mentarang National Park (KMNP) situated in the interior of East Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) lies at the border with Sarawak to the west and Sabah to the north. With its gazetted 1.4 mil-lion ha, it is the largest protected area of rainforest in Borneo and one of the largest in Southeast Asia.The history of the natural landscape of the park is intertwined with the history of its people. About16,000 Dayak people live inside or in close proximity of the park. These are still communities largelyregulated by customary law, or adat, in the conduct of their daily affairs and the management of natural resources in their customary territory ( wilayah adat) adat ) administer the customary law. All elected officials at village level and prominent leaders of the commu-nity are members of the customary council, which declare traditional forest areas with protection statusor strict management regime. These are referred to as \"lands whose access is restricted or limited\" ( tana ulen). Such lands cover primary forest rich in natural resources such as rattan ( Calamus sp.), sang leavesCO-MANAGEMENT ORGANISATIONS 285Still in other cases, it is the country as a whole that must go through a process of testing various approaches on the basis of diverse views of what is possible anddesirable. In this sense, co-management institutions emerge as a way of solvingproblems and signalling the acquired maturity of the natural resource manage-ment debate (see Box 8.7). (Licuala sp.), hardwood for construction ( e.g., Dipterocarpus sp., Shorea sp., Quercus sp.) and fish and game, all of which have high use value for the local community. In 1980 the area was established as Nature Reserve, under a strict protection status that allowed no human activity. Later on, a study that included community mapping exercises showed the Dayak com-munities rightful claims to the land and its resources. This study basically recommended a change ofstatus from Nature Reserve to National Park, where traditional activities are allowed. A WWF projectidentified as primary the problem of lack of tenure security, which had effectively transformed theDayak's forest into an \"open access forest\", where the state could decide to allocate exploitation rightsor establish a conservation area without their prior consent. The Dayak communities had very littlepower to defend the forest or secure their economic livelihoods against logging companies, miningexploration, or outside collectors of forest products. Under these circumstances, the project decided togive priority to activities that would lead to the recognition of adat claims and adat rights, so that indigenous communities could continue to use and manage forest resources in the conservation area.From 1996 to 2000, the project engaged in the assessment of the use and availability of forest resourceswith economic value, in workshops forthe recognition of forest under traditionalcustomary management ( tana ulen in recom-mendations and the redrawing of theexternal boundaries of the park, in thedrafting of adat or customary regulations for the management of the national park,and in the strengthening of local organi-sations. The Alliance of the Indigenous People of Kayan Mentarang National Park (FoMMA)was formally established on October2000 by the leaders of the ten customarylands of the park. This was to create aforum for conveying the aspirations of theindigenous communities and debatingissues concerning the management ofnatural resources in the customary lands of the KMNP. The Alliance is concerned with guaranteeingprotection of the forest and the sustainable use of natural resources in the ten customary lands of theNP area, as well as with the protection of the rights of indigenous people and their economic prosperityin and around the park. The Alliance now legally represents the concerned indigenous people in thePolicy Board ( Dewan Penentu Kebijakan ), a new organisation set up to preside over the park's manage- ment. The Policy Board includes representatives of the central government (Agency for ForestProtection and Nature Conservation), the provincial and district governments and the Alliance. Theoperating principles of the board emphasise the importance of coordination, competence, sharedresponsibilities, and equal partnership among all stakeholders. The board was formally established inApril 2002 with a decree of the Ministry of Forestry, which also spelled out that the park was to bemanaged through collaborative management\u2014 a first R.K., 2003) The vast majority of protected areas in the United States lie within the national system of public lands and resources. National forests differ from other forms of public lands insofar as the original rationalefor their retention within the public domain includes the continuation of natural resource developmentfor commercial purposes, as well as ecological preservation, scientific research, and endangeredspecies protection (this is in line with the 1960 Multiple Use and Sustained Yield Act). For the first one hundred years after independence, the dominant attitudes toward public lands and resources was characterised by a process of land acquisition (colonial westward expansion), followedby settlement (the transfer of the public domain into private ownership), and relatively unfettered com- mercial development. By the close of the 19 thcentury, however, the social and ecological costs of these laissez-faire policies were taking their toll in the form of deforestation, soil erosion, large-scale forest fires, loss of native species, and a host of urban social and economic problems. Progressive ideals werea response to this state of crisis. In general terms, progressives argued that only the federal governmentcould provide the objectivity, rationality and expertise needed to properly regulate, manage and pro-vide for the public good. By preventing the wasteful practices of those seeking short-term economicgain, the vast natural resources in the United States would not be squandered, but last for generations,managed according to scientific principles by a corps of highly trained and \"unbiased\" state officials. Despite this policy of centralised management authority, local residents remained economically dependent on these new national forests and, in practice continued to exercise varying levels of influ-ence over management decisions. Public participation in the management process was formalised inthe 1960s and 1970s with the passage of a series of new federal environmental laws, which empha-sised the need for public hearings and stressed public participation in an individual and nationalisticsense rather than in a collective or community-based sense. Avenues for \"participation\" were in factdesigned to allow individuals to express their personal views or interests, rather than groups and com-munities to express collective concerns. Rather than facilitating dialogue and open discussion, publichearings tended to be linear presentations of information from federal officials to a public audience. In the 1990s, regional socio-economic shifts created increasing tensions in many western rural commu- nities over public land use issues. Soon it became clear that the existing institutional structure for inte-grating public input into forest management processes was insufficient and tended to exacerbate localdisputes and alienate federal officials from community residents rather than to create an atmosphere ofcollaboration. In those years, on the other hand, a number of \"real\" partnerships\u2014 such as the QuincyLibrary Group in California, the Applegate Partnership in Oregon and the Ponderosa Pine ForestPartnership in Colorado\u2014 began to emerge and provided concrete examples of what might beachieved through collaboration. These different types of partnerships provided a forum where local resi-dents and federal managers could work together to solve common problems. On the basis of theirresults, interest in community-based approaches proliferated rapidly across western USA. By 1997, over90% of national forests in the United States was said to be engaged in some form of collaborative stew-ardship as part of their management strategy. SSccooppee ooff aauutthhoorriittyy While there may not be a stand-alone body with permanent premises, staff, budg- et, etc., some kind of joint organisational forum is essential if a natural resource orterritory is to be managed by more than one party. Such joint \"bodies\" often varyin their decision-making powers. The weakest form of organisation is simply anadvisory body to the \"real\" decision-maker (which may be by mandate a govern-mental agency). In such cases, the body may have strong moral force but littleCO-MANAGEMENT ORGANISATIONS 287real power. Some indigenous parties and organised sectors of civil society are increasingly unlikely to accept this model, given the existence of other types oforganisations that can better represent their rights (see Box 8.8). Others, however,consider that advisory bodies with strong legitimacy\u2014 and especially advisorybodies in charge of developing technical proposals and arrangements\u2014 often endup strongly affecting or determining decisions despite their lack of legal mandate(see Box 1997) \"Token\" cco-mmanagement oorganisations.Under Queensland's Aboriginal Land Act 1991 successfully claimed national parks are leased back to government and managed by a board of management. Unders.5.20(3) \"The Aboriginal people particularly concerned with the National Park land are to be repre-sented on the Board of Management.\" No mention is made of who else will be on the board, howmany, or what the proportional representation of those Aboriginal people shall be. In practice, anyway,the board has few real powers. Its principal function is to \"cooperate\" with the chief executive of thegovernment in the preparation and revision of a management plan. Under the Nature Conservation Act 1992 , to which the parks remain subject, real power remains in the hands of the chief executive. Management plans do not have statutory force, unless specifically determined under a separate regula-tion. Very few national parks have been successfully claimed under this act and Aboriginal people gen-erally express little confidence in it. Progress has been inordinately slow. Equitable aand eeffective cco-mmanagement oorganisations. At Uluru and Kakadu National Parks, similar claims, leases and board of management arrangements also apply. In these cases, however, the lease isfor a limited term (five years) subject to renewal, and provides guaranteed financial compensation. TheKakadu Board of Management, for example, comprises 14 individuals, 10 of whom are Aboriginal peo-ple nominated by traditional owners. The board is responsible for preparing a management plan (whichis subtly but significantly different from \"cooperating in its preparation\") and making day-to-day man-agement decisions. In practice, the traditional owners are a powerful force in the management of bothparks, which are run according to both national parks law and indigenous law. Management arrange-ments for these parks are genuinely cooperative. SSiizzee aanndd lleevveell ooff ooppeerraattiioonnss Co-management organisations can be large or small, simple or highly complex, single or multiple, and thus operate at various scales and levels. An example of acomplex institutional structure for the management of a World Heritage site isgiven in Box 8.9. The size and level of operation of this joint management bodyclearly contrasts with the smaller scale village level institutions described in Box8.4. Box 8.9 In the Wet Tropics of north-eastern Australia, a complex institutional structure has been developed with the intention of achieving some community involvement in the management of the World HeritageArea (WHA), as well as a balance between the perspectives of Commonwealth and state governments.A great deal of attention was paid to the process of setting up the participatory management institutions288 SHARING POWERCo-management organisations can also be distinguished on the basis of the scale on which they operate to improve natural resource management and local liveli-hoods. Three levels of operation appear most important: 1.The llocal llevel. The focus at this level is on primary actors. Co-management organisations are usually engaged in situation analysis, appraisal of differenttypes of interventions, making strategic decisions, developing plans and agree-because of serious conflicts\u2014 between the Commonwealth and state governments, and within thenorth Queensland community\u2014 over the listing of the area and the compulsory cessation of loggingunder a Commonwealth regulation. The participatory management scheme responsible for the imple-mentation of the Wet Tropics Management Inter-governmental Agreement is complex and multilayered.Its main components are: The WWet TTropics MMinisterial CCouncil. As the ultimate decision making body, the Council includes two Commonwealth ministers. The portfolios represented by these ministers change from time to time, butalways includes the Commonwealth minister responsible for the environment. Other ministers, such asthose representing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and State Tourism may be invited toattend as \"observers\" from time to time. Under the Act, the Ministerial Council's responsibilities are: zapproving the budget; znominating the chairperson of the board (see below); zrecommending for approval the final management plans to the state Governor in Council. The WWet TTropics MManagement AAuthority. The WTM Authority consists of a board, an executive director and staff. The staff and executive director are state government officers employed under Queenslandpublic service laws. The board consists of five part-time members who are private citizens. The execu-tive director is a non-voting member of the board. The voting members are appointed underQueensland law on the nomination of the Commonwealth (two), the state of Queensland (two) and theMinisterial Council (the Chair of the Board). While the Wet Tropics World Heritage Protection andManagement Act 1993 requires only that board members not be public servants, and have experienceor qualifications in a field relevant to the Wet Tropics WHA, the Commonwealth is obliged under theWet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Conservation Act 1994 to make at least one of its nomineesan Aboriginal person. The Authority is advised by two statutory committees: a Scientific Advisory Committee, and a Community Consultative Committee (CCC). While these committees have functions specified under theact, they do not have decision making powers. Initially the members on the CCC were chosen by theMinisterial Council. After proclamation of the act, appointment of the committees became the WTMAuthority's responsibility. There is now a formal policy and written procedures for selecting committeemembers. Public notices call for expressions of interest, and the policy requires the authority to choosemembers who provide a range of skills and interests, and are spread geographically across the entirearea. Preference is given to nominees who can demonstrate the support of a community group. Wherea particularly contentious issue is to be discussed at a board meeting, the authority may also hold com-munity meetings with key stakeholder representatives from the conservation sector, tourism industry,indigenous groups or World Heritage Area landholders and neighbours. The meetings are chaired by aboard member, who canvasses views on issues to be considered by the Wet Tropics Board. Each boardmeeting is attended by government officials representing the four Ministerial Council portfolios. Theofficials attend as observers and have no statutory role but are nonetheless have collected and compared a number of co-management agreements and organisations. The cases span international, national and localexamples.ments, and implementing, moni-toring and evaluating activities.Time and resources may need tobe invested in participatoryprocesses, dialogues to elicit mul-tiple perspectives, group learningprocesses, conflict resolution andthe active engagement of under-privileged actors ( e.g., women, the poor).44The full and effective involvement of primary actors in aco-management organisation atthe local level makes the wholedifference between token partici-pation/ consultation and real co-operative decision making andpower sharing. 2.The ddistrict oor rregional llevel.The focus at this level is on providing the enabling conditions for co-management of natural resources to happen at thelocal level over wide areas. Co-management organisations may be set up toidentify and promote needed conditions and forms of support, to encourageand promote local action, to mediate conflicts, to strengthen networks, and tofacilitate exchanges and joint learning. Typical activities include the federationand coordination of local initiatives and the building and strengthening of localorganisations to involve more local actors in the management of naturalresources. 3.The nnational aand iinternational llevel.The focus at this level on legislation, policy and institutional transformation. Co-management organisations operatingon a very large scale usually include as major actors governmental agencies,large NGOs, donor agencies and representatives of first nation peoples. Theirkey challenge is to ensure the broad conditions and incentives necessary toestablish flexible, innovative and transparent management practices. Morespecifically, they should refrain from imposing \"participation\" from abovethrough standardised structures that may inhibit, rather than facilitate, co-man-agement at the local level. Ideally, co-management organisations operate at these three interrelated levels to secure local livelihoods and sustain natural conserve Porcupine Caribou herd and its habitat zto further the objectives of the agreement; zto facilitate coordination, communication and coopera- tion between the parties and develop an International Conservation Plan; zto collect, share and provide advice and recommenda- tions to the parties concerning herd monitoring, harvest limits and data, habitat conservation; zto ensure opportunities for customary and traditional uses of the herd and participatory management.

It is well known thatthe environment is currently responding to a variety of influences\u2014 from climatechange to overexploitation and pollution\u2014 which alter its natural features,rhythms and cycles. Equally pervasively, socio-cultural and economic change hasbeen sweeping across the planet. Today, even remote rural livelihoods are under-going dynamic change, and all human communities increasingly express differen-tiated and evolving needs. In this context, adaptive management11is the only sen- sible approach. Adaptive management emphasises on-going learning through iter-ative processes and fitting solutions to specific contexts. It is based on systematicexperimentation and careful analysis of feedback to policies and managementinterventions. Possibly more than any other regime, a co-management regimeought to follow its tenets, and the more the co-management actors will invest injoint learning processes, the more their collaboration will be relevant and effec-tive. \"Learning by doing\" is thus an integral part of each stage of the co-manage-Chapter 9. LEARNING BY DOING IN 2002.LEARNING BY DOING 297ment process, but it is truly the heart of the matter in the third phase\u2014 the one of implementation of the agreements. Three broad themes run through the considerations, examples and lessons pre- sented in this Chapter: zInstitutional and organisational learning for adaptive co-management benefits from being rooted in indigenous and local knowledge, skills and institutions, and from using local indicators to track and respond to environmental andsocial changes. 22 zCo-management organisations ought to challenge themselves: they have to become learning-oriented at their core. Learning-oriented organisations encour- age experimentation, questioning and the abandonment of stereotypes; developskills in recording, applying and disseminating lessons; build relationshipsbased on mutual respect; and foster a non-threatening environment where peo-ple learn from one another. zFacilitating and encouraging individual and collective learning for co-manage- ment requires action at various levels, including not only the local but also the national and international institutional contexts. There is where the hard limita-tions on the spread, scaling up and mainstreaming of the web site: http://www.resalliance.org/ 3This theme is mostly explored in II of this volume, there is no \"right process\" to develop a \"right co-management agreement\" and yet an agreement is often as strong, or asweak, as the process that generated and sustained it. Several lessons, in particular,have been learned about the steps and activities that are key to making a co-man-agement agreement functional. Some of these activities and relevant of resources for effective and equitable participation in negotiations and implementing agreements is an important requirement for the agreements tobe functional. The support provided to the participation of the Maori people indecisions and implementation of natural resource management is an inspiringexample of how governments can \"level the playing field\" by facilitating moreequitable access to expertise, financial resources and spaces where dialogue andnegotiation are possible (see Box 9.1). Similar types of assistance to support thefulfilment of co-management agreements have proven essential for the success ofother large scale initiatives such as the Landcare and Rivercare programmes inAustralia (see The Resource Management Law Reform (RMLR) undertaken by New Zealand has been remarkable for298 SHARING POWERthe provision of a range of alternate mechanisms for Maori participation. This process has been effec- tive through being responsive to Maori cultural preferences, particularly with respect to using oral com-munication and time frames appropriate for decision making by consensus. Mechanisms included: zan intensive set of hui (meetings) held in the marae (customary community meeting places); zcovering of the personal and travel costs of participants for the hui; zan open-door policy, sensitive to tribal time frames, enabling submissions to be accepted and incor- porated in the review at any time ; zprovision of a free phone service for recording of oral submissions; zcomprehensive funding and human resource assistance to tribal organisations for the preparation of written submissions. Formal structural arrangements for advocating Maori interests have been crucially important for suc- cessfully integrating those interests in all aspects of the reform. The government established a coregroup of four people responsible for coordinating the RMLR process and facilitating two way communi-cation between Maori and the review team. The RMLR consultation on natural resource management issues has been the largest and most compre- hensive process for Maori participation in the formulation of policy and law ever carried out by theNew Zealand government. It elicited an exceptional response from the Maori, which further empha-sised the interrelationship between the integrity of natural resources and the social, cultural, economic,physical and spiritual well being of Maori communities. It also raised to an unprecedented level theMaori's expectations for the integration of their priorities in resource management agreements, andstrengthened their commitment to implement the agreements and to make them work. Box case studies by Siepen, 1994) In Australia, co-management programmes foresee government assistance for community-based manage- ment such as the Landcare, Rivercare and Coastcare programmes. The Natural Resources Management(Financial Assistance) Act 1992 (Cwlth), administered by the Australian Department of PrimaryIndustries and Energy, provides for inter-governmental agreements regarding natural resource manage-ment, with the primary aim of achieving \"efficient, sustainable and equitable management of naturalresources, consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development\". Its other objectivesare: zto promote community, industry and governmental partnership in the management of natural resources; zto assist in establishing institutional arrangements to develop and implement policies, programmes and practices that will encourage sustainable use of natural resources; zto assist in enhancing the long term productivity of natural resources; zto assist in developing approaches to help resolve conflicts over access to natural resources. The Act deals with agreements with states regarding the provision of financial assistance for natural resource management projects, as well as agreements with other persons, including associations,authorities or other organisations, whether incorporated or not. The Act also establishes a NaturalResources Management Fund and a National Landcare Advisory Committee.LEARNING BY DOING 299In 1997, the Australian Federal Parliament created a Reserve Fund for the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. Its main source of financial resources (A$ 1.1 billion) was the partial privatisation of one ofAustralia's major telephone companies. The Reserve Fund is intended to \"conserve, repair and replen-ish Australia's natural capital infrastructure\" by supporting initiatives on the environment, sustainableagriculture and natural resource management. Some of these initiatives are part of the Landcare,Rivercare settings rely on local resources and informal innovation systems. Local technologies are improved to intensify the use of natu-ral resources. In this way sustainable and relatively inexpensive solutions can befound by communities engaged in identifying their needs, designing and testingnew technologies and/ or adapting existing technologies to the local conditions.The potential for intensification of internal resource use without reliance onexternal inputs is enormous. In India (see Box 9.26) the co-managed PublicDistribution System allowed women farmers to achieve greater self reliance andreduced dependency on outside supplies of food, pesticides, fertilisers and seedsby enriching and diversifying their farming systems with locally availableresources. Similarly, when co-management bodies encourage local communitiesto engage in the planning, implementation and maintenance phases of projectsdesigned to meet health, housing, sanitation, water needs and revenue generat-ing activities, the results are often more sustainable and effective than thoseimposed by outside professionals and external agencies. Local natural resource management systems are naturally tuned to the needs of local people and often possess a substantial capacity to adapt to dynamic socialand ecological circumstances. While many of these systems have been more orless forcibly replaced by others ( e.g., market-oriented production under private or state property, conservation managed by state agencies), there remains a greatdiversity of local knowledge, skills and institutions that can still be effectivelyemployed. Local management systems are closely linked with local livelihoods,and often rooted in cultural practices and religion and spiritual beliefs. Sacredgroves, for example, are clusters of forest vegetation preserved for religious pur-poses. They may honour a deity, provide a sanctuary for the burial ground ofvenerable peoples, or protect from contamination a place where rituals can beperformed; some derive their sacred character from the springs of water theyprotect, from the medicinal and ritual properties of their plants, or from the wildanimals they support. 44Such sacred groves are common throughout southern and south eastern Asia, Africa, the Pacific islands and Latin America.55If sacred groves are extremely rich in biodiversity, they are generally limited in size. Bycontrast, the pastoral landscapes of mobile indigenous peoples offer examples oftraditional management systems of large dimensions and complexity. Co-management is an effective way to build upon what people already have, know and do to secure their identity, culture, livelihoods and the diversity of natural resources on which they depend. 66Neglecting this may engender human and environmental disasters of large proportions (see Box 9.3). 4Chandrakanth and Romm, Bassi, 2002) The whole ethnic territory of the Borana, in Ethiopia, can be considered a community (ethnic) con- served area. The territory has been managed for centuries through rules that assured the sustainable useof renewable natural resource. Some specific provisions embedded in culture assured bio-diversity con-servation per se and the sound management of natural resources was promoted through norms of inclu- sion/ exclusion designed for all pastoral activities and known as seera marraa bisanii --\"the law of grass and water\". The Borana \"law of grass\" shares the basic principles of most East African pastoral groups.It differentiates between dry season pastures (with permanent water points) and wet season pastures(with good grass, but only accessible during rains), imposing the maximisation of use of wet-season pas-ture whenever possible (during rains), to minimise pressure on the most intensely utilised rangelandsserved by permanent water points. The \"law of water\" is instead peculiar to the Borana and their envi-ronment, which is characterised by the presence of numerous well complexes (the tulaa wells being the most famous among them). This law is extremely articulated, regulating in various ways the social andeconomic investment necessary to develop traditional wells and water points, access and maintenance.Through the normal cycle of well excavation and collapse, over-exploited dry season areas are aban-doned and new ones are developed. The juniper forests found in Borana lands have a special role, which is common to many East African forests used by pastoralists. Being too humid, they are not suitable for permanent pastoral settlement.Some open patches, however, contain excellent pasture and the forest also provides permanent springs.For centuries such forests have never been permanently inhabited but reserved as dry-season pasture.They had a crucial function as last refuge for grazing in case of drought, reserve for medical and ritualplants and overall symbolic and ecological meaning. They were not subject to special managementprovisions besides the very strict prohibition to start fires inside them, but were an integral and essentialpart of the survival system of the Borana. The environmentally sound management of natural resources in Borana land assured the conservation of a unique biodiversity patrimony (including 43 species of wild mammals, 283 species of birds andmany unique plants and habitats) until the 1970s, despite the establishment of some small towns closeto the main forests already at the beginning of the 20th Century. From the 1970s onwards, however, theBorana environment was confronted with major changes in land use. The government limited move-ment within the ethnic territory and promoted agriculture, facts that deeply affected the Borana naturalresource management system. The situation dramatically collapsed after the change of government in1991. Political representation of the Borana within the local government became utterly marginal andpolicies that could only be described as \"actively destructive\" of their livelihoods were implemented.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) facilitated the resettlement of people inBoranaland who were not actually from the area (the great majority of them being neither Borana norOromo speaking), multiplying the number of permanent settlements in the region. The resettled villageswere assisted through international aid and agriculture was promoted as their livelihood strategy.Among the newcomers were also some non-Oromo pastoral groups that managed to manipulate inter-national aid and gained political support. They obtained large tracts of Eastern Borana territory, whichwere annexed to \"their\" region, including critical pastoral areas of the Borana. More land resourceswere lost by the Borana in the process of \"economic liberalisation\". Large ranches were acquired byinternational investors and extensive portions of land around the towns, located in their critical dry-sea-son pastures, were assigned to town dwellers for small-holding cultivation. The majority of the towndwellers are neither Borana nor Oromo. A high inflow of migrant Muslim Oromo was also allowed,and those undertook extensive farming, especially in the Liiban area. 300 SHARING POWERLEARNING from Farvar, 2003; see also Field example 1.3 in Chapter 1) The Kuhi\u2014 one of about 20 Sub-tribes of the Shish Bayli Tribe of the Qashqai nomadic pastoralists of Iran\u2014 are currently engaged in participatory action research about their own \"sustainable livelihoods\"and the conservation of biodiversity in their landscape. Their action-research refers to a resource man-agement unit comprising their summering and wintering grounds and their associated migration routesin between. As part of this, the Kuhi held several workshops and their first concern was to involve thewhole community. One of the major problems identified was the breakdown of the traditional organisa-tional strength of the tribes. They analysed their governance situation in some depth and decided to re-create their autonomous organisation, building upon traditional patters but ensuring that those wouldbe able to respond to modern challenges, including notions of participatory democracy. Extended nego-tiations led to the establishment of the \"Council for Sustainable Livelihoods of the Kuhi MigratoryPastoralists\" and its associated Community Investment Fund, which is now pursuing initiatives in eachof the 5 categories of problems/ needs identified by the Sub-tribe. Such initiatives include support toanimal raising, marketing and quality-control for highly priced gabbeh rugs produced by women, health care access, capturing of solar energy for various uses, access to legal support, and access toeducational books and videos. The initiative that excited them the most, however, is about restoringnatural resources to their common property care and control. A unique opportunity in this sense is the Chahar-Tang e Kushk-i Zar wetland, extending some 9 kilome-The local government has been acting as if common property land is no-man's land, to be assigned to whoever is claiming it. Indeed customary common property and community conserved areas are notcurrently recognised in Ethiopia. This process of land alienation has been affecting the most productivelands and the crucial ecosystem patches. The Borana have been squeezed into the driest pockets,bound to become overgrazed. Scarce rain during the last decade produced devastating effects andacute livestock destitution. The only possible survival strategy for the Borana has been to engage infarming in the remaining least suitable places, hoping for a harvest next year. Thus, the amount of landput under cultivation and alienated to the pastoral mode of production dramatically increased, as a sortof chain reaction. The patches of biodiversity in forests got exploited for a variety of commercial pur-poses, with no regard to sustainability. But, as everyone should have known, the traditional land of theBorana is not suitable for agriculture due to both low and irregular rainfall. Since 1998, the Borana andmillions of other pastoralists and agro-pastoralists survive in Ethiopia on the brink of starvation, oftenentirely dependent on food donations from abroad. Neglect and active tampering with traditionalresource management systems created a pattern of unsustainable livelihoods for an entire people andare effectively destroying most of the unique biodiversity harboured rooted in, and built upon, exist- ing customary and local organisations and rules. Local organisations are crucialfor the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. As Michael Cerneahas put it \"...resource degradation in the developing countries, while incorrectlyattributed to \"common property systems\", actually originates in the dissolution oflocal level institutional arrangements whose very purpose was to give rise toresource use patterns that were sustainable.\" 77. Local groups have a comparatively easier time enforcing rules and providing social incentives and penalties for theeffective conservation and use of natural resources. Successful initiatives run bylocal and/ or traditional institutions include watershed protection and reforesta-tion, wildlife management schemes, processing plants for natural products derivedfrom the wild, and many forms of community conserved areas. 88 7Cernea, 1993. 8Kothari 2003; Borrini-Feyerabend et 3.3; 3.10; 3.11; 9.4 and length, shared between the Kuhi and the Kolahli Sub-tribes. This has been a community con- served wetland from time immemorial. The Kuhi know all too well that they obtain many \"ecosystembenefits\" from this wetland, including water reserves, reeds for handicrafts, fodder for animals, fish,medicinal plants, micro-climate control, and wildlife. In a controversial plan, the government had ear-marked part of the area to be divided up among households for agricultural use and had diverted partof the water of the wetland for irrigation. The newly constituted Council, on the other hand, believes itis better to preserve this area as a \" qorukh \" or \" hema \"\u2014 to be conserved by the community. It thus sub- mitted a petition to the relevant governmental authorities to formally declare the wetland and the sur-rounding rangelands as a Community Conserved Area (CCA), with use rights being regulated by theSub-tribe elders. The petition is being reviewed by the government and it is hoped it will be acceptedunder a larger co-management accord by which the respective areas of authority and responsibility ofthe government and the community will be agreed to mutual satisfaction. In terms of IUCN categories,the overall CCA could be considered as a protected area of category V (landscape management objec-tive), with the wetland as a portion under category II (ecosystem management objective). The Councilof Elders has managed to register itself as a legal entity\u2014 a unique occurrence in Iran for an indigenoussocial organisation. Action recently taken by the Council includes a successful redressing of recentinvasions of its customary rangelands through court action. This initiative is showing important ways in which nomadic livelihoods can fully reconcile with conser- vation. The initiative is supported by the Centre for Sustainable Development (CENESTA, a nationalNGO in Iran), the Organisation for Nomadic Peoples Affairs (ONPA, a government institution), theInternational Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), IUCN/ CEESP's Working Group onSustainable Livelihoods, FAO (interested, among other things, in coping strategies of nomadic pastoral-ists in the face of drought), and WAMIP (World Alliance of Mobile Indigenous Peoples). The GEF(Global Environment Facility) implemented by UNDP has expressed interest in learning from the experi-ence of the project for policy advocacy, and the Christensen Fund said it will support its extension andreplication in other tribes and countries as a strategy for both conservation and cultural survival. Customary and traditional organisations have many points of strength. For exam-ple, they know more than anyone else how to identify the members of usergroups or community; how to assist in conflict management and administer sanc-tions for rule infringement at the local level; and how to develop rules forresource management based on local knowledge of ecological dynamics. 99In an age of increasing globalisation, however, their political standing is often in peril.Conservationists should seriously consider ways to legitimise and strengthen suchorganisations, as managing natural resources requires the capacity to develop andenforce appropriate rules in the local context. As discussed in Chapter 1 of thisvolume, successful co-management organisations often combine formal arrange-ments, which may be initiated and supported by the state or other external agents,side by side with other arrangements of older, agreement foresees the establishment of an advisory or management body, such as a local conservation council or an extended natural resource manage-ment board, specifications of who is to be represented, what is the mandate, whatare the tasks, etc. should be reached in the planning phases. It is important, how-ever, that a body entrusted with specific tasks is set up towards the end and not atthe very beginning of the process of developing the agreement. In fact, al. , 2004) In the mid-nineties, the IUCN assisted in the development of a co-management setting for Conkouati National Park, in the Republic of Congo\u2014 a \"difficult\" and conflict-ridden site where other agencieshad refused to work. Indeed, an enormous amount of energy had to be invested in social communica-tion processes before the project could even properly start. Through time, however, the communicationefforts generated some timidly positive perceptions of the social actors with respect to one another. Thiseventually developed into a concrete dialogue, and the park managers and local residents started envis-aging that they could become \"partners\", they could work together for mutually beneficial initiatives. The facilitation process focused on the local natural patrimony of Conkouati, and promoted negotia- tions on the basis of the common interests to maintain it for everyone's benefit. The parties figured outthat they were obliged to find solutions together\u2014 not as police and robbers but as social actors sharingan interest to maintain the abundance of natural resources in the area. At the beginning, their proposalswere widely different, but the project staff brought everyone to discuss the pros and cons of each per-spective and managed to obtain an agreement around a charter of principles, progressively refined andaccepted by all. It was only after this that a co-management organisation, the Comit\u00e9 de Gestion des Ressources Naturelles de Conkouati (COGEREN) was formally established, and took on the task of refining the charter further, establishing a zoning system and developing a number of specific accordsfor the three local most endangered species (manatees, marine turtles and bamboos). COGERENincludes representatives of the local communities, the state administration, the NGOs locally active inenvironment and development issues and some locally elected officials. The legitimisation of the organ-isation actually took place with the signing of an official Co-management Charter by the national andlocal government authorities, which was accompanied by rituals through which the local traditionalauthorities also engaged themselves publicly.through dialogue and negotiation that the most useful information and appropriateguiding principles are often discovered. For instance, it was through a few yearsof discussion of issues and policy development among the key relevant partiesthat the sophisticated and effective structure now in charge of the GalapagosMarine Reserve was designed and developed in practice (see Box 6.13). Similarly,in the Republic of Congo, the Conkouati management board could be envisagedonly after a lengthy process of discussion and negotiation had started bearingfruits (see Box 9.5). 10Wild and Mutebi, 1996. 11The name \"Forest Society\" derives from the first one that was set up, called Ekibiina Kya'beihamba-Omuruka gwa Mpungu to ascertain that any collaborative management body is created at the appropriate level, i.e., that it gathers representatives of stakeholders who canput into practice the agreement that has been developed. For instance, a manage-ment board at the level of the district may not be appropriate if the resources tobe managed affect only one or two specific communities and businesses. It maybe more useful to create instead an ad-hoc committee with direct representationof the social groups most directly affected. In other occasions, umbrella bodiesmay be needed to facilitate coordination between local resource users and rele-vant government departments. In Uganda, one such organisation links the 22\"Forest Societies\" established in each of the 22 parishes bordering BwindiNational Park. 1100Each one of the societies,1111however, is autonomously organised have been identi- fied on the basis of field experience. Some were drawn in the context of particularsectors but they are reasonably valid for other areas of natural resource co-man-agement, in different ecological and economic settings. These characteristicsinclude: Manageable ssize There is a greater chance of success (and an easier ride) with a single-tenure area of moderate size and a relatively limited number of management issues and par-ties to the agreement. If the area is large, the issues are complex and interlockingand many actors are involved, progress may be exceedingly slow, and frustrationsand setbacks may set in. The more complex the situation, the greater the need forsupport from government or well-organised federations of actors. A non-support-ive government bureaucracy is a very substantial handicap. 1122 Diverse aand ccommmmitttted mmemmbership oof tthe mmanagemmentt bbodyy The diversity of members in the management body is a precious asset for learning by doing. Through dialogue and deliberation, resource users, government staff,planners, local authorities, business people and scientists can identify problemsand questions, explore alternatives and adjust decisions and actions, as necessary.Ideally the membership of the co-management body would include representa-tives from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds, connected with a range ofcommunity sectors and well conscious of the duties and functions of governingbodies, and their responsibilities as members. They should also be prepared, ulti- mately, to set aside their personal and sectoral inter-ests and make decisions in the best interests of all par-ties and the environment. The most effective membersof co-management bodies are usually \"fearless\", butalso strategic. If necessary, they stand up to individu-als and institutions accustomed to exercising power(senior public servants and politicians, for example),but are also capable of exercising good judgementabout which battles are winnable and what to doabout those that are not. The members of the co-management body need to elect a good chairperson, capable of welding thegroup into a united team with a clear vision. And theCM body should be adequately resourced. Peoplework better, and are more respected by their commu-nity, if they are seen to be valued and compensated.High fees or salaries, however, tend to attract criti-cism, especially in rural communities. To prevent this,the members of the CM bodies should be chosen in amost transparent way. Membership should balancethe need to represent all key sectors and geographicalareas (and sometimes ethnic groups) adequatelyagainst the need to keep numbers small enough forefficient functioning. 12Ghai and Vivian, reporting in co-management bodies should be clear, and staff should not have multiple masters. A fearless decision-making body prepared to do battlewith government can place a government-employed chief executive in an impos-sible position by ordering her or him to carry out provocative or confrontationalinitiatives. At worst, this can paralyse the organisation and alienate the communi-ty. The government-preferred model, of having the chief executive as the chair ofthe board (and/ or the board dominated by government officers) may avoid theproblem of conflicting reporting lines, but is rarely accepted by the community asa model of true participatory management. The co-management governing bodyand the chief executive should understand the dividing line between governanceand management, and respect it. Ideally, however, the governing body shouldstrongly back its chief executive and should thus be involved in choosing him orher. Accounttable pprocedures Good co-management organisations should be accountable to all its members. In most circumstances, however, they are requested to be accountable only to thegovernment of the relevant countries. Often, in fact, a co-management body islegally answerable to a ministerial department, which may also fund it, partiallyor totally. This may represent a moral tightrope for such organisations, and thoseinvolved must be prepared to walk it and remain accountable to both the govern-ment and the other partners in the agreement, including the local communities. Inparticular, the organisation's budget, policies, decisions and decision-makingprocess should be open to public scrutiny, i.e., they should be accessible and transparent. A CM organisation is generally set up with the ultimate objectives of managing natural resources. Accountability should be mostly related to this goal, althoughsome members\u2014 and communities in particular\u2014 may be trying to hold itaccountable for aspirations beyond its charter. For instance, an organisation set upto protect the natural heritage values of an area is not primarily responsible for theeconomic welfare of the surrounding communities. While both ends can often bejointly served, the CM body may sometimes be obliged to make decisions that arenot primarily for economic advancement, or even contrary to it. If such a decisioncauses community distress, it is up to all the concerned parties to weigh all factorsand make a final decision in the best interests of the community as a whole, notto the CM body to compromise its agreed responsibilities. Alternatively, anotherco-management structure with a more comprehensive mandate may be set up tofocus on both conservation and livelihoods in the same context. Open dialogue with a broad range of interest groups should be provided whenev- er possible. The CM body needs to inform the wider community about what it isdoing by whatever means best suit local circumstances\u2014 newsletters, broadcasts,visits, public meetings, workshops, etc. The CM body also needs to listen hard,and have both formal and informal means of feeding public opinion back into itsoperations. Community meetings and attitude surveys carried out at regular inter-vals can be invaluable to focus community relations and mutual learning efforts,as well as to generally target weak areas of operation. Indigenous peoples,nomadic peoples and local communities\u2014 including their weaker, discriminatedgroups\u2014 should be actively informed and encouraged to have a say.306 SHARING POWERBox 9.6 BBuuiilldd oonn ssmmaallll ssuucccceesssseess (adapted from EPA, 1997) Small successes fuel future, larger ones. It is important, according to watershed practitioners, to start small and demonstrate success before working on a larger scale. For this reason, demonstration projectsare often a popular choice in watershed work. In some states, small victories have been instrumental inprompting the implementation of a state-wide watershed approach. One of the first agreed actions inthe Upper Arkansas Watershed Council (Colorado, USA) was a Citizen's Water Law Seminar. In theWest, the Prior Appropriation law\u2014 based on the idea that water can be privately owned\u2014 hasevolved into a complex and often mystifying tangle of rules. Additionally, water quality, in-stream flows,and recreation issues had complicated the understanding of water law. Many of the local community leaders (county commissioners, planning and zoning boards, etc.), sever- al of whom are new to Colorado, admitted to little understanding of the law, yet recognized its impor-tance in their work. The council agreed that it did not matter which side of a water issue anyone repre-sents\u2014 agriculture, development, environmental, recreation\u2014 the law is the law, and the more citizenswho understand the water law, the better. In brief, the seminar was held and was a wonderful success.It was planned in three months, was low-budget, gave the council strong local credibility, and providedan early success upon which to tackle tougher issues. Commitment to the watershed is key, and a smallgroup's passion for its improvement can catch fire. Practitioners also say over and over that it's impor-tant to the natural resources and the accords that comple- ment it as part of the same agreement need to be implemented as soon as possi-ble after the public celebration of the conclusion of negotiations. The organisa-tions and rules agreed upon by all relevant actors also need to be set up andenforced in a timely manner. This allows the partners to capitalise on the momen-tum of the negotiation phase. A committee and/ or specific individual should bein charge and be made accountable for each component of the strategy, co-man-agement plan or main activity, reporting to the relevant actors (and/ or to theorganisations set in place by them) on the on-going progress. Compliance with theagreements and rules is essential to the effectiveness of the whole CM process. Ifsome actors disobey the rules or do not accomplish what they agreed to do, oth-ers are soon likely to follow suit. To prevent this, the co-management agreementsneed to specify who is responsible for enforcement, as well as by what means andwhat regular checks they are to be carried out. Indeed the entitlements andresponsibilities of relevant actors need to be clear for all the parties involved. In this sense, accountability is crucial\u2014 the people who took on responsibilities need to publicly respond about them. And yet, it is also important that the processis not entrapped in some rigid and bureaucratic enforcement system. Co-manage-ment feeds on the passion and creativity of the groups and individuals involved,and on their ability to manage human relations in informal and convivial man-ners. 1133Flexibility and good human relations may go a long way in solving even complex and thorny controversies. Celebrating small successes along the way canbe an effective way of keeping actors together and maintaining a constructivegroup dynamic (see Box 9.6).LEARNING BY Mutebi, 1996) In 1992, the staff of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and the representatives of the residents of the civil parishes adjoining the park began a process of planning and evaluating resource use. The mainoutput of the parish workshops, follow up work and participatory research were memoranda of under-standing between the communities and the park authorities, which documented decisions taken in themeetings as \"multiple use plans\". These were not legally binding documents, but set out the intent andresponsibility of each party. The agreements, in Rukiga and English, were reviewed by each one of the Forest Societies established in the parishes. A ceremony was held in the occasion of the signing of the agreements by the parties.The Director of Uganda National Parks and several park rangers were present, along with members ofthe Forest Societies such as community leaders, nominated resource users, women representatives,local chiefs and religious leaders. Harvesting forest resources under these agreements began at Bwindi Impenetrable in late 1994 and involved at first only three of the twenty-two parishes bordering the park. To spread interest and compli-ance about the agreements, a new cadre of Community Conservation Rangers was established by thepark to improve communication and discuss the agreements with each community leadership institu-tion, resource users ( e.g., herbalists, basket makers, beekeepers) and interested community members. Publicising the agreement in this way proved not only key to making it functional but was also essentialfor extending similar agreements to other parishes. Negotiating the memoranda of understanding initial-ly took 15-20 days per parish, spread over a period of 6 to 10 months. The negotiation process for theremaining 17 parishes, however, ( e.g., a consensus over a management plan and an agreed sharing of rights and responsibilities) is reached, it should not be written in stone,but it should certainly be written on paper and publicised as widely as possiblewithin the relevant communities and among the relevant stakeholders. The agree-ment should be explained in plain terms (clear and comprehensible to all) and inthe local language(s), or alsoin the local language(s) when government officials tend to speak only a national language. If appropriate and feasible, oral and infor-mal forms of communication, including popular theatre, use of audio-visual mate-rials, presentations at traditional gatherings and other media, can be used as veryeffective complements. The importance of the agreement should be underlined by means of a specific event or ceremony. As far as possible, the signatories should be people directlytaking on management responsibilities ( e.g., the local village chief and the local park warden) and notrelatively unconcerned and distant authorities. The parties should commit themselves in public and the agreement should be given ample vis-ibility ( e.g., a copy of the agreement could be posted in local communities as well as in the premises of the agency in charge of managing the natural resources).Special steps such as the ones taken in Bwindi National Park may be needed towidely publicise and scale up the participatory management agreement (see Box9.7). It should be clear that adjustments to the their implementation, and review times should be scheduled in advance. Some forms of agreement, such as a memorandum of understanding, arequite flexible and allow for regular revisions. Other forms, such as contractsamong legally-recognised parties, are less so. The latter are usually required whenthe agreement foresees some important packages of economic or financial incen-tives for one or more parties in the agreement. The agreement can also be for-malised as a local by-law. It is useful that the agreement includes provisions fordealing with exceptional situations ( e.g., how to modify rights and responsibilities in case of acute ecological stress or social crisis).

For formal, contract-type agreements, contract lawand environmental public law should include procedures for dealing with con-flicts. In cases of conflicts between indigenous peoples and the state or other sec-tors of society, International Human Rights Law and some UN bodies can providesome guidance. 1144For the less formal agreements it is important to foresee in advance who will assist the parties to clarify entitlements and responsibilities andto mediate in the event of conflicts. The Canadian Royal Commission onAboriginal Peoples, for example, reports about a conflict over fish managementwhich led to First Nation representatives on a participatory management boardbeing outvoted and resigning. 1155In May 1994, a majority of the members of the Sturgeon Lake Co-management Committee in north-western Ontario voted to cre-ate a total sanctuary on all the valley spawning grounds. At the same time thecommittee, which included tourist outfitters and local hunters and anglers amongits members, accused the aboriginal people of damaging fish stocks and habitatand voted to review the legal status of all aboriginal fishing in sanctuaries. It wasat this point that the representatives of the local Saugeen First Nation resigned\u2014in protest\u2014 from the committee. Conflicts of interpretation during the implementation phase may be the inevitable result of a co-management process and may depend on the extent to which therelevant government agencies are committed to participatory management, aswell as on the political strengths of the relevant social actors. In this sense, theCanadian Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples has suggested that if govern-ment agencies are to be represented on co-management boards, they should sit astechnical advisors and be non-voting, especially where co-management is basedon notions of power-sharing. 1166In Australia, the Law Reform Commission recom- mended in 1986 to uphold the following as priorities for access to naturalresources: 1) conservation measures and other identifiable overriding interestssuch as safety, rights of innocent passage, shelter and safety at sea; 2) traditionalhunting and fishing; and 3) commercial and recreational hunting and fishing. Thecommission recommended that, as a matter of principle, traditional hunting andfishing by the Aboriginal People should take priority over non-traditional activi-ties, including commercial and recreational activities, where the traditional activi-ties are carried on for subsistence purposes. On the basis of this principle the pre-cise allocation of resources is now a matter for the appropriate licensing and man-agement authorities acting in consultation with the Aboriginal People and otheruser groups. 1177 14See Box 9.8 in this Chapter. See also Box 10.14 in Chapter 10. 15Canada Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996. 16Canada Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996. 17Law Reform Monitoring of compliance should be done on a regular basis and, in case of viola- tions of the agreement, enforcing mechanisms need to be applied. This is a 1996) International environmental and human rights law accord special recognition to the relationship between indigenous peoples and their customary territories. The UN Commission on Human Rights'Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, for example, adopted a general recommenda-tion concerning indigenous peoples in August 1997. The committee called on the states Parties to theInternational Covenant to: zrecognise and respect indigenous peoples' distinct cultures, languages and way of life as an enrich- ment of the state's cultural identity and to promote its preservation; zensure the absence of all forms of discrimination; zprovide indigenous peoples with conditions allowing for a sustainable economic and social develop- ment compatible with their cultural characteristics; zensure that indigenous people have equal rights to participate in public life and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent; zensure that indigenous communities can exercise their rights to practice and revitalise their cultural traditions and customs and to preserve and practice their languages; zrecognise and protect customary territories and resources, and either return them or compensate for their loss, if indigenous peoples have been dispossessed of those territories. The UN-adopted International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights has also been called on to elabo- rate the international human rights standards concerning indigenous peoples and the environment.Article 27 of the Covenant has often provided a basis for communications to the Human RightsCommittee about states' violations of rights. Article 27 provides that members of ethnic, religious or lin-guistic minorities shall not be denied the right to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise theirown religion, or to use their own language in community with other members of their group. The committee has agreed that the exercise of the cultural rights protected under Article 27 may mani- fest itself in many ways, including a particular way of life associated with the use of lands andresources, especially for indigenous peoples. The enjoyment of those rights require positive legal meas-ures of protection and measures to ensure the effective participation of members of minority communi-ties in decisions that affect them. In the Kitok versus Sweden case, the Human Rights Committee found that although the regulation of an economic activity is usually an internal state matter, where that activi-ty is an essential element in the culture of an ethnic community, it may be protected by Article 27. Butindividual rights to culture also need to be assessed in the context of the community's rights, and rea-sonable and objective restrictions on individual rights so as to preserve community rights may be foundto be legitimate. The committee has expressed the view that the right to enjoy culture needs to be assessed in context, and need not be confined to traditional practices. The use of modern technology, for example, does notdeny a given practice the status of continuing traditional culture. It has also suggested that economicactivities that have only a limited impact on cultural rights, and which were engaged-in after consulta-tions, may also not violate Article 27.310 SHARING POWERaspect for a co-management agreement to remain effective: if some parties can go by without complying to the rules, others are likely to follow suit. \"Who enforces\"is also very important. It is usually government that has the power and legitimacyto ensure compliance through coercive enforcement. And yet, effective enforce-ment mechanisms can also be organised and implemented by local communitiesand organised groups (see some examples in Boxes 9.9, 9.10 and 9.11), at leastwhen the delinquent forces are not overpowering. 1188Enforcing rules, however, is always a delicate task. The natural resource management scheme may involvehigh stakes for parties that are in the best position to apprehend violations buthave no legal basis to do so. If local residents take the enforcement completely\"into their hands\", for instance if they attempt to arrest people who came to cuttimber or shoot wildlife, they risk becoming involved in violent clashes and facinglegal prosecution the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh forest protection committees have developed different types of local rules as indicated by the following remarks of villagers: \"It was resolved by the committees that allthose areas where the trees are marked with red paints along the boundary are closed for grazing andhence all of us unanimously resolve not to take our cattle for grazing in these areas, nor allow the vil-lagers of other villages to do so. We shall keep our cattle at home and all cases of violation would bereported to the forest officer.\" For the protection of trees \"it was unanimously resolved that we shall not girdle any tree nor allow oth- ers to do so. We shall have some strict watch over illegal cutting of trees.\" For goats \"it 1991) A community marine resource management programme was initiated in 1984 in fishing communities of the Visayas islands of the Philippines. The co-management programme was designed to promote con-servation and sustainable use of coral reefs and associated fisheries through community based efforts tostop over-fishing and destructive fishing techniques using dynamite and cyanide. Local fishers helped design and implement the reserve and sanctuary systems at all levels. Working with community organisers, they earmarked the portions of the reef to be governed as a reserve, or morestrictly protected sanctuaries, and they physically laid the marker buoys themselves. Local communitiesalso formulated regulations prohibiting fishing, the anchoring of motorised boats, and the collection ofgiant clams within sanctuaries. Within the larger and less restrictive reserve areas, they prohibited dyna-mite fishing and the use of small mesh gear. These guidelines were subsequently recognised by the gov-ernment. Enforcement of the sanctuary rules is also carried out by the communities. Young local men formed groups known as Guardians of the Sea to confront and chase away violators (local and outsiders),sometimes with the help of the Philippine police forces. The Guardians of the Sea also initiate publichearings for local perpetrators who are tried and punished according to an indigenous system of publicjustice. 18Unfortunately in several cases the delinquent people\u2014 poachers and illegal fisherfolk who vie for the international market\u2014 can afford vehicles, fuel and weapons out of reach for the local communities and resource users. If the resources are available, however, the local enforcing crews can greatly profit from technology such as binoculars with electronic cameras, radio transmitters, and the like (Will Maheia, personal communication, It is rare that the management plans and complementary accords are perfect in the form in which they were first agreed and do not require adjustments along theway. In view of this, the partnership should start with a basic agreement, but alsoforesee some reviews at specific times during implementation, to develop andadjust the details. As a matter of fact, the adaptive management approach impliesthat much of the learning takes place during the implementation phase. Evenwhen the initial plans are very well thought out, there is a need to review them asthey are implemented in practice. Too often, organisations wait until there is a cri-sis to undertake reviews, but monitoring, evaluation and adaptation are moreeffective when they are part of the normal life of organisations and institutions. Inthis way, \"crises\" are replaced by 1999) In the Khong region of Laos, it is generally up to the village headmen to assure that fishing regulations are respected by all (see also Boxes 3.11, 5.11 and 6.11). Most communities rely on a mixed strategythat includes enforcement of regulations and awareness raising, which are both important, especially atinitial stages of implementation. The pattern has been that villages hand out a few warnings and fines inthe first year in which they implement the new regulation, and in so doing they let everybody knowthat the village is serious about it. By the second year, they find that much less regulation enforcementis required. By then, locals are familiar with the regulations, and have come to clearly understand whythey have been adopted. When necessary, villagers are effective enforcers of regulations. They are also pragmatic people. Seeing is believing, and they tend to feel more positive about co-management regulations if they begin to seepositive results. Fortunately, increases in fish stocks and catches often occur after even just a year ofimplementation of regulations. There appears to be an association between villages that have done anoutstanding job with implementing their plans, and relatively remote villages with a high level of com-munity spirit and solidarity. In other words, solidarity at the village level indirectly benefits community-based natural resource management. When solidarity increases as a result of co-management, there arealso other spin-off benefits in terms of community development. Another important factor linked to thesuccess of the co-management system in Khong relates to the good working relationships with districtauthorities.all those villagers who are having goats with them must sell them within a period of 3 days, otherwiseaction will be taken.\" As for firewood, \"no villager would carry the fuel wood head load for sale out-side the village. The defaulters will be charged 51 Rupees per head load.\" In some cases, social fines have been imposed not only on villagers but also on forest guards, and in others, communities have taken action on social issues, punishing for anti-social drinking and abuse. InMadhya Pradesh, the benefits have included improvements in fuelwood, grass and crop yields; reducedpoaching of elephants and other animals; changed relations between forest officials and local people;and the creation of democratic local organisations. 312 SHARING POWERMonitoring and reviews should be inclusive of multiple perspectives and as par- ticipatory as possible. The relevant parties may learn by gathering the data speci-fied in the follow-up protocol (see Chapter 6) but also other information, not evenmentioned there. Such data and information should be documented andanalysed, to understand in detail the factors that have an impact on the naturalresources and resident communities. And this should be done in the sense of bothpositive and negative impacts and influences or benefits accruing to them. Thesefactors should be brought to the attention of the responsible CM organisations inthe monitoring, evaluation and review meetings. Throughout implementation, meetings should be held to evaluate the results and impacts of the co-management agreements. If the activities and the financial andhuman commitments are substantial, the evaluation should be both internal (car-ried out by the key relevant actors) and external (carried out by independentexperts), and the results of those evaluations should be compared and analysedtogether. Various participatory methods can be used to support both the internaland external evaluations, including methods already familiar to the actors whoparticipated in the other phases of the CM process. In the evaluation exercises, the evaluators assess whether the co-management agreements succeeded in progressing towards the short-term environmental andsocial objectives the parties agreed upon as well as the longer-term vision andgoals subscribed by all of them. For this, they use result and impact indicators.Examples of result indicator are the existence of a zoning plan subscribed by allparties (if one of the objectives was to set up such a plan) and the number ofinfractions to the plan identified in one year of operations. Environmental impactindicators may be the viable presence of a species within a defined territory, orthe trend of the water level in a village's well. Social impact indicators mayinclude the nutritional status of children in the local communities, the engage-ment of women and minorities in decision-making about NRM, the improvementin average household income or the change (increase or decrease) in local con-flicts over natural resources. The evaluators examine these indicators and alsowhether the hypotheses and assumptions on which the agreement was designedremain correct or whether the context conditions have changed. The evaluators may also assess whether the process that developedthe agreement has been appropriateand is still on the right track. For this,they need to use process indicators.An example of a process indicator isthe fairness of negotiation, whichmay be measured by some objectiveinformation (were all the partiesinformed on time? Treated with dig-nity? Asked to present their views?Listened to carefully?), but also bythe perception of participants.Interestingly, some process indicatorsare also indicators of social impact.For instance, the process may suc-ceed in informing 313NRM some parties that were not involved before. This is a process result that, in itself, also constitutes a positive social impact. On the basis of discussions of process, results and impacts, the parties decide whether the co-management agreements have to be modified and, if so, whatmodifications are needed and who should carry them out. If necessary, theprocess reverts to a phase of negotiation\u2014 although generally at a faster pacethan the first time (see Figure 4.2 in Chapter 4). It is also useful to have an emer-gency plan for situations in which fast intervention is needed. A co-management setting can thus be monitored and evaluated with respect to its own process (how did it develop? How is it run?), the expected results of thatprocess ( e.g., emergence of new organised parties, CM agreements, a co-manage- ment body) and the impacts of such results. This is far from a simple matter,requiring the use of both quantitative and qualitative tools, participatory methodsand often also the presence of external evaluators. It is neither simple nor immedi-ate to maintain a clear distinction between the co-management process and itsresults, and the consequences (impacts) of such results. The complexity anddemanding nature of the task may be responsible for the frequently inadequateunderstanding of co-management as a whole. In the rare cases in which co-man-agement settings are evaluated, in fact, this is done by external professionals whotend to concentrate on short term results and involve the local organisations onlyas informants (see Box 9.12). A more balanced picture could be obtained byinvestigating process, results and impacts, as well as the links among them, withthe active involvement of all parties that played an active role in the process itself.If an \"independent\" perspective is also required, the results thus generated couldbe compared and combined with those of an external has been given to regular monitoring of participatory management initiatives, includ- ing in efforts that appear to be the most promising or successful. Only in the 1990s did some donorsbegin to insist on such processes. For instance, the Biodiversity Conservation Network, involved in vari-ous biodiversity-based enterprises in South and South-east Asia, began at that time to integrate detailedmonitoring procedures. 2200In Nepal, it conducted some baseline research in the buffer zones of Chitwan and Bardia National Parks, where the Parks and People Project was being launched. Subsequent moni-toring showed that there had been an increase in some wildlife populations, including the rhinocerosand the tiger. Under this project, the protected area warden was supposed to carry out monitoring withthe help of staff, and submit monthly reports to the Department of National Parks and WildlifeConservation. An independent assessment of the project, however, later stated that monitoring and eval-uation had been rather weak. 2211 Even where monitoring has been happening, it has rarely been participatory, with outsiders usually con- ducting it. For instance, the World Bank's main monitoring mechanism of the projects it funds are \"mis-sions\" that primarily involve expert consultants and its own staff. Rarely are the affected or beneficiarypopulations involved except as respondents. Classical donor practice has been to fly in foreign experts, or hire expensive national consultants. 2222In 19An example of a participatory evaluation of a co-management setting that produced an external report but also prompted the begi nning of an on-going local evaluation process is described in Box 9.18 later in this Chapter. 20Bhatt, 1997) Over 200,000 residents of Lane County, Oregon, depend on the McKenzie River watershed for their drinking water. They also use the river for fishing, rafting, and other recreational activities. Agriculturaland other industrial users rely on the river to supply them with large amounts of high quality water fortheir operations. Economic development in the McKenzie watershed and other types of pressures havein recent years threatened the capacity of the river to sustain the quality of its water. A partnership of two local governments led to the creation of the McKenzie Watershed Council. Lane County and the Eugene Water & Electric Board acted as conveners to organise, seek start-up funds, andprovide early support and direction. The council's mission statement reads: \"To foster better stewardshipof the McKenzie river watershed resources, deal with issues in advance of resource degradation andensure sustainable health, functions, and uses.\" The 20-member council was formed in 1993 and ismade up of private citizens, public interest groups, locally elected officials, representatives of state gov-ernment, as well as representatives of the Bureau of Land Management, Army Corps of Engineers, andthe U.S. Forest Service. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provided start-up funds and theBPA (Bonneville Power Administration) and other bodies contributed funds for completing the actionplans and public outreach. The council adopted a work programme that focused on four topics: water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and human habitat. It adopted action plans for all four topics and implemented sev-eral of the prescribed actions, beginning with three key programmes: watershed-wide water qualitymonitoring, citizen water quality monitoring, and restoration and enhancement projects.

Other funding comes from council's partners Eugene Water & Electric Board, ArmyCorps of Engineers, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Forest Service.

A partnership with RARE (Resource Assistance to Rural Environments, part of the President's Americorps Programme) has been critical to the success of the McKenzieWatershed Council's Citizen Monitoring Programme. This volunteer programme engages studentssome cases, however, this is beginning to change. In Pakistan, under a project entitled \"MaintainingBiodiversity with Rural Community Development\", promoted by the Aga Khan Rural SupportProgramme and IUCN, villagers have been trained to carry out wildlife surveys and monitoring exercis-es, and are now conducting yearly evaluations of the conservation and development plans they haveelaborated. 2233 23See http://srdis.ciesin.org/cases/Pakistan-Paper.html and http://www.iucn.org/places/pakistan/macp.htmRegular monitoring and evaluation of both the process and results of the co-man- agement initiatives is needed to assess and fill gaps in design and implementation,and to gauge whether progress is being made and is likely to remain sustainable.For both, essential ingredients are baseline data and adequate resources to sustainthe collection and analysis of information through time (see Box 9.13).LEARNING BY NRM unit(s) to be managed, identified on the basis of ecological and social considerations; zavailable lists of relevant parties to include in negotiation, and preliminary analysis of their respective entitlements, claims and power differentials and of the NRM conflicts, both existing and potential, among them; zinformation and tools ( e.g., maps) on the main ecological and social issues at stake in the identified NRM unit(s) gathered and made available to all parties; zunderstanding of the key political and social factors and institutions that determine resource access and use; za \"name\" and a description of the co-management process that are culturally valid and broadly understood and accepted in the context at stake; zsocial communication initiatives that opened and maintain two-way communication channels between the Start-up Team and the relevant actors, and foster a broad discussion of NRM issues in society; zthe parties reasonably well-informed, organised ( e.g., they have identified their own representatives and key interests at stake in the management of natural resources) and willing to negotiate a co-man- agement agreement; zenhanced local confidence of the parties in being able to manage natural resources; zsocial emergence of previously unorganised or marginalised groups.throughout the watershed in the evaluation and monitoring of water quality parameters, and has been avery effective outreach tool. Starting with a grant from the state in 1995, the programme now involvesover 200 students from six schools, who monitor five sites on a weekly basis. RARE workers have beeninvolved from the beginning\u2014 from designing the pilot programme to training students and workingwith them on a weekly basis to do the sampling over the last two years. 24See Chapter 4 and Figure 4.2 in particular.Monitoring should be carried out at an appropriate frequency and the measured data and collected information should be made accessible to the relevant actorsand the general public. The indicators should be identified on a case-by-casebasis, although some examples of indicators for the different phases of a co-man-agement process 2244may provide useful ideas. Some such examples are noted below. AAsssseessssiinngg tthhee pprreeppaarraattoorryy pphhaassee The preparatory phase is the foundation of the co-management process and the interested actors (in particular the initiators, supporters and members of the Start-up Team) should assess whether its key expected results\u2014 which may alreadyinclude some positive social impact\u2014 have been achieved. Checklist 9.1 includesindicators that may be useful to assess the preparatory phase. AAsssseessssiinngg tthhee nneeggoottiiaattiioonn pphhaassee The negotiation phase is the heart of the process and its effectiveness and fairness set out a standard to be expected and observed by all parties. Examples of 316 SHARING POWERindicators to assess the negotiation phase, which may again already include some social impact indicators, are listed in Checklist relevant actors about the CM process itself; zexistence of mechanisms for exchange and dissemination of NRM information as well as regular meetings to debate and negotiate co-management agreements; zuse of informal media and means, in order to involve and consult those who are unwilling or unable to participate in formal processes such as meetings and workshops; zactors' ease and fairness of access to communication and negotiation meetings (can all the parties attend the meetings? Are some actors discriminated against?); zavailability of competent facilitators to assist during meetings, mediate conflicts and help relevant actors to communicate among themselves and effectively negotiate agreements; zactive participation of the relevant actors in the development of a common vision and the negotiation of co-management agreements (presence at meetings, effective expression and arguing about their own interests and concerns, willingness to assume responsibilities, etc.); zexistence of a broad common vision among all parties about the desired future of the territory and resources to be managed; zeffectiveness and fairness of the negotiation process as perceived by the relevant parties; zexistence of co-management agreements (either oral or written, formal or informal) providing the par- ties with a clear understanding of their respective NRM functions, entitlements and responsibilities; zexistence of a clear plan and set of procedures for the monitoring and evaluation of the agreement (follow-up plan); zexistence of CM organisations (with executive, advisory, decision making or mixed roles and with enough resources to carry out their required tasks) expressing a plurality of NRM entitlements in the context at stake; zquantity and quality of knowledge of the parties about the relevant CM actors; the agreed plans, the rules, the organisations and the roles they are expected to play; zimproved social relationships and trust among the parties participating in the negotiation. AAsssseessssiinngg tthhee iimmpplleemmeennttaattiioonn pphhaassee During the negotiation phase, follow-up protocols are usually prepared for the co- management agreements to be implemented, and individuals are identified toapply them. The protocols should make explicit the results and impacts eachactivity is expected to obtain and what indicators will be used to assess them.Thus, with respect to the preceding phases the indicators of interest are nowchanged. It is now time not only to asses the process of co-management and its immediate results , but also the results and impacts of the agreement it produced, translated into activities on the ground and rules followed by peoples. For this,indicators need to be agreed upon regarding the status and quality of the naturalresources in the NRM units and the socio-economic conditions the agreementshave specifically set out to influence. Such environmental and socio-economicindicators are unique for each agreement as they refer to its specific objectives.LEARNING BY carry out monitoring and evaluation initiatives; zavailability of competent personnel to clarify entitlements and responsibilities and mediate in the event of conflicts among the relevant actors during implementation of the plans and agreements; zadherence and compliance of the parties with their agreed entitlements and responsibilities; zperception of the parties that they are learning through the implementation process, and maintenance of a constructive attitude in solving problems; zsatisfaction of the parties about the way in which the co-management agreements and organisations are working; zfair distribution among the parties of the actual benefits and costs of the agreements; zdecrease in frequency and seriousness of conflicts among the parties now bound to the agreements; zlong-term commitment of the parties demonstrated by initiatives to promote political and policy changes that facilitate implementing the co-management agreements.The co-management process and on-going results, however, remains important and should keep being be monitored. Some such indicators, however, are poorlydistinguishable from result and impact indicators (see Checklist 9.3). While the co-management agreement is being implemented, the area in which itis enforced may grow in size ( e.g., when new communities wish to sign on to the same agreement) and/ or new actors ( e.g., a federation of village associations) arrive on the scene. In addition, the people having access to the natural resourcesgenerally develop a heightened sense of responsibility and legitimacy of their role.This encourages the parties to refine NRM rules and apply more efficient andcomplex technical solutions. In such cases the organisations in charge of naturalresource management may have to experiment\u2014 judiciously\u2014 with innovation.Judicious innovation, a key component of learning by doing, is facilitated by flexi-ble management plans and budgets. Expansion in application, appropriation,enhanced fitting of the context through complex rules and judicious innovationare all important signals that the agreement is being \"institutionalised\" in society.They can be considered as CM indicators for both process and impact. In order to learn by doing it is important to collect data and information, but even more so to maintain a constructive attitude. If mistakes are regarded as opportuni-ties for learning and if people are rewarded for identifying problems and promot-ing innovative solutions, learning-by-doing is strongly encouraged. On the otherhand, it is important that innovations, and in particular innovations regardingNRM rules that were agreed upon by all parties, are never introduced withoutproper analysis and authorisation. AAsssseessssiinngg tthhee ccoo-mmaannaaggeemmeenntt rreessuullttss Appropriate indicators allow the relevant actors to assess whether the manage- ment objectives have been achieved (what results were obtained) and the degree to which the cooperation of various parties contributed to such objective is the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. Another frequent aim is support to the livelihoods of local communitieswithout undermining ecological functions and biological diversity and with dueattention to empowering, and not disempowering, the communities themselves.Some basic recommendations around the choice of indicators for monitoring andevaluation purposes are collected in Checklist 9.4. Checklist 9.4 CChhaarraacctteerriissttiiccss ooff eeffffeeccttiivvee iinnddiiccaattoorrss For both assessing process and results of co-management it is important to select indicators that are: zsignificantt\u2014 i.e., reflect changes or aspects of importance at meaningful spatial and temporal scales; zsensittive, i.e.,change proportionately in response to actual changes in the condition or item being measured; zmmeasurable, i.e., capable of being recorded and analysed in quantitative or qualitative terms; zprecise, i.e.,measured in aatt llow ccostt, procedures and be cost-effec- tive in terms of data collection, analysis and interpretation; zpracttical, i.e.,it should be possible to measure them and analyse the measurement results in a timely fashion; zcommparable, i.e.,defined in a way that allows them to be compared to and combined with other indi- cators ( e.g., percent achievement of EPA, 1997) In the 1970s, it became increasingly obvious that the Chesapeake Bay was degraded. Bay grasses hadAppropriate and relevant indicators are not easily identified. Many of the difficul- ties in assessing co-management may actually stem from the scarce fitting and sig-nificance of the indicators selected to monitor its process and results. In the initialphases, indicators related to the capacity of the parties and institutions are appro-priate and should be studied in detail. This should include the performance oflocal organisations, the quality of the initial appraisals, the fairness of the negotia-tions, the knowledge, attitudes and skills of the parties and their respective contri-butions. Subsequently, during the management and implementation phase, theactual achievement of the management objectives should be investigated, as wellas their repercussions on local productivity, livelihood security and well being.While the agreements are consolidated and expanded, the ecological indicators toassess the trends in the status and health of the natural resources should keptbeing followed, but also equity, poverty reduction, income generation, diversifica-tion of livelihoods and lateral networking should be studied along. Finally whenthe agreements are scaled-up and external support is withdrawn, long term resultsand impacts such as local empowerment, performance of CM institutions, eco-nomic and ecological sustainability of the CM agreement, performance of externalsupport institutions and linkages developed between CM organisations and exter-nal parties could be studied. LEARNING Murwira, 1996) The impact of co-managed research and development programmes on soil and water conservation in southern Zimbabwe was assessed by participating farmers. Their evaluation highlights important featuresof successful approaches to implement and coordinate soil and water conservation activities. Old aapproach New aapproach ((participatory mmanagement) zforcible methods were (e.g., literate farmers); zintercropping was forbidden; zfailed to convincingly address Soil and Water Conservation (SWC); zwe were told to do things with- out questioning; zthe usefulness of conservation works was never explained; zno dialogue between farmers and extension agents;zeveryone to benefit as all are free to attend meetings now; there is dialogue; zprocess is well explained (teaching by example); zfarmers are the drivers now; zintercropping is encouraged to boost yields; zfarmers are being treated as partners and equals; zno discrimination against poor or rich, educated or uneducated; zwe are given a choice of options; zthey pay attention to us and find time to find solutions to farm- ers problems; zwe are being encouraged to try out new things;died back to a fraction of their historical coverage, large parts of the bay were devoid of oxygen, the water was murky, and some species of fish and shellfish had dramatically declined. By the early 1980s,a scientific consensus emerged that nutrients\u2014 both nitrogen and phosphorus\u2014 were the primary pol-lution problem, to which all the bay's 64,000 square mile watershed contributed. In 1983, the firstChesapeake Bay Agreement was signed expressing a vision of a regional approach \"to improve andprotect water quality and living resources of the Chesapeake Bay estuarine system.\" The partners in theagreement included the Governors of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, the district of Columbia,the Chesapeake Bay Commission (representing the legislative bodies of those states), and the UnitedStates' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 1987, the second Chesapeake Bay Agreement was signed, with a view to \"...achieving by the year 2000 at least a 40 percent reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the main stem of theChesapeake Bay. The strategy should be based on point source loads and on non-point loads in anaverage rainfall year.\" This objective is specific, quantified and can be allocated to particular politicaljurisdictions or river basins. It can be communicated to and understood by the general public, electedofficials and others, and progress towards it can be assessed by a very clear measurement: the percentnutrient reduction for each tributary to the bay. Generally, this was perceived as fair and flexible, aseach jurisdiction was free to develop its own strategy to meet that goal, based on local land uses, exist-ing programmes, and resources. The objective thus enjoyed the support of the leaders of the relevantstates and the EPA, as well as the broad support of local governments, the public, and an array of inter-est groups. Evaluations generally compare events and conditions before and after the co-man-agement setting was set up.

Checklist Pretty, 1995) The following checklist may be used to monitor and assess the social impact of a co-management process. Did co-management: zprovide a framework for cooperative action? zFacilitate and promote forums to develop effective compromises? zHelp organise people to generate and use their own knowledge and research to advocate their own rights? zMediate for more equitable access to resources? zHelp secure sustainability in natural resource management? zOrganise labour resources? zMobilise the local economic resources to effectively manage natural resources (credit, savings, mar- keting)? zAssist some groups to gain new access to productive resources? zProvide social infrastructure at the village level? zProvide a link between rural people and external agencies involved in R&D and natural resource management? zInfluence policy institutions that affect it in turn? zImprove access of rural populations to information? zImprove information flow from the local context to governments and NGOs? Importantly, the evaluations should allow for the identification of both expected outcomes (see Box 9.15) and unexpected outcomes (see Box 9.16) LEARNING BY DOING 321Box 9.16 WWaattcchhiinngg ffoorr uunniinntteennddeedd aanndd uunneexxppeecctteedd ccoonnsseeqquueenncceess...... (adapted from Gilmour and Fisher, 1991) Monitoring and evaluation of community forestry activities are frequently limited to \"measuring progress\", or checking \"project goal attainment\". Very little concern is placed on looking for \"unintend-ed\" or \"unanticipated\" consequences, such as accidentally making some segment of the populationpoorer... Further, attention is rarely placed on questioning the appropriateness of project goals them-selves. Given the great uncertainty about the social processes involved in community forestry, we sug-gest that it is vitally important to look for unintended consequences and to carry out fundamental evalu- ations of project goals and impacts in the light of analysis of the actual effects of project activities. Identifying and understanding \"unintended consequences\" requires emphasis on social, economic andpolitical processes by direct observation and analysis. Quantitative economic analysis is not, in and Mutebi, 1996) Five types of monitoring have been carried out in and with parishes that signed agreements with Uganda National Parks (UNP): 1.Monitoring iillegal aactivities. Park patrol records and data on community assistance in controlling ille- gal activity were used for monitoring purposes. Initial indications were positive. Over the first twoyears in which beekeeping was allowed within the park no fires broke out in the relevant areas. Priorto that, fires occurred each dry season. Information from rangers indicated that some beekeeperswere using the pretext of checking their hives to set snares. Park wardens held meetings with thebeekeeper societies, which warned and fined the responsible individuals. 2.Monitoring uutilised sspecies.Depending upon their vulnerability, utilised species were monitored at three levels: by the users themselves, by UNP and by the Institute of Tropical Forest Conservation ofMbarara University. 3.Monitoring ssecondary eecological iimpacts.Two secondary effects of utilisation were checked: the impact on species that depend on their direct use and the indirect impact because of the presence ofusers in the forest. The interactions between users and gorillas have been of most concern. 4.Monitoring uuser ppresence.User presence was recorded during each harvesting event and results were compared with tourist and ranger presence levels. 5.Monitoring ccommunity aattitudes. Park/ community relationships were monitored through \"ground relationship graphs\" that map changing attitudes between the community and forest managers overthe years and the reasons for those changes. This tool consistently recorded not only any deteriora-tion in relationships with increased attempts at law enforcement, but also improvements due to con-servation education, permissions to community institutions to judge park infringements, the expecta-tion of being allowed to use multiple resources, agricultural support, etc. WWhhoo eevvaalluuaatteess ssuucccceessss?? Besides \"what to measure\" at different moments in the co-management process and especially after the implementation of the co-management agreements, anoth-er important question is \"according to whom?\" Monitoring and evaluation of322 SHARING POWERDifferent indicators are likely to be utilised by women and men, poor and rich, young and old, long time residents and recent migrants. For instance, indicatorsused to evaluate the performance and impacts of co-management are likely to dif-fer according to the individual's degree of dependence on the natural resources. Awoman head of household may be impressed by being able to collect abundantthatching grass and gum Arabic from a protected area. A national policy makermay be guided by the number of elephants residing in the same area, or by thetrend in yearly collected tourist fees. The monitoring and evaluation phase in co-management needs to sensitively explore and build upon such different perspec-tives of what is relevant and important. Some professionals suggest combining at least three types of indicators in a single process: 2255 zindigenous or experiential indicators used by rural people and reflecting experi- ence-based changes in environmental or socio-economic conditions; these are site-specific and reflect the diverse needs and expectations of community mem- bers; ztechnical or scientific indicators that are universal , disciplinary and quantitative enough to allow for comparisons between locations and across iin KKagore ((Zimbabwe) stewardship of natural resourceszstrength of local institutions zmaintenance of natural resource flowszfrequency of village assemblies zrole of svikiro (traditional chief) in village assemblies zfruit and water harvests from specific sites respect for the land zeffectiveness of indigenous regulations zextent of vegetation coverznumber of water points protected zuse of local species in reforestation and surface afforested ecological enhancement zmaintenance of sacred sites zenforcement of indigenous regulationszquality of environment in the sacred sites zfrequency of standing of specific tree species e.g., Syzgium slope protection zextent of vegetation cover zextent of gully erosionzmaintenance of terraces by local residents zrehabilitation of specific sites in Kagoreissues, problems and progress on an ongoing basis is a management function that needs the support of all the partners that generated the co-management agree-ment. In this light, it is important to understand and include local criteria and cat-egories in the ongoing monitoring and evaluation. Indigenous systems offer manyquantitative, qualitative and process oriented indicators that can be effectivelyutilised (see Table 9.2). 25GTZ, 1997. 2001) The Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) has been under a co-management regime since 1999, when the new management plan ushered by the innovative Special Law for Galapagos entered into Wily, 1997) In Tanzania local communities were made responsible by government for the management of Duru- Haitemba and Mgori forests. Commenting on the characteristics of the successful co-management vil-lage institutions, the foresters described how and what they had gained in the process. They said that itliberated them from the exhaustion and failure of trying to protect miombo woodlands under pressure, with inadequate resources and in conflict with local communities. The local government foresters saidthat, for the first time in their long career, they were in a position to provide what they can best give\u2014technical advice. District forestry staff have been asked by villagers to advice on issues that they havenot been in a position to advise upon before, including mediating roles in disputes or problems whichthe actors themselves have found difficult to resolve, such as inter-village boundary disputes. The MgoriForest liaison officer frequently refers to the work of the CM institutions as \"conservation, not Notes, 1998.zindicators that can help relate scientific knowledge and methods to local peoples' experiences. Different social actors may have different views of what constitutes a positive impact as well as different criteria of evaluation. It is important to include suchplural views, indicative of how co-management contributes to: zcommunity planning, implementing, and assessing zfostering cooperation with government and outside organisations; zregenerating or maintaining the health of natural resources; and zsustaining local livelihoods and equity. In extreme cases, what some may see as progress, others may even see as a prob- lem. As when developing the management plan, some form of facilitated negotia-tion may be needed to reach consensus on the overall learning objectives, indica-tors and end-uses of results of the evaluation. Again, as for the management plan,all willing relevant actors should be involved. The members of local communities,in particular, should not be confined to role of information providers or data gath-erers. Participatory monitoring and evaluation methods and approaches can allowthem to express and analyse their realities on the basis of their own criteria andknowledge of environmental and social processes. Many of these methods involvevisualisation, oral testimonies and ecological and natural resource assessmenttechniques familiar and/ or accessible a participatory evaluation of the co-management setting (see Figure 6.1 in Chapter 6) engaged the local Junta de Manejo Participativo (JMP, the Co-management Council), representatives of all the relevant sectors in the three main inhabited islands of the Galapagos archipelago, and numer-ous individuals with significant concerns and responsibilities. The evaluation was meant to be \"forma-tive\" (setting goals and indicators of progress) as well as \"summative\" (assessing progress towards thosegoals) and involved both a participatory aspect and an external component (the external evaluators pro-duced their own report but also took advantage of the results of the participatory evaluation they facili-tated). The evaluators identified several elements of weakness and made recommendations to address them. They also stated, however, that the Galapagos Marine Reserve offers a most significant example of insti-tutionalised co-management, which demonstrated resilience and the capacity to achieve consensuspositions on important management decisions. In fact, the system managed to overcome various typesof disputes, including legal attacks at the higher level in society, local instances of violence, politicalsabotage and numerous changes in sector leadership. Remarkably, it also allowed the reaching of aconsensus over a zoning plan that freed from extractive use 18% of the archipelago coastline (the mostdepleted areas). Among the characteristics identified as contributing to these successes were the follow-ing: zStrong aand cclear llegal bback-uup(Special Law of Galapagos Management Plan of 1999; Official Regulations of 2000; decision of the Constitutional Supreme Jury of 2001). zComposite, well-tthought-oout ssystemwith a co-management body (JMP) in charge of tech- nical proposals by consensus, and another co-management body\u2014 the Autoridad Inter-institucional de Manejo (AIM) in charge of casting decisions about such proposals by vote. Importantly, proposals that obtained the consensus of all members of the JMP were consistently approved by the AIM (basi-cally 100% of such proposals were approved). This is a embedded iincentive ttowards aachiev- ing cconsensus aand aavoiding sstalling(if the JMP does not reach a consensus, the AIM decides on its own accord). zDesignof the system through aa pparticipatory pprocess(the local Start-up Team called Grupo Nucleo worked for a couple of years to draft the Special Law of Galapagos and the GMR Management Plan).

The lessonslearnt from such schemes that have been in operation for several years provideuseful insights into the characteristics of successful co-management institutionsand how these can be nurtured. This does not mean that all is clear and that thereare no more uncertainties about the roles and features of effective co-managementinstitutions in a fast changing world. Far from it! As we have discussed, there areeven multiple perspectives on what constitutes successful co-management. And yet, it seems that some advice can be offered towards enhancing the effectivenessand sustainability of the agreements, organisations, rules and culture-based pat-terns of understanding and DDeevveellooppiinngg ggooooddwwiillll aammoonngg tthhee Claims Task Force2277has said, co-management agreements are about rights to land, sea and resources, and the real solutions to the problemsthey set out to solve lie in a broad based reconciliation, both legal and political.Whatever type of agreement, there is one essential element that all must contain.That is goodwill, i.e.,trust, mutual respect and integrity. If that element is not pres- ent, developing a co-management agreement becomes extremely hard. There islittle point in even commencing negotiations towards functional agreementsunless the parties are prepared to: zrespect one another; zdevelop even a very broad shared vision of the desired feature for the resources at stake; zact honestly, in particular by following through and delivering what they have agreed upon. Mutual goodwill is particularly at stake after the agreement has been signed, when issues associated with co-existence and cooperation in the face of different world-views have to be confronted on a daily basis. Distrust or lack of understanding ofthe motives and rationale for a conservation agency by local people may be anongoing problem. Similarly, a paternalistic and distrusting attitude on the part ofgovernment staff may be \"felt\" by people and may suffocate any desire for coop-eration. Social communications initiatives during implementation can be helpfulto clarify and possibly diffuse conflict. Good faith and commitment to the co-management agreement need to be demonstrated by all parties. MMaaiinnttaaiinniinngg fflleexxiibbiilliittyy aanndd ffoosstteerriinngg ssoocciiaall eexxppeerriimmeennttaattiioonn Co-management is achieved through a cyclical process of dialogue, action, and reflection. An important characteristic of successful co-management is thus to 27British Columbia and support such a process without focusing entirely on the results it should achieve. The \"process\"approach is based on the assumption that when sever-al institutional actors are at stake they need time toget to know their respective needs and capacities. Thelearning process involves acting together, creatingknowledge, and developing an active institutionthrough trial and error. Such a process must be flexi-ble, and responsive to highly differentiated needs andsite-specific conditions. Every farm or forest patch hasits own signature. No one can predict how ecologicalconditions and needs will evolve over time. Co-man-agement bodies must \"learn by doing\", building uponthe motivation, confidence and rapport amongst allthe parties involved. An approach based on social experimentation treats error as a source of information to adapt procedures(see Box 9.19). Indicators are developed from thosemost important to key actors, in particular the localcommunities, and, rather than pursuing absolute andfixed targets, the actors find occasions to celebrate themilestones they reach along the way. Innovative learning methods promote group demonstrations, village level workshops, andcommunity-to-community visits and extension to achieve effective multiplicationof sustainable natural resource management technologies. Co-managementschemes based on such a \"process approach\" must be pursued for realisticlengths of time before evaluating results in terms of social development and sus-tainable natural resource management. Some of the positive trends and resultsgenerated in this way ( e.g., local confidence in being able to manage natural resources, social emergence of previously marginalised groups) may be even moreimportant than their concrete, short term, ecological results. 1999) Because formal aquatic resource co-management planning is unfamiliar to the villagers who established the new co-management plans (see also Boxes 3.11, 5.11, 6.11 and 9.11), it is generally necessary forthem to adjust regulations after having tried them out. This is an important part of adaptive manage-ment and a great way to increase local capacities. Lessons are invariably learnt as time passes, andexperiences generally indicate whether regulations should be softened or hardened. Village headmenhave the right to change regulations, but they are supposed to organise community-wide meetings andreceive everyone's prior approval before alterations are actually made to the plan. They are also sup-posed to notify the district officials in Khong. Experience indicates that while village headmen almostalways seek a mandate from their fellow villagers before instituting changes, they rarely inform the dis-trict. They just inform them when the officers pass by. The officers in Khong are mostly concerned thatvillages do not establish regulations that discriminate against other villages. For instance, they have apolicy that villages are not allowed to restrict outsider-fishing activities unless they are willing to enforcethe same restrictions on themselves. However, if a village bans a fishing method in their area of jurisdic-tion, outsiders are expected to abide by the ban in the same way as local fisherfolk. The \"non-discrimi-natory regulation\" policy of the district helps to maintain good relationships between villages. LEARNING BY DOING 327While the co-management agreement gets fine tuned, the area in which it applies may expand (new parishes or communities may join the agreement) so that theprocess may move in at least two dimensions\u2014 towards more complex accordsand towards larger areas of application. 2288This may also be accompanied by the development of new associations among the parties in the agreement, or newnesting institutions ( e.g., a federation of fisherfolk associations). Flexible manage- ment budgets are very conducive to this maturation through \"learning by doing\"as they can provide the support necessary for organisations to get on their feet.Box 9.20 VViillllaaggeerrssrreeggeenneerraattee mmiioommbboowwooooddllaannddss iinn TTaannzzaanniiaa (adapted from Wily, 1997) In a situation of severe degradation of the forest cover, two Tanzanian communities have pioneered the challenge of achieving sustained, effective control of the use of the forest resource in a very cost-effec-tive way. This was made possible because the government of Tanzania gave them appropriate rightsand access to benefits, allowing them to assume their responsibilities as forest managers. Each one of the villages maintains a Village Forest Committee, the composition of which has steadily shifted from village leaders to ordinary villagers. This local level democratisation has both arisen from,and led to, a growing need for accountability as practical management and controls get under way. Asthe months pass, more, rather than fewer, villagers become effectively involved in the commitment toconserve and manage the forest. An interesting feature of this process is that whilst villagers cited virtu-ally all uses from timber to grazing as \"indispensable\" before they were granted control over the wood-lands, the same leaders and ordinary villagers swiftly argued for discontinuation of any use that theyconsidered damaging once it was known that the forest was \"theirs\". As one villager observed whenasked why the village was so intensely serious in its forest conservation effort: \"Of course we stoppedthe encroachment and charcoal burning when we were given the forest to look after for ourselves! Nowit is ours, we only have ourselves to blame if the forest gets used up. That is why you find us serious.\"While many of the lessons learnt from the co-management experience in Khong are applicable to otherparts of Laos and the region, unique conditions in different areas will require inventive approaches tomeet local needs. Common property regimes can break down in crisis, but experience in Khong indi-cates that they can also be strengthened in response to resource management crisis. The aquaticresource co-management programme in Khong has been very successful. It has enhanced village soli-darity, increased natural resource management capacity and increased the fish and frog stocks andcatches. Provided that co-management systems remain flexible and can adapt to social and institutionalcircumstances unique to particular areas, it will continue to be a most important option for equitablymanaging natural resources in the region.

At the beginning the emphasis may be onbasic resource protection combined with the exercise of some rights of access byspecified parties. This may be followed by an increased sense of legitimacy andresponsibility on the part of the people exercising such access, and, little by little,the development of more appropriate rules and/ or more complex manipulationand technologies for the sustainable extraction and use of resources. A tellingexample is the changing attitudes and priorities of villagers after they took overthe management of their miombo woodlands in Tanzania (see Box 9.20). 28Mark Poffenberger, personal communication, 1996. Complex agreements may include micro-zoning (mosaic plans), multiple time hori - zons, adoption of new technologies, etc.328 SHARING POWERIn addition, it is often in the implementation phase that the need for specific poli- cy and legal change to support effective co-management of natural resourcesbecomes well recognised. 2299These changes need to be pursued, as appropriate, by the management partnership (different stakeholders may be able to use differentchannels to achieve the desired changes). By such processes, several de facto management partnerships may also become de jure , i.e.,legalised by government authority. The same Tanzanian villages described in Box 9.20 began to managetheir forests by preventing activities they had declared illegal, issuing a limitednumber of permits for sustainable uses, patrolling the forest, rehabilitating springs,etc., only on the basis of the support they had secured from the local district council. It soon became clear to them,however, that they needed more for-mal legal backing if their rules were tobe taken seriously by all. Each villagewas therefore assisted to rephrase theirmanagement plans and rules asVillage By-Laws. These were then for-mally approved under the DistrictAuthorities Act in 1995. Now eachvillage is the legal authority and man-ager of that part of the Duru-Haitembaforest specified in the relevant VillageBy-Law as falling under its jurisdic-tion. 3300 PPrroommoottiinngg ppeeooppllee-cceennttrreedd oorrggaanniissaattiioonnaall ccuullttuurreess The quality and depth of a co-man- agement process is dependent on thewillingness of the parties to worktogether. Governmental agencies, inparticular, should be willing to trustpeople\u2014 their knowledge, their cul-ture-based organisations, their under-standing of their own rights, theircapacities to assume responsibilitiesand innovate. A solid commitment to \"people-centeredness\" and a philosophy of reversals from top-down managementdecisions are key features of enabling organisations and an indicator of theirengagement in learning by doing. Both empirical experience and theory suggest that \"organisational culture\"\u2014 i.e., the combination of the individual opinions, shared knowledge, values and norms of the members of an organisation\u2014 is the most fundamental level at which trans-formation needs to take place. 3311Structures and work patterns may be reformed within organisations to enable co-management, but if their \"organisational cul-ture\" is left untouched, the changes may remain superficial and ultimately withouteffect. For natural resource management bureaucracies in particular, narratives and 29The legal and political conditions for successful co-management of natural resources are further discussed in part IV of this v olume. 30Wily, 1997. interactions are the central element of their organisational culture. They give rise to, and legitimate, particular proce-dures, policies, technologies and professional practices that either deny or en-courage diversity and participation in natural resource management. For example,an emphasis on relatively \"stable\" ecosystems feeds into the development of poli-cies and \"scientific\" practices for conservation controlled by professionals and dis-tant organisations. Conversely, notions of uncertainty, spatial variability and com-plex non-equilibrium ecological dynamics tend to emphasise flexibility, mobilityand adaptive resource management in which local people are central actors. 3322 Simplified and a-historical perspectives perpetuated by the powerful have been a persistent feature of environmental policies and interventions. Neo-Malthusiannarratives have been used by bureaucracies to blame people for environmentaldegradation and justify imposing on them massive packages of standard interven-tions. To \"prevent further deterioration\", official policies and bureaucracies haveconsistently defined local misuse of resources as the principal cause of destructionand excluded people from the management of natural resources. 3333All too often, \"by depicting resource users (the local ones) as wild, destructive (or illiterate, une-ducated, backward or non-innovative), state resource management agencies thinkthey can justify their use of militaristic environmental protection\". 3344 Such policy (or crisis) narratives are usually robust, hard to challenge and slow to change. They play a key role in policy and project level decision making. Theystructure options, define relevant data and exclude other views within bureaucra-cies and professional circles. And yet, recent research has debunked severalorthodox views on people-environment interactions (Box 9.21). Effective andinclusive co-management bodies are usually characterised by people-centredorganisational cultures that embrace this new knowledge about people-environ-ment interactions. People-centred organisational cultures typically emphasise theimportance of social and ecological knowledge, flexible institutions co-management. Box 9.21 DDeebbuunnkkiinngg , 2000; Pimbert, 2004) Recent research has fundamentally questioned many of the environmental crisis narratives and received wisdoms on the supposed destructiveness of rural people on the environment. A combination of histori-cal analysis, social anthropology, participatory methods to understand local resource users' knowledgeand perspectives, and insights from non-equilibrium ecology has challenged some of the environmentalknowledge taken for granted by government bureaucracies and donors: zContrary to neo-Malthusian, assumptions, population increase may not necessarily mean more envi- ronmental degradation and less biological diversity. More people can mean more care for the envi- ronment as shown by research in Sierra Leone3355and Kenya.3366 zHistorical research in West Africa has shown dominant deforestation estimates to be vastly exaggerat- ed. Many of the vegetation forms that ecologists and policy makers have used to indicate forest loss, such as forest patches in savannah, are, according to the knowledge of local resource users the product of powerful discourse rather than facts. Sundberg (2004) illustrates this with regard to poor mig rants in Guatemala, who are invariably considered \"the primary cause of deforestation in the reserve, to the exclusion of other actors s uch as powerful cattle ranchers, loggers, and oil companies...\". 34Peluso, 1996. 35Kandeh and Richards, 1996. 36Tiffen et al. , 1994. 330 SHARING POWERhistorical evidence, the results of landscape enrichment by people.3377 zMany assumed \"pristine\" wetlands, grasslands, forests and other biodiversity-rich environments in Latin America, the Pacific Islands, Africa, Australia and Asia have been proved to be human modi- fied and enriched landscapes.3388 zNew perspectives in ecology have challenged conventional views of dry lands in Africa as stable ecosystems subject to decline and desertification once carrying capacity is exceeded. Rangelands are resilient and less prone to degradation and desertification than once thought. The new findings con-cord with the knowledge of many local herders and emphasise how rangelands are subject to highlevels of spatial and temporal variability, and ecological dynamics are characterised by sudden tran-sitions rather than slow and predictable change. 3399 zIn the insular Caribbean, field research has shown that increases in the level of poverty and unem- ployment of a coastal community do not automatically lead to increased resource use and degrada- tion, as often assumed.4400 37Fairhead and Leach, the people living closest to the resources to identify, exchange and analyse information, understand the issues atstake, negotiate solutions and develop an agenda for action. Their success hingeson a commitment to understand multiple perspectives within communities andamong various actors and on sufficient time and space to negotiate workable part-nerships with one another. Several families of methods and approaches are ofhelp throughout this, basically revolving around participatory action research(PAR) and participatory learning and action (PLA). When introduced by facilitatorsin a sensitive and respectful manner, these methods enable people to truly \"takepart\" in understanding issues and making decisions over natural resources and theother issues that affect their lives. The methods also contribute to breaking downthe conventional distinctions between diagnosis, planning, implementation andevaluation, setting a fluid and flexible process of decision making and action.They help to identify new skills in the community and to generate local confi-dence to articulate solutions and take action. A learning approach implies that people are able to discuss alternatives and choices and develop their own process of appraisal, prioritisation, and decision-making based on locally developed indicators. This is particularly important at thecommunity level, too often by-passed by analyses and decisions. As described inPart II of this volume, an enabling approach involves external support but in away that complements and does not replace internal capabilities, knowledge andresources. In this sense, co-management processes have still much to do to pro-mote learning attitudes at all levels. The empowerment process at the local levelis crucially important and a foundation for any other type of participatory process-es and learning, but it can even be envisaged to move beyond that, into institu- tional development and \"lateral learning\" (see Table participatory processes may proceed by pursuing negotiation, organisational change and lateral learning at various levels:4411 The llocal/ mmicro llevel The more enabling co-management organisations encourage the expansion of par- ticipation from one activity, such as appraisal, to the empowering involvement ofprimary actors and local communities throughout the whole co-managementprocess. In this sense, \"participation\" involves setting priorities ( e.g., what should be conserved, by when and how? Who decides where work should be done?);controlling implementation (whose project is it?); controlling funding (how arefunds distributed and to whom? Who benefits?); reporting progress to authoritiesor donors (whose format counts?); developing institutions (whose power counts?).Co-management organisations may thus encourage a shift in the quality and typeof participation, towards learning processes that allow the parties to reflect ontheir experience and develop knowledge together. Successful participatory learn-ing initiatives often combine specific methodologies, such Pretty, 1995) Mere labelling Participatory methods used only as a label to make proposals and rhetoric attractive to donors Participatory methods for stafftraining Participatory methods primarily used for one shot training of staffmembers. No commitment is demonstrated to use methods for fieldaction, no effective skills are available. Participatory methods for appraisal Participatory methods are used at the appraisal stage to obtain a listof local priorities for action. Lack of skills, commitment andresources prevent the continuation of the approach for programmemanagement and local organisational development. Participatory methods for projectmanagement Participatory methods are used to develop an effective sequence ofprogramme implementation and management but are not linkedwith institution development aspects. The use of methods is sus-tained as long as funding is available but tapers off on withdrawal ofresources in absence of effective local organisations. Participatory methods for localinstitutional and organisationaldevelopment Participatory methods are used effectively for programme manage-ment and local institutional development, which shows short andlong term impact. The process, however, may not be accompaniedby corresponding changes in support organisations at larger scales( e.g., in learning environment, structures, disbursement procedures and evaluation mechanisms). This may lead to decaying of effec-tiveness of organisational efforts over time. Participatory methods for organisational change and \"laterallearning\" Participatory methods used as part of a strategy of organisationalgrowth and learning, as well as local institution development. Thestrategy involves appraisal, planning, negotiation, bargaining andconflict resolution as well as lateral expansion of resource useorganisations through peasant to peasant (village to village), herderto herder (tribe to tribe), and institution to institution mechanisms. 41For a more general account of the scaling up and institutionalisation of participatory processes, see Blackburn and Holland, 19 98; Bainbridge et al., 2000; Pimbert, 2004. 332 SHARING POWERother methods of participatory learning that are deliberately empowering.4422For example, they link learning with creating or strengthening local organisations thatact in self reliant organisations encourage a scaling up of operations to include larger numbers of communities and territories/ resources in the manage-ment of natural resources. Once successful local experiences are in place, theycan grow through a number of avenues including provision of resources, strength-ening of networks, provision of mutual support in conflict resolution, etc. Somemost effective learning processes are based in networks of field initiatives andengage the relevant field staff (governmental agencies and projects), local commu-nity members, local authorities and other relevant parties. The learning that takesplace in such initiatives is directed by the learners and usually encompasses awide range of skills and experiences ( e.g., analytical skills, communication skills, capacity to facilitate and participate in meetings)4433towards effective co-manage- ment. A good example is described in Box 5.10 of Chapter 5. Co-management organisations have at times achieved larger scale impact by sup- porting groups who have had successful experiences in one situation to spreadtheir knowledge, innovations and experience to other areas. Exchanges, mutualvisits, joint initiatives and information flows lead to lateral spread of participatoryapproaches over wider geographical areas and offered opportunities to influencepolicies at various levels. The work of the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme inGujarat (India) offers an example of this type of scaling up of a participatoryapproach to natural resource management (see Shah and Kaul Shah, 1994) The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) is an NGO working with village communities in Gujarat to catalyse and promote community participation in natural resource management. AKRSPfocuses on promoting village organisations and institutions to implement the villagers' own resourceconservation plans. This approach has shown that programmes managed by local bodies result in high-er investment by farmers in soil, water and nutrient conservation. Local villagers trained as para-profes-sionals were able to create demand for their services of planning, management and monitoring. Following this, the participatory process spread widely to neighbouring villages and watersheds. Agricultural productivity increased by 30% to 100% over a two to three year period. Soil loss wasreduced, and out-migration slowed. Many households diversified into animal husbandry and horticul-ture. The local para-professionals and co-management organisations became confident enough to helppromote similar activities in neighbouring areas and village level institutions. The creation of a sustainable network of local institutions by AKRSP in the area depended to a great extent on its ability to provide training and programme support to such bodies to emerge as viable,small-scale commercial entities. The size of AKRSP and its initial operations in 40 villages enabled it tohire a good quality multi disciplinary team, which could provide support to village institutions in adiverse range of functional areas. By virtue of the size of its operations, AKRSP was able to mobilise andattract support from many external agencies, including the Indian government. 42Freire, 1970; Freire, 1985; ActionAid, 2001; Archer sscale Organisations that operate at a large scale and wish to enhance participation in natural resource management have to focus on more than local communities andthe micro-level. Possibly, in fact, one of their key challenges is to change them- selves. Such organisations, which generally include representatives of national governments, large NGOs and donor agencies, tend to adopt standardised proce-dures that, no matter how sophisticated, do not adjust well to fine-grained localecological and social characteristics. Together with the professional attitudes andbehaviour usually associated with top-down, expert prescriptions, such standard-ised procedures are likely to inhibit the flexible, innovative practices needed forthe co-management of natural resources to flourish in diverse local contexts. 4444Similarly, the scaling up and institutionalising of the Community Integrated Pest Management (CIPM) programme in Indonesia has been remarkable. Through itsemphasis on farmer-to-farmer training, action research, policy dialogue and otherparticipatory processes, CIPM has truly transformed the livelihoods of peasants byimproving income security, food supply, public health and re-invigorating ruralcivil society. It has also strengthened social assets by supporting farmers' efforts tobuild associations and networks, giving them a stronger voice and improvedmeans of collective action and mutual aid (see al., 2003) Integrated Pest Management (IPM) emerged in Indonesia in the late 1980s as a reaction to the environ- mental and social consequences of the Green Revolution model of agriculture. A cooperative pro-gramme between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the IndonesianGovernment had centred on Farmer Field Schools (FFS), which are schools without walls. The FFSaimed to make farmers experts in their own fields, enabling them to replace their reliance on externalinputs, such as pesticides, with endogenous skills, knowledge and resources. Over one million ricepaddy farmers and local resource users participated, and are still today involved, in this national pro-gramme. Over time, the emphasis of the programme shifted towards community organisation, community plan- ning and management of IPM, and became known as Community IPM (CIPM). Agro-ecosystem analysisand methods for group dynamics were initially used to enhance farmers' ecological literacy as it relatedto plant-insect ecology. Farmer IPM trainers and researcher/ scientists learned facilitation and presenta-tion skills and how to make basic experimental designs to analyse and quantify ecological phenomena.Then, the principles of FFS slowly extended from rice to the management of natural resources, fromIPM to plant breeding and participatory water management, and from technical domains to broaderengagement with policy issues, advocacy, and local governance. The beneficial environmental impacts of the programme include significantly reduced pesticide use, increased biological and genetic diversity, and a more holistic approach by farmers to maintaining thecomplex ecological balance of rice agro-ecosystems. Learning to analyse policy, deal with high-leveldecision-makers in government and produce a newspaper with a print run of 10,000 has been key inenabling farmers and other natural resource users to become organisers, planners, advocates, and poli-cy activists. The empowering dynamic led to a variety of campaign strategies, including a national IPMfarmers' congress and the development of a charter for peasant rights. Such activities, together with thestrengthened voice of farmers brought about by the Community IPM process overall, created anupsurge of support for a national peasant movement professional re-orientation of the kind described in Checklist 9.6 are , 1995; Shah, Kaul Shah and Pimbert, 1998) Governments, large NGOs and donors that are effective in the co-management of natural resources typi- cally encourage several types of internal organisational change, as described below: zCommmmittmmentt tto pprocess Top managers/ decision makers of government departments and large NGOs commit themselves to a long-term process going \"beyond projects\" (cycles of 10 years or more are much more appropriatethan 2-year projects). zOrganisattional ccultture The organisational culture provides opportunities to enable learning from experiences and mistakes, and is flexible enough to allow experimentation. Donor funding is flexible and more dependent onopen-ended, event-focused targets than on fixed schedules. zManagemmentt ssttyyles There is a transition from management styles based on hierarchy, inhibited communications, com- mand and obedience relationships to more organic styles that encourage lateral communication, col-legial authority and flexible roles and procedures. The organisations encourage employees to be par-ticipatory in their work with each other, and not just during \"field visits\". zOrganisattional ssttructture Efforts are on-going at transforming compartmentalised and hierarchical organisations into flatter structures that are multi functional and evolve organically. Innovative mechanisms may include theestablishment and funding of small self managed teams within organisations, endowed with the free-dom to experiment, motivate and learn from mistakes. Professionals are encouraged to work as \"intra-preneurs\" (entrepreneurs within organisations) and pilot innovations. zQualittyy oof ssupportt pprofessionals Co-management of natural resources requires a high degree of professional support in the initial phas- es until local institutions develop/ re-activate indigenous and local management systems. The need torespond flexibly and provide support in a wide range of areas requires dynamic and committed pro-fessionals. Efforts are made to attract and reward excellent professionals in the initial phases of theprocess in order to be effective in the long run. Donors invest early-on to build the capacity of theseprofessionals and their field collaborators. zIncenttives/ rrewards Incentives and rewards encourage staff to be honest, work in the field with communities, stay on as staff, and encourage joint action between governmental institutions and communities. zOrganisattional pprocedures Organisational and programme management procedures enable linking of participatory learning and action with programme management and implementation ( e.g., through the decentralisation of funds management). They seek to build participatory learning and action from the start of the programmecycle. Co-management processes are piloted on a small-scale and implemented mainly through localorganisations.LEARNING BY DOING 335zOuttward LLinkages Priority is given to developing effective linkages ( e.g., training exchanges, joint initiatives, on-going information flows) with partner organisations. This is meant to help partners (including donors) to bet-ter understand all phases of the participatory processes. Linkages are developed on principles ofmutual respect, integrity and trust among partners. Box 9.24 al. , 2004) The Conkouati-Douli National Park (Congo Brazzaville) offers a important example of how an effective management partnership can be developed even while facing some of the most challenging conditionsin the world. The co-management organisation it formally established is the Comit\u00e9 de Gestion des Ressources Naturelles de Conkouati (COGEREN), which includes representatives of the local communi- ties, the state administration, the NGOs locally active in environment and development issues and somelocally elected officials. The legitimisation of this co-management body was accomplished through thesigning of a Co-management Charter by national and local authorities and by a number of social ritualsby which the local chiefs became publicly engaged. After this, a zoning plan was developed, as well asa management plan for the park, prepared on the basis of the zoning plan and progressively includingthree special agreements on the species most highly endangered in the area: the manatees, the marineturtles and rattan. These agreements were prepared cooperatively with all the parties engaged in theCOGEREN and spelled out some important hopes for a voluntary code of conduct in the area. Unfortunately, the achievements in Conkouati\u2014 arresting and powerful as they have been\u2014 remained vulnerable. After the IUCN project that nourished the development of COGEREN came to an end,COGEREN managed to survive well, continuing and even expanding activities for a couple of years,with a small but crucial support from the Netherlands Committee for the IUCN. All work grounded to ahalt, however, when a new Conservateur (park manager) and a new conservation advisor from a foreign NGO45came into the area. Instead of valuing the advantages of the situation they found in place, they chose to follow a more conventional and dated \"protectionist\" and \"repressive\" approach. In spite of theexisting official engagements, they did not respect the authority of COGEREN, prevented both the officialsignature and the application of the special agreements on the manatees, the marine turtles and rattan,and re-focused park management efforts on the armed repression of poaching. The wisdom of involvingin conservation a poorly-paid armed militia in a country just out of a civil war was all to be seen. Farfrom eliminating poaching, this \"repression\" appears to have increased it. The armed forces have simplybecome a new layer in the system, taxing each poached animal that gets out of the park, and thusencouraging the poachers to hunt more than before. As a matter of fact, a sort of alliance is said to havebeen established between the armed police and the poachers (who are not members of the local com-munities and come from outside the park) with the first becoming the taxing protectors of the second: agreat result indeed! Understandably, the sudden change of approach has angered and disheartened thecommunities engaged in the COGEREN, and new clashes and conflicts have been recorded. It would beunforgivable if the local communities were made to lose interest altogether after the long process thatmanaged to involve them sincerely and effectively in conservation.Scaling up and institutionalising co-management approaches offer great opportu-nities to expand people's participation in natural resource management but alsopresent considerable policy and operational challenges. In particular, few expertsand specialised agencies have the will, experience or skills necessary to work in aparticipatory mode. Support measures may be needed to deal with the insecurityoften associated with their changing roles. When this is lacking, one can even seethe rapid demise of inspiring co-management (see Box 9.24). is particularly problematic where there is little support from government or because of prevailing negative attitudes and negative histori-cal legacies. In such contexts, the role of innovative, charismatic or dynamic indi-viduals is often crucial. These \"champions of change\" can be found at any levelof society\u2014 within local or national government, NGOs, local communities and,not least, among resource users. And yet, perhaps more than the existence ofchampions per se , it is the attitudinal and value orientation of the champions in co-management organisations that really makes the difference. For example, many features of normal professional attitudes and behaviour\u2014 such as dominant and superior attitudes, authoritarian relationships, gender and upper-to-upper biases, failures to honour aroused expectations, rushing, and being\"extractive\" in terms of resources and information\u2014 are surely not conducive toco-management. Examples are the attitude of \"we know what's best for them\" ofofficials and powerful actors, the opposite feeling of awe and subservienceamongst some community members and weaker actors, the mutual distrust andill-will built upon a history of conflicts, and the behaviours that perpetuate mysti-fying symbols of power and authority. As respectful, learning-oriented attitudes areincreasingly seen as crucial, abandoning routines (un-learning patterns) andengaging in personal reorientation and organisational learning are sense, can encourage theirmembers dominating way; zdevelop a self-critical attitude, recognising that they are continually learning and welcoming rigorous peer review; zbe explicit about whether they are eliciting information or/ and resources for external use, or are promoting community action and devolution of decision making power over the use of natural resources\u2014 a distinction that should bemade clear and documented; zmake commitments to value fairly the contributions made by all partners (South, North, local, external); zrecognise the need for a diversity of views and approaches, and respect them; zidentify, in partnership with communities, relevant rights and appropriate forms of compensation when eliciting information and resources for external use; zensure that credit and compensation are given as they are due; zstrive towards a process of empowerment of women, marginalised people and weaker people in society. The challenge of unfreezing and/ or shifting attitudes and the working style of bureaucracies (government, donors, large NGOs) demands examining the rela-tionships between working structures and staff attitudes and behaviour, which areoften mutually reinforcing. Bureaucratic structures exert pressures on their staff toact and behave in certain ways. In turn, the behaviour and attitudes of staff shapethe organisational cultures and influence the way bureaucracies operate, bothinternally and with their \"clients\" and \"beneficiaries\". Organisational changeneeds to combine training for individual change with structural transformation\u2014 aprocess through which the organisation up of co-management implies nothing less than fun- damental changes in the operational procedures of bureaucracies, their rewardand incentive systems, their organisational culture, their career patterns, and theiruse of time, ddiissttrriibbuuttiioonn ooff bbeenneeffiittss Ensuring distribution of the natural resource management ben- efits is an important factor to promote and maintain the good will of the co-man-agement parties. A simple and successful example of \"transparency in practice\"comes from the early days of the CAMPFIRE programme, in Zimbabwe (see Box9.25). SSttrriivviinngg ffoorr eeqquuiittyy Effective and sustainable co-management organisations pay attention to equity and human rights issues for both ethical and practical reasons. It is crucial torecognise that the top-down management of wildlife or protected areas can main-tain a degree of effectiveness even in the face of injustices and the impoverish-ment of people. 4477Co-management, however, has little chance of success if bene- fits are not distributed fairly among the relevant parties. Or, let us say, has littlechances of remaining \"co-management\" and not being transformed into yetanother top-down body at the service of the powerful. As discussed in Chapter 2,\"equity\" in natural resource management entails the fair sharing of informationamong the parties, the chances for everyone to participate in discussion andnegotiate agreements that are understood and appreciated by all, and the sharingof resource management benefits and responsibilities in a way that is commensu-rate with the varying capacities of the parties, the sacrifices and contributions theymade and/ or the damages they incurred in the process. 4488 Achieving a balanced representation of actors and interest groups in co-manage- ment organisations is also an important element of an equitable co-managementsetting, and it is all but an easy task. Most communities show internal inequitiesand differences, based on ethnic origin, class, caste, economic endowments, reli-gion, social status, gender and age. In all societies, the composition of decision-making bodies is likely to reflect and reinforce such imbalances of power, withthe weaker and underprivileged social groups being least represented in decisionBox 9.25 LLeeaarrnniinngg ttrraannssppaarreennccyy ffrroomm MMaahheennyyee WWaarrdd ((ZZiimmbbaabbwwee)) (adapted from Jones, 2003) In Mahenye and some other CAMPFIRE areas of Zimbabwe, village meetings are held when the Ward Wildlife Committee gives a statement of accounts for the year and decisions are taken on how to spendthe next year's income from wildlife and tourism. When the income is distributed, each head of house-hold individually collects the cash. If it was decided to spend some of the income on a communityproject, such as a grinding mill, then each head of household returns the agreed portion of the cash forthis purpose. They all see and hold in their hands the cash that was generated from wildlife and fullyrealise that wildlife has a monetary value. Further, each head of household, having assigned money to apurpose, is bound to want to ensure that it will be actually used for that purpose, 2003. 48For instance, through lost access to resources, damage to crops and through the physical danger presented by many wild animals. See also Pimbert and Pretty, 1998.338 SHARING POWERmaking structures. And, of course, what ben- efits one group and meets some conservationgoals, may harm other parties and othergoals. Inequities in the composition of theco-management bodies can create profoundresentments among the parties and ultimatelydefeat co-management as a whole.Institutions striving for successful outcomesdevelop special arrangements to bring to thefore the views of all relevant parties, and par-ticularly the views of gender, caste, racial orreligious groups, in ways that are culturallyappropriate. 4499A powerful way to do so requires that not only the least powerfulactors are represented in decision-makingbodies, but also that decisions in such bodiesare taken by consensus. Through time, thiscan generate entirely new skills, collaborativecapacities and mutual respect in a local soci-ety. Ensuring fair and equitable representation of different stakeholders is key to the success ofco-management institutions. If co-manage-ment bodies are created in regions where thedemographic composition of the affectedcommunities is quite homogeneous, the deci-sion-making could involve only government and representatives of the communities as a whole, sometimes holding the majori-ty of seats. This occurs in some northern Canadian co-management organisations.On the other hand, where the local communities are highly differentiated internal-ly, their representatives in the participatory management body need to reflect thatdiversity. Identifying the most appropriate representatives of indigenous communi-ties connected with a particular area may be difficult, especially if there are intra-group conflicts over titles and responsibilities. 5500Clarity over the types of represen- tation and criteria used to identify primary and secondary actors is crucial toensure the CM success. And care must also be taken not to weaken or damagethe traditional community organisations (such as Councils of Elders) that are oftenthe last (and best) resort to represent the interests of communities and negotiate ontheir behalf. 5511 Many co-management organisations sooner or later find the need to invest time and resources in reforming policy and legal frameworks to ensure more equitablebenefit sharing among the parties involved in co-management. 5522Similarly, innova- tions to promote more equitable benefit sharing need to be encouraged at thelocal level. A particularly good example of local level practice that evolved withequity in mind is described in Box 9.26. Working through their sanghams, women adapted social mapping and wealth ranking methods to decide on how to allo-cate food grains in the fairest possible way under a Public Distribution Systemthey co-manage in south India. 49See some examples in Boxes 5.15, 5.16 and 9.1. 50Sullivan, 1997. 51Experience shows that such entities can adapt themselves to modern challenges such as gender and equity concerns; attempts at \"improving such systems\" from the outside can backfire, however, if help is not offered with sensitivity and respect. 52This point is explored in Part IV of this volume. LEARNING BY Pimbert, 1999) Like elsewhere in India, a Public Distribution System (PDS) operates in the villages around Zaheerabad in Medak district of Andhra Pradesh. Every month each family having access to this system (about 50%of the rural population) can buy 25 Kg. of rice at a subsidised rate. Although this ration is the lifeline ofpoor rural families, the rice sold in the PDS is an alien grain for the women of Zaheerabad. They nevergrew rice on their dry lands. It was always sorghum, pearl, finger and other millets mixed with a widerange of pulses that made up the crops on their lands and the meals in their pots. With more and morePDS rice coming from the resource rich areas of South India, dry land farmers and their food cropswere being gradually displaced. Their lands were being put to fallow and local biodiversity importantfor food and agriculture was eroded. The PDS rice was economically attractive but was nutritionallyinferior to traditional coarse grains. Being reduced to consumers, dependent on purchased food for theirown survival, undermined the women's self-esteem and self-respect as food providers and keepers ofseed. The women organised into sanghams \u2014 voluntary associations of Dalit women, the lowest social rank in the village\u2014 and discussed possible alternatives to the government's PDS. They decided to reclaimtheir fallow lands and grow their traditional dry land crops again. They aimed at setting up a complete-ly community-managed PDS system based on coarse grains, locally produced, locally stored and local-ly distributed. Meetings were held in villages and the modalities of running an alternative PDS wereworked out together with the Deccan Development Society (DDS), an NGO supporting the work of the sanghams . Formal agreements were signed between the DDS and the village sanghams to specify the roles, rights and obligations of each party in the joint management of the alternative PDS. Workingthrough the DDS, the sanghams also approached the Government of India's Ministry of Rural Development, which saw the merit of their case and approved funding for a Community Grain Fund. In the very first year, this jointly managed scheme involved over 30 villages, brought about 1,000 hectares of cultivable fallows and extremely marginal lands under the plough, produced over three mil-lion Kg. of extra sorghum (at the rate of about 100,000 Kg. per village) in a semi-arid area, grew extrafodder to support about 2,000 cattle; created an extra 7,500 wages and provided sorghum at 2 Rupeesper Kg. for about 4,000 families. Grain storage took place in a decentralised fashion, using indigenousstorage techniques that minimised pest damage and health hazards. Biological diversity significantlyincreased in the area as traditional crops and varieties were reintroduced as part of complex anddiverse farming systems. At the end of the storage period, during the food-scarcity seasons, the sanghams grains are sold at a subsidised price to poor households. The sanghams identify around 100 poor households in each vil- lage. Using participatory methods, the Dalit women decide who among the villagers are the poorest and qualify for community grain support. In each village, social maps indicating all the households aredrawn on the ground by villagers themselves. Criteria for rural poverty are evolved by the villagersthemselves and each household is judged on a five point scale of poverty. Each level is identified by adifferent colour ( e.g., black=destitute, red=very poor, green=poor, etc.) and each house marked by a specific colour after careful deliberation in an open and transparent way. Households thus selected areissued a sorghum card by the sangham. Instead of the subsidised rice of the government PDS, which costs 3.50 Rupees per Kg., this card entitles a family to an amount of sorghum at the subsidised price of2 Rupees per Kg. for each of the six months that make up the rainy season. The poorer the family, thelarger their entitlement. In recognising each person's fundamental right to food, the sanghams thus put in practice their own concepts of equity and solidarity as they distribute the benefits of the co-managedPublic Distribution System.Part IIV.TOWARDS AAN EENABLING SOCIAL CCONTEXT342 SHARING POWERChapter 10. NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS Environmental degradation and inequitable access to natural resources are, to a large extent, the result of political choices and processes and cannot be addressedwithout significant and durable changes in the distribution of power in society.Thus, making co-management \"work\" at the local level requires overcoming con-straints on local conservation and development that have to do with the regional,national and international contexts and are shaped by a variety of forces, process-es and instruments. Crucial determinants of such contexts are national legislationand policies. Many would affirm that locally negotiated and implemented co-management agreements are likely to be ineffectual unless supported\u2014 or at least not imped-ed\u2014 by coherent legislation and policies. While this is generally true, it is alsoobserved that co-management experiments generated in absence of supportivepolicies have demonstrated aliveness and effectiveness. Importantly, they havedemonstrated a capacity to influence existing policy and to generate new andmore appropriate ones. In this sense, even co-management experiments practicedon a small scale at the local level can serve as a vehicle for social change. Theycan, for instance, give a taste of empowerment to groups and communities thatwere previously marginalised. They can increase the accountability of organisa-NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 343Box 10.1 PPoolliicciieess ddeeffiinneedd In the broadest sense of the term, policy can be defined as discourse, i.e. as an ensemble of norms, rules, views, ideas, concepts and values that govern practice and behaviour, and interpret social andenvironmental realities. 11This suggests that the expressions and instruments of policy can be both formal and informal, and that the manner in which policy issues are discussed and framed in discourse is initself significant. Public policy refers specifically to the deliberations and directives of actions taken by governments of nation states, including local government agencies and institutions. By extension, public policy alsorefers to the deliberations and directives of action established and adopted by inter-governmental agen-cies and institutions, including international conventions. But policy is more than a set of goals andprocedures. It encompasses instruments and processes such as mechanisms of resource allocation; insti-tutional arrangements and procedures for public and non-governmental institutions; legal and regulato-ry frameworks applied by the state; and access, quality, efficiency, and relevance in the delivery of pub-lic services. 22 Policy is not synonymous with public policy. Other actors such as medium and large scale businesses and transnational corporations have their own policies. This private sector policy can have a significant influence on environment and development. And policy is also made by indigenous peoples and localcommunities of fishing folks, peasants and farmers, nomadic pastoralists and hunters and gatherers. This\"community policy\" also affects natural resources and their use. Importantly, public, private and community policy do not always shape, or effectively affect, outcomes, and the difference between rhetoric and reality should be always borne in mind. 33In this respect, Barraclough and Ghimire44provide a useful typology for policies that do not deliver expected outcomes: zpolicy failures (they fail to achieve what they were expected to achieve); zpolicy perversities (they have unintended negative consequences); zpolicy hypocrisies (they ostensibly have one objective but actually aim at other, even contrary, objec- tives); and zpolicy absence (benign neglect results in negative social and environmental impacts). Policy-making and implementation are inherently political processes, which define a society and reflect its fundamental values and structures. The process of policy-making (who makes policy and how it ismade) determines and mirrors the functioning of that society. Policy-making is the privilege of the dicta-tor in an autocratic society, while each and every citizen is expected to participate in policy making inthe case of a utopian democratic society. Between these two extremes, there exists a diversity of sys-tems of governance and policy making processes that are more or less participatory.tions. They can build local capacity. And they can be motivating and inspiring forprocesses of decentralisation and democratisation at the national level. Policy implies a purposeful course of action taken by social actors to address par- ticular issues and advance towards specific objectives. Policy is a good part ofwhat many organisations do. Policy involves process, in the form of policy mak-ing, implementing and reviewing, and it involves content, in the form of objec-tives, statements and instruments (Box 10.1). 1Keeley and Scoones,1999. 2Norton, 1998. 3Stiefel and Wolfe, 1994. SHARING POWERPolicies that create environments favourable to co-management seem to pursue three types of goals. The first goal is sustainability , seeking human activities and resource use patterns compatible with ecological sustainability. The second goal is equity , securing the rights of people and communities, enhancing social and eco- nomic benefits, and combating inequalities, such as the ones responsible forpoverty and exclusion. The third goal is good governance , empowering civil soci- ety in decision-making and democratising government institutions and structures,and markets. Ideally, these goals should be pursued in an integrated and coherentfashion. In the real world, however, this is more the exception than the rule. Yet,co-management approaches can still be fostered and supported by limited andsectoral policies, such as policies that address only one of the above goals, oreven just a sub-area within any one of these broad concerns, such as: zbuilding the capacities of any relevant actor in a variety of ecological and social aspects of natural resource management; zpromoting social communication initiatives and soliciting the active participa- tion of disfavoured groups; zfacilitating equitable access to natural resources by recognising and preserving rights, securing tenure, or allocating entitlements through devolution mecha- nisms; zmanaging resource use conflicts, and harmonising conservation with resource use and human development; zoptimising, securing and fairly sharing the social and economic benefits gener- ated from the use of natural resources; zstrengthening the identity and culture of indigenous peoples and local commu- nities, in particular regarding customary rights on natural resource management and conservation; zfostering the appreciation of cultural diversity, in particular through different ways of satisfying human needs and managing natural resources respectful of customary laws and practices; zstrengthening inclusive democratic processes at various levels including for cul- turally sensitive issues and customary practices; zplacing limits on the concentration of economic power, both nationally and internationally, and promoting corporate and state responsibility; zsafeguarding local communities, institutions and economies against the nega- tive impacts of unchecked globalisation. It is thus clear that the policy instruments that are of relevance for co-management extend beyond the regulation of institutional partnerships or the \"protection\" ofthe environment. CM-supportive policy deals with ecological sustainability, liveli-hoods, democratic and accountable institutions, social justice and equity in thepolitical and economic arena. This chapter focuses on national and international policies that can facilitate and strengthen the co-management of natural resources at different scales. Rather thanpresenting a fixed menu of policy instruments, it describes a range of policyoptions and directions for national governments and other actors who seek tomainstream co-management. As democratic lleevveell Co-management requires a policy environment that avoids and departs from extremist and simplified approaches to governance. Aware of the failures andinequities of state-dominated models, of the dangers of approaches that givesupremacy to the market and its forces, and of the limitations of exclusive com-munity authority and action, advocates of co-management see the benefits ofapproaches that recognise the strengths and weaknesses of various social actorsand institutions. The ideological foundation of co-management is one that placespeople unambiguously at the centre of the development process, but it is also onethat understands that the state, the market and civil society\u2014 including local com-munities, NGOs and individuals\u2014 all have a positive role to play in that process. Ideally, formal policy frameworks would stem from a broadly shared national vision and provide guidance and direction for the sound governance of naturalresources. These frameworks should be the products of internally driven participa-tory processes that generate broad-based commitment and ownership. In an idealpolicy environment, such laws and policy instruments would derive from, and beconsistent with, a national vision of development, society and environment. Inmany parts of the world, however, and especially in the South, environment anddevelopment policies are directly influenced by external agencies. For instance,the most explicit statements of public policy on issues and sectors relevant to co-management can be found in such instruments as the World Bank-sponsoredNational Environmental Action Plans (NEAP) and Poverty Reduction StrategyPapers (PRSP), some country strategy papers assisted by bi-lateral and multi-lateralagencies, or policy statements developed in accordance with the provisions ofinternational conventions ( e.g.National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans). This pattern of external influence can put into question the ownership of policystatements and of the measures they contain. Also noticeable is the case of exter-nal agencies actively colluding with national elites and commercial interests topromote the interests of powerful actors. 55In general, co-management arrange- ments are best established in a political context that respects basic freedoms andprovides for the rule of law. In the absence of such a context, the promotion ofco-management may frankly prove unrealistic (see Box 10.2).ment are increasingly proving to be crucial for the design of supportive co-man-agement policies throughout the world, issues related to the process of policy for-mulation will be addressed in the subsequent, closing chapter. CCoo-mmaannaaggeemmeenntt 2002) Between 1996 and 2001, the World Bank and the Government of Haiti implemented a project called Projet d'Appui Technique \u00e0 la Protection des Parcs et For\u00eats , which aimed at conserving and managing the last remaining forests of this impoverished Caribbean country. The project had a number of compo- 5Hancock, 1991; Sogge, 2002.346 SHARING POWERnents, including capacity-building and institutional strengthening for government agencies and civil society organisations, promotion of social and economic development activities within and aroundforests and protected areas, preparation of management plans for individual protected areas, and estab-lishment of co-management institutions and agreements at the local level. This project was designed and initiated at a time when the political situation in Haiti presented signs of hope. A new President of the Republic had been elected with overwhelming popular support, a rela-tively stable government was in place, and critical policy reforms were being initiated. This project waspart of a broader vision based on the restoration of democracy and the protection of the basic rights ofcitizens, the improvement of governance through decentralisation and community empowerment, andthe reduction of poverty through economic diversification, social protection and improved environmen-tal management. Co-management of forests and protected areas fitted well in this vision. Through co-management arrangements, this project aimed at strengthening local authority and responsibility over the manage-ment of critical natural assets, at giving a prominent role to community organisations, at promoting sus-tainable use of resources, and at protecting the last remaining areas of forests, in a country renownedfor its extreme poverty, and for the extent of its deforestation and overall environmental degradation. While the project had a number of positive impacts before being interrupted in 2001, as a result of the sanctions imposed on Haiti by the international community, it was not able to achieve its objectives ofestablishing viable co-management agreements. Specifically, three factors militated against the achieve-ment of these objectives: (a) the state and its civil society partners remained unable to protect citizensand community organisations against corruption and against political and economic violence imposedby powerful interests (the \"rules of the game\" that prevailed on the ground remained basicallyunchanged), (b) people did not trust government agencies and officials, and were not prepared to col-laborate with them in matters of importance to their livelihoods and survival, and (c) the state and itsagencies remained unwilling to delegate formal authority to non-governmental and community part-ners. In many respects, it was futile to attempt to establish co-management institutions in a country where basic human rights were not respected, state institutions were largely perceived as corrupt and unreli-able, and community empowerment was bound to be perceived as a threat to dominant groups andinterests within and outside government. CCoonnssttiittuuttiioonn aanndd bbaassiicc cciivviill llaaww The first and most fundamental expression of public policy in any country is found in its national constitution. Some constitutions directly and explicitly facili-tate co-management as they fully and straightforwardly recognise the right of peo-ples, citizens and civil society in general to participate in decision-makingprocesses and in the governance of national and local institutions. Some constitu-tions also recognise the rights of communities and indigenous peoples as collec-tive bodies (collective versus individual rights). In Argentina, for example, theconstitution stipulates that Congress has the power to recognise the legal status ofindigenous peoples and of community property rights over their traditional lands.In Colombia, the constitution states that the law guarantees the participation ofcommunities in the decisions that may affect them. In the Czech Republic, theconstitution includes protection for national and ethnic minorities, guaranteeingrights to development, culture, language diversity, participation and association.The constitution of Ecuador is, in many ways, remarkably progressive in its recog-NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 347nition of the collective rights of indigenous peoples (Box 10.3).

In accordance with the Constitution and with the law, respect for public order, and human rights, the state shall recognise and guarantee to indigenous peoples the following collective rights: 1.To maintain, develop and strengthen their spiritual, cultural, linguistic, social, political and economic identity and traditions. 2.To protect the imprescriptible ownership of community lands, which may not be alienated, confiscat- ed or broken up, except by the state with its power to declare public utility. These lands will be exemptfrom payment of property tax. 3.To maintain ancestral ownership of community lands, which will be freely awarded in accordance with the law. 4.To participate in the use, usufruct, administration and conservation of renewable natural resources found on their lands. 5.To be consulted about any plans and programmes to prospect and exploit non-renewable resources found on their lands which may have an environmental or cultural impact on them.

Someimportant elements of legislation ( e.g.civil code, rural code, and pastoral code) often do not even recognise indigenous and local communities as legal entities(according to some legislation only individuals, businesses and the state \"exist\" ) and they cannot accommodate collective rights and responsibilities. Rarely isthere a simple and effective legal status for communities willing to manage andconserve natural resources. Even rarer is a legal status that allows local communi-ties not only to manage their customary common property resources, but also toderive an economic profit from it. One of the crucial ways in which constitutions and basic laws provide backing to co-management is by recognising communities as legal entities, by allowing thedevolution of natural resource management authority and responsibilities at the lowest effective level (in applicationof the principle of subsidiarity\u2014 seeChapter 4) and by upholding abroader culture and system of partici-patory policy-making and gover-nance. When such provisions areenshrined in the national constitu-tion, they have the potential 66to inform and influence all policies and plans. NNaattuurraall rreessoouurrccee mmaannaaggeemmeenntt ppoolliiccyy Policies on natural resource manage- ment are crucially important indirecting who will manage naturalresources and how, and who willbenefit from that management. They do so at the national level but also at the sub-national (regional) and local levels.Particularly significant in this sense are policies that decentralise, delegate,devolve and secure control over natural resources, as well as policies that recon-cile protection India's 73rdand 74thConstitutional Amendments gave local governments (the panchayati raj system) the task of planning for economic development and social justice. In theory this process begins with the gram sabha (village assembly) at the village level, though this varies in practice across states. In the state of Madhya Pradesh, a new law was passed in 2001 that virtually transferred all powers concerninglocal development to the village assemblies, including powers related to village development, budget-ing, levying taxes, agriculture, natural resource management, village security, infrastructure, educationand social justice. In Kerala, as part of the People's Planning Campaign, local governments received40% of the state budget allocation for local services. Grassroots planning processes were carried out inthousands of villages and later approved by direct vote in popular village assemblies. 6It is not automatic that legal provisions are implemented, especially when they involve sensitive concerns to Kothari, 2003) From 2000 to 2004, the Government of India, through its Ministry of Environment and Forests, has been involved in the formulation of a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). This hasbeen the result of a broad process that involved a number of studies and reviews and dozens of strate-gies and action plans prepared at local, state, eco-regional and thematic levels. This process has beenparticipatory and decentralised, involving a wide range of actors in the analysis of data, issues andoptions, and in the formulation of policy recommendations and specific instruments. Its coordinationhas been carried out by the NGO Kalpavriksh. One of the basic goals of the draft NBSAP is \"equity in the conservation and use of biodiversity, includ- ing equitable access to biodiversity and control over decision-making about it, as well as equitable dis-tribution of the costs and benefits associated with its conservation and sustainable use\". In particular,that includes \"creating democratic spaces for the voices of dis-privileged women and men in definingconservation and use priorities.\" The measures provided by the draft NBSAP include \"communitytenure rights, in particular the rights of women, children and other dis-privileged sections within them\",as well as \"balancing local, national and international interests\". Specific provisions of the draft NBSAP include the strengthening or revival of customary governanceSome countries do not have formal public policy statements that govern social development and natural resource management. In these situations, co-manage-ment can rarely take place on a large scale. In other countries policy statementsexist but are narrow and fail to provide a comprehensive framework to integrateand harmonise different sectoral policies. In too many cases, policy-making onenvironmental issues and natural resource management comes in response to acrisis or to external influences, not as a result of endogenous processes of analysisand decision-making. In addition, laws are not always guided by, or derived from,clear objectives. Therefore there is often an unmet need for a comprehensiveframework of formal policy in the field of natural resource management. Such aframework would include: zNational SStrategies ffor SSustainable DDevelopment (NSSD): all countries of the world are now committed, since the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) held in South Africa in 2003, to the formulation of suchnational strategies. Whatever the title used ( e.g.National Strategy for Sustainable Development, National Development Plan, and NationalDevelopment Strategy), the heart of such statements should ensure that nationaldevelopment is guided by strategic directions and instruments that include con-cerns for sustainability, provide adequate policy direction for natural resourcegovernance and management, and define a suitable framework for integrateddevelopment planning. 77 zNational BBiodiversity SStrategies aand AAction PPlans(NBSAP): these instruments have been or are currently being developed by most countries of the world, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity(CBD). They provide an excellent opportunity for nations to express formallytheir commitment to participatory governance and co-management, and to putin place the specific policies and instruments required to realise this commit-ment (see Box 10.5). 7Dalal-Clayton and Bass, 2002350 SHARING POWERstructure, the documentation, encouragement and integration of customary law into statutory laws, and a reconciliation of \"the contradictions between the laws of conservation, on the one hand, and thoserelating to decentralisation and social justice, on the other\".

Many countries have already prepared their NAP88 which is meant to incorporate public and community participation in resource management. Very interesting pilot initiatives have been includedin some of these national co-management is the inclu- sion of appropriate provisions within the policies and laws thatgovern the conservation, use and management of natural resources, e.g.forestry, fisheries, land, soils, and wildlife. These policy instru- ments should include a vision of collaboration and equity in natu-ral resource management, incorporate the principles and values ofparticipation, subsidiarity, rights and empowerment, and stipulatethe specific measures that are available to design, establish andfacilitate institutions and arrangements. zNational pprotected aarea llegislation aand ppolicies: in addition to their national policies in key sectors, many countries have formulated and adopted develop- ment plans and programmes to govern the establishment and management ofnational systems of protected areas. These plans and programmes are usuallysupported by national legislation, which should incorporate the principles andinstruments of co-management, including specific provisions for shared anddelegated management authority (Box 10.6). Box 10.6 RReeffoorrmmiinngg nnaattiioonnaall pprrootteecctteedd aarreeaa ssyysstteemmss (adapted from Ghimire and Pimbert, 1997) In many cases, a review of national PA category systems and classifications may be a logical and neces- sary step to bring new strength and coherence to a national conservation policy. For instance, existingprotected areas under co-management with indigenous peoples and local communities may still beclassified in categories incompatible with current uses and situations. Often, National Parks fit to bemanaged as protected areas under IUCN Category V or VI are run by legislation that forbids all humanpresence and NR uses and impedes all sorts of co-management agreements. It is therefore important todispose at the national level of a comprehensive range of categories and governance types that fullyreflect the varying degrees and forms of human use and intervention on the environment. 99This is slow- ly being recognised also in international documents.1100 8www.unccd.int/actionprogrammes/menu.phb 9Borrini-Feyerabend, 2004. 10For instance see the UN List of Protected Areas (2003).Examples of co-management of natural resources and protected areas inscribed in national policy and legislation include: Marine pprottectted aareas llegislattion iin TTanzania National legislation defines the rules under which participatory management of NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 351natural resources can take place. The case of the Tanzania Marine Park and Reserves Act of 1994 is a good example. Several local initiatives were started forthe co-management of coastal areas, and local government authorities establishedby-laws and regulations to legalise these activities. It soon became apparent thatthe national legislation on marine parks and reserves was deficient, and did notformally allow for participatory management processes involving the Division ofFisheries and Village Councils. 1111A new legislation was thus drafted and ratified in 1994 to define the rules for the involvement of village councils in the participato-ry management of marine parks and reserves. The new national legislation pro-vides an adequate statutory framework for local initiatives to be fully incorporatedinto national policy, and for village-based resource management systems to be for-mally recognised as a legal option. The NNattional CConservattion SSttrattegyy oof PPakisttan Pakistan's National Conservation Strategy, which was ratified in 1994, emphasises public involvement in the management of natural resources and of protectedareas in particular. Under its umbrella, provincial and territorial governmentsembarked in developing regional conservation strategies. The Sarhad ProvincialConservation Strategy 1122includes specific guidelines for the involvement of com- munities in co-managing protected areas, such as the need to set up a co-manage-ment structure where local communities are to be directly represented, as well asspecific mechanisms to facilitate their participation, protect their cultural identity,effectively share information and to distribute fairly the benefits deriving fromeach specific protected area.

The relevant agreements take the form of a memorandum ofunderstanding between El Salvador's Park Service and the organisation requestingto co-manage a protected area. A series of requisites are established for an organi-sation to qualify, such as possessing legal status, and having administrative capaci-ty and prior experience in managing protected areas. Once the organisation quali-fies, the Park Service requires it to submit an operational plan, which details theobjectives and goals as well as the activities designed to meet them. As in manyother instances, the state reserves the right to revoke the agreement that, as amemorandum of understanding, has clear time limits and evaluation periods. Ifthe organisation complies with the requirements and is successfully evaluated, theparticipatory management of the protected area can continue over longer periodsof time.

Yet, states have by nature a monopolistic tendency and the conditions forthe management of protected areas are getting tighter for the NGOs\u2014 despitetheir excellent results and their proven capacity to engage local communities andother stakeholders. Unfortunately, the co-management setting of Lebanese protect-ed areas appears in jeopardy. Jointt FForestt MManagemmentt iin IIndia On 1 June 1990, a Joint Forest Management (JFM) programme was officially launched in more than 14 states of India, largely in response to the fast deteriora-tion and uncontrolled exploitation of their forests. The goal of the programme was\"to secure the willing cooperation of the people through their active participationfor the conservation and development of forests on a sustainable basis\". 1133Through co-management agreements, local forest protection committees received the for-mal authority to control forest resource uses. In the best cases, the agreementshave managed to define a fair share of the rights and responsibilities of local usergroups and the forest department, and have led to impressive forest regenera-tion. 1144In other cases, complex controversies related to equity and real versus token participation in forest management decisions have arisen leading to the fail-ure of several local attempts. 1155In 2002, nearly 64,000 Forest Protection Committees were registered in 27 Indian states.1166Similarly in Nepal, over 3,400 forest user groups have been formed that currently manage 2000 communityforests. These legally registered groups work with government forestry staff todevelop a five year operational plan. Upon approval of the plan, conditionalmanagement rights are handed over to the user groups. The operational planspells out the rights and obligations of the parties involved in the forest manage-ment the Federal Government Policy of Canada, a comprehensive claim process enables the negotiation and recognition of indigenous rights and interests in areaswhere earlier treaties did not involve the surrendering of aboriginal titles.Comprehensive claims processes involve negotiations over indigenous peoples'claims to land and resource management, determination of development strate-gies and indigenous self-government. Claimant groups can secure title to landscovered by the settlement, wildlife harvesting rights, participation in land, water,wildlife and environmental management in the settlement area, financial compen-sations, revenue-sharing rights, access to measures to stimulate economic devel-opment, and a role in the management of heritage resources (Box 10.7).Agreements are protected under the Canadian Constitution and cannot be amend-ed without the concurrence of the claimant group. 1188The comprehensive claims have evolved over time. In 1984, they mostly dealt with rights to harvest wildlife,harvesting methods, native employment in the parks, business considerations andthe like. 1199More recently, the boards established under land claim settlements have gained more encompassing and iin VViettnamm In Vietnam, the Government has developed a Master Plan for Fisheries (1997- 2010). This plan is particularly relevant to the development of coastal and marineprotected areas as it emphasises user rights over resources, addresses policy formarine capture fisheries, and promotes the need to adopt and implement moreeffective conservation measures. The plan emphasises accelerating the process ofestablishing a rational system for the exploitation and use of the country's naturalmarine resources and habitats, including the introduction of management systemsand structures aimed at supporting resource and habitat protection while recognis-ing the need for an equitable allocation of resource use rights and obligations ofthe people and coastal communities.

It is this provision that was followed in Saint Lucia to estab-lish the Soufriere Marine Management Area (see Box 3.9 in Chapter 3) and thusprovided the institutional basis for its co-management regime. In the absence ofthis provision, the Soufriere Marine Management Area may not have been able torealise the positive results that it has obtained over the past few years. policies and legal instruments provide for local repre- sentation on multi-stakeholder protected area management boards. Theseboards comprise representatives of national and local Government of Canada, 1993) The Western Arctic Claim Settlement gives the Inuvialuit priority in the harvest of marine mammals in the settlement region, including first access to all harvestable resources. This means that the Inuvialuithave the right to harvest a subsistence quota of marine mammals, to be set jointly by them and the gov-ernment. The Inuvialuit also have a preferential right to harvest fish for subsistence within the settlementregion; this includes trade, barter and sale to other Inuvialuit. Subject only to restrictions imposed byquotas each year, Inuvialuit are issued non-transferable commercial licenses to harvest a total weight offish equal to the largest annual commercial harvest of that species taken by Inuvialuit from those watersover the preceding three years. Access to commercial harvests above that level is granted on the samebasis to Inuvialuit as to other applicants. In the Yukon Final Agreement, signed in 1993, self-government arrangements and special management areas have been negotiated and included in the comprehensive claims settlement for that area. Each ofthe four First Nations can exercise law-making powers over land-management, hunting, fishing, trap-ping and fishing, and business regulation. A new national park, a special management area and anational wildlife area have also been created. The Vuntut National Park is encompassed within the spe-cial management area, much of which will be owned by the Vuntut Gwitchin people, who also retainharvesting rights. Renewable Resource Councils are established with First Nation representation, andrepresentation is granted on a range of other land and resource management bodies. 2211The National Wildlife Area is a jointly managed waterfowl habitat. 21Such as the Yukon Water Board, Development Assessment Board, Surface Rights Board, and the Territorial Fish and Wildlife Manage ment Board. 22Vo, 2001.354 SHARING POWERnon-governmental organisations, indigenous peoples and other local cultural communities. They have primary responsibility for protected area managementand they call for the participation of community and other civil society actors.With increased capacity-building for community and indigenous people's rep-resentatives, some of these boards have become models of participation in pro-tected area management. 2233When combined with the respect of the principle of Prior Informed Consent these policy shifts potentially allow local communitiesto actively shape protected area Alanya, on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, is located on the edge of a deep basin, and the inshore zone for setting nets isvery limited. The fishers have organised among themselves a system of rotatingfishing areas so that each fisher receives equitable access to the more produc-tive fishing spots. There are some 40 named fishing spots in Alanya's trammelnet fishery, which takes place between September and May. The overall systemof access rights and rules for taking turns is quite complicated but, starting inthe 1980s, it has reduced conflict among fishers. Fishery management in Turkeyis centralised. There are no local government jurisdictions or local village juris-dictions over fishing, as for example one finds in Japanese coastal fisheries.This created a dilemma for the fishers in Alanya: how to provide legitimacy forthe system they designed? They decided to draw legitimacy by using theAquatic Resources Act as enabling legislation. The Act states that local co-oper-atives have jurisdiction over \"local arrangements\". Thus the rules were drawnup under the letterhead of the local fisheries co-operative, endorsed by the fish-ers at the coffee house where they were formulated, and copies were depositedwith the local mayor and police. 2255 in NepalFoewAs Nepal emerged from a feudal regime during the early 1950s, the incipient state established a basic forest policy. Initially, this policy distinguished three categories of forests, including \"community forests\" meant to satisfy communityneeds. Their management and protection was entrusted to village Panchayats . This policy remained on paper and was not truly implemented until the late1970s. During these two decades, Nepal's forest policy followed the Westernmodel, by which forest ownership was vested in the state and managementauthority placed in the hands of the Forest Department. The forests werenationalised in 1957, actually not\u2014 as many have erroneously remarked\u2014 totake them away from the communities, but rather to break the feudal tenurearrangements by which three quarters of the forests and agricultural lands inthe country were held by a single family. After nationalisation, the ForestDepartment was responsible for performing all policing and licensing functions,a nearly impossible task in light of its limited staff capacity. The Forest Act of1961 provided the first legislation that contemplated transferring governmentforest lands to village Panchayats for community use. Unfortunately, these legal provisions were never implemented, and the issue was not addressed until 15years later. Meanwhile, the Forest Preservation Act of 1967 strengthened therole of the Forest Department as policy and law-enforcement agency. AForestry Plan was established in 1976, including provisions for creating Panchayat Forests to benefit local communities. Finally, in 1978, specific rules 23Worah, 2002. 24See, however, Ferrari and De Vera, 2003. See also Box 10.16. 25Berkes, 1992.NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 355and regulations governing the transfer of limited areas of state forests to the Panchayats were enacted. Formal recognition had thus been given to the rights of villagers to manage their own forest resources with provisions for technicalassistance by the Forest Department, as necessary. In 1990, the Government ofNepal stressed its engagement about community forestry by inscribing it as akey component in its major master plan for the forestry sector. This includedprovisions for: zhanding over of all the accessible hill forests to the communities to the extent that they are able and willing to manage them; zentrusting the users with the task of protecting and managing the forests, with the users receiving all of the income; zre-training the entire staff of the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation to enable them to perform their new role as advisers and extension workers. Investigations in forest management have shown conclusively that a great many village communities have been managing their forest resources effectively, cre-ating institutional arrangements to ensure the basic protection of hill forests andthe enforcement of access and use rights. Many of these local management sys-tems evolved over the past 35 years, and proved more effective than manage-ment by the Forest Department, which had been plagued by constant budgetand staff cuts. 2266 Despite the diversity of situations, one broad general lesson emerges from working with natural resource policies throughout the world. While it is essen-tial to establishan leg-islation in its interpretation and some site-level decision-making to fit at best thespecificities of different contexts. It is therefore important to remain aware ofthe distinction between the CM provisions that more appropriately belong tonational law and those that more appropriately belong to specific managementagreements, as proposed in Box 10.8. 26Gilmour and almost synonymous with local governance, because it requires local power and capacity to exist and succeed, but also because it is, byits very nature, an instrument of local empowerment. The institutional landscapeof local governance is complex and varies greatly from country to country. Inmost respects, local governance is much more than local government; it encom-passes a wide range of organisations and institutions, both formal and informal,all of whom have a role to play in the allocation and use of rights and responsi-bilities at the local level. Local partners in co-management processes and agree-ments can be of various types, and policies are required to facilitate their partici-pation in management. An important innovation for the sustainable management of natural resources is a component of broader policy principles that goes under the name of \"sub-sidiarity\". Basically, this calls for a government to decentralise, delegate ordevolve authority and responsibilities in several branches of social life to thelowest possible level with capacity to take responsibility for the relevant tasks(see Boxes 10.9 and 10.10). The subsidiarity principle has been re-affirmed byseveral national and international documents and agreements (see also Chapter4). 2277Devolving rights and responsibilities in natural resource management, enhancing local autonomy in defining landscapes and seascapes, managing nat-ural resources and planning and implementing development and conservationinitiatives are powerful means to awaken the capacities of civil society (seeChecklist 10.1 and Box in favour of local stakeholders to govern the negotiation and allocation of rights and responsibilities zMechanism for participatory monitoring, evaluation, reporting, arbitration and dispute resolution zGuaranteeing the respect of the rights of \"rightholders\", most especially indigenous peo- ples (including mobile indigenous peoples), trib-al and local communities zDelegation of authority to local rights\u2014 and stake-holders for enforcement zDelegation of authority to local rightholders for revenue generation zGeneral conditions for termination of contractual agreementszPurpose and scope of the agreement zSpecific allocation of rights, responsibilities and resources among co-management partners zDuration of the agreement zTermination and amendment procedures zTransparency and accountability zSpecific benefits zSpecific conditions for termination of contractu- al agreements 27See for example the basic principles of the ecosystem approach adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD): www.biodiv.org , INSTRUMENTS 357While the specific policies and arrangements for local governance vary greatly between countries and regions depending on social and political history and con-ditions, many co-management bodies include representatives et al., 2002) A recent compilation and analysis of case studies of natural resource governance examined experiences in three Asian and eight southern African countries and from those derived the following typology oforganisations found to exercise local authority over common property resources: z Distrrict oorrganisations.These included local government organisations such as Rural District Councils in Zimbabwe and Panchayats in India, and multi-stakeholder district structures aligned to line depart- ments such as Wildlife Management Authorities in Zambia and forest farms in China. zVillage ccommittees.These are typically initiated and encouraged by government agencies, e.g.the Village Natural Resource Management Committees in Malawi and Forest Protection Committees inIndia. z Corrporrate, llegal oorrganisations.These are composed of all rightholders and/ or residents, as Trusts (Botswana), Conservancies (Namibia), Communal Property Associations, Villages and RangeManagement Associations. z Householdsand iindividuals. In these cases, households and individuals are found to exercise varying degrees of authority over species selection, wildlife harvesting practices, sale and consumption, andthe distribution of benefits. z Indigenous aand ttrraditional rrule-mmaking iinstitutions.These are largely self-initiated organisations that operate outside the state hierarchy, and include traditional leaders, resident associations and share-holding schemes. Examples include the Councils of Elders in the Solomon Islands or the traditional adat village governance institutions in Sumatra that have re-emerged after the New Order period. Throughout the world, such traditional organisations still play important roles in natural resource man- agement and represent local voices ppeerrssppeeccttiivveess oonn ddeecceennttrraalliissaattiioonn aanndd ddeevvoolluuttiioonn 4.1, the words \"decentralisation\"and \"devolution\"are sometimes used inter-changeably. Yet, they connote very different processes. The term decentralisation is used to refer to the physical dispersal of operations to the local level, but also to describe the delegation of a greater degree of decision making authority to lower levels of gov-ernment administration. Decentralisation thus refers to the distribution of functions and powers from acentral authority to regional or local authorities, but the latter are essentially part of the same structure asthe central authority. A federal structure with strong provincial control, for instance, is more decen-tralised than one that is solely controlled by the central government. Devolution is more radical, involving the transfer of authority and control from one agency to a com- pletely different one, usually more \"local\" and of a different origin. Effective devolution is as yet rare inthe world, for the simple reason that those in power do not want to give it up, or do not believe thatlocal institutions can perform! Even governments willing to devolve the rights to manage and use localresources, tend to retain conflict management functions, budgetary controls, and other functions that keep the local institutions effectively under their control. 28 28Parodi, 1971; Burns et al. , 1994. 29Esman and Uphoff, 1984.358 SHARING POWERstructures (see some examples in Box 10.11). Local administrators and government agencies are important actors in co-management for a number of reasons, includ-ing the following: zlocal administrators should be elected bodies and thus provide a measure of local representation; zlocal government agencies are expected, at least in theory, to provide a measure of public accountability; zlocal government agencies are also expected to advance \"fair rules\" in institu- tional arrangements. Yet, we should refrain from assuming that local administrators and agencies always and effectively represent the interests and concerns of their local constituencies.On the contrary! In situations where the electoral process has been recently intro-duced, is poorly understood, unfairly practiced and/ or limited to making a choiceamong candidates who have little to do with the local environment, the experi-ence is not flattering for local governments as natural resource managers.Customary NRM bodies or even local civil society organisations would have muchbetter chances to succeed. As a matter of fact, it is good to promote the involve-ment of both local governmental agencies and traditional authorities in co-man- agement bodies, to introduce a good measure of transparency and to promotelocal communication and mutual learning. Box 10.10 EExxaammpplleess ooff ggoovveerrnnmmeenntt ppoolliicciieess With the overthrow of long-time dictator Moussa Traore in Mali, a new constitution was framed, provid- ing for the empowerment of local communities. A process of widespread consultation with various sec-tors of the population resulted in the demand to grant land tenure and resource management rights tolocal communities. In 1992, these demands were included in a rural development policy, and in 1993, alaw on decentralisation was passed, granting to the local Communes sizeable independent administra- tive powers, including the right to manage the resources in their territories. The state retained overall tutelage, i.e. the right to intervene to enforce the law and public interest. Benjaminsen30refers to this setup, in which governments delegate considerable responsibility and powers to manage local resources,while providing the policies, laws, and technical support, as \"the core of co-management\". Yet, somehave been doubtful about the real reasons behind this policy and its sustainability, as it was at least part-ly a result of the urging of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, whose structural adjustmentmodel requires loosening of governmental controls. In India, two constitutional amendments of far-reaching consequence have been adopted in 1992, one granting village bodies ( Panchayats ) several powers, and the other doing the same for municipal bodies. A follow-up law in 1996 has extended considerable autonomy to tribal areas, though not the self-rulethat some of the tribal movements have been asking for. Later, however, state governments provided theirown interpretations, usually highly watered down, to these changed constitutional provisions. When itcomes to actual implementation, a considerable control seems to remain with centralised bureaucraciesand politicians, unless grassroots movements force actual devolution. In Uganda, the deposing of Dictator Idi Amin in 1979 marked the beginnings of a hesitant move towards democracy. But it was not until the National Resistance Movement (NRM) took over in 1986 that exten-sive decentralisation of political functioning started. Through constitutional changes and new legislation(such as the Local Councils Statute, the Local Governments Act, and a new Constitution in 1995),greater power to decide about natural resources has been granted to parishes and other local-level bod-ies. 30Benjaminsen, society necessarily demand that civil society be organised, which requires some form of legal or policy basis for: zthe constitution, registration and operation of groups and organisations; zthe ability of these organisations to generate, manage and invest funds; zthe possibility to vest authority for the management of publicly-owned assets, including natural resources, to these organisations; zthe involvement of these organisations in specific management activities and programmes, including planning, monitoring and research, information man- agement, enforcement and sustainable resource use; zthe provision of technical and capacity-building support by state agencies to these organisations; zthe facilitation of networking and communication among civil society organisa- tions, as a mechanism for organisational strengthening, capacity-building and advocacy. Research carried out in nineteen countries by a global network of civil society organisations and research institutes has identified legal frameworks that have thepotential of enabling and strengthening civil society. 3311While the legal frameworks are not sufficient by themselves, they can provide an enabling context. Suchenabling legislation will often need to be combined, in mutually supporting ways,with reforms in economic and fiscal measures to regenerate local livelihood assets(natural, financial, physical, human and social) and create safe spaces to expressinterests and concerns and discuss options integrity generate credible institutions, which perform their governance duties,including negotiating and enforcing resource useregulations, with confidence and public support.This is true for a wide range of contexts, but particu-larly so for indigenous peoples and many rural com-munities, for whom cultural identity, a living nativelanguage and collective practices help conserve ashared body of traditional ecological knowledge.Many co-management processes are thus smoothedand made more sustainable when all or some of theinvolved parties are bonded by a strong shared cul-ture. Policies and legislation in support of co-manage- ment of natural resources can take advantage of this,and build upon cultural identity and customary gov-ernance systems. This requires, most of all, a size-able measure of flexibility, necessary to accommo- 31For more information see www.ids.ac.uk/logolink . The LogoLink web pages contain a number of resources on ways to help civil society to organise, including recent research on legal frameworks for citizen participation, participatory planning, and participation in local budgets and resource decisions. 32See Banuri and Najam, 2002. This is further discussed later in this Chapter and in Chapter 11.360 SHARING POWERdate for the complexity of ethnic governance systems. Ethnic governance usually includes a body of norms ( e.g., customary law and practice), procedures ( e.g., decisional processes, conflict management and dispute settlement), specificknowledge, and individuals playing specific roles (often the traditional leaders). Inethnic governance, land and resource tenure are normally ascribed at the sametime to several actors, which include households, extended families, villages, line-ages, clans, etc. Overlapping claims are recognised on a same territory, definingdifferent types of rights and specific rules (norms on circulation of people andaccess to resources, decisional councils, rituals, myths, etc.) that ensure liveli-hoods. 3333Conflicts are generally solved by local traditional authorities. When tradi- tional authorities have lost the capacity to maintain the respect of rules (at timesbecause they have been officially disempowered and \"dismantled\") conflictingclaims on the same land and resources may generate open clashes among localcommunities and the state, private developers and migrants. Aware of this, somecountries are reversing past policies and slowly recognising traditional institutionsfor natural resource management as potential powerful allies (see Box 10.11). Box al. , 2003) In the early 1980s the central government of Indonesia decided to outright replace the traditional local authorities (the clan-based margas ) of Lahat district (Sumatra) with bureaucrats of the modern state. With decisions taken in \"far away offices\", they also greatly expanded the lot of protected areas in theregion, transforming many local people into illegal residents \"with a stroke of pen\". It was right at thattime that the price of coffee also rose significantly in world markets and more and more people, includ-ing many opportunistic migrants, started entering protected forests in order to grow coffee. The original marga system was very effective in protecting timber and non-timber products from outside exploiters and in dealing intelligently with environmental resources ( e.g., farming was commonly banned within 100 metres from springs). Unfortunately, the system was first seriously weakened by theDutch colonial powers that established a policy of \"shooting on sight\" for people who would disobeytheir formal, top-down prohibitions ( e.g.would enter a protected forest). Later, after a brief period of resurgence at the time of independence, the system was formally dismantled by national law in 1979.Locally, this was perceived as an attempt by the Javanese elite in the government to gain overall controlover the natural resources of the country. In practice, a weak, inexperienced, poorly funded andbureaucratic apparatus abysmally failed at controlling access to the natural resources and only succeed-ed in transforming the old communal forests into an open access regime. More and more people invad-ed the protected forests to take advantage of the lucrative coffee markets and deforestation rapidlyensued. With the fall of the Suharto regime, in the late 1990s, Indonesia has adopted a new forestry manage- ment policy that sets in motion opportunities to devolve forest management responsibilities to the locallevel. Management responsibility can be taken up by local communities organised in either traditionalforms (such as the marga ) or modern cooperatives. The forestry authorities retain an important role as providers of technical advice. This new devolution policy is not likely to become a panacea, and espe-cially so in a context of weakened civil society and shrewd local politicians that can quickly gatherbenefits for themselves. It is, however, a major innovation\u2014 an experiment that many should veryclosely watch. The formal recognition of customary governance systems is more of a challengein countries deriving their legal tradition from Roman law than in common-law 33See, for instance, Box 3.5 in Chapter 3, and Baird and Dearden, 2003. NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND support of the cultural dimension of conservation are based on generating and disseminating information on community values, knowledge, skills, resources and institutions and promoting aware-ness about the natural resource management capacities embedded into local cultures. For instance, inMorocco the place where botanists still find the few existing patches of \"original vegetation\" in thecountry are not the official protected areas but the \" marabous cemeteries\"\u2014 conserved in a nearly pris- tine state because of the traditional respect and care by the local communities. These local forms ofconservation are only beginning to be recognised as part of the patrimony of the country. In India, tradi-tional water harvesting systems that had been left to decay for a long time have been revitalised inrecent decades with wonderful success. 3388In Peru, the maintenance of agro-biodiversity is closely relat- ed to the maintenance of customary patterns of resource use and exchanges, and some community-originated initiatives are attempting to get this recognised at the national level. 3399 Policies can encourage and support activities ( e.g., ceremonies, festivals, fairs) where the people cele- brate their cultures, enjoy their artistic manifestations, and show their pride for their lands and the beau-ty and wealth of their environments. These activities not only have strong impact locally, but also con-tribute to positioning the local cultures as a vital part of a national heritage. A simple but powerful poli- 34See Chapter 9. 35This has origins in colonial impositions, as for the Cabildo of Ecuador and the Capitania of Bolivia. 36Lack of sensitivity for the local context may bring agencies to \"assign\" positions of authority and financial advantages that a mount to local revolutions. In B\u00e9nin, a conservation initiative assisting communities in the southern periphery of Parc W has provided j obs, social status and financial advantages to local poachers, in the hope that they abandon their practices and assist the governmental ag encies instead. Such interventions are poorly sustainable (they are totally dependent on project resources), dubiously effective (the poachers now understand all the ways by which the agencies carry out their surveillance work) and capable of engendering profound social dis- ruptions in the local communities (the poachers, who were among the least capable and respected members of local societies, are now incomparably wealthier than the rest and even considered as primary referents to the external project). 37An example is a GEF initiative currently (2004) engaged to revise the entire training curriculum of protected areas personnel i n Morocco, seeking a better and more sensitive understanding of the unique characteristics and capacities of communities for the conservat ion of biodiversity (M. Rashid, personal communication, 2004). 38CSE, 1997. 39This is true for the Potato Park, in the region of Cusco (Alejandro Argumedo, personal communication, 2003).countries. Where national legislation does not \"formally recognise\" and \"allow\" indigenous peoples and local communities to play their role in natural resourcemanagement, co-management advocates may wish to lobby for policy reform.Even where favourable legislation exists, however, its proper implementation mayneed to be specifically demanded and supported. Embracing cultural diversity inthe co-management of natural resources often implies a radical transformation inthe organisational culture of government departments and changes in professionalbeliefs, behaviours, attitudes and practice. 3344For instance, the tendency to impose \"rational\" organisational models on local communities3355is often counterproduc- tive, and even financial and technical \"support\" may leverage the worst ratherthan the best in them, spreading internal conflicts and corruption. 3366Most commu- nities can best organise by choosing themselves the models that best suit their cul-ture and needs. If those will change, they should do so from within and notbecause of external imposition. Examples of broad policy directions supportingcultural diversity for co-management include the promotion of culture-sensitivecurricula in basic education and professional training, 3377appreciation and support provided to local languages and local cultural initiatives and, in general, therecognition of the cultural dimension of natural resource is to maintain, respect, and restore, as necessary, the local, ethnic names of species and places. Traditional knowledge, customary laws and institutions, biodiversity names and uses, and locallanguages and dialects are all interconnected. In this sense, a revival of indigenous and local languageshelps to maintain alive a body of knowledge that is indiscernible from the language in which it isexpressed and may be critical to landscape and natural resource management. In general, it has been adeplorable trend of protected area managers and agencies to change traditional names of places withother names that mean little or nothing to people of the region. For instance, in Ecuador, protected areamanagers changed the name romerillo that people use to give to their local forests, with Podocarpus,which is the Latin name for the same species. The Park thus became \" Podocarpus National Park\"\u2014 aname that means nothing to people. Fortunately, these practices are becoming less common, and localnames and languages are increasing their national and international visibility. Examples of protectedareas that conserve their traditional names in local languages exist for Australia, Colombia, Malaysia,South Africa, Mexico and several other countries. 4400 40Borrini-Feyerabend et al. , 2004 (in press). 41Barraclough and Pimbert, 2004 (in press). 42See Bassi, 2003. In all cases, institutionalising the rights of the hitherto excluded is a conflictive endeavour, depending on the purpose- ful organisation and mobilisation of those who stand to benefit (Barraclough the conquered by confiscating their lands or otherwise limiting their access to property. Especially in agrarian soci-eties, control of land, water and other natural resources by ruling elites has beenthe principal mechanism employed for consolidating the monopoly of political,economic and social power throughout society. Present-day rights that regulateaccess and tenure of resources among diverse social actors are extremely variedfrom country to country and within a country among different localities.Generally, the rules regulating the use of, and control over, land and other naturalresources reflect the interests of dominant social actors at the time these ruleswere institutionalised by custom or law. These rules, however, are not static andimmutable. They evolve in response to social change and it is not unthinkablethat-as human rights hopeful-ly become better understood, recognised and pro-tected-the ones hitherto excluded from the control of natural resources will bettercome to the fore. Indigenous peoples, landless workers, small producers, mobilecommunities as well as low-income consumers and all others who are dependenton natural resources but without property rights over them, may hopefully acquiresome form of rights entitling them to an equitable participation in their manage-ment and benefits. Effective collaborative management agreements are a step in this direction, in par- ticular when they manage to provide clear and secure rules to regulate the accessto and uses of natural resources. If diverse social groups do not have a sense ofsecurity of their individual and collective rights over natural resources, they can-not participate effectively in their management. 4411Novel legal arrangements can be explored and developed at the national level to provide that. For instance,some formal recognition of \"primary\" rights to land (property or permanentusufruct) could be provided to communities with a long-standing local history andpracticing an ecologically sound model of sustainable resource use. This couldhelp them re-affirm their rights versus newcomers and opportunistic users.4422As mentioned in the preceding section, this also implies that national legislation andpolicies accommodate for a fair degree of local peculiarities and complexity. Inparticular, they should refrain from imposing organisational models to communi-ties but seek to recognise what exists and is locally legitimate. The explicit formalNATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 363recognition of customary law, collective rights and customary regulations and bodies dealing with NRM conflicts are likely to be particularly important. A number of resources not specifically related to land rights may have crucial rel- evance for communities within their wider productive and livelihoods systems, forexample mobile resources ( e.g., water, wildlife and fisheries) or resources located in areas firmly owned or occupied by the state or other social actors. The identifi-cation of such resources requires the involvement of traditional knowledge hold-ers, as most of them are used in a customary way and may not be known toeverybody in the communities, and even less to government agencies and out-siders. Some of these resources may not be of critical importance for the physicalsurvival of the people but vital in a cultural sense. Other resources may be essen-tial only in times of drought or special scarcity, and thus critically important forthe long-term survival of certain communities. Typically, this has been the case forwater, pastures, game, fuel wood, building materials and other resources nowincluded in official protected areas, which communities would still like to accessin difficult circumstances. Tenure and resource access security and rights in such special circumstances imply complicated legal challenges, especially when having to reconcile commu-nity, private and state interests, but are not out of the realm of creativeinstitutions. 4433In fact, it may be useful that communities involved in mapping and inventory exercises identify the resources they traditionally use even outside the boundaries of their customary lands. In Mexico, the state of San Luis Potosi recog-nised use rights over a long pilgrimage route used by the Huichol indigenous peo-ple outside their traditional lands, facilitated agreements with owners and otherusers, and declared the area a Natural and Cultural Reserve, where traditionaluses by the indigenous population are legally allowed. 4444In the North of Russia, the Kytalyk Reserve, established on the basis of an agreement with the Even peo-ple on their traditional lands, was extended over an area that the communitiesconsidered sacred far from their traditional grazing and hunting grounds. 4455 Related to the above, the Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) of indigenous and local communities need to be clarified and protected. Countries members of theWorld Trade Organisation (WTO) are under strong pressure to adopt the US modelof intellectual property rights. This model strongly favours the rights of global cor-porations to claim patents on medicinal plants, agricultural seeds, and otheraspects of biodiversity, even in cases where the biological material has beenunder cultivation and development by indigenous people or farming communitiesfor millennia. By eroding secular rights over biological resources, informal innova-tions and collective knowledge, the risk is that IPRs will shift the control over pro-duction, livelihoods and environment from local communities to the corporatesector through the following interrelated processes: zErosion oof ffarmmers' rrightts.Traditional livelihood and survival strategies of small farmers based on saving, exchanging, breeding or replanting seeds are under threat from globally uniform IPR rules adopted by governments.4466 zPrivattisattion oof ttradittional kknowledge.IPRs privatise, commercialise, plunder and erode traditional knowledge without any rewards for custodians (women, 43National protected areas in the UK, France, Italy and Spain have such characteristics, and yet manage to develop viable managem ent plans. from the relevant needs of poor people to the demands of companies (focus on high-profit, high-yielding varieties and medicinal drugs). For many farmers and indigenous peoples, the enclosure of genetic resources and knowledge through IPR regimes also threatens the diversity of common propertycultures by which the rights of local communities over natural resources and com-munity knowledge are ensured. Most of these communities have traditionallyviewed plants and seeds as part of the community commons, not subject to own-ership and fee structures imposed by outside corporations. This is becoming moreof an issue when the communities share their knowledge in the context of co- management processes and agreements. The lossof control of information is a major concern forpeople whose political and spiritual power mayderive from their traditional knowledge. 4488\"One size fits all\" IPR law should be abandoned to per-mit reassertion of rules that respect and favour theneeds of local and domestic communities as wellas the protection of innovations and knowledgedeveloped over time. 4499Even in the absence of specific national legislation that recognises andprotects the knowledge and innovations of localcommunities and indigenous peoples, there areways of safeguarding these through specificagreements and procedures, 5500which are of partic- ular relevance and to self determination is important for indigenous peoples throughout the world. Starting during colonial domination and continuing with independentstates, the overriding policy objective vis-\u00e0-vis indigenous peoples has been their integration into the national society while denying them their rights to use andregulate access to their resources, to exercise their customary laws and to controldecision-making concerning their future. Many of their traditional lands havebeen taken over by the state and later exploited by extractive industries and for\"development\" projects, or set aside for protected areas. Those who resisted thesetrends were marginalised and castigated, and often treated as \"anti-development\"or subversive. Indigenous peoples have consistently argued that they are notagainst development per se , but cannot accept a kind of development that leads them towards social disintegration and ecological wastelands. They wish a differ-ent kind of development, related to their needs and aspirations. In this sense, theircall for the \"right to self-determination\" can be interpreted as their wish to decidewhat type of development shall happen in their communities and to retain controlover their lives, which is intimately related to their land and natural resources. Formany indigenous peoples the right to self-determination thus appears a fundamen-tal condition towards re-assuming responsibility for natural resource management.This would imply that national governments discontinue their integrationist poli- 47GRAIN, 2004 48Dermot Smyth, INSTRUMENTS 365cies and related practices, first of all involuntary or induced resettlements,5511and rather provide scope for people to make informed decisions about their futurethrough a variety of participatory processes for assessing, planning and evaluatingdevelopment and conservation initiatives. New enabling policies could stipulateand ensure just that. Enabling policies, however, cannot limit themselves to looking towards the future. In many cases, they also need to ensure that pastright violations are also addressed, for instance vialand restitution and other fair compensation process- es. There is overwhelming evidence of the negative impacts inflicted uponindigenous land and resources because of government-led or private operation.This has included community displacements for a variety of reasons, includingthe establishment of large dams, plantation forests, protected areas, intensiveshrimp farming and rangeland development schemes. Mandatory provisions canbe made in national law to redress such impacts and damages, providing faircompensation for the damages suffered and restitution for the territories expropri-ated. 5522As changes have often occurred since the time of expropriation, commu- nities may need some form of specific support to re-establish their livelihoodseven when lands are \"restituted\". In certain cases, a sense of community owner-ship can be rekindled through affirmative policies that make possible effectiveattribution and security of tenure, building upon traditional management prac-tices and grassroots-based dialogue on desired futures. 5533Other compensation schemes, such as eco-tourism ventures, may be newer for local communitiesand require technical assistance to be established effectively. Importantly, a legalrepresentative and/ or a legal team specialising in land rights should be on handif not permanently representing the communities' case for reparation. Throughclear policy commitments \"to level the playing field\", government agencies canplay important roles to assure that indigenous and local communities are fullyinformed about their rights to land restitution and the equitable compensation ofother suffered damages 5544... although this facilitation role may be better suited to NGOs. Initiatives at various levels can help ensure the respect of rights over traditional and common lands and the redressing of past injustices. At the national level,enabling policies can support communities to demarcate and protect their terri-torial or marine boundaries against external threats and political impositions.Either as a precondition for legal recognition of ownership and access rights, oras a provisional alternative to it, area demarcation is a central requirement fortenure security of indigenous and local communities engaged in co-management(Box 10.13). In the last few years, especially in the Amazon region but also inother regions, there has been a strong engagement in demarcation of collectiveterritories, in most cases carried out by indigenous organisations with the supportof external organisations. In traditional land tenure, permanent physical bound-aries are less important than resource boundaries, which are changing andadaptable. Under modern legal systems, however, the recognition of land rightsrequires the identification of permanent physical boundaries. In this sense,demarcation provides the basis for the legal recognition of natural resources andlandscapes valued by local actors. Demarcation implies not only the physicalidentification and signalling of borders, but a complex process of recognitionand mapping of a territory, often including a rapid biodiversity inventory as well.Once demarcation is done, steps need to be taken for its legal recognition. This 51Cernea and Schmidt-Soltau, 2003. 52See some examples in Table 4.3 and Boxes 4.3 and 7.11. 53A very interesting example is described particularly important in areas where there are conflicts over lands and resources, and where external forces could resort to violence, abuse andencroachment into community lands. National policies are crucial to allow andsupport such and IHRLG, 2003) On August 31, 2001, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued its ruling in the \"Case of the Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni Community versus Nicaragua\" concluding that Nicaragua had violated the rights of the Mayagna community by granting a logging concession within its territory without theconsent of the community and by ignoring the consistent complaints of the Awas Tingni for demarca-tion of its territory. According to an \"evolutionary interpretation\", the Court noted that Article 21 of theAmerican Convention on Human Rights, which recognises the right to private property, also protects\"the rights of members of the indigenous communities within the framework of communal property.\"Establishing an important precedent for the defence of indigenous rights within the international system,the Court affirmed that indigenous territorial rights arise from the communities \"possession of the land\"as rooted in their own \"customary law, values, customs and mores.\" These rights are not dependent onthe existence of a formal title granted by the state. The Court recognised the importance that indigenouspeoples place on their relationship with the land, highlighting that \"indigenous groups, by the fact oftheir very existence, have the right to live freely in their own territory; the close ties of indigenous peo-ple with the land must be recognised and understood as the fundamental basis of their cultures, theirspiritual life, their integrity, and their economic survival.\" The Awas Tingni decision declares the duty of states to demarcate and title indigenous communal land to make effective the rights recognised by the American Convention. The Court ruled that the lack ofdemarcation of indigenous territories prevents indigenous peoples from the free use and enjoyment oftheir lands and resources. As such, the lack of effective juridical mechanisms for demarcation consti-tutes a violation of the judicial protection and property rights of indigenous peoples as guaranteed provide effective direction for and support to co-management, natural resource policy and other supporting policy instruments often go beyond the mereexpression of objectives and desired situations. For instance, they stipulate specif-ic provisions to promote the development and functioning of successful co-man-agement arrangements and agreements. This section presents the main areaswhere appropriate legislation can help to empower, stimulate and the provision of adequate information to stake- holders in advance of consulting with them. In doing so, planners need to remem-ber that different stakeholders will have different levels of technical expertise andlocal knowledge. Biologists, for example, may know very little about the socio-economic situation in an area, while local and indigenous communities are likelyto have little background in conservation-related sciences. Efforts in effectivesocial communication would provide many occasions for people not only toreceive information but to share it, discuss it and make sense of it in a collectiveNATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 367Besides access to information, and as rightly linked in the Aarhus Convention, effective participation in co-management also requires transparency and account-ability and a fair recourse to justice available to all. This can be achieved through: zpublic reporting requirements stipulated within the provisions of co-manage- ment agreements; zthird-party monitoring of the implementation of co-management agreements, by non-governmental organisations, governmental agencies, media houses or independent bodies; zmechanisms for sanctions when there is a lack of compliance with the provi- sions of co-management agreements (one key challenge in this regard is to ensure that the mechanisms for sanction apply to all parties in co-manage-ment agreements, and not only to civil society and community partners); zthe involvement, whenever required, of active political bodies and civil socie- ty pressure groups; za reliable and fair judicial system that includes provisions for legal recourse 2003) The Aarhus Convention was negotiated in 1998 at the Fourth Ministerial Conference on the \"Environment for Europe\" in Aarhus (Denmark) and sponsored by the United Nations EconomicCommission for Europe. Since then, 24 nations in Europe and Central Asia have become parties to thetreaty, and 40 have signed it. The treaty entered into force in October 2001, and is now open to signa-ture by all nations of the world. The Aarhus Convention links environment and human rights. It acknowledges that this generation has an obligation to future generations and establishes that sustainable development can only be achievedthrough the involvement of all actors. Thus, it focuses on enhancing interactions between civil societyand public authorities in a democratic context and on forging a new process for public participation inthe negotiation and implementation of international agreements. At heart, the Convention is about gov-ernment accountability, transparency and responsiveness. It grants rights to civil society actors andimposes on parties and public authorities obligations regarding access to information, fair and transpar-ent decision-making processes, and access to redress. 5555For example, the convention requires broad access to information about the state of air and atmosphere, water, land, and biological diversity; infor-mation about influences on the environment such as energy, noise, development plans, and policies;and information about how these influences affect human health and safety. There is growing interest in endorsing the Aarhus principles in Latin America, southern Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region, but many other countries perceive the Convention's concepts of democratic deci-sion-making about the environment as too liberal or threatening to commercial confidentiality.context. In many cases, language may be a barrier, and materials will need to bepresented in appropriate local languages. Many of these requirements can andshould be guided by policy statements. Whenever possible, they should also beguaranteed by legislation. The Convention on Access to Information, PublicParticipation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters,usually referred to as Aarhus Convention, is particularly noteworthy in this regard(Box 10.14). 55See www.unece.org/env/pp368 SHARING POWERpartners in co-management agreements; the system should provide for arbitra- tion in cases of conflict, and guarantee the equality of advocacy in case ofdispute. Related to access to information and transparency is the legal recognition of the right to information and Prior Informed Consent (PIC) of local communities andindigenous peoples. The countries that ratified the ILO Convention 169 andundertook to implement the Convention on Biological Diversity are increasinglyconsidering incorporation of the right to prior and informed consent (PIC) on mat-ters beyond traditional knowledge. This trend is to be supported and encouraged,as it has evident benefits for the lands and resources of indigenous peoples andlocal communities. PIC should be a central tenet of policies and practices for theco-management of natural resources. In the Philippines, for example, local com-munities on Coron Island have used the principle of PIC effectively to assert theirrights and their own vision of the future (Box and De Vera, 2003) The Tagbanwa people of the Philippines inhabit a stunningly beautiful limestone island for which they have established stringent use regulations. The forest resources are to be used for domestic purposesonly. All the freshwater lakes but one are sacred. Entry to those lakes is strictly forbidden for all exceptreligious and cultural purposes. The only lake accessible for tourism is Lake Kayangan, which has regu-lations concerning number of people allowed in, garbage disposal, resource use, etc. Until recently, theTagbanwas' territorial rights were not legally recognised, leading to encroachment by migrant fishers,tourism operators, politicians seeking land deals and government agencies. This caused several prob-lems, chief among whom was the impoverishment of the marine resources, essential for the local liveli-hood. In the mid-1980s, however, the islanders organised themselves into the Tagbanwas Foundation ofCoron Island and started lobbying to regain management control over their natural resources. They first applied for a Community Forest Stewardship Agreement, which was granted in 1990 over the 7748 hectares of Coron Island and a neighbouring island, Delian, but not over the marine areas. In1998, they managed to get a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim for 22,284 hectares of land andmarine waters and finally, in 2001, after having produced a high quality map and an Ancestral LandManagement Plan, they managed to obtain a Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT), whichgrants them collective right to their land. Despite their successful management achievements, the Tagnabwa CADT was later reviewed, as the national policies and systems were being restructured. A governmental proposal was then advanced toadd Coron Island to the National Integrated Protected Area System. Despite the fact that the govern-ment proposed to set in place a co-management system for the island, the Tagbanwas opposed themove, as they feared that they would lose control of their natural resources, and those would be lessand not better protected. Very importantly for them, they wish to remain \"rightholders\"\u2014 the ownersand protectors of their territories\u2014 and refuse to be classified as one \"stakeholder\" among others.Another reason mentioned by the Tagbanwa for their refusal to accept the government proposal is thefact that Coron Island was selected as one of the 8 sites to be part of the programme without any con-sultation with them and thus without their prior informed consent. The refusal to comply with the co-management programme, however, does not mean that Coron Island is less well managed than otherenvironments protected by the state. Possibly even the contrary, as the indigenous right holders have setin place restrictive measures for resource access and use, including a strong curbing of tourism.NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY anypartnership or identifying the minimum com- mon denominator of the wishes of everyone. It is about partnerships that givepower, rights and responsibilities to those who have a primary stake in the useand management of natural resources, and who are in the position to contributeto and guarantee their sustainable and equitable use. Legal instruments should nottightly specify who the partners should be, but lay out the procedure that shouldbe followed to identify such partners and to allocate rights and responsibilitieswithin specific management instruments and agreements. In particular, naturalresource policy and legal instruments can and should provide safeguards againstthe marginalisation and exclusion of some of the potential partners. For example,national parks legislation can stipulate that municipalities adjacent to protectedareas should automatically be represented on that protected area's managementbody. Similarly, forestry legislation can stipulate the roles that user groups play inco-management institutions. \"Affirmative\" (proactive) national policies are often needed to promote equity in capacity building at the community level. Indigenous peoples and local commu-nities, both rural and urban, comprise groups with different interests and agendas,including some with relatively more power and greater access to resources thanothers. Women or ethnic minorities may play a more marginal role and may begreatly interested in mechanisms to secure a more meaningful involvement in co-management decisions . One way governments can address this concern is to ensure that relevant information reaches everyone and that all community mem-bers can openly participate in discussions over co-management agreements. Thismay be more feasible in some cultural contexts than in others. In some villages,for instance, women may prefer influencing decisions within the household ratherthan speaking in public. In general, greater equity in capacity building initiativesmay help marginalised or weaker actors such as women, ethnic minorities andpoorer social groups to regain some power and standing within their communitiesand co-management bodies. It is not always the case that a particular stakeholder group is clear about its own interests and concerns regarding a particular situation or environmental option,including the establishment of a protected area or its relation to it. It is also notoften the case that such stakeholders have figured out how to get themselves \"rep-resented\" in discussions with others. At times NGOs claim to speak for local com-munities, indigenous leaders claim to speak for their peoples, or private sectorindustry association representatives claim to speak on behalf of their membershipbut these forms of \"internal organisation\" are more top down than genuine. Thiscan cause problems, when, for example, protected areas authorities claim to have\"consulted\" with indigenous peoples or a local community, but the communitydoes not in fact feel that it was fairly represented in the planning process. As amatter of fact, most if not all co-management arrangements involve some form ofrepresentation in governing bodies and management organisations. Legal instru-ments for natural resource management must therefore specify the mechanisms bywhich the representatives of people and civil society organisations are selected.These mechanisms should be as much in line with participatory democracy aspossible, for instance by involving some form of open discussion of issues fol-lowed by an election and/ or a selection through customary community decisionsas well as mechanisms for follow up and accountability. And avoid imposing externally-conceived organising systems on local communities, and rather respect as much as possible their culture-embed-ded institutions. 5566 A more mundane but similarly important element of capacity building for all rightholders and stakeholders is the possibility to overcome time and travel con-straints. 5577Participation is expensive, particularly for local communities and indige- nous peoples. Taking time off work for meetings is not an option for many ruralpeople, unless the process is designed with their particular needs in mind, such asavoiding harvest or fishing times, key religious or cultural events, and findingsome means to meet the difficulty and expense of travelling, particularly in theremote rural areas where many protected areas are located. Local officials ofpoorly funded protected area agencies and local government units face similarproblems. Policies in support of co-management need to make provisions to coverat least some of the costs of meetings. FFiinnaanncciiaall aanndd eeccoonnoommiicc ppoolliicciieess One of the fundamental assumptions of co-management is that community-based and collaborative approaches reduce management costs. In a typical co-manage-ment arrangement, several of the functions that would otherwise be performed bystate agencies are delegated to local government agencies, civil society organisa-tions, community groups and users of natural resources. This is bound to reducethe costs borne by the central management agency. But this does not mean thatthe costs have been eliminated. They may have been reduced, as it would indeedbe more efficient for a local agency to carry out, for instance, a monitoring func-tion, instead of having a team of technicians travelling from the national orprovincial capital at regular intervals to collect samples or interview informants.Yet, most of the costs required for management would not be eliminated but sim-ply transferred from the central to the local level. This observation under- scores the need for fairand complete assess-ments of the costs ofmanagement, and forclear rules that governthe allocation of respon-sibility in regard. Ininstances where collab-orative arrangementsplace responsibility forthe management ofresources in this should beaccompanied by atransfer of financialresources through adirect budget allocation, a rental fee, or the transfer of authority to generate financial resources from man-agement. 5588 56See various considerations and examples in Chapter 5. 57See Box 9.1 in Chapter 9. 58An example is described in Box 9.2 in Chapter 9.NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 371Very useful policies also establish the right and capacity of local co-management partners to generate revenue, and provide both autonomy and accountability inthe use of that revenue. One of the specific instruments that can bring tangiblebenefits to local actors is the sharing of revenue from tourism and other commer-cial concessions, hunting and fishing licenses and permits, trade licenses, andsales of timber and non-timber forest products. In Botswana, for example, theWildlife Conservation and National Parks Act provides communities with theopportunity to apply to the government for rights to manage the wildlife in theirarea, including the enforcement of regulated hunting. 5599 Indeed, co-management practices on the ground are supported and fostered by national policies that combat poverty and attempt to reduce social and economicinequality. At a general level, it is the broader national and international politicaland economic context that presents major opportunities or obstacles for co-man-agement. For instance, neo-liberal policies such as trade liberalisation, privatisa-tion and the predominance of competitive market forces in the regulation ofaccess to resources impact negatively on co-management, as they favour the morepowerful economic interests at the expense of poor people and communities. 6600 An important economic phenomenon that impacts on the outcomes of co-man- agement is the increased commoditisation of goods and services, accompanied byrapid changes in production, information and communication technology. Thismeans that many resources critical to people are now easily governed by marketrules and placed outside of the control of their primary users. Globally definedrules such as the WTO-TRIPs agreement ( e.g.patents on seeds and medicinal plants) and privatisation (land, water, forests, public services) are undermining thecontrol that local resource users have over their environments, knowledge andinstitutions. 6611Globalisation and the concentration of economic power in the hands of trans-national corporations and finance markets proceed with a simulta-neous process of devolution and decentralisation. But the power to define thecontent and purpose of policies, institutions and systems is concentrated in thehands of ever fewer trans-national corporations (TNCs). 6622In this light, widening economic democracy and equity appear as a key overarching condition for the mainstreaming of co-management. For instance, co-management initiatives would be strengthened by policies that protect local interests, placing selected resources beyond the reach of competitivebidding processes, and protecting local markets whenever necessary. 6633In this manner, co-management agreements backed by proper legislation could becomeinstruments of protection of special local needs and interests. National govern-ments, acting alone or in groups, may also need to introduce specific policies toprotect domestic markets for natural resources from cheap imports and the nega-tive impacts of competition in international trade. Subsidised imports have oftendestroyed environments and sustainable livelihoods throughout the South, andmany people now working for poverty wages in factories are refugees from localeconomies based on fishing, farming, pastoralism or forest-based livelihoods. Forinstance, India's domestic edible oil industry ( i.e.oilseed crop producers, millers, processors and retailers) has been undermined as highly subsidised soya from theUS and palm oil from Malaysia have flooded the market. Moreover, the dominantparadigm that exports from the South to the North are a major route for economic 59Winer 1996. 60UNRISD, 2002. the inevitability of adverse competition between poor exporting countries and its hijacking of national priorities to the provision of thecheapest exports. To reverse this trend, countries could develop internationaltrade rules that allow them to introduce constraints on their exports and imports. 6644 Trade rules that favour export production and dumping of cheap imports can be replaced by rules that permit the use of trade tariffs and quotas to regulate importsof food, timber, fish, fibres and other natural products that can be produced local-ly. This means applying the principle of subsidiarity: whenever production can beachieved by local social actors, using local resources for local consumption, allrules and benefits should favour that option, thus shortening the distance betweenproduction and consumption. This is not to suggest that there should be no tradeat all in food, fibre and other natural resource based products, but to recognisethat trade should be confined to whatever commodities cannot be supplied at thelocal level, rather than trade being the primary driver of production and distribu-tion. 6655 Governments also need to carefully assess the compatibility of newly evolving international environmental, labour and safety standards with national policiesdesigned to support co-management. For example, in the name of food safety,many international rules, such as the WTO's Agreement on the Application ofSanitary and Phytosanitary Standards and the Codex Alimentarius, have enforcedan approach to food processing that works directly against local and artisanalfood producers, whilst favouring the global trans-national corporations. Amongother things, they require irradiation of certain products, pasteurisation, and stan-dardised shrink-wrapping of local cheese products. Such rules tremendouslyincrease costs for small producers as these homogenised global standards primari-ly benefit TNCs that trade on global markets. Where co-management schemesseek to retain wealth closer to where it is generated, there is a strong case for foodproduction standards (and other NR standards) to be localised, with every nationpermitted to set its own high food safety and other standards related to naturalresource management. Similarly, national governments will increasingly need to work together to put lim- its on the concentration of economic power in supply chains that link naturalresource based producers with consumers. Trans-national corporations involved innatural resource management include suppliers of commercial inputs and servicesto the farming, fisheries, timber, bio-prospecting, mining, tourism and protectedareas sectors. They also include corporations that disproportionately benefit fromthe processing, distribution and retailing of natural resources (food, timber, miner-als, medicinal drugs, genetic resources, new natural products such as oils andcosmetics) as well as TNCs offering services or partnerships for eco-tourism andprotected area management. 6666A relatively small number of trans-national corpo- rations are strategically placed along these supply chains, influencing both thenature of production, the terms of trade and who benefits from natural resourcebased goods and services on the global market. 6677The concentration of corporate power in the global food system is illustrative of these emerging trends (see 1. ffarmm iinputts.Concentration in the input sector proceeded at breakneck speed in the 1990s. Six companies now control 80 percent of pesticide sales, down from 12 in 1994.6688In the period 1995- 2000 the amalgamations in the US seed industry alone were worth USD15 thousand million. From a food systems perspective, input manufacturers, as suppliers to the least profitable sector of the agri-food system, namely farming, are in a strategically weak position. The level of concentration in thebusiness is in part a desperate drive to maintain profitability against declining strategic value ofchemicals, seeds and biotechnology. Value chain thinking rather than technical justification or inno-vation is the key to the sustainability of these industries. Survival will depend on strategic allianceswith processors and retailers around food quality, safety and quality. 2.In pprocessing.Partly out of necessity to exercise countervailing economic power to retailers, process- ing industries are also rapidly consolidating their economic and market power. The economic powerof the top eight food multinationals has been compared to that of half of Africa. In 2000, USD 87thousand million in food industry deals were announced, with Nestl\u00e9, Philip Morris and Unileveremerging as the Big Three of global food makers. The justification for such massive accumulation ofmarket power is \"to have more clout in the consolidating retailing environment\" . We are likely to see a growth in networks and cross-ownership between food processing and the seed sector, in whichthe farmer is contractually sandwiched, just a step away from the farmer as renter rather than ownerof contracted crops or livestock. 3. In rrettailing.In both the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (USA), it is retailers who determine what food processors want from farmers . Retailers are the point of contact between the majority of OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) citizens and therural economy. The supermarket sector is most concentrated in the EU, but is also rapidly consolidat-ing in the US. In the nine years since the Earth Summit, USA food retailing chains have concentrateddramatically, with the five leading chains moving from 19 percent control of grocery sales to at least42 percent. Since 1992, global retail has consolidated enormously and three retailers\u2014 Carrefour,Ahold and Wal-Mart\u2014 have become truly global in their reach. In 2000, these three companiesalone had sales (food and non-food) of USD300 thousand million and profits of USD8 thousand mil-lion, and employed 1.9 million people. It is predicted that there will be only 10 major global retailersby 2010. 68Kuyek, 2000; power of TNCs is a major challenge for governments committed to an enabling policy environment for co-management based on a fair sharing ofcosts and benefits. TNCs exert inordinate and unaccountable influence over pub-lic policies; 6699many corporations involved in the marketing of natural resources have annual revenues that dwarf the Gross National Products of many countries.Newly emerging initiatives, however, may help governments regulate corporateactivities for the public good. For example, an increasing number of corporationsare working towards a \"corporate responsibility agenda\" through such instrumentsas codes of conduct, certification, reporting, stakeholder dialogues and partner-ships. This approach to promoting corporate social and environmental responsi-bility emphasises the role of \"voluntary initiatives\", in which TNCs themselvesdefine the boundaries of the corporate responsibility agenda. In more recentattempts to move away from corporate self-regulation, trade unions, NGOs andmulti-lateral organisations have become involved in standard setting, certificationand independent monitoring of codes of zThe Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has set up a Working Group on TNCs, which is considering a code of conduct for TNCs and has drafted a set of Human Rights Principles and Responsibilities for TNCs and other Business Enterprises. The Working Grouphas also proposed the creation of entities to assist with the implementation of the principles and tomonitor compliance.These are promising developments, but evidence from a range of case studiessuggests that there remains a considerable gap between the rhetoric and practiceof corporate responsibility. Change has tended to be piecemeal and is fraught with contradictions. 7700Compelling evidence indicates that the regulation of busi- ness and TNCs cannot be left to companies and their shareholders, industryassociations and service delivery NGOs. More often than not, lukewarm volun-tary initiatives have edged out important mechanisms and institutional arrange- ments that are key to national sovereignty and policy coherence. 7711New policy initiatives and forms of international cooperation are therefore needed to regu-late corporations within countries and globally. Several ideas and proposalsinvolving the UN system have emerged that could serve to correct the imbal-ance of power between TNCs and governments (see Box 10.17). Institutionalarrangements involving state and international regulation, watchdog activism,collective bargaining, and complaints procedures that allow different socialactors to identify and deal with breaches of agreed standards are all part of the menu of political choices open to governments and civil society. 7722UN agencies such as the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the UN Development Programme(UNDP), the UNEnvironment Programme(UNEP) and Organisation(WHO), as theInternational LabourOrganisation (ILO), canalso play a central roleand should not shy awayfrom critical research andpolicy analysis on TNCsand their social, environ-mental and developmentalimpacts, and on regulatoryinitiatives at both nationaland international levels.And yet, with few excep-tions, the current vogue inmost international agen-cies is to appease the TNCs with policies and programmes that integrate private sector interests. Weare far from seeing the UN agencies play a critical supervisory role. 70Utting, 2002. 71Utting, 2002. 72Fitzgerald, rreformms zRe-orientate the end goals of trade rules and aid, so that they contribute to the building of local economies and local control, rather than international competitiveness; zre-introduce protective safeguards for domestic economies, including safeguards against imports of food and other natural resource based goods and services that can be produced locally; zpromote a site-here-to-sell-here policy for manufacturing and services domestically and regionally; z\"localise money\" so that most of it stays within communities and neighbourhoods and helps rebuild local economies, rather than being siphoned off to distant actors and financial markets; zpromote local competition policy to eliminate monopolies from the more protected economies and ensure high quality food production, and natural resource based goods and services; zrestrict the concentration and market power of the major food and other natural resource based cor- porations and retailers through new national competition laws and international treaties; zprovide mechanisms to ensure that the real costs of environmental damage, unsustainable produc- tion methods and long distance trade are included in the cost of food; zfund the transition to more localised economies and environmental regeneration by introducing taxes on resources and on speculative international financial flows (USD 1,500 thousand million is traded every day on foreign exchange markets alone\u2014 most of which is purely speculative and hasnothing to do with the real economy).zThere have been calls for a Special Rapporteur on TNCs to be established by the Human Rights Commission and for some existing Special Rapporteurs to deal with problems involving TNCs. The need to extend international legal obligations to TNCs in the field of human rights and to bring cor-porations under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court has also been suggested. zFriends of the Earth International proposed that the World Summit on Sustainable Development consider a Corporate Accountability Convention that would establish and enforce minimum envi- ronmental and social standards, encourage effective reporting and provide incentives for TNCs tak-ing steps to avoid negative impacts. zThe International Forum on Globalisation has advocated the creation of a United Nations Organisation for Corporate Accountability that would provide information on corporate practices as a basis for legal actions and consumer boycotts. Christian Aid has put forth the idea of a GlobalRegulation Authority that would establish norms for TNC conduct, monitor compliance and dealwith breaches. Others have called for the reactivation of the defunct United Nations Centre onTrans-National Corporations, some of whose activities were transferred to UNCTAD a decade ago. In practice, a levelling of the economic playing field for the co-management ofnatural resources calls for mutually reinforcing and radical structural reforms.Among these, the regeneration of more localised economies and culture\u2014 inshort more effective local governance\u2014 merits closer attention. The idea here isto re-localise pluralistic economies that combine both subsistence and market ori-ented activities. 7733Several mutually reinforcing enabling policies have been identi- fied to bring about such transformation for diversity Box10.18). zRedirect both hidden and direct agricultural and other natural resource subsidies towards supporting smaller scale producers to encourage the shift towards diverse, ecological, equitable and more localised food systems in pastoral, fishing, farming and forest-based communities as well as inurban and peri-urban contexts; zensure land reform and property rights to redistribute surplus land to tenants and sharecroppers and to secure rights of access and use of common property resources; zprotect the rights of peasants, farmers and pastoralists to save seed and improve crop varieties and livestock breeds, also through a ban on patents and IPR legislation on genetic resources important for food, health and agriculture; zincrease funding for and re-orientation of public sector research and development (R&D) for agri- culture and natural resource management towards participatory approaches and democratic control over priority setting and technology validation; zintroduce a two-tier system of environment and health safety regulations: stricter controls on large- scale producers and marketers and simpler, more flexible, locally-determined regulations for small- scale localised enterprises generating wealth from natural resource transformation; zenhance research and development and financial support for decentralised and sustainable energy production based on renewable energy. 1100..22EEnnaabblliinngg ppoolliicciieess aatt tthhee iinntteerrnnaattiioonnaall lleevveell In a context of political, economic and cultural globalisation, and in light of the power and influence of supra-national institutions and processes, it is importantto consider the role of international policy frameworks and instruments. Indeed,the past three decades since the 1972 Stockholm UN Conference on the HumanEnvironment have seen the growing importance of global governance in severalways: ztrade liberalisation agreements have led to the emergence of powerful new institutions and corporations that are based on trans-national markets; zregional political and economic groupings have been expanded and strength- ened, including the European Union, the Free Trade Area of the Americas and the Asia Free Trade Association ; zglobal standards and commitments have been formulated and adopted, partic- ularly through a number of international conventions and agreements; and zinstitutional arrangements have been put in place for the management of the global commons, particularly through the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Climate Change Convention. International instruments and agreements impact directly on co-management atNATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 377the local level, particularly because: zrequirements for participation and co-management are stipulated in several of the conventions and other binding or non-binding instruments; zseveral multilateral and bilateral donor agencies have introduced provisions, guidelines and conditionalities aimed at promoting co-management and other participatory approaches; and ztrade and other international policies impact on the conditions of and capaci- ties for resource use and management at the local level. In many respects, the most fundamental international instrument in support of co-management remains the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Adoptedby the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1948, theDeclaration is not legally binding but is considered as an international instru-ment of tremendous political and symbolic importance. After the adoption of thisDeclaration, the UN Commission on Human Rights began drafting legally bind-ing documents. The International Covenant on Economic, Social, and CulturalRights (ICESCR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR) were adopted in 1966. Articles 1.1 of both the ICESCR and ICCPR uphold the right of all peoples to self- determination: \"All peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development\". Articles 1.2 of both covenants similarly support the right to development: \"All peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international eco- nomic co-operation, based on the principle of mutual benefit, and international law. In no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence\". Other international conventions are of particular relevance to marginal socialgroups who live in areas rich in biological diversity, and who may engage in co-management processes. For example Convention 169 Concerning Indigenousand Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, commonly known as ILO 169, wasadopted in June 1989 by the Conference of the International LabourOrganisation. ILO 169 specifically stresses the need for the participation ofindigenous peoples in the decision-making process regarding resources andlands on which they have claims of dependence. Article 2.1 affirms that: \"Governments shall have the responsibility for developing, with the participation of the peoples concerned, co-ordinated and systematic action to protect the rights of these peoples and to guarantee respect for their integrity\". According to ILO 169, the protection of indigenous rights is the responsibility ofgovernments, but only with the cooperation and participation of the indigenouspeoples themselves. Similarly, many of the principal rights described in theUnited Nations Draft Declaration on the Rights of on the Rights for Indigenous Peoples was agreed upon by members of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations at its 11thsession in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1993. The declaration is expected to be finalised in 2004 or 2005.378 SHARING POWERAgenda 21, adopted at the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, called for effective participation in all the elements of planningand development. In particular: zChapter 8 (Integrating environment and development in decision-making) states that \"an adjustment or even a fundamental reshaping of decision-mak- ing, in the light of country specific conditions, may be necessary if environ-ment and development is to be put at the centre of economic and politicaldecision-making, in effect achieving full integration of these factors.\" zChapter 23 (Strengthening the role of the major groups) identifies, in the \"spe- cific context of environment and development, the need for new forms of par- ticipation\" and notes \"the need of individuals, groups and organisations toparticipate in decisions, particularly those that affect the communities inwhich they live and work.\" zIn Chapter 26 (Recognising and strengthening the role of indigenous people and their communities), active participation is called for to incorporate their \"values, views and and full participation; zright to collective, as well as individual human rights; zrecognition of existing treaty arrangements with indigenous peoples; zright to determine own citizenry and citizen obligations; zright to live in freedom, peace, and security without military intervention or involvement; zright to religious freedom and protection of sacred sites and objects, including ecosystems, plants and animals; zright to free and informed consent (prior informed consent); zright to control access and exert ownership over plants, animals and minerals vital to their culture; zright to own, develop, control and use the lands and territories, including the total environment of the lands, air, waters, coastal seas, sea-ice, flora and fauna and other resources which they have tra- ditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used; zright to special measures to control, develop and protect their sciences, technologies and cultural manifestations, including human and other genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of the fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs and visual and performing arts; zright to restitution and redress for cultural, intellectual, religious or spiritual property that is taken or used without authorisation; zright to just and fair compensation for any such activities that have adverse environmental, economic, social, cultural or spiritual impact.fully guide co-management processes and negotiated agreements over the use of natural resources (Box 10.19).NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 379zChapter 33 (Financial resources and mechanisms) stresses that \"priorities should be established by means that incorporate public participation and community involvement providing equal opportunity for men and women. In this respect,consultative groups and round tables and other nationally-based mechanismscan play a facilitative role.\" zChapter 37 (National mechanisms and international cooperation for capacity- building) states that, \"as an important aspect of overall planning, each country should seek internal consensus at all levels of society on policies and pro-grammes needed for short and long-term capacity building to implement itsAgenda 21 programme. This consensus should result from a participatory dia-logue of relevant interest groups and lead to an identification of skill gaps, insti-tutional capacities, technological and scientific requirements and resourceneeds to enhance environmental knowledge and administration to integrateenvironment and development\". The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) reaffirmed many of the commitments and principles adopted in Rio, and promoted the concept of partnerships . In the strict sense of the term, a partnership is no different from co- management, but the dominant discourses at the Johannesburg Summit appliedthe concept to all forms of collaboration, including those where industryremained the primary factor and actor. Nevertheless, the Summit's emphasis onpartnerships only serves to underscore the value of collaboration and participa-tion, and the need to bring all actors into the management process. One of the most significant developments that have taken place recently on the international scene in the field of natural resource governance is the adoption ofthe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). This significance lies in its focus ontraditional knowledge and practices, in the fact that it is legally binding, and in anapproach that goes beyond indigenous groups and includes all local communi-ties. The Convention stresses the need to involve indigenous and other local com-munities in the conservation of biological diversity, and in the sharing of benefitsderived from the use of these resources. Article 8(j) of the Convention commitsparties to: \"subject to [their] national legislation, [to] respect, preserve and maintain knowl- edge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilisation of such knowledge, innovations and practices\". Similarly, Article 10(c) stipulates that each country should: \"protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices that are compatible with conservation or sustainable use requirements; support local populations to develop and implement remedial action in degraded areas where biological diversity has been reduced; and encourage cooperation between its governmental authorities and its private sec- tors in developing methods for sustainable use of biological resources.\" More recently, the Conference of Parties (COP) of 12 principles are complementary and interlinked and they are at the basis of several decisions approved by the Conferences of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity.7755 Principle 1: The Different sectors of society view ecosystems in terms of their own economic, cultural and society needs. Indigenous peoples and other local communities living on the land are important stakeholdersand their rights and interests should be recognised. Both cultural and biological diversity are centralcomponents of the ecosystem approach, and management should take this into account. Societalchoices should be expressed as clearly as possible. Ecosystems should be managed for their intrinsicvalues and for the tangible or intangible benefits for humans, in a fair and equitable way. Principle 2 :Managemmentt sshould bbe ddecenttralised tto tthe llowestt aappropriatte llevel. Decentralised systems may lead to greater efficiency, effectiveness and equity. Management should involve all stakeholders and balance local interests with the wider public interest. The closer manage-ment is to the ecosystem, the greater the responsibility, ownership, accountability, participation, anduse of local knowledge. Principle Management interventions in ecosystems often have unknown or unpredictable effects on other ecosystems; therefore, possible impacts need careful consideration and analysis. This may require newarrangements or ways of organisation for institutions involved in decision-making to make, if neces-sary, appropriate compromises. should: a) reduce those market distortions that adversely affect biological diversity; b) align incentives to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable use; c) internalise costs and benefits in the given ecosystem to the extent feasible. The greatest threat to biological diversity lies in its replacement by alternative systems of land use. Thisoften arises through market distortions, which undervalue natural systems and populations and pro-vide perverse incentives and subsidies to favour the conversion of land to less diverse systems. Oftenthose who benefit from conservation do not pay the costs associated with conservation and, similarly,those who generate environmental costs ( e.g.pollution) escape responsibility. Alignment of incentives allows those who control the resource to benefit and ensures that those who generate environmentalcosts will pay. Principle 5: tthe eecosyysttemm aapproach. Ecosystem functioning and resilience depends on a dynamic relationship within species, among species 75http://www.biodiv.org/programmes/cross-cutting/ecosystem/decisions.asp Diversity has adopted the ecosystem approach as the primary framework for the implementation of the Convention. The COP has approved operational guide-lines, and these are based on twelve broad principles. Particularly noteworthyamong these are principles 1 and 2, which stress the need for societal choiceand decentralisation of management to the lowest possible level (Box 10.20).NATURAL RESOURCE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTS 381and between species and their a-biotic environment, as well as the physical and chemical interactions within the environment. The conservation and, where appropriate, restoration of these interactions andprocesses is of greater significance for the long-term maintained conditions and, accordingly, manage-ment should be appropriately cautious. Principle In considering the likelihood or ease of attaining the management objectives, attention should be given to the environmental conditions that limit natural productivity, ecosystem structure, functioningand diversity. The limits to ecosystem functioning may be affected to different degrees by temporary,unpredictable or artificially maintained conditions and, accordingly, management should be appropri-ately cautious. Principle approach should be bounded by spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate to the objec- tives. Boundaries for management will be defined operationally by users, managers, scientists andindigenous and local peoples. Connectivity between areas should be promoted where necessary. Theecosystem approach is based upon the hierarchical nature of biological diversity characterised by theinteraction and integration of genes, characterised by varying temporal scales and lag-effects. This inherently con- flicts with the tendency of humans to favour short-term gains and immediate benefits over future ones. mmustt rrecognise tthatt cchange iis iinevittable. Ecosystems change, including species composition and population abundance. Hence, management should adapt to the changes. Apart from their inherent dynamics of change, ecosystems are beset by acomplex of uncertainties and potential \"surprises\" in the human, biological and environmental realms.Traditional disturbance regimes may be important for ecosystem structure and functioning, and mayneed to be maintained or restored. The ecosystem approach must utilise adaptive management inorder to anticipate and cater for such changes and events and should be cautious in making any deci-sion that may foreclose options, but, at the same time, consider mitigating actions to cope with long-term changes such as climate change. Principle Biological diversity is critical both for its intrinsic value and because of the key role it plays in provid- ing the ecosystem and other services upon which we all ultimately depend. There has been a tenden-cy in the past to manage components of biological diversity either as protected or non-protected.There is a need for a shift to more flexible situations, where conservation and use are seen in contextand the full range of measures is applied in a continuum from strictly protected to all sources is critical to arriving at effective ecosystem management strategies. Amuch better knowledge of ecosystem functions and the impact of human use is desirable. All relevantinformation from any concerned area should be shared with all stakeholders and actors, taking intoaccount, inter alia , any decision to be taken under Article 8(j) of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Assumptions behind proposed management decisions should be made explicit and checkedagainst available knowledge and views of stakeholders.382 SHARING POWER76For more comprehensive analysis and guidance on the implications of the CBD Programme of Work regarding indigenous peoples and local communities, see Borrini-Feyerabend et al. , 2004 (in press). 77In this context nomadic communities and pastoralists are given special reference. 78See http://www.unccd.int/main.phpLast but not least, the CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas approved at the 7thConference of the Parties to the Convention (February, 2004) includes an entire programme element on \"Governance, participation, equity and benefitsharing\". 7766The programme promotes equity and benefit-sharing and the full and effective participation of indigenous and local communities in the establishmentand management of protected areas. It recommends the parties, inter alia , to: 2.2.1 Establish policies and institutional mechanisms with full participation of indigenous and local communities, to facilitate the legal recognition and effective management of indigenous and local community conserved areas in a manner consistent with the goals of conserving both biodiversity and the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local commu- nities. 2.2.2 Implement specific plans and initiatives to effectively involve indigenous and local communities, with respect for their rights consistent with national legislation and applicable international obligations, and stakeholders at all levels of protected areas planning, establishment, governance and manage- ment, with particular emphasis on identifying and removing barriers pre- venting adequate participation. 2.2.4 Promote an enabling environment (legislation, policies, capacities, and resources) for the involvement of indigenous and local communities and relevant stakeholders7777in decision making, and the development of their capacities and opportunities to establish and manage protected areas, including community-conserved and private protected areas. Another critical international instrument is the Convention to CombatDesertification, which provides for the formulation and adoption of nationalaction programmes that specify the respective roles of government, local commu-nities and land users, and the resources available and needed. The Parties to theConvention shall, 7788inter alia : (e) promote policies and strengthen institutional frameworks that develop cooper- ation and coordination, in a spirit of partnership, among the donor community, governments at all levels, local populations and community groups, and facilitate access by local populations to appropriate information and technology; (f) provide for effective participation at the local, national and regional levels of non-governmental organisations and local populations, both women and men, particularly resource users, including farmers and pastoralists and their representa- tive organisations, in policy planning, decision-making, and implementation and review of national action programmes. Like the emphasis on partnerships, a second important trend of the past fewyears has been the adoption, by most multi-lateral, problems of biological-diversity management are complex, with many interactions, side-effects and implications, and therefore should involve the necessary expertise and stakeholders at the local,national, regional and international level, as appropriate.79Jeanrenaud 2002. 80Pimbert, 2004a; Pimbert, 2004b. 81Seewww.unece.org/env/pp and Box 10.14 earlier in this Chapter. 82Finger-Stitch and Finger, 2003.

Yet, beyond the apparent homogeneity of this discourse, there are differing ide-ologies and perspectives even within individual organisations 7799and, even more importantly, the practice does not always correspond to policy discourse andrhetoric. 8800 For example, non-governmental organisations from 26 countries have federated in the Pan-European Eco Forum to promote the Convention on Access toInformation, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice inEnvironmental Matters (Aarhus Convention). 8811The Aarhus Convention has been ratified by 17 countries (only Denmark and Italy among western European coun-tries) and came into force in October 2001. The convention concerns in particu-lar issues related to the installation of industrial plants (for energy\u2014 includingnuclear, mining, chemical and genetically modified organisms, or industrial meatproduction and waste management facilities that have environmental effects).The Aarhus Convention has been promoted mainly by non-governmental organi-sations in Eastern Europe but poses a serious challenge to nominally democraticWestern European governments, which have shown particular resistance to itsratification. 8822It seems that, once again, civil society needs to organise and take action to secure and consolidate its rights. As seen in this rapid survey of policies that can foster or impede co-management regimes, inclusive participation and citizen engagement are key to getting suchpolicies right. This is miles away from the meek \"consultation\" and \"dialogue\"on terms largely decided by others often proposed by environment and develop-ment agencies, governments and corporations. To get to the heart of the matter,the very process of policy-making (who makes policy and how) needs to beunderstood and transformed. The themes \"empowerment democracy\" should be explored in great detail. As some would say, a nonnegotiable principle is that participation is a basic 1111..11 TThhee ppoolliittiiccss ooff ppoolliiccyy A policy is the result of numerous interactions among the social actors who, directly or indirectly, shape its content, interpretation and implementation. In gen-eral, thus, a \"policy-making process\" reflects the power relations that exist in soci-ety. In other words, it is to be expected that the dominant policy reflects and rein- forces the interests of the powerful\u2014 be they the political parties, individuals oraristocracies in control of government and/ or influential corporations, financialgiants and key market forces. A few questions help to shed light on the policy making process: \"Which actors are involved? Where is \"policy-making\" actually taking place? Who has the finalcontrol and say? Whose knowledge is included and whose excluded? Whoseinterests are served? Is someone held accountable? If so, to whom, and how?\"Asking these questions helps to shift attention from an analysis of policies per se (\"Are policies addressing the relevant issues? Are policies good or misguided? \") tothe analysis of the policy process (\"Whose perspectives, knowledge, values, andaspirations are embedded in policies, and whose are excluded? Through POLICY CHANGE 385Issues of power and knowledge are at the heart of negotiations and agreements on natural resource management and co-management practitioners have frequentencounters with them. Broadly speaking, knowledge and values get established orembodied in policy through three main pathways 11which may be used alone or in combination, namely: zas aa rreflection oof sstructured ppolitical iinterests, which happens when policy change results from open interactions and struggles among groups with differ- ing political interests (examples include different classes, factions within thestate, the state and society); 22 zas aa bby-pproduct oof tthe iinitiative oof sspecific aactors, which happens when some actors have discretion over the policy process33and exercise their own inter- ests, capacities fframe ppractice, which happens when, for instance, political issues and choices are recast in the \"neutral\" lan- guage of science and hidden behind the symbols of scientific authority; in thissense, policies are part of a dominant \"discourse\" that defines the world and,in the process, excludes alternative interpretations. 44 Despite the difficulties inherent in deciphering the language of policy studies, a good understanding of what actually happens in policy-making processes can bevery useful for people engaged in co-management and for civil society in general(see Box 11.1). This understanding can nurture a critical analysis of \"the rules ofthe game\" and promote fairer representation systems and better social inclusion inthe policy process. Box 11.1 WWhhaatt ssoocciieettyy\"\"?? (adapted from Edwards, 2004; Howell and Pearce, 2001) There are two broad ways in which \"civil society\" can be understood. The first\u2014 and the one encoun- tered most commonly\u2014 is civil society as made up of non-market organisations that exist between thehousehold and the state. Civil society may thus comprise non-governmental organisations (such asthose involved in natural resource management and agricultural development interventions), 55social movements (such as indigenous peoples and farmers' movements), membership organisations and tradeunions (such as peasant unions) 66and customary, informal organisations. This understanding is some- times known as the \"associationalist\" view of civil society. A second interpretation understands civil society as the arena within which public debate occurs and in which dominant ideas about how society ought to be organised are discussed and formed by citizens.This might be referred to as a \"public sphere\" or \"deliberative\" view of civil society. At a national level,civil society would be, for instance, the social milieu that develops propositions about safeguarding theinterests of small scale resource users and farmers. At a more local level it might comprise the peopleand groups that develop decisions about environmental care or public health through a participatorybudgeting process. Within a community it may be the sphere in which ideas about women's role inlocal leadership are debated, reproduced or modified. Both interpretations of \"civil society\" are used in this volume. 1Keeley and Scoones, 1999. 2Hill, 1997. 3Long SHARING POWERFour emerging trends77provide a strong rationale for the direct participation of citi- zens88in the formulation and implementation of tries representative democracy has been heavily criticised for its inability to pro-tect citizens' interests. Marginalised groups in both the North and the South oftendo not participate effectively in such representative democracy. The poor areoften badly organised and ill-served by the organisations that mobilise their votesand claim to represent their interests. The crisis of legitimacy faced by institutionsin the eyes of the poor, and a growing number of middle income citizens, is wide-ly documented. Drawing from participatory research in 23 countries, the recent\"Consultations with the Poor\" report, 99prepared for the World Development Report 2001, concludes: \"From the perspectives of poor people world wide, there is a crisis in governance. While the range of institutions that play important roles in poor people's lives is vast, poor people are excluded from participation in governance. State institu- tions, whether represented by central ministries or local government are often nei- ther responsive nor accountable to the poor; rather the report details the arro- gance and disdain with which poor people are treated. Poor people see little recourse to injustice, criminality, abuse and corruption by institutions. Not surpris- ingly, poor men and women lack confidence in the state institutions even though they still express their willingness to partner with them under fairer rules.\" Civil society organisations, in the North and the South, have also been demandingthat citizens' voices be heard during the formulation of government policies tomeet human needs in environmentally sustainable ways. Many of them argue thatcitizen deliberation and inclusion can improve the quality of decision-making andmake the policy process more legitimate, effective and 2.Increased ppolicy ccomplexity aand uuncertainty oof rresults. Policy-making processes involve a good deal of decisions based on imperfect knowledge of their conse-quences. As policy-related issues and socio-environmental systems become morecomplex and unstable, such uncertainties increase. 1111Active management inter- ventions and technological risks are particularly noteworthy in this connection.For example, variation within and among ecosystems is enormous. Daily, seasonaland longer term changes in the spatial structure of ecosystems are apparent\u2014from the landscape level to the small plot of cultivated land. Uncertainty, variabil-ity and non-equilibrium conditions demand flexible responses and adaptive man-agement practices. Managers must be able to monitor and respond to ecosystemchanges and be central actors in analysis, planning, negotiations and action. 1122 Local co-management bodies or platforms are well placed to monitor environ- mental change and deal with the unpredictable interactions between people andecosystems. Like adaptive management, they involve iterative processes, based onfeedback and continuous learning. Adaptive management thus calls for localactors to participate in deliberating and acting on the basis of local (2001a and 2001b) and references therein. 8We note that the concept of citizen is at times understood to exclude indigenous peoples and minority ethnic groups and refugee s who are not considered to be part of the Nation State. Yet, the word \"citizen\" was in use before the emergence of the Nation State (it derives from the Latin civis) referring to all individuals involved in the management of community affairs. In this volume the word cit izen is used in this broad sense to include all people living and working in a given country. 9Quote from page 172 of Narayan et al. (2000). 10Calame, 2003. 11IDS, only amplified by the sweeping changes that currently affect the world. Climate change and the interactions between genetically modified organ-isms (GMOs) and the environment are characterised by high levels of local uncer-tainty. Same is for predicting the local impact of, let us say, releasing new types ofindustrial waste ( e.g., nanoparticles) or endocrine-disrupting chemicals into the environment. Conventional risk management approaches and cost benefit analysisare inadequate when we know neither the probabilities of possible outcomes northe phenomena that can affect those outcomes in significant ways (\"we do notknow what we do not know\"). Given such uncertainty in the face of complexity,perceptions of both problems and solutions are essentially value-laden. And\"experts\" are no better equipped to decide on questions of values and intereststhan any other groups of people 1133\u2014 another powerful argument for more inclu- sive forms of participation and deliberation in the policy process. 3. More ccritical pperspectives oon \"\"science\" aand pprofessional eexpertise.\"Science\" plays a central role in determining much of the content and practice of policiesthat shape people-environment interactions, as \"experts\" (foresters, agronomists,rangeland specialists, economists....) decide about social, economic and environ-mental issues. With respect to democratic politics, these are much more opaquepathways, as the roots of decisions can supposedly be understood only by smallelites of scientists and fellow experts. Increasingly, however, one can perceivemistrust and cynicism and a sense of declining legitimacy vis-\u00e0-vis professionaland scientific expertise. This is particularly true in countries where poorly trustedgovernment institutions are tightly associated with scientific expertise in policy-making. Some of the reasons for this eroded trust include: zPeople are exposed to a wide range of opinions from experts and counter experts in scientific controversies. This undermines the positivist view of knowledge with its claim that any group of experts faced with the same prob-lem should arrive at the same conclusions. Many people in industrialised andpost-industrialised countries no longer view \"Science\" as representing knowl- edge that is certain and unique. 1144They rather see a plurality of sciences \u2014 each offering a different perspective upon the world, each gifted with internaldebates and controversies. zAt least a part of the public has also been informed by radical critiques that present science as an embodiment of values in theories, things, therapies, sys- tems, software and institutions. As all these values are part of ideologies(world views), scientists appear immersed in the very same cultural and eco-nomic conflicts, contradictions and compromises as all other citizens. 1155 zCitizens feel \"at risk\" from science-based social and technological develop- ments. For example, the recent crisis in European countries over bovine spongiform encephalopathy and GMOs has undermined public confidence inscientific expertise. This has been compounded by evidence of collusionbetween some key government experts and the commercial interests of indus-try. Citizens are increasingly sceptical of scientific solutions when the\"experts\" who recommend the solutions have contributed to creating the rele-vant public health and environmental crises in the first place. Again, in both the North and the South, more deliberative and inclusive policy- making processes seem to be an important pathway to overcome low confidencein government institutions and scientific expertise. In such processes, the value of388 SHARING POWERformal science is recognised, but so are the citizens' perspectives.1166In fact, advo- cates argue that more deliberative and inclusive processes involving citizens andthe \"lay public\" generate a much better understanding of allscience-policy ques- tions1177 and, in particular, of the coalitions throughout the world are reaffirm- ing the importance of human rights over economics and the rule of marketforces. 1188For these movements, human rights, justice and democratic accountabili- ty are enhanced when the formulation of policies and the design of technologiesinvolve \"inclusive deliberation\". Inclusive deliberation, a process whose key fea-tures are described in Checklist 11.2, potentially allows men, women, the elderlyand children to exercise their human right to participate, as citizens, in decisionsabout society, the environment and the organisation of economic life. In thissense, people are not mere users of policies or social entities subjected to them.They are, instead, active makers and shapers of the realities that affect theirlives. 1199Much of this argument draws its legitimacy from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and resonates with political traditions in which direct citizenempowerment and action are the central objectives of a just and free society thatcelebrates diversity, empathy and virtue. 2200 The four trends just summarised provide a rationale for \"citizen inclusion\" and \"democratic deliberation\" in the policy process and uup ppolicy pprocesses tto mmore ddiverse fforms oof kknowledge. The issue here is not to choose between popular knowledge and scientific expertise, but to recognise the legitimacy of a variety of systems of knowledge, and to givethem all a place in the decision- and policy-making process. The intent is alsoto demystify scientific knowledge, bringing it closer to the lives and realities ofpeople and making it more transparent and less threatening. zRecognising tthat kknowledge iis nnot sseparated ffrom vvalues. The world views and ideologies of those who possess or produce knowledge are woven into it by virtue of the questions asked, the answers provided and the conditions underwhich the knowledge itself has been generated. In the decision-makingprocess, knowledge must therefore be complemented and guided by the opin-ions, aspirations and values of the people and institutions concerned with thesepolicies. zEmbracing pparticipatory ddecision-mmaking aapproaches. Methods and procedures exist that allow for the involvement of people and organisations in policy mak- ing processes. This is particularly important for the people normally excludedfrom planning and decisions. Creativity and courage are required to use suchmethods and procedures, and thereby combat exclusion, offering to all con-cerned people a fair chance to participate zUnderstanding tthat ppolicy-mmaking iis mmore tthan fformulating ppolicies. In order to be meaningful and durable, policy processes ought to introduce monitoring, evaluation and feedback mechanisms and place the responsibility of managingpolicies in the hands of those who are supposed to be served by them. At allstages in policy processes, there is also a need to transparency,accountability deliberation and participatory decision-making have a long history. In book 7 of Republic, Plato enumerates the subjects that might be useful for the future leaders of the state: music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy. These subjectshave important theoretical aspects and are expected to shape the mind of thefuture ruler. In this sense, Socrates asks questions such as \" What is virtue ?\" and mocks people who are unable to provide an abstract definition for it. In contrastto ideal concepts and abstract theory, Protagoras stressed that \"man is the measureInclusive and participatory processes of policy-making are likely to be more effec-tive, because of their potential to (a) build ownership among participants; (b)encourage change and make implementation easier; (c) result in empowermentthrough information sharing, capacity building and confidence building; and (d)create space and demand for new policies. Policy making is complex and power-laden. Throughout the world, exclusionary and narrow policy processes seem to act to reinforce the values and interests ofthe more powerful social actors and their networks. Nuanced scholarly studies ofpolicy change also show how policy dynamics are influenced by powerful combi-nations of political interests, dominant policy discourses and narratives, and effec-tive actor networks that span local, national and international levels. 2211What, then, are the realisticprospects for citizenengagement in thataffect both peopleand naturalresources? There are no unique or full answers tothese questions. Butour collective experi-ence suggests that, at the very least, two complementary pathways exist that canempower citizens for policy change in co-management: i) the use of specificmethods and approaches to expand democratic deliberation and inclusion, and ii)the direct and self-conscious strengthening of civil society. 21See for example Keeley and 1999; Mayers and Bass, 2004.390 SHARING POWERof all things\", i.e., personal experience and perspective are central to our ways of knowing and what we say always comes accompanied by a sort of \"personalguarantee\". For him, then, the question becomes \" Was the person X virtuous in that particular situation? \" The distinction between Plato and Protagoras\u2014 between the perfect but simplified world of abstract ideas and theories and the imperfect and messy, but concreteand extremely rich world of human experience 2222\u2014 can still be traced in contem- porary policy making processes. In some socio-cultural surroundings, supposedlyobjective expert capacities, and the \"philosophers\" delivering them, are top val-ues. In others, what truly counts is the direct experience and participation of citi-zens. At heart, this already spells out the distinction between representative andparticipatory, or direct, democracy. 2233Participatory democracy is distinct from rep- resentative democratic systems, such as elected members of parliaments or sen-ates, in that it puts decision-making powers more directly in the hands of ordinarypeople. 2244In this connection, European and Northern American history offer sever- al lessons that may be of relevance today. The following are just a few illustrativeexamples among many others that could be chosen from all around the world. In the Social Contract (1763) Rousseau suggested that participatory approaches to democracy had the advantage of demonstrating that \"no citizen is a master ofanother\" and that, in society, \"all of us are equally dependent on our fellow citi-zens\". Rousseau suggested that participation in decision-making increases thefeeling among individual citizens that they belong in their community. As early as1790s, William Godwin proposed that government should be mainly reduced to asystem of juries and assemblies that would deliberate and carry out all the func-tions that could be carried out voluntarily or enforced informally through publicopinion and social pressure. 2255Others have since argued that not only is democrat- ic deliberation theoretically possible, it is, and probably has been, a feature ofeveryday human existence. There is indeed abundant evidence of deliberation insituations as disparate as the Athenian assembly of ancient Greece, tribal councilsall over the world, revolutionary movements in the last century and modern expe-riences in popular direct democracy. 2266 For example, E.P. Thompson's historical analysis illustrated how the Luddites of nineteenth century England sought to subject new technologies to a public trial,just as they had put food prices on trial in previous generations. 2277Far from oppos- ing all new technology, recent studies have suggested that the Luddites were infavour of certain innovations as long as they did not threaten their quality of life. 2288 As historian Steve Woolgar has put it, \"The conventional arguments that assert the Luddites to be irrational resisters to progress\u2014 because they mistakenly assumedeither capitalism or machinery to be irrational\u2014 are based on essentialist notionsof progress.... The Luddites failed not because they misrecognised the machine [astheir enemy] but because the alliance of forces arrayed against them was too greatfor their interpretation to prevail\". 2299 Writing in the United States in 1909, Dewey pointed to the dangers that arose whenever experts become detached from the concerns of the public, or when the 22On this see also Feyerabend, 1999. 23This section draws on Pimbert and Wakeford, 2001a; POLICY CHANGE 391public is excluded from the process of long-term social planning.3300Unless both sides are engaged in continuous and mutually educative dialogue, neither expertsnor citizens are, he suggested, capable of utilising the full range of tools availableto them. He also proposed that experts could never achieve monopoly controlover knowledge required for adequate social planning because of the extent towhich \"they become a specialised class; they are shut off from knowledge of theneeds they are supposed to serve\". When insulated and unaccountable, heargued, this \"cadre of experts\" became not a public resource, but a public prob-lem. While accepting that citizens must often depend on experts for the gathering of facts and construction of policy scenarios, Dewey attacked those who dismissedthe public's capability to participate in policy-making. He suggested that, giventhe prevailing culture of secrecy and propaganda, citizens had not been given afair chance to fulfil their potential in this role. It was impossible to presume thequality of contribution citizens might make if balanced information were avail-able. For example both past and present experience with trial by jury do indeedsuggests that citizens are quite capable of engaging in deliberations and arbitrat-ing complex issues (Box 11.2). Box 11.2 AA 2003; PEALS, 2003) It is unclear whether the European system of trial by jury originated in Ancient Greece, where various versions were widely practiced, or in more ancient civilisations. What is certain is that systems of \"par-ticipatory justice\" have been found in various societies throughout recorded history. Whether or not it had existed there previously, the system of jury trial was brought to Britain with the Norman invaders in 1066. Firmly established by the time of the Magna Carta in 1215, the jury involvedordinary people picked from a wide population and allowed them to hear from witnesses, deliberate insecrecy and reach a decision by majority vote that would then be announced publicly. By the FifteenthCentury it had replaced non-rational methods of trial, such as trial by ordeal, and became establishedas the form of trial for both criminal and civil cases at common law. The perceived justice of the jurysystem led to it being taken up across Britain as a tool for achieving social justice. In towns around thecountry, for instance a people's court often set what was a \"fair\" price for foodstuffs such as bread andgrain. Whilst elected governments make the laws, it is juries that are able to decide the innocence or guilt of anyone charged with breaking many of those laws, making it a key instrument of participatory democ-racy. Over the centuries they have achieved an importance to many democracies and have had to befiercely defended. One senior judge surveying the limiting of a government's power provided by thejury over the centuries compared the jury to: \"a little parliament.... No tyrant could afford to leave asubject's freedom in the hands of twelve of his countrymen.... Trial by jury is more than an instrumentof justice and more than one wheel of the constitution: it is the lamp that shows that freedom lives\". 3311 Today, jury trials are practised in the UK, USA, and many other democracies around the world, includ- ing Australia, Brazil, Russia and Spain. Perhaps no other institution of government rivals the jury inplacing power so directly in the hands of citizens, or wagers more on the truth of democracy's coreclaim that the people make their own best governors. 3322 Contrary to what might be expected from surveys highlighting apparent public ignorance of science, studies of even highly technical court cases have shown citizens able to deal with technical issues at 30Dewey, 1927. 31Devlin, 1956. 32Abramson, 2000.392 SHARING POWERA growing number of people today see democracy without citizen participation and discussion as an empty and meaningless concept. This understanding of poli-tics is the starting point for a growing number of experiments and initiatives thatcreate new spaces for citizens to directly influence decisions affecting their lives. Such innovations go under various labels, ranging from participatory democracy, to deliberative democracy, to \"empowered participatory governance\". 3344Whilst extremely diverse in style and context, these initiatives share several common fea-tures. These include: za concern with more active and participatory forms of citizenship . Such views go beyond the notions of citizens as clients or consumers, as articulated dur- ing the 1980s and 1990s, to citizens who engage in policies, in agenda settingfor research and in the delivery of services. They also profess to go beyondconsultation to more empowered forms of involvement that renew or establishtraditions of direct democracy; zan emphasis on inclusion , especially of racial and ethnic minorities, women, youth, older people, and others seen as previously excluded or marginalised; za simultaneous emphasis on the involvement of multiple actors in new forms of partnership, which in turn enable wider ownership of decisions, processes and projects; za strong emphasis on broader forms of accountability , which enable multiple partners to hold institutions, professionals and policy makers to account through social, legal, fiscal and political means; zthe search for new polit- ical forms that realise the democratic ideal of gov-ernment of and by, as well as for, the people. These political forms are partici-patory because they relyon the commitment andcapacities of ordinary peo-ple to make sensible deci-sions through reasonedand conscious delibera-tion, and they are empow-ered because they try tolink discussion withaction. least as well as the judges. Even in cases where it is claimed that trial by jury is inappropriate becauseof the scientific nature of evidence, potential problems can usually be overcome if the manner of pre-senting the evidence is given careful consideration. Studies comparing the decisions reached by jurors compared with those reached by judicial experts found that the same verdicts were reached in 75-80% of cases. Crucially, this proportion did notchange in complex as opposed to less complex cases. 3333 33Abramson, 2000. ffoorr iinncclluussiivvee ddeelliibbeerraattiioonn In the 1990s, deliberative and inclusive processes (DIPs) have been increasingly applied to the formulation of a wide range of policies in countries of both theNorth and the South. 3355These approaches aim to improve deliberation of policy and policy-making practice through the inclusion of a variety of social actors inconsultation, planning and decision-making. Diverse procedures, techniques and methods can be used to engage different actors in deliberative processes. Examples are citizens juries, scenario workshops,public hearings and visioning exercises illustrated in Checklist 11.1. Theseapproaches and methods differ substantially in detail and have been applied to awide range of issues and contexts. They all, however, seek to adopt to varyingdegrees the criteria of deliberation and inclusion listed in Checklist 11.2. Whenthese methods and approaches are used well, they are part of a process in whichprofessional expertise, local expertise, negotiation skills, research skills, and dem-ocratic values are the basis for creating new knowledge and promoting social andecological change. jjuries A citizens jury is a group of citizens\u2014 chosen to be a fair representation of the local population\u2014 brought together to consider a particular issue set by the local authority. Citizens juries receive evi-dence from expert witnesses and cross-questioning can occur. The process may last up to severaldays, at the end of which a report is drawn up to set out the views of the jury, including any differ-ences in opinion. Juries' views are intended to inform government decision-making. zCitizens ppanels \u0017Research panels A research panel is a large sample of a local population used as a sounding board by a public sec- tor organisation. It is a form of research which tracks changes in opinion and attitudes over time. InGermany for example, these panels are known to consist of 500-3000 participants. Members arerecruited either by mail or by telephone as a sample of a given population. Panels have a standingmembership and a proportion of their members is replaced regularly. Participants are asked regu-larly about different issues over a period of time. \u0017Interactive panels Other models also have a standing membership, which may be replaced over time but basicallyconsists of small groups of people meeting regularly to deliberate on issues and make policy rec-ommendations. zConsensus cconferences A panel of lay people who develop their understanding of technical or scientific issues in dialogue with experts. A panel of between 10-20 volunteers are recruited through advertisements. A steeringcommittee is set up with members chosen by the sponsors. The panel's members attend two week-ends where they are briefed on the subject and identify the questions they want to ask in the confer-ence. The conference lasts for 3-4 days and gives the panel a chance to ask experts any outstandingquestions. The conference is open to the public and the audience can also ask questions. The 35Pimbert and Wakeford, 2001a. 36For a description of other methods that could be used for participatory policy-making see NEF, 1998.394 SHARING POWERpanel's members retire and independently of the steering committee prepare a report that sets out their views on the subject. Copies of the report are made available to the conference audience andpanel members present key sections to the audience. zDeliberative oopinion ppoll This method measures informed opinion on an issue. A deliberative poll examines what the public at large thinks when it has had the occasion and information to consider the matter carefully andclosely. A baseline survey of opinion and demography is carried out and the participants of the pollare then recruited to resemble the wider group both in terms of demography and attitude. Oftenbriefing begins before the event by means of written or/ and visual information. Then, during severaldays, the participants deliberate in smaller groups and compose questions to be put to experts andpoliticians in plenary group discussions. Their views on a given subject are measured before the pollbegins and again once it has finished. Changes in opinion are measured and incorporated into areport. Deliberative polls are often held in conjunction with television companies. zVisioning eexercises aand ffuture ssearch cconferences A range of methods (including focus groups) may be used within a visioning exercise, the purpose of which is to establish the \"vision\" participants have of the future and the kind of the future theywould like to create. Visioning may be used to inform broad strategy for a locality, or may have amore specific focus (as in environmental consultations for Local Agenda 21 or, indeed for all sorts ofco-management agreements as described in Section 6.2 of this volume). The heart of future search conferences is a two- to four-day meeting where participants attempt to create a shared vision of the future. It brings together those with the power to make decisions withthose affected by decisions to try to agree on a plan of action. The process is managed by a steeringgroup of local people representing key sections of the community. People who are recruited areasked to form several \"stakeholder groups\" within the conference. They take part in a structuredtwo- to four-day process in which they move from reviewing the past to creating ideal future scenar-ios. Each of the stakeholder groups explains its vision and then a shared vision is explored. The con-ference ends with the development of action plans and policy recommendations. Self-selectedaction groups develop projects and commit themselves to action towards their vision. zInnovative ddevelopment Innovative development is a methodology consisting of four participatory steps. First, an \"action map\" is formulated. This is a systematic vision for action of an attainable and desired future thatreflects the consensus of participants. Second, there is estimation of the distance from the current sit-uation to the attainable future and of the capabilities that are available. Third, is a study of \"poten-tialities\"\u2014 the systematic identification and evaluation of each of the prospective actions. Fourth, isthe design for action. All methodological steps are carried out through the participation of relevantactors who are convoked by an appropriate and legitimate authority. This, in fact, is very close tothe steps of the co-management process described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4 of zParticipatory RRural AAppraisal ((PRA)/ PParticipatory LLearning of approaches, methods and behaviours to enable people to express and analyse the reali- ties of their lives and conditions, and to plan, monitor and evaluate action that seems appropriate tothem. In PRA/ PLA, outsiders act as catalysts for local people to decide what to do with the informa-tion and analysis that they generate. PRA methods include participant observation, semi-structuredinterviews and visual techniques (maps, matrices, trend lines, diagrams). zIssue fforums These are ongoing bodies with regular meetings, which focus on a particular issue ( e.g., community safety or health promotion). They may have a set membership or operate on an open basis, and areoften able to make recommendations to relevant council committees or to share in decision-makingprocesses. In India, for example, \"issue forums\" or \"study circles\" in villages (see Section 5.2 of thisvolume) are spaces where villagers gather to discuss specific subjects of interest, e.g., the impact ofEMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICY CHANGE 395non-timber forest produce collection, or honey collection, or hunting. Sometimes they will call in outside experts to help. The understanding and information that they generate is then used in thevillage assembly decision-making processes. zMulti-ccriteria mmapping Multi-Criteria Mapping (MCM) attempts to combine the transparency of numerical approaches with the unconstrained framing of discursive deliberations. The technique involves a rather complexseries of steps, including: deciding the subject area, defining the basic policy options, selecting theparticipants, conducting individual interviews (2-3 hour sessions where additional options areselected, evaluative criteria are defined, options are scored and relative weighting is given to crite-ria), having researchers carrying out quantitative and qualitative analyses of the opinions of the par-ticipants, providing feedback on preliminary results, developing deliberations among participantsand, after a final analysis, producing a report and policy recommendations. Many of the methods described above are combined and used in the co-management process described in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 of this volume. therein) zDeliberationis defined as \"careful consideration\" or \"the discussion of reasons for and against\". Deliberation is a common, if not inherent, component of all decision-making in democratic soci- eties. zInclusionis the action of involving others. An inclusive decision-making process is based on the active involvement of multiple social actors and emphasises the participation of previously excluded citizens. zSocial iinteractionis at the heart of the DIPs, which normally incorporate face-to-face meetings among those involved. zThere is a dependenceon llanguagethrough discussion and debate. This is usually in the form of verbal and visual constructions rather than written text. zA deliberative process assumes that, at least initially, there are different ppositionsheld by the partici- pants and that these views are all respected. zDIPs are designed to enable participants to evaluateandre-eevaluatetheir positions in the light of different perspectives and new evidence. zThe form of negotiationis often seen as containing value over and above the \"quality of the deci- sions\" that emerge. Participants share a commitment to the resolution of problems through public reasoning and dialogue aimed at mutual understanding, even if perfect consensus is not beingachieved or even expected as possible. zThere is the recognition that, while the goal is usually to reach decisions, or at least positions upon which decisions can subsequently be taken, an unhurried, rreflective aand rreasonably oopen-eended discussionis required for those decisions to be solidly grounded and \"owned\". Several examples of the use of DIPs for environmental policy making are described and analysed in Table 11.1.

The citizens jury was made up of representativesof small and marginal farmers, small traders, food processors and consumers. Prajateerpu was jointly organised by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), the Institute ofDevelopment Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex, the Andhra Pradesh Coalition in Defence ofDiversity, The University Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh and the all-India National Biodiversity Strategyand Action Plan (NBSAP). The jury hearings took place in Medak District, Andhra Pradesh, on June 25-July 1, 2001. Jury members also included indigenous (known in India as \" adivasi\" ) people. Over two- thirds of jury members were women. The jury members were presented with three different scenarios. Each was advocated by key propo- nents and opinion-formers who attempted to show the logic behind the scenario. It was up to the juryto decide which of the three policy scenarios most likely provided them with the best opportunities toenhance their livelihoods, food security and environment 20 years from now. Scenario 11: VVision 22020.This scenario was put forward by Andhra Pradesh's Chief Minister, backed by a World Bank loan. It proposes to consolidate small farms and rapidly increase mechanisation andmodernisation of the agricultural sector. Production enhancing technologies such as genetic modifica-tion were expected to be introduced in farming and food processing, reducing the number of people onthe land from 70% to mmodel oof oorganic pproducttion.This was based on proposals from the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) and the International TradeCentre (UNCTAD/ WTO) and was based on environmentally friendly farming linked to national andinternational markets. This scenario was dependent on the demand of supermarkets in the North for acheap supply of organic produce, complying with new eco-labelling standards. Scenario 33: LLocalised ffood ssyysttemms.This scenario was based on increased self-reliance for rural com- munities, low external input agriculture, and the re-localisation of food production and markets. Itincluded long distance trade only in goods that are surplus to local production or not produced locally.Local AAgenda 221 iin Antalya consultative mecha-nisms (city councils and otherplatforms) and facilitated work-ing group meetings, supposedlynon-hierarchical, where peoplecould discuss specific issues. [A criticism levied to this process is that the discoursestyles, and the fact of having tomake public speeches favouredsome participants with respectto others.] 43Doganay, 2003.EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICY CHANGE 399The jury/ scenario workshop process was overseen by an independent panel, a group of external observers drawn from a variety of interest groups. It was their role to ensure that each Food Future waspresented in a fair and unprejudiced way, and that the process was trustworthy and not captured by anyinterest group. The key conclusions reached by the jury\u2014 their own vision of the desired future\u2014 included features such as: zfood and farming for self reliance and community control over resources; zmaintaining healthy soils, diverse crops, trees and livestock, and building on indigenous knowl- edge, practical skills and local institutions. It also included an opposition to: zthe proposed reduction of those making their living from the land from 70% to 40% in Andhra Pradesh; zland consolidation in zcontract farming; zlabour-displacing mechanisation; & Bt cotton; zloss of control over medicinal plants, including their export. ThePrajateerpu and subsequent events show how the poor and marginalised can be included in the policy process. By being linked with state level and international policy processes, the jury outcomesand citizen voice have encouraged more public deliberation and pluralism in the framing of policies onfood and agriculture in Andhra Pradesh. The state government that championed Vision 2020 reformswas voted out of office in 2004. The largely rural electorate of Andhra Pradesh voted massively againsta government it felt was neglecting farmers' needs, rural communities and their well being. 4444Similarly, the issues highlighted by the Prajateerpu have been partly responsible for the setting up of a UK parlia- mentary inquiry into the impacts of British bilateral aid to India\u2014 and in Andhra Pradesh in particular.At the time of this writing, the inquiry is under way, conducted by the UK Parliament's well they are used, participatory methods in and by themselves do not lead to policy changes. DIPs cannot be viewed as the \"magic bullet\" forenhancing public participation in policy-making and implementation. Despite thekey role they can potentially play in framing and defining the boundaries ofemerging policies, they are, after all, only a small part of the policy process. Inorder to be fully effective, participatory methods for inclusion and deliberationmust be rooted in the broader context of policy change, where policy changeemerges from a variety of sources and where power relations and vested interestsare key. The experience to date, however, offers relatively few real life examples in which DIPs have been comprehensively applied to policy-making. A recent criticalreview of 35 case studies argues that there has been little reflection on 1) howDIPs are located within broader policy processes and 2) how citizens involved in400 SHARING POWERparticipatory dialogue are linked to wider policy networks and the dynamics of policy change.4466Whilst this study largely ignores the broad historical experience alluded to earlier in this chapter, it does nevertheless offer critical insights on thestrengths and weaknesses of DIPs today. Many of the more recent examples ofDIPs are only one-off affairs. Few of the actors involved in these experiences havecritically analysed whether and how the outcomes of these participatory eventswere used to influence advisory committees and technical bodies connected topolicy making. Moreover, several examples of DIPs in the North have been convened by govern- ment agencies. In some countries of the South, some of these processes have beenpromoted by international donor agencies working with national policy makingagencies. These are examples of DIPs constituting policy spaces created fromabove, and in which the state has substantial control over how the participatorymethods and approaches fit into policy-making. In many of these cases the delib-erative processes primarily fulfilled instrumental objectives (\"legitimising\" deci-sions already taken from above). As convenors, the organising agencies determine much of the style and content of the deliberative process through choice of objectives, methods and tools, the allo-cation of resources and the scale of operation, and the links to the wider policyprocesses. This is also true for DIPs that have been initiated by organisations out-side government policy making bodies. For example there are several instanceswhere \"deliberative and inclusive events\" such as consensus conferences, citizensjuries and future search conferences ultimately functioned as a pathway of legit-imisation for the very commercial or political interests that commissioned andinformed the process in the first place. 4477 Elsewhere, in policy spaces created from below, the debate about wider questions of ethics, morality and values and their links with matters of justice and rights, is astriking feature. These DIPs organised by civil society organisations, NGOs andradicalised professionals 4488extend the frame of decision-making, although they often have relatively weak links withthe formal policy process. Therein liesa danger that these democratic delib-erations will simply be ignoredbecause they are delivering the\"wrong message\" or information thatcannot or will not be accommodatedby bureaucratic decision-making,major industrial lobbies and trans-national commercial interests.Relations of power within policy-making bureaucracies and their asso-ciated networks of influential actorsmay result in limited opportunities forother voices to be heard. Yet, thereare examples where new spaces for action are created by demanding access to information, such as in the case ofmovements in India to access village records and information on departmentalbudgets meant for rural development. 4499 46Holmes POLICY CHANGE 401Criteria of validity and quality will obviously differ depending on the context, the methods used (see for instance Table 11.1) and approach chosen to link DIPs withpolicy processes. When assessing the quality of a deliberative process, however, the emphasis should be on methodological rigour rather than aiming to satisfy na\u00efve notions of\"objective truth\". A prime concern should be on meeting safeguards and qualityIn all cases, creating a space for more inclusive deliberation, either from above orfrom below, is an avenue towards potentially more effective, equitable andinformed decision-making. Attempts to link DIPs with the broader policy processare more successful when due attention is given to issues of quality of informationbut also to process validity, credibility and trustworthiness. Ensuring ssafeguards ffor qquality aand vvalidity A central challenge for practitioners of DIPs is to ensure the quality and validity of the knowledge and actions generated by the process.5500In this light, it may be more realistic and honest to recognise from the outset that the subjectivity andworldview of convenors and key actors can always influence actions as well asinterpretations of events and outcomes. For this reason, it is important to buildsafeguards into the deliberative process to ensure it is broadly credible, trustwor-thy, fair and not captured by any interest group or perspective. Several criteria andindicators of public acceptance and effectiveness of process can be useful in thisregard and are listed in ffostering tthe aacceptanceof a DIP and/ or decision by citizens and the wider public zRepresentativeness: representative sample of the affected population zIndependence: process conducted in an independent, unbiased way zEarly involvement: increases sense of ownership and role at the stage when value judgements are important zTransparency: the public able to see progress and how decisions are made zInfluence: visible impact on policy Criteria ffor eeffective pprocess(effective design and implementation of a DIP process) zResource accessibility: access to appropriate resources (information, time, experts, materials) enables participants to engage and carry out their roles effectively zClear and well-defined methodological design: the scope of the exercise, its procedures and the expected outcomes are defined at the outset zStructured decision-making: debate is enabled over the underlying assumptions, how the decisions are made, the extent to which they are publicly supported zCost-effectiveness: the investment (time and money) in the process is suitable to the scale and importance of Wakeford (2003).402 SHARING POWERcriteria. Some such safeguard and quality criteria likely to be appropriate in many situations include: zDiverse ooversight aand ttransparency. Many of the guidelines for DIPs, such as those laid down by the Institute of Public Policy Research,5511include provision for the process to be overseen by a panel of independent observers. Theinclusion of social actors with a diverse range of interests on this panel can bean important means of ensuring the methodology is not captured by a groupwith a particular perspective or vested interest. However, for this purpose, inmost DIPs it is crucially important to widen the concept of social actor and\"stakeholder\" to include those marginalised by prevailing socio-economicforces. Only if there is a balance on any oversight body between those whosehuman rights are at risk and those with power, the process is likely to be fair,and perceived to be fair. The transparency of participatory forms of policy making can be further enhanced by involving social actors who are able to guarantee credibility andtrustworthiness. For example, in the citizens jury/ scenario workshop describedin Box 11.3, the organisers built several layers of diverse oversight and trans-parency into their methodological design (see Box 11.4). It is noteworthy thatwhen media is invited to observe and document the process there is usuallygreater scope for linking local voices into national and international The Government of Andhra Pradesh (India) visualises a radical transformation in the way food is pro- duced, distributed and marketed 20 years from now. As a result, all the proposals for the future of food,farming, rural development and environment made in the government's Vision 2020 are controversial,particularly the promotion of genetically modified (GM) crops and the displacement of around twentymillion rural people. The two counter-visions explored in the Prajateerpu citizens jury/ scenario work- shop (see Box 11.3) also contained controversial elements. It was therefore critical that the deliberativeprocess was transparent and under the control of representatives of organisations with different vestedinterests and social aims. Four primary safeguard mechanisms were built into the Prajateerpu process: 1. The OOversight PPanel. The Panel had an explicit mandate to assess the fairness, pluralism and credi- bility of Prajateerpu. The Oversight Panel's composition was sufficiently diverse to represent a broad spectrum of interests. Chaired by a retired Chief Justice from the Supreme Court of India, the panelcritically oversaw the entire process, checking for possible bias and inconsistencies. It included rep-resentatives of the international donor community, civil society organisations and indigenous peo-ples. The members of the Oversight Panel shared their observations with the co-ordinating team atthe end of each day of the jury's deliberations, ensuring that all parts of the process were agreed byindividuals with a diverse range of perspectives. The Panel also made an overall evaluation of Prajateerpu after the formal closure of the event. 2.The mmedia oobservers aand rreporters. Members of the press (audio-visual and written) were invited to document the hearings and outcomes of Prajateerpu. The following national newspapers sent their correspondents to observe and report on different moments of the deliberative process: The Indian 51IPPR, 1994; Lowndes and Stoker, 1998.EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICY CHANGE 403Express , The Times of India , The Hindu , and The Deccan Chronicle . A variety of state newspapers written in Telegu also sent their correspondents. Reporters and camera crews from two Indian televi-sion news channels (Star News and Doordashan) were present, with Doordashan returning threetimes to film and interview participants at the beginning, middle and end of the event. The semi-con-tinuous presence of the press ensured another level of control and vetting of the jury process. Thewide reporting of the event in the national media highlighted the credibility and impartiality of thedeliberations that led to the jury's verdict. Interestingly, a small minority of journalists were eager todemonstrate that jurors had been briefed and tutored into stating pre-formed positions. In interviewswith these journalists, however, jurors strongly dismissed these doubts and implicit accusations. Inthe words of one juror, \"These are life and death matters to us. We will not let anyone tell us what we should say .\" 3. The ssilent oobservers. Several other observers were invited to witness the jury process on the under- standing that they should remain silent during the specialist presentations and the deliberations of thejury. These observers included other farmers from Andhra Pradesh, NGO representatives, agriculturalresearchers and planners, trade union representatives and corporate sector representatives. Theseobservers were from both India and Europe. Most of them stayed only two to three days but somewitnessed the whole event. All formed opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of the process andwere able to communicate their views to members of the Oversight Panel, the co-ordinating teamand the press. The presence of the silent observers further enhanced the transparency of Prajateerpu . 4.The vvideo aarchives. The entire citizens jury/ scenario workshop along with interviews of various par- ticipants was recorded on digital video by a team from the Sarojini Naidu School of Performing Arts,Fine Arts and Communication of the University of Hyderabad. These comprehensive video archiveswere compiled to: zprovide a clear and accurate record of the event, including the location, the jury setting, the par- ticipants, the nature and quality of the debates, the process and its outcomes; and zallow any party or external agency to learn from this experience or check for shortfalls in balance, fairness or failings in the deliberative process. Two duplicate sets of 26 videotapes were prepared along with a detailed index of the video archives and English/ Telegu transcripts for Prajateerpu . The first set of duplicate tapes was left in the custody of the International Institute for Environment and Development, London (UK) and the second withThe University of Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh (India). Diverse control and transparency were thus embedded in the very design of Prajateerpu . Moreover, control and scrutiny over the dynamics of Prajateerpu took place in real time and in situ , allowing many different participants to validate their own knowledge, and contest the validity of that of others inan open deliberative arena. For example, the panel of independent observers acted as an extended peercommunity that was able to directly witness the dynamics of knowledge production, action andempowerment. The Oversight Panel, which included representatives of marginalised communities andmore powerful institutions, had absolute power to decide which methods and processes (representative-ness of jury, video scenarios, balance of witnesses, quality of facilitation) were appropriate and whatconstituted valid knowledge in that context . Through this innovation the organisers sought to decen- tralise and democratise the knowledge validation process as well as ensure that the Prajateerpu's out- puts were as legitimate and representative as possible. Related to issues of balanced oversight, the safeguard of diverse controls can alsobe further ensured by relying on several sources of funding. Funding sources withvested interests in conflicting visions and policy choices should be involved inDIPs for the sake of pluralism.404 SHARING POWERzRepresentation aand iinclusion. Who is allowed to take part and other issues of representation are crucial for the credibility of a deliberative process. DIPs should engage a statistically representative sample of the population affectedby a particular policy. Yet, more valid \"representation\" may require givingmore importance to groups of social actors with particular life experiences orcharacteristics such as gender, race, age, wealth and type of livelihood-resource base. Positive discrimination (affirmative action) may be needed toinclude marginalised groups who have been historically excluded from policymaking and the control of regulative institutions. Where policies have widersocial impacts it is usually necessary to include representatives from key sec-tors (industry, government, civil society organisations, farmer trade unions,academic institutions...) so that they can feed their views into the process. Asmentioned in Part II of this volume with regard to the identification of the par-ties in the CM agreement, this is better developed as an iterative process, withsubsequent refinements . Convenors and facilitators will always need to exercise their best judgment in the act of \"including\" some parties in the processes of consideration, decisionand implementation (inclusion). Inclusion goes beyond the question of \"who isallowed to participate\" to issues of recognising knowledge and different waysof knowing. This is particularly important in deliberations involving both citi-zens and experts with scientific or other specialist knowledge. For example,several consensus conferences and citizens juries on the risks of new technolo-gies have demonstrated the competence with which citizens can discuss highlytechnical issues to which they had no previous exposure. They achieve this bycarefully eliciting from each specialist witness the information relevant to theircase. The questions of ordinary citizens and resource users have a more holisticquality than the arguments presented by some subject matter specialists.Different ways of knowing are included in the process, as jurors ask questionsframed from their own life experience and livelihood contexts. The extent to which citizens are allowed to interrogate their sources of informa- tion, rather than being merely the passive recipients of written briefings andspecialist testimonies, is a good indicator of how inclusive a process is inrecognising the validity of different knowledge systems. zOpen fframing aand ffacilitation. The way discussions are framed by informa- tion, witnesses or questions can have an important influence on the extent to which citizens have the opportunity to develop their own policy scenariosand visions for the future. The extent to which assumptions behind issues canbe challenged and new questions asked in DIPs is highly dependent on thechoice of subject area or/ and the particular way a problem is defined. Theinitial choice of problems and definition of criteria drives the end results. Forexample it is noteworthy that assessments of GMOs in the UK were stronglyinfluenced by each participant's early framing of the debate in multiple crite-ria mapping exercises. 5522Many criteria chosen by the participants lay outside the scope of official risk assessments and for no participant the whole range ofcriteria was explicitly included in the formal evaluation process of GMOs inthe UK. The \"sensitivity\" of the early framing of issues and questions in DIPsemphasises the importance of ensuring that the entire spectrum of values andinterests are represented. The extent to which convenors and organising agen-cies allow for flexible and open POLICY CHANGE 405may ultimately prove a good indicator of their commitment to democratic val- ues. It is good practice for the framing of discussions and scope of recommen-dations to be set by citizens engaged in DIPs rather than be constrained by aquestion dictated to them by a particular social actor or interest group. Thedegree to which convenors let go of their power over framing the terms ofdebate may actually determine whether ordinary people will be able to bringabout change or whether DIPs will be merely used to legitimise establishedpower structures and their favoured policy. zCreation oof aa ssafe ccommunicative sspace. A wide range of different experiences with DIPs have demonstrated the importance of safe communicative spaces. These are opportunities in which people, who might otherwise feel threatenedby sharing their knowledge and experience with others, can be placed incarefully thought-out environments of mutual support and empathy in order toallow them to express themselves. Safe communicative spaces are needed forthe confrontation of perspectives from the social and natural sciences as wellas the knowledge of local resource users, for social actors to negotiate anddevelop policy futures. The notion of safe communicative spaces recognisesthat there are differently situated forms of knowledge about livelihoods andthe environment, and each is partial and incomplete. Participatory learning,inclusion, dialogue and careful deliberation are needed to bring these multi-ple and separate realities together, combining the strengths of outsiders' andlocal peoples' knowledge. Convenors of DIPs who explicitly seek to link localvoices with policy change will need to provide safe spaces at a number of dif-ferent levels. Often there is a need to move beyond the uncritical support for assembly-style spaces, where populist attitudes can mask the hidden agendas of the powerful.This is important because the possibility that hierarchy and self censorshipmight constrain deliberation and inclusion is always present in any spacewhere people come together. Deliberation is, after all, not only governed byrational assessment and dialogue about technical or political options. Feelingslike anger, powerlessness, shyness, admiration, fear\u2014 all of the emotional sideof human beings\u2014 are equally important. Like power, emotions are essentiallyrelational phenomena. Personal and collective emotions, the self confidence ofindividual actors and the level of trust between actors all matter in spaces setup for deliberations on policy change. At a fundamental level, trust and emo-tions that underlie the self deeply influence the forms and outcomes of deliber-ations. Communicative spaces for participation, therefore, need to provide asense of stability and security so that social actors can open up and engage in new struggles for self respect and self esteem. 5533Otherwise learning, under- standing and acting for policy change will probably not take place. zEmergence oof aa wwide ccommunity oof iinquiry aand eempowerment.The quality of a process is apparent when there is strong evidence that it has catalysed and informed a broad community of inquiry, with possibly enduring consequencesfor several of the actors involved. This outcome is often dependent on amethodological design that explicitly links citizens involved in the DIPs towider policy networks and the dynamics of policy changes. Whilst there are no universally valid recipes for this, experience suggests trends in policy processes can help engage a wider com- munity of actors for change. Particularly successful reversals from normal rolesand locations for empowerment include: a) putting the perceptions, prioritiesand judgment of resource users and other marginalised citizens centre stageand using appropriate methodologies for DIPs; b) holding the process in a ruralor appropriate local urban setting that is familiar to those citizens and resourceusers more directly affected by the policies; c) getting government bureaucrats,scientists and other specialist witnesses to travel to resource users, farmers andother citizens in order to present evidence on the pros and cons of differentchoices, technologies, policies; d) using television and video technology toensure transparency and free circulation of information on the process and theoutcomes, both nationally and internationally, and e) going beyond the idea ofadvocating on behalf of the marginalised to the practice of enabling the mar-ginalised to speak for themselves. 5544 As a general rule, once people involved in DIPs reach their conclusions it is essential that appropriate intermediary individuals and channels link them withthose who have the power to create change ( e.g., farmer federations, indige- nous peoples organisations, advocacy NGOs...). Immediate outcomes of DIPscan be more effective in policy change when they are actively used by civilsociety actors to influence advisory committees, technical bodies and civil ser-vants connected to policy-making. One option is for groups of actors to useDIPs, when appropriate, as part of a larger set of activities aimed at influencingpolicy \"from below\": campaigns, hidden resistance or direct civil action.Another option is to combine formal bodies of representative democracy withthe more bottom-up deliberative and inclusive methods and processes. Thisapproach may be particularly effective at the level of local and municipal gov-ernments, where citizen participation and government accountability can bemutually reinforcing and supportive. All of these criteria and safeguards can help ensure the credibility, efficacy and fairness of DIPs used for policy making. However, ethics, values and intentionalitywill always remain fundamental to issues of quality and validity. Simply put, par-ticipatory methods such as DIPs for policy change can be used either for instru-mental ends or for genuine citizen empowerment. Implicit or explicit intentionsand underlying values always inform \"participation\", the framing of issues, theform of any initiative and its operating dynamics. For example, a commitment todemocratic values is likely to be expressed by the adoption of design principlessimilar to 2003) zParticipants, not those organising the process, frame and set terms of reference for the whole exer- cise. zThe group organising, or in overall control of, the process is broad based, including social actors with different interests on the subject being discussed. zThere are safe spaces for participants (usually non-specialist) perspectives to engage in a mutually 54Pimbert et al. , 2003; Wakeford and Pimbert, 2004.EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICY CHANGE 407educative manner with those of specialists. zThere is full transparency about the activities carried out within the process to those outside it. zA diversity of information sources is available to participants. zThose without a voice in policy-making can use the process as a tool for positive change. zThe process contains safeguards against policy-makers using it to legitimise existing assumptions or policies. zAll groups involved in the process have sufficient room for learning, development and change. zAn \"audit\" trail is designed and set out to explain whether policies were changed as a result of the process, what was taken into account, what criteria were applied when weighing up the evidence from the process and how the views of those involved in the participatory process made a differenceto the decision. Citizens interested in pursuing policy change in favour of co-management of natu-ral resources need to be clear about how this relates to: zthe right to participate at all levels of the policy making process as equal part- ners regardless of gender, wealth or ethnic origin; zthe right to self representation and autonomy; and zthe right to political, economic and cultural self determination (sovereignty). 1111..33SSttrreennggtthheenniinngg cciivviill ssoocciieettyy By now it will be evident to the reader of this volume that effective co-manage- ment is predicated on a fairer and more balanced sharing of power in society, implying redistribution towards the weaker sectors and civil society in general.While promoting and welcoming this change, we would like to caution againstembracing it without a critical approach. For instance, co-management requiressome formal organising of civil society, a fact that offers important opportunitiesbut also presents potential problems. Experience has shown that formal organisa-tions, including those that evolve from informal community institutions, can alsobe dominated by powerful interests, capable of marginalising the poor and thepowerless in even more insidious ways. 5555Formal organisations almost inevitably introduce hierarchy and structure, and these can consolidate a sclerotic distribu-tion and use of power within groups and communities. To prevent this, somegroups prefer to rely on informal structures and spontaneous, experimental andconvivial practices, in other words \"a sensible measure of anarchy\" at least for theinitial experimental phases of the CM process. 5566 Secondly, while there is a need to recognise and strengthen local rights and responsibilities, attempts to empower previously marginalised sections of the soci-ety can have unintended consequences on local livelihoods, the environment and 55Bainbridge et al. , 2000; Cornwall and Coelho, 2004. 56Anarchy is meant here in the sense of \"absence of fixed governing structures\". For instance, some political \"parties\" in Europe (e.g.the Federalist Party of Italy) prefer to be called a movement rather than a party. They have established automatic and rather frequ ent rotation of people in positions of authority and preferentially base their action and alliances on specific issues rather than on The social disruption that change could cause, as entrenched groups try to hit back, could in turn upset customary natural resource manage-ment patterns. Whether this is ultimately destructive or not depends on the newequations among the social actors and networks involved, interventions by out-siders to stabilise the situation, and other factors. Experience from community-based natural resource management initiatives suggests that greater communityengagement combined with supportive outside interventions and incentives leadsto better resource management in the long run. 5577Yet, it cannot be assumed that greater democracy in society will automatically and inevitably lead to betterresource management at all times and in all places. Thirdly, the objective of social justice may also suffer, paradoxically, as underpriv- ileged sections are given formal powers and representation on management bod-ies and DIPs linked to policy processes. This is because they may no longer bewilling or able to use their informal, and often more effective, tools of resist-ance\u2014 coming late for work, going slow, minor sabotage, slander, ridicule, pre-tended ignorance, desertion, etc.\u2014 which Scott has called the \"weapons of theweak\". 5588These tools are quiet and unobtrusive, yet are perhaps more influential in the making of history, in the relations between oppressed people and theiroppressors, than open rebellions and revolutions. Scott likens this process ofresistance to the creation of immense barrier reefs by the minute actions of mil-lions of coral polyps. Indeed, because of their very nature, such methods ofprotest are difficult for the formal sector to punish. Yet, if oppressed people arebrought out into the open and asked to use formal processes of democracy, atwhich they may be weak, their relative power might actually diminish. There appears to be little way out of this dilemma, how-ever, except to advocate that democratic processesshould remain as flexible and open to innovationas possible, that oppressed people should continueto be supported to take all avenues of resistanceand protest open to them. And, last but not least,that all processes of empowerment should be sus-tained over long periods of time. Finally, and related to the above, there is the dan- ger that some processes of democracy may actuallybe a means of co-option. People and groups thatget engaged in co-management committees, orprocesses of deliberation and inclusion, often losetheir sharp edge and relax their questioning attitudetowards authority. They may also become less \"rep-resentative\" of the whole constituency they comefrom and distort demands or favour some of its sec-tions. This is, of course, by no means an inevitableprocess, but one that has to be strongly guardedagainst.

The authorsof the study argue that the \"voice\" end of the spectrum must begin with creatingthe pre-conditions for voice, through awareness-raising and building the capacityto mobilise. As citizens who are outside of governance processes begin to engagewith government, there are a series of avenues through which their voices may beamplified, ranging from advocacy to lobbying for policy change and citizen moni-toring of performance in various sectors. Similarly, regarding receptivity by thestates, several avenues are available, including government mandated forms of cit-izen consultation, standards through which citizens may hold governmentaccountable, incentives to encourage officials to be responsive to citizen voice,changes in organisational culture, and legal provisions that, in various ways, makeparticipation in governance a legal right. Broadly speaking, there are three main strategic approaches for the emergence of a strong civil society and the empowerment of \"voices change\" within governments can help strengthen civil soci-ety and encourage more inclusive policy debates. In the Philippines, for exam-ple, it was the lobbying of radical civil servants along with organisations of pro-fessionals that led to the wide implementation of participatory irrigation man-agement 6600(a model which has subsequently spread to other countries). In Mexico, reformist officials have helped consolidate small farmer marketingorganisations 6611and strengthen the role of community organisations in regional sustainable development policy.6622 Civil society is likely to have a greater potential for influence when civil ser- vants and progressive government officials introduce legislation guaranteeingthe right to participation. The legal right to participation is a more empowered form of engagement than participation by invitation of governments, donors, orhigher authorities. One area in which rights to participation are being embod-ied into law is that of local governance. 6633A number of pathways have been used: zJoint approaches to planning . Civil society actors and government bodies work together in planning service delivery and environmental care (see Box 11.5). zChanging forms of accountability . Innovations have not only emphasised citi- zen involvement with local governments in planning, but also empowered citi- zen representatives to hold government to account for carrying out properly thefunctions of government (see Box 11.6). zEmpowered forms of local direct participation in the governance of public affairs . While many approaches are looking for new relationships between citi- zens and elected representatives, others are creating forms of direct citizen par-ticipation through legal changes. Representative forms of governance are thuscomplemented by more empowered, direct involvement of citizens at the locallevel. Perhaps the most direct and effective example of the latter is www.ids.ac.uk/logolink and Chapter SHARING POWERof authority about budget allocation. In Porto Alegre and other municipalities of Brazil, neighbourhood meetings are used to do exactly that in a processcalled \"participatory budgeting\" (see Box 11.7). zStrengthened inclusive representation in locally-elected bodies . A pathway adopted by several countries has been legal change that promoted the inclu- sion of traditionally excluded populations in local councils (see Box 11.8). Box 11.7 PPaarrttiicciippaattoorryy bbuuddggeettiinngg iinn PPoorrttoo 2003). Porto Alegre is a Brazilian town with a population of about 1.2 million people, situated along the pol- luted Guaiba River in Southern Brazil. There are about 250 favelas (slums) in Porto Alegre, where about 400,000 people live. Since 1989, Porto Alegre has been governed by the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT,the workers party). This party was founded in 1980, when the military regime first allowed the creationof new parties. The PT emanated from a coalition of labour unions, urban and rural social movements,people from Christian base communities, and formerly revolutionary Marxist groups. The PT has nowell-defined ideology, but follows two main tenets: the needs of the poor should get priority and thepeople should be directly involved in governance. The original contribution of the PT was the insight that popular control on public spending was the key to real popular participation in governance. To achieve this, the PT introduced the practice of \"directdemocratic budgeting\" from 1989 onwards. This involves a number of phases including assembliesBox 11.6 NNeeww from The LogoLink Network www.ids.ac.uk/logolink ) In Bolivia, the Law of Popular Participation of 1994 mandated broad-based participation, starting at the neighbourhood level, as part of the process of local government decentralisation. It also recognised theimportance of social organisations that already existed (including indigenous communities, with theirown practices and customs). About 15,000 such \"territorial base organisations\" are registered to partici-pate in the planning process. In addition to that, the particular innovation of the Bolivian law was tocreate legal citizens' oversight or vigilance Committees in each municipality, which are empowered tofreeze municipal budgets if actual expenditures vary too far from what was agreed in the planning processes .Box 11.5 MMaannddaattoorryy jjooiinntt ppllaannnniinngg (adapted from McGee et al. , 2003) In the Phillippines, the 1991 Local Government Code (LGC) requires citizen participation at all levels of local government through the local development councils. Participation is mandated in the areas ofdevelopment planning, education, health, bids and contracts, and policing. In theory, the LGC also pro-vides for direct representation of civil society and voluntary organisations on local government bodies,though this has been uneven in its implementation. Legislation also mandates funds for training of citi-zen representatives in order for them to participate effectively. In Brazil, the new Constitution of 1988, termed at the time the \"Citizens Constitution\" affirmed public participation in the delivery of local services as a democratic right. This has resulted in the creationacross the country of municipal level councils, which link elected officials, neighbourhood representa-tives and service providers in almost every sector, including health, education and youth.EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICY , 2003) The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments of India, described in Box 10.4, mandated that one third of the seats in the local councils should be reserved for women, as well as one-third of the officesof the chairperson. Similar reservations have been made for those of the lower castes and tribes. Whilemaking local councils more inclusive, the Constitution also gave them a great deal more power forplanning for \"economic development and social justice\" in twenty-nine separate areas of local develop-ment, including forests, education and irrigation. While the implementation of these new representationprocesses has been uneven, and while the local councils are not always granted adequate financingfrom central government, the inclusion of new members in the political processes has been vast. Aboutone million women and some 600,000 lower caste or tribal members have now been elected to localgovernment office.where people can give their views on the way public spending is organised at present; neighbourhoodmeetings where investment priorities are drawn up; electing delegates for the Regional Budget Forum;holding more assemblies; and, finally, production of a final budget by the Municipal Budget Council,synthesises the demands made in the various meetings. The result has been increased efficiency in public spending. Before the introduction of the \"direct dem- ocratic budgeting\", the largest amount of sewer line constructed was 17 kilometres, in 1987. From1990 to 1994, the figure raised to 46 kilometres of sewer line annually. As a result, from 1989 to 1996,the portion of the population with access to sewer lines rose from 46% to 95%. During the three yearsprevious to the PT administration, four kilometres of street were paved each year; after 1990, 20 kilo-metres of road were paved annually, and the quality of this pavement rose dramatically. Extended fave- las, that had only mud roads and tracks, became accessible for buses, garbage trucks, ambulances and police cars. It is estimated that over 100,000 people, representing some 10% of the population of thetown, have attended a participatory budgeting meeting at least once over the fourteen years of the ini-tiative in Porto Alegre. Participatory budgeting has also spread to other municipalities in Brazil. Municipal governments elect- ed to power in several Brazilian cities in the 1990s introduced a participatory budget. The governmentinvests in projects that communities have identified as their priority needs. Given a citizen's right tohave information and make demands on the state, government agencies have to consider the feasibilityof any request. If a citizen request is judged non feasible, the state agency has to demonstrate why thisis so. In several municipalities, popular participation in this initiative has exceeded the government's expecta- tions and has increased annually. Participatory budgeting has changed public spending priorities,reducing inequalities in places. The improvement of the quality of life in some of the municipalities hasbeen evident, as it is the first time that the local government has taken into account the needs of thepoorest sectors of the population. Participatory budgeting has not only meant a much greater involve-ment of citizens and community organisations in determining priorities, but also a more transparent andaccountable form of government. All the above pathways are significant and positive innovations promoted by thestate. Through legislation, they create new and stronger roles for civil society inrelation to local governance. And yet, the extent to which the legislation itselfopens new spaces for participation and citizen voice varies enormously, both412 SHARING POWERaccording to the characteristics of the legal frameworks themselves, and the broader context of which they are a part. The actual implementation of these lawsalso varies, due to differences in understandings, power relations, citizens' aware-ness, etc. Moreover, state-society synergies are prone to the intermediation ofparty politics ccivil ssociety aactors.The most pathway to strengthening civil society involves collaboration betweenlocal and external actors within civil society itself. Typically this involves local,community-based organisations and national NGOs, academics andresearchers. In the Philippines, for example, scientists and non governmentalorganisations have collaborated with marginalised farmers to develop a farmer-led network of people's organisations working towards the sustainable manage-ment of biodiversity and local control over food systems (see Box 11.9). Box 11.9 The MMASIPAG eexperience (adapted from Vicente, 1993; www.masipag.org ) The MASIPAG programme was born out of the Filipino farmer's bittersweet experiences with the Green Revolution. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Philippine government heavily promoted the adoptionof high yielding varieties (HYVs) and high input agricultural production systems. The International RiceResearch Institute (IRRI) played a key role in researching and marketing the new rice varieties. By 1970,78% of the country's rice-lands were planted with HYVs and the initial results were encouraging as cropproduction soared. However, by the late 1970s many farmers were seriously disenchanted with the Green Revolution. The problems they faced included the rising cost of seed and fertilisers; the increasing concentrations ofchemicals needed to keep production up; deterioration of the seed; increasing pest problems; pesticideinduced poisoning and deteriorating human health; and environmental degradation. Over the next fiveyears, a farmers' strategy emerged from various formal and informal consultations. The strategy pro-posed, amongst other things, the launch of an initiative to develop a national agricultural programmeindependent of foreign support; an agrarian reform programme to address the problems posed by largeplantations of bananas, coconut and sugar cane; a review of the government/ IRRI programme withoptions for nationalising its management or stopping its operation; and building a truly Filipino institu-tion for rice research. When their proposals were ignored by government, the farmers and their allies in civil society took the initiatives forward themselves. A group of progressive scientists initiated consultations with farmers in dif-ferent parts of the country (Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao). This culminated in a national convention land- mark gathering, a farmer-NGO-scientist partnership was formed and its first project aimed at breakingthe control of fertiliser and pesticide companies, multi-lateral rice research institutes and distribution car-tels over the rice industry. The Multi-sectoral Forum (MSF), a group of professors, scientists andresearchers in the University of Philippines Los Ba\u20acos, took the lead role in composing the technicalpool of what was initially known as \"farmer-scientist partnership\". By 25 June 1987, the \"Farmer-Scientist Partnership for Agricultural Development, Inc.\" was ready to embark on what is now knownpopularly as the the last 17 years, MASIPAG has been at the forefront of development struggles in the Philippines pur-suing, among other things, a holistic approach to development, community empowerment, and people'scontrol over agricultural biodiversity as a contribution in the over-all effort of improving the quality oflife of small farmers. MASIPAG's approach to strengthening and builds on the following: 1.Bottom-uup aapproach - Any development programme must prioritise the expressed needs, problems and aspirations of the people themselves. The enhancement of knowledge and skills likewise startswith the people's actual capabilities. 2.Farmer-SScientist PPartnership - A genuine partnership between the farmers and their organisations, and the scientists/ researchers from the social and natural sciences attempts to put into practice the bot-tom-up approach in conservation and development. This is apparent in programme implementationand in all activities undertaken by the partnership. This relationship is further strengthened by NGOsfrom the religious sector and other local organisations of concerned individuals and professionals. 3.Farmer-lled rresearch aand ttraining - On-farm research and training in different agro-environments and socio-cultural settings start from what the farmers need to learn and develop. They are active partici-pants in plant breeding and in developing technologies such as ecological pest management and bio-diversity rich farming systems. They do the research and facilitate training. 4.Farmer-tto-ffarmer mmode oof ttransfer - Farmers are animated by a sense of mission to reach out to other farmers. Only in their united and concerted efforts can MASIPAG's vision be realised. Cooperation,not competition is a strong motivating force for the farmers to chart their own destiny. 5.Advocacy ttowards ggenuine aagrarian rreform. In the MASIPAG context, advocacy towards genuine agrarian reform is meant to lead to full ownership, management and control of the land by the farm-ers/ peasants, and their access to basic support services necessary for sustainable agriculture andlivelihoods. There are indeed very many documented and anecdotal cases of such collabora-tion. The combined efforts of local and external civil society actors help to bringthe concerns of marginalised and excluded people into policy processes fromwhich they would otherwise be absent. A review of twelve federations of ruralorganisations whose primary concerns related to agricultural development and nat-ural resource management suggests that the strongest organisations, those mostable to project members' concerns in negotiations with government, donors andmarket actors, have each enjoyed an extended period of accompaniment from NGOs or religious leaders. 64In most cases these external actors were involved in the creation and strengthening of these civil society organisations. Similarly, theemergence of vocal farmer movements in India has often involved non-farmer sup- port or charismatic leadership from other parts of civil society. 65 All these studies show, however, that how such collaboration occurs is critical. The most fruitful collaborations are those that involve intensive, sensitive and respectfulsupport in which external actors accompany, advise, suggest systems, etc., over along period. External actors do not intervene in local decision making, respectingand trusting local partners. For example, at the core of one of South America'smost successful federation of cooperatives, El Ceibo, has been the longstandingprovision of administrative and technical advice from certain volunteer services and donors. 66Likewise in Indonesia, the emancipatory values and enabling atti- tudes of external actors (trainers, NGO staff...) were key in facilitating citizenempowerment in Farmer Field Schools and in the wider peasant movement that now seeks to reclaim rights over land and other resources. 67 3.Independent ppathways ffrom bbelow. Strong and representative organisations can emerge from the bottom up. Local organisations with deep roots in traditional 64Carroll and Bebbington, 1995. 66Bebbington, roles in local natural resource management and repre- sent local voices to external agencies.68 In Sumatra, for instance, traditional adat (customary) village governance institu- tions which re-emerged after the NewOrder period have begun to deal with,among other things, tenure issues in thevillage and represent villager concerns toexternal actors (see box 10.11). The longlasting traditional basis of many suchorganisations gives them indisputablelegitimacy (see Box 11.10). Yet, theseorganisations are not always internally democratic and gender inclusive. 69They can be dominated by leaders in whom tradition or history vests authority butsuch leaders may not espouse the equity gains recently brought about by histori-cal processes and crystallised in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. 68Esman and Uphoff, 1984. 69See Regole of the Ampezzo Valley (where the famous Cortina resort is located) is a community-based institution with a known history of approximately 1,000 years. The Regole independently manage thecommon property resources initially made available by the work of the early Regolieri (extensive pas-ture creation and maintenance out of the original woods) and, up to today, the Regolieri comprise onlythe descendants of the early founders of the community and their male sons who remain residents in the valley. Property is held under inalienable and indivisible common title and the general assembly of theRegole takes management decisions after extensive discussion and by a \"qualified majority\", a proce-dure more akin to consensus than voting. Through time, the Regolieri maintained their rights of occupa-tion and modes of local production thanks to their skills as diplomats (for instance, they managed toensure agreements with the Venetian Republic in 1420 and, later on, with the Austrian emperors). In1918, the end of the First World War saw the Ampezzo Valley incorporated within the Italian state.From then up to today, the Regole struggled to maintain their autonomous status under special excep-tions in the national legislation and regional laws, a feat that depended on a combination of personalskills of the Regolieri and importance and visibility of the landscape they managed to conserve. About15 years ago, the Regole finally received a major recognition as the sole and full legal managers of the Parco Naturale delle Dolomiti d'Ampezzo \u2014 a regional protected area established on land and resources mostly conserved by them. They have also obtained a tax-free status from the Italian govern-ment and major project funds and subsidies from the European Union, the Italian state and the Venetoregional government. Old and new social movements provide a variety of examples of civil societyorganised to reclaim power from below. These include attempts to transform gov-ernance structures through political participation, face-to-face discussions, andempowered federations that include people from various local places. Some ofthese movements have ties with religious beliefs (such as the liberation theologymovements of Latin America 7700or the Islamic Brotherhoods that acted as develop- ment agents in West Africa7711), ethnic, caste or kinship associations, and gender or age-based groups.7722Others are linked with cooperatives or even the management of natural resources, such as irrigation associations, fishers associations and allsorts of other mutual aid groups. Most typically, these movements include unions,born to uplift the conditions of workers with common interests and concerns and,today, indigenous peoples organisations active in national and international con-texts. Independent pathways from below raise many challenges and risks, as demon- strated by moments in history when citizens have experimented with new formsof direct democracy and confederated power. 7733For instance in Spain, during the Civil War of 1936-1939, the peasants of Andalusia and Aragon established com-munal systems of land tenure, in some cases abolishing the use of money forinternal transactions, setting up free systems of production and distribution, andcreating a decision making procedure based on popular assemblies and direct,face to face democracy. A system of self-management for workers was set up innumerous cities, including Barcelona and Valencia. Factories, transport facilities,utilities, retail and wholesale enterprises were all taken over and administered byworkers' committees and unions. Much can be learned from these experiments. 7744 Federations, nnetworks aand oorganised ppolicy across a range of scales- from individual through national to international federations, consortiums, networks and umbrella bodies.One reason for linking up and federating in this way is to increase the leverage oforganisations in policy and political debates. Federated organisations have an important role in projecting the voice and con- cerns of resource users and other citizens in a variety of spheres. Many such fed-erations that aim to influence policy-making are not only natural resource basedand agricultural organisations. They may be landless people's movements (theclearest examples being the million strong Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais sem Terra the Philippines),7755federations of the urban poor,7766indigenous people's movements (such as the Coordinating Body for the Indigenous Peoples' Organisations of theAmazon Basin COICA), 7777peasant des Organisations Paysannes de l'Afrique de l'Ouest \u2014 ROPPA in West Africa), or vari- ous national federations of producer organisations, such as those of Benin, Niger,Mali and Senegal. 7788Most of these organisations come to natural resource policy debates with wider agendas\u2014 about, say, land redistribution or participatory gov-ernance. As a result, discussions may be very wide ranging and complex. Yet,they can lead to important shifts in the balance of power in favour of poor ruralpeople, as the rise of producer organisations in West Africa illustrates (see Box11.11). Producers organisations have also been active at the international level. One examples is Via Campesina 7799, a broad, worldwide coalition of peasants and farm- EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICY CHANGE 41572Ralston et al. ,1983. 73Bookchin, 1996; Bookchin, 1998. 74Bookchin 1994. 75MST in Brazil has its own website, with pages in Portuguese, English, French, Spanish and Italian, such is its international pr ominence. See: http://www.mstbrazil.org/ . KMP is a nationwide federation of Philippine organisations, which claims to have \"effective leadership\" of over 800,000 landless peasants, small farmers, farm workers, subsistence fisherfolk, peasant women and rural land tenure reform, agroecology, and food sovereignty. Another example is the World Alliance of Mobile Indigenous Peoples (WAMIP)\u2014 a neworganisation whose members are nomadic pastoralists, hunters and gatherers,shifting cultivators and sea nomads. The organisation is made up of tribes, peoplesand indigenous nations whose livelihoods, production systems and cultural identi-ty depend on a mobile lifestyle and on the sustainable use (and thus conservation)of natural resources. These peoples are among the most disinherited and discrimi-nated groups in and Gu\u00e8ye, 2003) Producer organisations (POs) cover a wide range of activities, from management of common woodland or pasture resources to water user associations, collection and sale of a particular crop or providingaccess to fertiliser, seed and credit. Grouping together through collective action enables producers totake advantage of economies of scale and to make their voices heard in government policy and deci-sion-making. Additionally, producers hope to increase their negotiating power with companies buyingtheir crop, all the more necessary as globalisation is bringing an increased concentration and integra-tion of agri-business throughout the world. In some cases, producer organisations have also provided avaluable bridging function between farmers and sources of technical expertise, such as research andextension structures. Foreign aid funds have often been instrumental in strengthening the role that POscan play despite the associated risk that the leadership may become distant from the interests and needsof the membership. Over the past decade, a range of POs have become established and have strengthened their positions at local, national and sub-regional levels in West Africa. These organisations are in part the result of gov-ernment withdrawal from important sectors of the rural economy, including agricultural input supplyand marketing. They also have emerged in a context of greater political liberalisation, and now repre-sent a political force of which governments must take notice. This became clear from the strike byMali's cotton farmers in the 2001 season, due to low prices and continued waste and corruption withinthe Compagnie Malienne pour le D\u00e9veloppement des Textiles . The strike cut output by half, with many cotton farmers switching to maize and other cash crops for that season.8800 Examples of POs operating at national level include the Comit\u00e9 National de Concertation des Ruraux (CNCR) in du Niger (SEXAGON) in Mali.8811The CNCR provides an interesting case, which brings together a series of PO federations in Senegal, and has become a central actor in the dia-logue between government, donors, and producers on agricultural strategy and related issues, such asland tenure. Such POs have the advantage of providing a channel to make the case for greater supportto agriculture in general, as well as to take account of the particular constraints faced by smallholders.Policy and decision-making in government tend to follow both formal and informal procedures.Smallholders have less easy access to informal mechanisms that operate via \"old-boy\" (informal friendsand associates) networks, and lobbying through high-level political contacts, which are usually the pre-serve of powerful economic actors, such as large commercial farmers and agribusiness. Thus, POs needto make best use of official channels and opportunities to give voice to the needs of less powerfulactors. At the regional level, there has been increased interest in generating pressure on governments and regional institutions to ensure producer interests are better taken into account in negotiation processes 80Toulmin and Gu\u00e8ye, 2003. 81GRAF/ GRET/ IIED, 2003.EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICY CHANGE 417relating to the WTO, the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform and Cotonou negotia- tions. Examples include the R\u00e9seau des l'Afrique de l'Ouest (ROPPA), the Association Cotonni\u00e8re Africaine and the Union of Chambers of Agriculture for West Africa. ROPPA and its members have been particularly vocal in support of household farming, and opposed to theagribusiness model being promoted by some as the means to \"modernise\" agriculture. \"This vision (insupport of household farming) has been inspired by a global perception of the role of agriculture insociety, not only for producing food and fibre but also for performing many other economic, social andenvironmental functions\". 8822Thus, the argument being made by ROPPA and others supports broader debates regarding the \"multi-functionality\" of agriculture and of the land, and the consequent need toavoid a purely economic or market-based approach. 8833 A key goal of the more emancipatory federations and umbrella organisations is to develop a public sphere that allows for maximum democracy in the literal senseof the term. In its present form, this new politics in the making affirms the valuesof: zConfederalism - a network of bodies or councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies, in the villages, tribes, towns and even neighbourhoods of large cities. These confederal bodiesor councils become the means of interlinking villages, towns, neighbourhoodsand ecological units into a confederation based on shared responsibilities, fullaccountability, firmly mandated representatives and the right to recall them, ifnecessary. zDual power - the larger and more numerous the linked federations and confed- erations become, the greater their potential to constitute a significant counter- power to the state and transnational corporations. Confederations can eventual-ly exert \"dual power\", using this to further citizen empowerment and democrat-ic change. For example, they can seek power within local government throughstrategies of collaboration and political negotiation, while maintaining strongcommunity and municipal organising strategies at the grassroots. Multiple lanesfor engagement can also be used to link community based conservation anddevelopment, social movements, and political parties with direct local gover-nance strategies. This dual power approach is widely used by the IndonesianPeasant Rights movement (Box 11.12) and the work of the Barangay-BayanGovernance Consortium in the , 2003) The demise of the repressive Suharto Government in 1997 made it possible for the Indonesian civil society to come out and organise for change on a large scale. New peasant movements have emergedin every region of Indonesia. The Agrarian Reform Consortium and the Peasant Rights Movementslaunched by the North Sumatra Small Farmers Union, the Friends of Small Farmers movement in cen-tral Java as well as the Integrated Pest Management farmers movement created an even bigger alliancein the history of farmers' movement in Indonesia by establishing a Peasant Rights Movement. Organisedas a broad federation, the movement is a strong reaction to the neo-liberal approach of trade liberalisa-tion and especially to the corporate takeover of food and farming. The movement is campaigning toprotect the livelihoods and culture of Indonesian rural communities, and claiming rights to food andfarmer sovereignty. It argues that genuine food security and participation of farmers can only be realisedin a system where the sovereignty of farmers organisations and activities are guaranteed. Farmers and 82Beli\u00e8res et al. civil society for policy change depends on creating an enabling social context at different levels, including within civil society organisations andpeoples' movements themselves. At this point in time, three main challengesappear to stand out for civil society, which we will discuss below. EEqquuiittyy,, ggeennddeerr aanndd vvooiiccee Throughout the world, the challenge of widening social inclusion and representa- tion is key for most civil society organisations and the federations they are part of.people must be able to exercise their human rights to define their food and farming policies as well ashave the right to produce their food in accordance with the diversity of their socio-cultural and ecologi-cal contexts. Many civil society organisations are linked into broad federations to exert countervailing power against what they perceive as a largely corrupt centralised government. Networks and federations get activelyengaged in policy reforms at the sub-district, district, provincial and national government levels. Civilsociety organisations facilitate participatory policy processes and co-management settings. A diversity ofdeliberative and inclusive processes is used by networks and coalitions to gain leverage, exert pressurefrom below and effect policy changes. Whilst the primary focus is on institutionalising participatorygovernance at the community level, well organised farmer federations have secured important policy changes by engaging with civil servants at the district and sub district government level. 8844 Iszatt, 2004) It began as a small initiative known as the \"BATMAN\" project and today it is a movement of NGOs, peoples' organisations, social groups and progressive local officials, loosely known as the Barangay-Bayan Governance Consortium (BBGC)\u2014 one of the largest organised consortia working on participato-ry local governance anywhere in the world. By using the dual power approach, which \"targets civil society, government, and the democratic space in between\", concrete gains have been made, including changed attitudes and behaviours, democra-tised and more accountable local decision-making, strengthened governance institutions, contributionsto policy changes, and delivered basic services and livelihoods. Participation in governance has takenon new meanings, as ordinary citizens developed a personal stake in striving for genuine democraticchange and transforming power relations and structures that have been acting, and still can act, to per-petuate patronage, injustice, poverty and marginalisation. Local actors involved in BBGC openly reflect on the obstacles and the challenges they face. They dis- cuss how to change deeply engrained political cultures, including both the \"bossism\" that persistsamongst some officials, and the patron-client culture often found in the community; how to scale upand out from local levels to more national levels, and from rural to urban; how to deal with issues ofserious conflict; how to carry participatory work in areas with strong ethnic or religious minorities; andmost of all, how to institutionalise and sustain the gains that are made through local community action. EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR al. forthcoming. 89Cited in Deere and Leon, 2001: 52. 90Deere and Leon, 2001. 91Nagar and Raju, 2003. 92Fakih et al. , learning how to better include and respect the voices of the very poor and marginalised are both enduring and urgent new challenges for civilsociety at large. Several discussions of peoples' movements involving farmers andother resource users generally conclude that the demands of these movements arebiased to the needs of rich\u2014 or at least to those of surplus\u2014 producers. 8855Some movements tend not to voice concerns of particular relevance to the rural poor,such as minimum wages and harassment. Similarly, recent reviews of membershiporganisations have at times concluded that \"successful groups among the poortend to exclude the layers below\". 8866This is especially the case for groups whose functions relate primarily to economic service provision, marketing, etc.8877 And yet, this is by no means a universal phenomenon. For example, Indian farmer movement demands for higher crop prices allow more surplus retention in ruralareas, creating investment capital that allow rural industrialisation and thus jobsfor the poor. 8888Even if the voices and interests of some layers of the poorest are excluded in such organisations, the voices of less poor (but still poor) people arelikely still to be included. The implication here is not to work against such organi-sations or criticise them harshly, but to support additional organisations that canspecifically represent the very poor and the marginalised environments in whichthey live. It also means that civil society needs to constantly ask: \"under whatconditions can poor people's voices be heard, and projected by, organisationsand social movements that also involve wealthier farmers, fisherfolk, and otherresource users?\" Although natural resource management is becoming increasingly feminised, rural organisations still seem to reflect and reinforce the patriarchal relations that char-acterise many rural societies. Thus if raising the voice of poor people in naturalresource policy is a general problem, then raising the voice of poor women inthese policy discussions is particularly challenging. Traditional, community levelorganisations are often biased to men. In Ecuador, for instance, the InternationalFund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) estimated less than 10 per cent of themembers of community assemblies were women, and some estimate that womenhold only one per cent of leadership positions. 8899Women also suffer discrimination within many large-scale organisations created by indigenous peoples.9900Whilst many NGOs have sought to increase women's participation, there are manyobstacles to gender sensitivity and inclusion within NGOs. In India for example,broader social relations of caste and class can influence how the NGOs deal withwomen farmers, reducing any extent to which their work is empowering. 9911In Indonesia, more gender inclusive policies and practices have only just recentlystarted to be introduced in Farmer Field Schools (FFS) and the wider federationFFS are part of. 9922 One important obstacle to women's voice in such organisations is that participa- tion is linked to tenure over land and other natural resources. Tenure rules oftenprivilege male ownership (though not in all cultural contexts). In this connection,the success of women's and indigenous movements in shaping new land use leg-islation so that it is more inclusive of women's tenure rights is very significant. enhance the voice of women in policy and institutions. It also encourages civil society to constantly ask: \"underwhat conditions can women gain more space in organisations and peoples' move-ments to voice their views on natural resource management, and make their prior-ities There are important differences between two radically different types of spaces for participation in the governance of natural resources: invited spaces from above and popular or citizen spaces. Government- and donor-led efforts to set up co- management committees and resource user groups are examples of invited spacesfrom above. In contrast, citizen or popular spaces are created by people whocome together to create arenas over which they have more control e.g., indige- nous peoples platforms for negotiation and collective action or do-it-yourselfCitizens Juries that frame alternative policies.... Whilst there are notable excep-tions, popular spaces are arenas within which, and from which, ordinary citizenscan gain the confidence to use their voice, analyse, deliberate, frame alternativesand action, mobilise, build alliances, and act. 9944 But not all spaces for participation have the possibility to become spaces for real change. Popular spaces usually offer more opportunities for civil society to devel-op its agenda than invited spaces by governments. And yet, they are not alwayswelcoming spaces for women, nor inclusive of the weak and marginalised, norfree from manipulation and co-option by powerful insiders and/ or outsiders. 9955 Citizen or popular spaces can reproduce subtle forms of exclusion through lan- guage and other cultural codes. Spaces, including citizen spaces, are infused with power relations, affecting who enters them, who speaks with what knowledge and voice, and who benefits. Thisis particularly apparent, for example, when both professional knowledge and peo-ples' experiential knowledge are brought together in the same space and dis-cussed. Foresters, agronomists, protected area managers, water engineers, healthprofessionals, architects, land use planners, and scientists all have specialistknowledge that can usefully feed into citizen deliberations and more inclusiveforms of participation that strengthen civil society. But the deliberative process,and the political negotiation over what constitutes valid knowledge in a particularcontext (see Box 11.14), deeply challenges professionals to assume different rolesand responsibilities. In particular, citizens with professional knowledge will oftenneed to shift to new roles that facilitate local people's analysis, deliberations andproduction \"Perhaps we should abandon a whole tradition that allows us to imagine that knowledge can exist only where the power relations are suspended and that knowledge can develop only outside its injunctions, its demands and its interests. Perhaps we should abandon the belief that power makes mad and that, by the same token, the renunciation of power is one of the conditions of knowledge. We should admit, rather, that power produces knowledge...; that power and knowledge directly imply one another; that there is no power relation without the correlative constitution of a field of knowledge, nor any knowl- edge that does not presuppose and constitute at the same time power relations....In short, it is not the 94See Pimbert and Wakeford, 2001b; Cornwall and Coelho, 2004. 95See Box 7.3.EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICY CHANGE 421activity of the subject of knowledge that produces a corpus of knowledge, useful or resistant to power, but power-knowledge, the processes and struggles that traverse it and of which it is made up, that determines the forms and possible domains of knowledge.\" (Foucault, 1979: pp. 27-28) \"Contests for knowledge are contests for power. For nearly two centuries these contests have been rigged in favour of scientific knowledge by the established power structures. We should ask why scien- tific knowledge has acquired the privileged status that it enjoys, why it is that scientists' endeavours are not seen to be on a par with other cultural endeavours, but have come to be singled out as providing the one and only expert route to knowledge and guide to action. We need to confront the question of what kinds of knowledge we want to produce, and recognise that that is, at the same time, a question about what kinds of power relations we want to support\u2014 and what kind of world we want to live in.... A socially responsible science has to be a science that does not allow itself to be set apart from, let alone above, other human endeavours. In our interactions with the world, we are all involved in the production of knowledge about the world\u2014 in that sense, there is no single group of experts\". (Kamminga, 1995: 321) As power and knowledge are impossible to disentangle, the struggle to involve thefull diversity of civil society in the production of knowledge is part of the largerstruggle for a more equitable distribution of power. The adoption of a participato-ry culture within organisations, including civil society organisations, and changesin attitudes and behaviour are unlikely to \"automatically follow\" when new meth-ods for deliberation are adopted or suddenly become fashionable. Chapter 9 ofthis volume describes the challenge of designing appropriate institutional mecha-nisms and rewards to encourage the spread of a participatory culture and praxiswithin government organisations. Civil society organisations and movements thatseek to create more safe spaces for participation are similarly challenged to trans-form themselves, and some ideas about the elements to tackle are offered inChecklist 11.5. More generally, civil society will often need to understand better which spaces offer the possibility for meaningful voice and shift in power relations, and whichdo not; when it makes sense to engage within \"invited spaces\", and when it ismore appropriate to remain outside. Guidelines and criteria for engagement canhelp citizens and civil society groups decide whether, when, why and how toengage in policy processes. 9966But, in the final analysis, creating safe spaces for democratic participation will depend on civil society's conscious social commit- ment to a politics of freedom, equity and gender inclusion. 2000; Pimbert, 2003a) Key actions for reformers working for more accountable organisations (local and national government, NGOs, civil society organisations) include: zdiversify the governance and the membership of budget allocation committees of public sector plan- ning, services and research institutes to include representatives of diverse citizen groups and proce- dures to ensure transparency, equity and accountability in the allocation of funds and disseminationof new knowledge; zencourage shifts from hierarchical and rigidly bureaucratic structures to enabling government policies, pressure from below, organi- sational change and professional reorientation are all necessary preconditions forshifts towards more policy making byand forcitizens.9977However, at this time in history, the \"power to define reality\" rests less and less with governments and pro-fessionals engaged in planning, service delivery and in the design of technologiesto meet human needs. Globalisation in its present form induces huge power dif-ferentials as a small minority of economic actors seek and often obtain controlover markets, technologies, policies and institutions, imposing a one dimensionalhomogenising reality on diversity. Of the top one hundred economic entities ofthe world, 51 are corporations and only 49 are states. The top 200 trans-nationalcorporations (TNCs) are responsible for about 25% of all measured economicactivity in the world. Since the early 1990s, in the United States, average corpo-rate profits have increased by 108% and the compensation packages of CorporateChief Executives have increased by a massive 481%. During the same period,average annual wages for workers have risen only 28%, barely keeping abreastwith inflation. In 1960 the combined incomes of the richest fifth of the world'spopulation were 30 times greater than the poorest fifth. By 1991 it was over 60times and in 2003 the UN's latest figures estimate it as 80 times as high. 9988 Powerful TNCs use a variety of official and unofficial instruments to impose three basic freedoms central to the neo-liberal credo of international competitivenessand comparative advantage: freedom of investment, freedom of capital flows,freedom of trade in goods and services. 9999 TNCs rely on unofficial, non transparent and discrete bodies to influence govern- ments and opinion makers such as:sive organisations; zprovide capacity building for technical and scientific personnel to foster those participatory skills, attitudes and behaviour needed to learn from citizens (mutual listening, respect, gender sensitivity as well as methods for participatory learning and action); zensure that senior and middle management positions are occupied by competent facilitators of organisational change, with the vision, commitment and ability to reverse gender and other discrim- inatory biases in the ideologies, disciplines and practices animating an organisation; zpromote and reward management that is consultative and participatory rather than verticalist and efficiency led, and establish incentive and accountability systems that are equitable for women and men; zprovide incentives and high rewards for staff to experiment, take initiatives and acknowledge errors as a way of learning by doing and engaging with the diverse local realities of citizen's livelihoods in urban and rural contexts; zredesign practical arrangements and the use of space and time within the workplace to meet the diverse needs of women, men and older staff as well as their new professional obligations to work more closely with citizens and other actors (time tables, career paths, working hours, provision ofpaternity and maternity leave, childcare provisions, mini sabbaticals, promotion criteria...); zencourage and reward the use of gender disaggregated and socially differentiated local indicators and criteria in monitoring and evaluation as well as in guiding subsequent technical support, policy changes and allocation of scarce resources. and references therein. 98UNDP, 2003. 99George, 2000.EMPOWERING CIVIL SOCIETY FOR POLICY CHANGE 423zthe European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT) made up of the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of 47 of the largest European TNCs; the ERT works closely with the European Commission and individual heads of states, oftenwriting some of the Commission's most important \"White Papers\"; 110000 zthe Trans Atlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) composed of CEOs from North America andEurope. Through regular dialoguewith top politicians and interna-tional agency leaders, the TABDstrongly influences internationaltrade negotiations; it also main-tains permanent expert committeeson a range of topics includingstandard-setting for goods andservices so that products may befreely sold in all markets. As an official organisation, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is particu-larly responsive to the demands of TNCs for internationally binding rules in favourof total freedom of trade in goods and services. With little or no public oversight,corporations actively shape WTO negotiations on the liberalisation of trade ongoods, agricultural products and intellectual property. Areas such as health, edu-cation, culture, the environment, and energy are corporate targets under theemerging General Agreement on Trade in Services. The decisions of the WTO'sDispute Resolution Mechanism (panels of trade experts, meeting behind closeddoors) are enforceable through sanctions and apply to all 136 member-countries,both developed and developing. This is where WTO's greatest power lies: duringthe first five years of its existence, the rulings of the dispute settlement body havegenerally upheld corporate interests over those of people and the environment. Corporate led globalisation is increasingly dis-empowering many more citizens on an unprecedented scale, both in the North and the South. Increasing job losses,fractured livelihoods, economic marginalisation, fear and anxiety about the futureare all induced by the drive for comparative advantage and international competi-tiveness via: zrelocations of industry and services, often from countries with higher labour costs and regulatory standards (environmental, working conditions) to coun- tries with lower ones; zmergers and acquisitions, with post acquisition rationalisation; zdeployment of new cost and labour saving technologies (computers, robotics, automation, biotechnologies) in the restructuring of manufacturing, agricul- ture, forestry, fisheries and, increasingly, service sectors such as banking,insurance, airlines, accounting, retailing, hotels and environmental agencies; zreductions in public sector spending and privatisation; zspread of a culture and vision emphasising the inevitability of the neo-liberal agenda, the public has to accept that There Is No Alternative (the TINA syn- drome).110011 100Balany\u00e0, 2000. 101International Forum on Globalisation, 2002. 424 SHARING POWERIn this regard it is important to note that women are more harmed than men by the growing inequalities, insecure employment, and social unrest that havemarked the last two decades of neo-liberalism (1980-2000). Throughout theworld, women are the first hit by displacements induced by \"modernising\" forestand agricultural development, and by the mass redundancies associated with thecurrent frenzy of mergers, acquisitions and re-locations of industries. In bothdeveloped and developing countries, women's average wages continue to be sig-nificantly lower than men's\u2014 in all professions and across all social groups.Women are under-represented in all of the world's governments and parliamentswhere they are often used as tokens in processes of political participation.Moreover, there is some evidence that the degradation of living conditions inpoorer households everywhere has translated into an increase in levels of vio-lence, particularly in domestic and sexual violence in which women are the firstvictims. For example, as many as 40 per cent of adult women are now subjectedto domestic violence in Europe (58 per cent in Turkey...). And it is estimated that in 2002 alone, over 4 million young girls and women were soldfor use as slaves, wives or prostitutes throughout the world. 110022 Several feminist economists have shown how the gendered struc- ture of the economy as well as male bias in national and interna-tional economic policies deeply constrains the institutionalisationof both gender and inclusive participation in development. 110033 More specifically, the neo-liberal approach to development and corporate-led globalisation affirms the superiority of \"economicefficiency\" and the \"commodity economy\", to the detriment of a)the \"care economy\" where women have a predominant responsi-bility and b) the many subsistence economies that still harbourdiverse definitions of well being and a diversity of naturalresources. Whilst clearly important and necessary, a strong civil society does not only imply an expansion of political democracy to include more people and places in shaping the policy process, technolo-gies and institutions. An analysis of how power is increasinglyexercised and mediated today suggests that economic democracy and information democracy are also fundamental for change. Widening economic democracy is a key overarching condition for the main- streaming of participatory forms of policy making in this globalising world. In itsdeepest sense, \"economic democracy\" means free democratic access to themeans of life and the guarantee of freedom from material want. More specifically,there is a need for economic arrangements that offer enough material security and time for citizens (men and women included) to exercise their right to participate in shaping policies for the public good and ecological sustainability. Only withsome material security and time people can be \"empowered\" to think about whattype of policies they would like to see and how they can contribute to obtainingthem. Similarly, only with full access to information and liberation from active brain- washing by economic, political and cultural advertisements and the diffusion ofsheer lies can people develop some forms of critical consciousness. It is not possi-ble to have message-free media and purely objective ootthheerr In practice, levelling the economic playing field for democratic participation calls for radical and mutu- ally reinforcing structural reforms. Among these, the following merit closer attention because of thebroad directions they suggest for societies increasingly involved in the dynamics of globalisation: 1. A ttax oon ffinancial sspeculattions.The proposal, first launched in 1972 by James Tobin, calls for an internationally uniform tax on all conversions of currency (in the original proposal it was set at 1%).This tax would discourage speculation and encourage exchange rate stability. At the same time, withannual estimates of the tax revenue ranging from a few tens of thousands of million to a few hun-dreds of thousands of million US dollars, this globally-raised revenue could create a global fund tomeet global challenges of human and social development and conservation. Responding to a num-ber of technical criticisms, this initial proposal was transformed into a two-tier tax, levied as a nation-al tax but introduced through an international agreement, with a minimal-rate levied on all transac-tions (the \"basic tax\"), and a high rate (an anti-speculation device) triggered during periods ofexchange rate turbulence and on the basis of well-established quantitative criteria. Other variationson the theme have also pollution preven- tion and control measures to encourage rational use of scarce and environmental resources and toavoid distortions in international trade and investment. The principle requires, therefore, that the pol-luters bear the expense to achieve this. Where adopted, the principle helps to prevent or minimisepolluting processes and internalise the costs of doing so as part of the cost of production and the costis possible for media to respect different views and encourage investigative jour-nalism. It is possible for a national legislation to include safeguards against eco-nomic powers dominating the political scene, and against various forms of mediaagglomeration. And it is possible for formal education to promote critical thinking,rather than mere absorption of notions, and to expose children to pluralist viewsas early as possible. In this context, the challenge for civil society organisations and social movements is to take the lead in making other worlds possible. 110044In recent years, civil society as a whole has supported not only alternative thinking, practices and innovationsfor widespread transformation that promote democratic participation, but alsoeconomic and information democracy, alternative education systems and genderequity. Examples of proposals for structural reforms aimed at \"re-embedding theeconomy in society\" 110055and more are shown in Box 11.15. These are far from being a North-based affair. Both southern and northern actors are now discussingsuch reforms and proposals throughout the world. These newly emerging viewsare relevant in the context of our policy analysis because they speak directly tothe wider social conditions in which co-management and adaptive governance ofnatural resources can (or cannot) thrive. And yet, more civil society dialogue andinitiatives are clearly needed to further elaborate, test and implement such pro-posals in the coming years. Indeed, throughout the world, civil society is chal-lenged to give new meaning and content to the \"good life\", \"development\" andsociety's relationship with nature. 104Amin and Houtard, 2002. 105On the concept of embedded economy in society see Polanyi (1944).for the consumer. A carbon tax can be included as part of a global package of the measure and could be one of its most momentous applications. 3.A gguarantteed aand uuncondittional mminimmumm iincomme ffor aall. The Citizen Income proposal is based on the notion that the productive capacity of society is the result of all the scientific and technicalknowledge accumulated by previous generations. This is a common heritage of humankind and allindividuals regardless of origin, age or gender have a right to benefit from it, in the form of an uncon-ditional basic income. An equitable distribution of the existing world product would allow each per-son on earth to benefit from such a basic income. Apart from offering a measure of security, a CitizenIncome would allow people\u2014 men and women\u2014 to find more time to engage in caring activities,civic affairs and democratic decision-making over the means and ends of social life. 4.A ggender rredisttributtion oof rroles aand rresponsibilitties.This proposal would allow women to work for a decent wage outside the home andmen and women to share more evenly in domestic, parenting and caring activities within their households and neighbourhoods. This implies gender equitableproperty rights over resources as well as redesigning practical arrangements and the use of space andtime within the workplace to meet the diverse needs of women, men, dependent children and elder-ly people (time tables, career paths, working hours, provision of paternity and maternity leave, child-care provisions...). It may also imply a cultural shift affirming the importance and values of the non-monetary reproductive sphere as much as the monetary productive economic sphere\u2014 with men andwomen deriving their identities through a plural anchoring in both spheres of social pro- posal is about finding ways to a) change the sexual division of labour so that men do as muchunpaid work as women and engage in caring activities within the domestic/ reproductive sphere, b) ensure that wage-work is more evenly distributed so that everyone caninvest in other activities, outside the wage economy , c) defend the rights associated with wage-work, and d) move towards a post-wage societyand introduce new rights de-linked from wage-work. An important goalhere is to free up peoples' time for self-chosen and autonomous activi-ties, whilst ensuring freedom people live will need to offer more individual and collective opportunities ofengaging in many different activities outside\u2014 and unmediated by\u2014the market, wage-work and commodity production. These environmentscould provide the structural means by which citizens could managetheir own affairs through face to face processes of deliberation and deci-sion making. 110066 7.The aacttive ppursuitt oof iinformmattion ddemmocracyy. If, as in the words of Thomas Jefferson, \"information is the currency of democracy\", democ-racy is indeed still in its infancy. Enormous work still needs to be donebefore the majority of people engage in critical thinking and well-informed decision making. Such work should start from profoundreforms in formal education curricula, where pluralist perspectivesshould be substituted in place of monolithic interpretations of historyand uncritical perspectives on \"science\". And it could continue withappropriate regulation of the media business, safeguarding againstpower agglomerations, enforcing strict codes of conduct with regard to the implicit or explicit diffusion of false information, establishing appropriate procedures to subtractelectoral politics from the grip of economic power and encouraging investigative journalism. 426 SHARING POWER 106Bookchin, 1971; Gorz, 1997; Biel participation in the policy process depends on expand- ing spaces for autonomous action by civil society, the regeneration of diverselocal economies, technologies and ecologies, commitment to deliberative democ-racy and robust ways to make global and national institutions accountable tothose excluded from decision making, 110077and engagement towards ways of think- ing that are, at the same time, more critical and more respectful of the self andothers. The unprecedented imbalances of power induced by corporate-led globalisation challenge all co-management practitioners to engage with these new frontiers,and to work towards the strengthening of civil society, both in the North and theSouth. In the final analysis, only a strong civil society can get people meaningfullyinvolved in the work of the United Nations, shape the international policy arena,lobby for international safeguards and accountability, reform national policies onenvironment and development, and achieve local solutions that value the wealthand diversity of the world's cultures, communities and environments.428 SHARING POWERThe closing words of this volume are written while its authors are scattered in var- ious continents attempting to do, in practice, what this volume has advocated anddescribed. From the variety of our experiences, a few points seem evident to us: zThe wonderful and arresting complexity of each real-life context makes each \"co-management case\" unique and requires, each time, unique study and care. An appreciation of this complexity, a grounding in history and the expe-rience of local communities, and a basic awareness of the relevant biologicaldiversity and ecosystem functions are the necessary starting point for anythingthat hopes to be effective. zOn the basis of this appreciation and understanding, the most important ingre- dients to get co-management moving are humane qualities rather than intel- lectual qualities or technical proficiencies: a positive attitude, good will,curiosity, attention, care, honesty, appreciation, respect, patience... evenhumbleness, but also conviviality, perseverance, determination and, moreoften than not, courage. It is only by building upon these qualities that peoplecan effectively respect and recognise each other's arguments and entitlements,listen, think and organise together, and take new and effective action. zA further crucial ingredient is the concrete ability of people to become involved. It may be hard for some of our readers to imagine this, but some power-ful obstacles to co-management includebeing perennially sick\u2014 weak with para-sites and malaria, light-headed becauseof lack of food, depressed because of asuccession of disasters in the family. Theyinclude being unable to reach a meetingbecause of lack of means of transporta-tion or sheer time, as... if one goes to ameeting, who else will tend the field,fetch the water, care for the children orthe sick? These are important considera-tions to keep in mind when we comparecases in resource-rich and resource-poorenvironments and when we set forth to \"save biodiversity\" in the midst of the downtrodden of this world. There areprerequisites for co-management, and those begin with adequate local capaci-ties, from the most basic to the sophisticated.CONCLUDING REMARKS CONCLUDING REMARKS 429zThen there is what in this volume we have referred to as a \"learning attitude\", the openness to novelty, the willingness to experiment, and the curiosity that motivates people to carry out action-research and not be satisfied with easyexplanations, platitudes and common scapegoats. We believe that one of thepowerful advantages of co-management is the wise merging of local and non-local knowledge and skills\u2014 those grounded in the tradition and the accumu-lated experience of indigenous peoples and local communities and thoseextracted by formal scientists through a careful analysis of different cases andcontexts. We have referred to this wise merging as syncretic solutions \u2014 they appear as made up of bits of incompatible nature, but prove surprisingly freshand effective. A learning attitude is essential for adaptive management, but itmust concern more than environmental interventions and their results.Adaptive management has to include adaptive governance\u2014 striving for livelyinstitutions, capable of responding through time to the changing conditionsthat embed both conservation and livelihoods in a given environment.... zA learning attitude and the willingness to merge knowledge from various sources and origins are a good part of what constitutes a \"co-management process\" but not all of it. Fortunately, one does not need to reinvent hot waterat every turn, as much has been learned about experiences, methods, toolsand institutions that help people to exchange ideas in constructive settingsand effectively understand, plan and act together. We believe that much of theusefulness of this volume rests on the fact that it offers a variety of lessons andtools distilled from experience, and many examples from the field. The lessonsand tools are not meant to be \"applied\" but considered, adapted, modifiedand used only with wisdom and under intelligent surveillance. Similarly, theexamples are not meant to be \"copied\" but taken into consideration as a poolof ideas and insights. We have gone into some depth to describe issues to beexamined and dealt with in preparing partnerships, negotiating agreements,developing co-management organisations, and learning by doing, and wehope that the relevant descriptions, checklists, tools and examples will be use-ful and inspiring. Indeed, we trust to have convinced at least some of ourreaders that co-management depends upon on-going learning, and that thebest results can be achieved by developing policies and programmes on thebasis of lessons learned in practice. The ball is now in the court of communi-ties, field-based initiatives, policy-makers, professional networks and traininginstitutions... and much needs to be accomplished. zA crucial role is played by the context in which the specific situation we would wish to see evolving into co-management happens to exist. A web of political and socio-cultural ties and economic opportunities and constraints iswhat makes it possible or impossible to work, reap just returns and invest in abetter future. It is what makes the difference between building upon quick-sand or on solid ground, acting in fear or security, sustaining results or seeingthem wither because of lack of recognition and support. All of us engaged infield-based initiatives have to recognise, first and foremost, whether we arenot attempting to co-manage... a handful of dust. Is there a sufficient econom-ic basis for local livelihoods? And, if yes, is there a way to secure the condi-tions that make such livelihoods possible? Too often, the local producers carryout most of the work and bear most of the risks and yet receive minimalreturns, dictated by wholesalers and market speculators.... Too often the oneswho dare speak the truth and organise for change are the first ones to pay.Practitioners should make an honest assessment of whether the necessary con-430 SHARING POWERditions for co-management are in place. If the answer is no, those conditions should be tackled first. zUltimately, the success of a co-management setting is determined by what local actors see as important, and affecting their lives. The results of co-man- agement should be tangible in the sense that the relevant parties should beable to figure out whether the agreement they have developed actually solvestheir problems. And yet, the satisfaction of a group of parties or even a \"localmajority\" is not all. A balance must be struck between local meaning and val-ues and broader, nationally or internationally declared, liberating principles.Such principles enrich and improve the life of everyone and preserve valuesgreater than any one of us, such as respect for biological diversity and humanrights. In this sense, co-management may offer safeguards against both thenarrow-mindedness and selfishness that can accompany localised decision-making, and the abstract rhetoric and impositions possibly related to decision-making on a large scale.... The reader of this volume will have noted that, while discussing co-management, we often focused on the role of indigenous peoples and local communities. Wedid so as we believe that the \"community mode\" of being in this world\u2014 as com-pared with mode\" intertwined with the \"market mode\" and the\"state mode\"\u2014 has much to offer for our sanity as people and for the integrity ofour environment. As discussed in several places in this volume, the present andrecent centuries have seen a world-wide interface, and often a clash, between tra-ditional, localised, communally owned and community-based \"modern\", \"scientific\", expert-dominated and a-localsystems, based on individual, corporate or state property. This is part of a greattransformation by which markets, trans-national corporations and state techno-bureaucracies have come to dominate our lives, a transformation that is neithernecessary nor overall positive. Stressing the constructive role, creativity andunique cultural features of communities is a form of resistance to this sweepingtransformation, as communities can embed alternative values and lifestyles. Somecommunities have proven incapable of resisting the modernising onslaught, butothers\u2014 including many indigenous and mobile communities\u2014 have shownimpressive strength and resilience. We have offered some of their stories and CONCLUDING REMARKS 431examples in this volume, which are both refreshing and inspiring for us. Discussing co-management has brought us to touch upon other, more encompassing subjects, such asculture, identity, development, democracy, humanrights and the need to preserve the integrity of theplanet for future generations and for other species.This is at the heart of our motivations in writing thisvolume. We hope that, in the decades to come,cultural diversity will be fully revealed as the greatvalue that it is, and human rights will be paidincreased attention and be much more actively pursued. We also hope, however,that all this will find a counterpart in some recognition and declaration of humanresponsibilities. Possibly, the real meaning of freedom will be found through amore in-depth understanding of the practice of \"sharing power\"... curbing someof our prerogatives and privileges to recognise the ones of others\u2014 the downtrod-den and dispossessed of today, the human generations of the future and even theother species on this planet\u2014 all of whom are bearing the costs of much of whatthe powerful are doing and profiting from today. In this sense, \"sharing power\"means finding our place in the world, giving as much as receiving, and valuing allwe have been given\u2014 nature in particular\u2014 entirely and meaningfully.... Possibly never before in history have the words \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" been used so often and in so many contexts. Yet, have we truly understood what theyare about? In this volume we have discussed negotiation processes and inclusivedeliberation\u2014 ways for people to critically review issues, think together and takecommon decisions. These seem to be the best we have so far, and surely beat thedistant and poorly informed\u2014 if not actively brainwashed\u2014 exercise of votingrights in today's representative democracies. Yet, we may find that freedom anddemocracy can go deeper than our immediate \"desires\" and \"opinions\" crafted byovert and covert advertisements and stage-set politicians speaking in slogans....We may find that they depend on regaining that part of us that fuses the humanand the biological, the part that redeems the feeling of being one with nature andcompassionate (in the original etymological meaning of \"feeling together\") withall other members of our species. It is in the heart of that feeling of oneness andcompassion that awe and respect for the environment and capacity for mutual aidand collaboration are born. In that, we believe, rests the highest privilege of ourindividual and collective freedom\u2014 caring for our fellow beings and the wondersof nature. Love, sympathy and self-sacrifice certainly play an immense part in the progressive development of our moral feelings. But it is not love or not even sympathy upon which society is based in mankind. It is the conscience\u2014 be it only at the stage of an instinct\u2014 of human solidarity. It is the unconscious recognition of the force that is borrowed by each man from the practice of mutual aid; of the close dependency of everyone's happiness upon the happiness of all; and of the sense of justice, or equity, which brings the individual to consider that right of every other individual as equal to his own.
