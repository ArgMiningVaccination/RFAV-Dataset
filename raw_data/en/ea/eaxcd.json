Human & Experimental Toxicology May 2011 [epub] Neil Z Miller and Gary S Goldman FROM ABSTRACT: The infant mortality rate (IMR) is one of the most important indicators of the socioeconomic well-being and public health conditio ns of a country. The US childhood immunization schedule specifies 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 year\u2014the most in the world\u2014yet 33 natio ns have lower IMRs. Using linear regression, the immunization schedules of these 34 nations were examined and a correlation was found between infant mortality rates and the number of vaccine doses routinely given to infants. Linear regression analysis of unweighted mean infan t mortality rates showed a high statistically significant correlation between incre asing number of vaccine doses and increasing infant mortality rates. A closer inspection of correlations between vaccine doses, biochemical or synergistic toxicity, and IMRs is essential. KEY POINTS FROM THIS STUDY: 1) \"The infant mortality rate (IMR) is one of the m ost important measures of child health and overall development in countries.\" 2) \"Clean water, increased nutritional measures, be tter sanitation, and easy access to health care contribute the most to improv ing infant mortality rates in unclean, undernourished, and impoverished regions o f the world.\" 3) \"The World Health Organization (WHO) attributes 7 out of 10 childhood deaths in developing countries to five main causes: pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, malaria, and malnutrition\u2014the latter greatly affect ing all the others.\" 4) Malnutrition is associated with a decrease in im mune function which leads to an increased susceptibility to infection. 2 From the desk of Dr. Chris Quigley, Director Charle s Street Family Chiropractic and Physical Therapy part of the Boston Wellness Group 102 Charles Street, Bost on MA 02114 ph 617-720-1992 Web: susceptib ility to disease. 6) \"Despite the United States spending more per cap ita on health care than any other country, 33 nations have better infant mortal ity rates.\" 7) The high infant mortality rate in the US is not attributed solely to high premature births. 8) The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) keeps a ccurate up-to-date infant mortality statistics throughout the world. \"In 2009 there were 33 nations with better infant mortality rates than the United State s. The US infant mortality rate of 6.22 infant deaths per 1000 live births ranked 34th .\" 9) \"Many developing nations require their infants t o receive multiple vaccine doses and have national vaccine coverage rates of 9 0% or better, yet their infant mortality rates are poor.\" 10) \"Gambia requires its infants to receive 22 vacc ine doses during infancy and has a 91% -97% national vaccine coverage rate, yet its IMR is 68.8.\" 11) \"Mongolia requires 22 vaccine doses during infa ncy, has a 95% -98% coverage rate, and an infant mortality rate of 39.9 .\" 12) \"These examples appear to confirm that infant m ortality rates will remain high in nations that cannot provide clean water, pr oper nutrition, improved sanitation, and better access to health care.\" 13) \"A counter-intuitive relationship occurs betwee n the number of vaccines given to infants and infant mortality rates: nations with higher (worse) infant mortality rates give their infants, on average, more vaccine doses.\" \"Are some infant deaths associated with over-vaccination?\" 14) \"Among the 34 nations analyzed, those that requ ire the most vaccines tend to have the worst IMRs. Thus, we must ask important qu estions: is it possible that some nations are requiring too many vaccines for th eir infants and the additional vaccines are a toxic burden on their health? Are so me deaths that are listed within the 130 infant mortality death categories really de aths that are associated with over-vaccination? Are some vaccine-related deaths h idden within the death tables?\" 15) \"Prior to contemporary vaccination programs, 'C rib death' [Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)] was so infrequent that it wa s not mentioned in infant mortality statistics.\" 3 From the desk of Dr. Chris Quigley, Director Charle s Street Family Chiropractic and Physical Therapy part of the Boston Wellness Group 102 Charles Street, Bost on MA 02114 ph 617-720-1992 Web: thebostonwellnessgroup.com email: 16) In the US, national immunization campaigns bega n in the 1960s. \"Shortly thereafter, in 1969, medical certifiers presented a new medical term\u2014sudden infant death syndrome.\" [Sudden and unexpected death of an infant which remains unexplained after a thorough investigation]. SIDS w as not added to the National Center for Health Statistics as new cause-of-death category until 1973. 17) \"By 1980, SIDS had become the leading cause of postneonatal mortality (deaths of infants from 28 days to one year old) in the United States.\" 18) There is evidence that some infants may be \"mor e susceptible to SIDS shortly after being vaccinated.\" 19) A 1982 study published in the journal Neurology concluded that DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus toxoid) vaccine ''may be a generally unrecognized major cause of sudden infant and early childhood de ath, and that the risks of immunization may outweigh its potential benefits.\" 20) A 1987 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found the SIDS mortality rate in the period zero to three day s following DPT to be 7.3 times greater that in the period beginning 30 days after immunization. 21) A 1992 article published in the American Journa l of Epidemiology found that babies died at a rate about eight times greater tha n normal within 3 days after getting a DPT vaccination. 22) The authors present evidence that vaccine relat ed SIDS are under reported because the deaths are reclassified as death due to : Suffocation Unknown cause Unspecified causes Pneumonia Unspecified viral disease Diseases of the blood Septicemia Diseases of the nervous system Anoxic brain damage Diseases of the respiratory system Influenza Unspecified diseases of the respiratory system 23) \"It appears as though some infant deaths attrib uted to SIDS may be vaccine related, perhaps associated with biochemical or syn ergistic toxicity due to overvaccination.\" 4 From the desk of Dr. Chris Quigley, Director Charle s Street Family Chiropractic and Physical Therapy part of the Boston Wellness Group 102 Charles Street, Bost on MA 34 nations that have crossed the socio- economic threshold and are able to provide the basic necessities for infant su rvival\u2014clean water, nutrition, sanitation, and health care\u2014several require their i nfants to receive a relatively high number of vaccine doses and have relatively high in fant mortality rates. These nations should take a closer look at their infant d eath tables to determine if some fatalities are possibly related to vaccines though reclassified as other causes.\" 25) Common substances found in vaccine ate, polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid, sodium chlo polyoxyethylene) 26) \"Respiratory disturbances have been documented in close proximity to infant vaccinations, and lethal changes in the brainstem o f a recently vaccinated baby have been observed.\" 27) \"Since some infants may be more susceptible to SIDS shortly after being vaccinated, and babies vaccinated against diarrhea died from pneumonia at a statistically higher rate than non-vaccinated babie s, there is plausible biologic and causal evidence that the observed correlation betwe en IMRs and the number of vaccine doses routinely given to infants should not be dismissed as ecological bias.\" 28) \"The US childhood immunization schedule require s 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 year, the most in the worl d, yet 33 nations have better infant mortality rates.\" 29) Using linear regression, the immunization sched ules of these 34 nations were examined and a correlation was found between infant mortality rates and the number of vaccine doses routinely given to infants. 30) \"These findings demonstrate a counter-intuitive relationship: nations that require more vaccine doses tend to have higher infa nt mortality rates.\" 31) \"A closer inspection of correlations between va ccine doses, biochemical or synergistic toxicity, and infant mortality rates, i s essential.\" 5 From the desk of Dr. Chris Quigley, Director Charle s Street Family Chiropractic and Physical Therapy part of the Boston Wellness Group 102 Charles Street, Bost on MA 02114 ph 617-720-1992 Web: thebostonwellnessgroup.com Gambia and Mongolia vaccinate 91-98% of their infants with 22 vaccine doses and yet they have extremely high infa nt mortality rates. This supports that infant mortality is more linked to cl ean water, improved nutrition, and better sanitation than to vaccinations. Clearly, in countries with clean water, good nutrit ional measures and better sanitation, increasing the number of vaccination do es not reduce infant mortality, and might counter intuitively increase it as a cons equence of synergistic toxicity. Vaccines are loaded with a large range of toxins. Massive immunization campaigns in the US began in t he 1960s, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) first appeared in 1969, and S IDS became the leading cause of death of US children between 1 to 12 month s of age by 1980. These authors imply and present evidence suggesting a rel ationship between SIDS and vaccines.
