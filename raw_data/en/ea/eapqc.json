Here's a collection of recipes for the easiest crystals to try. Borax Crystals Anne Helmenstine Borax is a chemical sold as a laundry booster and for insect control. Dissolve borax in hot water to produce crystals overnight. These crystals grow readily on pipe cleaners, so you can make crystal hearts, snowflakes or other shapes. 3 tablespoons borax1 cup boiling water Crystal Window Frost Anne Helmenstine This reliable crystal growing project produces crystals in a matter of minutes. Prepare a non-toxic crystal growing solution that you wipe onto windows, mirrors or another surface to produce a crystal \"frost\". 1/3 cup Epsom salt1/2 cup hot water1 teaspoon liquid dishwashing soap Refrigerator Crystal Needles Anne Helmenstine This project uses hot tap water, not boiling water, so it's safer for young crystal growers. Place the crystal solution in the refrigerator and get sparkly needle-like crystals within a few minutes to a few hours. It's that easy! 1/2 cup Epsom salt1/2 cup hot tap waterFood coloring (optional) Salt Crystal Geode Anne Helmenstine Natural geodes require thousands of years to form, but it only takes a couple of days to make a geode yourself. This geode grows on calcium carbonate, which is simply an eggshell. The crystals are beautiful cubic salt crystals. You can leave the crystals naturally clear or add food coloring for color. EggshellSaltBoiling waterFood coloring (optional) Copper Sulfate Crystals Anne Helmenstine Copper sulfate crystals grow easily, plus they are naturally vivid blue with an interesting crystal habit. Copper sulfate is readily available online or you can find it in some stores that carry root kill or algicides that use copper sulfate as their primary ingredient. Copper sulfateVery hot tap water Easy Ammonium Phosphate Crystals Anne Helmenstine There's a reason monoammonium phosphate is the chemical included in commercial crystal growing kits! Ammonium phosphate can be made in any color and displays an interesting crystal habit. 6 tablespoons monoammonium phosphate1/2 cup very hot tap water Easy Alum Crystals Anne Helmenstine Alum crystals are clear crystals that grow in pyramids and other prisms. One of the most popular projects is to mix the alum and water together and pour the solution over a small rock to make fake \"diamonds\". 2-1/2 tablespoons alum1/2 cup very hot water Cite this Article Format mla apa chicago Your Citation Helmenstine, Anne Marie, Ph.D. \"Easy Crystal Growing Recipes.\" ThoughtCo, Apr. 5, 2023, thoughtco.com/easy-crystal-growing-recipes-606259.
