History of the University Higher education in the early days of this country was dominated by private colleges originated by religious groups who saw in them a means to provide leadership for their churches, schools, and communities. Scandinavian immigrants to this country were no exception . The institution which was t o become Augustana College began with the foundation of Hillsboro Academy in Hillsboro, Illinois, in 1835. By 1846, a Scandinavian Lutheran group had changed the name to \"The Literary and Theological Institute of The Lutheran Church of the Far West.\" The ambitious new name set the pace for the institution as it moved with the tide of immigration into America's West. The school was moved to Springfield, Illinois, where it became Illinois State University and numbered among its students John Hay, who l ater b ecame the nation's Secretary of State, and Robert Todd Lincoln, son of Abraham Lincoln. In 1860, due to differences over matters of doctrine, Professor Lars Paul Esbjorn and a group of followers moved to Chicago a nd established The Augustana Seminary with Esbjorn as the first president. The College has chosen to mark this as its founding date. The name Augustana is drawn from the origin of the Lutheran Church in the Augsburg Confession in 1530 during the time of the Reformation. The Latin designation of th is document was the Confessio Augustana. During and after the Civil War, the fledgling college was caught up in the westward movement of pioneers. The school moved with its constituents to Paxton, Illinois, in 1863; and then in succession to Marshall, Wis consin, in 1869; to Beloit, Iowa, in 1881; and to Canton, Dakota Territory, in 1884. In 1918, following the union of three Lutheran synods, the College was moved to Sioux Falls where it merged with the Lutheran Normal School to form the present ins titution . In 2015 the name Augustana College changed to Augustana University. Twenty -four presidents have served Augustana since Balcer (1965 -1980); William C. Nelsen (1980 - 1986); Sidney A. Rand (1986 -1987); Lloyd Svendsbye (1987 -1992); Sidney A. Rand (1992 -1993); Ralph H. Wagoner (1993 -2000); Bruce R. Halverson (2000 -Sandlin (2017 -present). The Seal The Augustana Seal is composed of a circle representing eternity, a triangle representing the Trinity, and a book which is th e Bible. The \"cross\" running through the book i s the Chi Rho (the monogram and symbol formed from the first two letters \"X\" and \"P\" of the Greek word for Christ). The letters VDMA are symbolic of the University motto \"VERBUM DEI MANET IN AETERNUM\" or \"The Word of God endures forever.\" The letters on ei ther side of the Bible are the Alpha and Omega of the Greek alphabet symbolizing the beginning and the end. The lamp is the Lamp of Knowledge. The three dates represent the founding dates of the College: 1860, the founding of th e College in Illinois; 1889, the founding of the Lutheran Normal School in Sioux Falls; 1918, the merger of the two schools to become Augustana College. The name Augustana is drawn from the origin of the Lutheran Church in the Augsburg Confession in 1530 during the time of the Reform ation. The Latin designation of this document was the Confessio Augustana. This seal was designed by Ogden Dalrymple, Profess or of Art from 1946 -1991.

This major is des igned to provide the student with cross -disciplinary experiences across much of the natural sciences - chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics. The intention is to provide graduates with the ability to readily integrate these disciplines and to provid e the tools necessary to break boundaries in scientific exploration. Students in this rigorous, interdisciplinary major are precluded from declaring majors in either chemistry or biology, which will allow a greater capaci ty to take classes outside of the n atural sciences. The major is a chemistry degree with a biochemistry emphasis and is American Chemical Society (ACS) approved. 71 CREDIT HOURS Graduates completing these requirements are approved by the American Chemical Society. The Chemistry Department s trongly recommends that students preparing for graduate study in biochemistry complete the ACS Approved Biochemistry Major.

Although the prime concern is with the way the ancient Greeks and Romans lived and thought, the lines of influe nce extend to our own lives as well. Religious thought, legal codes, drama, lyric poetry, and the writing of history all to ok shape in these cultures of the Mediterranean. At this time a general survey of the cultural movements of the Mediterranean world is offered with the support of the History department and a survey of classical literature is offered within the purview of comparative literature. The Philosophy department offers a survey of the ancient philosophical schools of thought. Additional courses in the classics are offered during the Interim. A Classics major and three minors (Ancient Languages, Classical Philology and Classical Studies) are available. Language courses offered beyond the beginning level are available as independent studies. Some electives are offered as topics courses. Greek is taugh t with attention to both the biblical and classical context and sati sfies seminary prerequisites in the language. Latin still functions as a valuable adjunct for work in history, religion (the early Lutheran heritage was crafted in German and Latin), English, law and medicine. Students interested in pursuing graduate studi es in Classics are urged to take additional courses in both languages and additional electives.

Computer Science and Software Engineering The underlying goal of the Department of Computer Science is to offer up -to-date, quality instruction in its undergraduate prog rams to support careers in business, science, government, and industry, and to provide a strong foundation for graduate study in comp uter science. In support of these goals, a curriculum has been developed which: 1) provides coherent, broad -based coverage of the computing discipline; 2) prepares students to apply their knowledge to solving constrained problems, which includes the ability to define a problem cl early, to specify, design, implement, test, modify, document solutions, and to work within a team e nvironment throughout the problem solving process; 3) offers sufficient exposure to the rich body of theory that underlies the field of computing; and 4) makes available an enviro nment in which students are exposed to the ethical and social issues associat ed with the computing field. The computer science department offers majors and minors in both Computer Science and in Computer Information Systems (CIS). The Computer Science major provides the strongest mathematical and scientific background. It is recomm ended for students who intend to pursue graduate studies or to seek employment involving the technical or scientific application of computing. The CIS major deals mo re with the business and human aspects of computing. It has fewer science and mathematics r equirements, but has additional requirements for courses in Business Administration. A minor in Computer Science and a minor in CIS are available to students who choose to concentrate t heir studies in an affiliated area. Courses are included in the curricu lum to support the general department goals and the detailed program goals. In addition, several courses are offered to provide the necessary basic knowledge of computer technology and computer programming for those students wishi ng to use the computer as a tool for study and research in other disciplines.

If data science is the process of extracting meaning from data, we need to know what meaning is! The technical courses provide the tools to work with data and to create models from the data . The domain knowledge courses help one to understand what it is we are looking at -- the meaning . What do our results give us and are they meaningful? Augustana's liberal arts environment provides an excellent opportunity to combine the technical field of data science with ot her fields of study in the natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities. The data science major has been designed with the application domain in mind; the application domain courses outlined above are examples; courses from other departments not listed above can also be included in the program with department appro val (or some other TBD process). Double Majors While designed to be a stand -alone major with the inclusion of application domain courses, the requirements for the data science major overlap nicely with those from mathematics and from computer science. A do uble major with data science in either of those areas will result in a set of skills that are in high demand in today's job market. Pairing the data science major with a major in business adm inistration, economics, and biology are also in -demand combinatio ns. Data science combined with other majors should also be obtainable in a four -year plan, depending on the required course overlaps. Data Science Minor While the data science major is highly technical, the data science minor is more accessible to those w ith limited time to complete the required course sequence. The minor includes exposure to two high -level data science programming languages, statistics, data analytics and modeling techniques, and data visualization techniques.

The study of economics involves theoretical analysis, statistical inference and the study of economic history and institutions. A s one thinks about improving the quality of life -from the local to t he global level -it is virtually impossible to avoid contact with \"the economic way of thinking.\" The Economics program is designed to serve the general student as well as majors and minors. The Department's goals are thre efold: 1) acquaint students with e conomic aspects of society; 2) familiarize students with models and techniques for analyzing economic problems; and 3) enable students to develop critical skills for evaluating economic policy and institutions. Economics majors find employme nt in diverse areas of the economy (e.g. banking, finance, management, teaching, government). Some majors pursue graduate training in econom ics while others pursue MBA, law or other advanced professional degrees. Augustana has a chapter of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the international economics honor society, which encourages student -faculty interaction and recognizes scholastic attainment in economics.

All programs leading to initial level certification are approved by the South Dakota Department of Education (SD DOE). It should be noted that periodic changes in the Teacher Education Program occur as state and national accrediting bodies revise their standards. The conceptual framework for the Teacher Education Program is grounded in a philosophy that integrates the best of Western educational thought, the wisdom of indigenous Native American culture, and emerging research on positive youth development. Known as the Circle of Courage, this conceptual framework empowers teac her candidates with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to create positive learning environments so that all students can learn. The central premise of the Circle of Courage is that a set of shared values supp orts a community of learners. Those shared values are belonging, mastery, independence, and generosity. A set of professional competencies, based upon the Interstate New Teachers Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC) principles, have been identified to guide course content a nd field experience s, as well as articulate what teacher candidates should know and be able to do upon program completion. The competencies assi st teacher candidates in developing a commitment to and a proficiency in their chosen profession. The curriculum and field exper iences of the Teacher Education Program are structured to blend the Circle of Courage values into a model for professional behavior. Throug hout their program of study, teacher candidates complete course requirements and participate in field experiences design ed to facilitate mastery and understanding of the program competencies. Detailed information regarding the Teacher Education Program can be found online and in various program materials such as the Teacher Education Handbook and the Student Teaching Handbo ok.

History History, the written record of the past, serves as the memory of humanity, and provides society with a common frame of refere nce. The study of history presents a panoramic view of human behavior, enhancing our understanding of self a nd others. This is true whether one studies the Western or the non -Western world. Some History majors continue their education for careers in college teaching, library science, law, public administration and the ministry. Many of our majors graduate into careers in secondary education, working in archival or museum settings, others gain employment in community service enterprises, the government or business. Whichever choice a student makes, the study of history allows a s tudent to engage in a variety of occupations, whether at home or abroad. And remember, history does not judge the past, historians do. Public History Emphasis: Public history focuses on the preservation and interpretation of history in public settings and in conversation with public aud iences. Public history includes wide variety of subfields ranging from curation, museum education, and historic preservation to interpretation, documentary film, and archival management. Students who pursue careers in public history might work as archiv ists, museum curators, or historic preservationists. Public historians help to write, create, and understand history, as well as influence the formulation of public policy. Toward this end, students seeking a public history designation need particular skills and familiarity with a variety of environments. Students seeking this area of emphasis will develop the skills necessary to work in libraries, museums, archive s, historical societies, and interpretative centers.

Medical Humanities and Society The Medical Humanities and Society mi nor offers an interdisciplinary curriculum that allows Augustana undergraduates to explore what it means to be human, to become informed about current issues in healthcare and medicine, and to examine the complexities of ill ness, health, medicine, and heal thcare. Guided by these goals, the program offers an integrative and intentional approach to investigating, evaluating, and understanding the deep impacts of illness and disease on patients, health professionals, and the social worlds in which they live an d work. A truly transformational program, medical humanities and society (e.g., narrative medicine, history of medicine, institutiona l dynamics, contemporary issues of structure and agency, culture studies, science and society studies, ethics, economics, b usiness, philosophy, and the arts) seeks to shape how undergraduate students preparing for careers in healthcare can use a foundational understanding in t he natural sciences and integrate it with the humanities and social sciences. Though not an exhausti ve list, fields of interest for those considering this program include the following: pre -medical, nursing, exercise science, pre -dental, pre -physician assistant, pre -occupational therapy, pre -physical therapy, pharmacy, social work, speech therapy, hospit al chaplains, healthcare administration, community health, public education, and athletic training. In a liberal arts setting, s tudents in these areas of inquiry will have distinctive and authentic opportunities to encounter and contemplate the deepest mea nings of health and healing, to reflect on the sacred nature of medicine as their vocation, and to integrate faith with learning and service.

Medical Laboratory Science Plan I To earn an Augustana degree with a major in Medical Laboratory Science, a student must complete three years of work at the University followed by a year of study in an approved Medical Laboratory Science program. A prospective major must make an application to the professional program during the fall of th eir junior year. Augustana will allow up to 40 credit hours for successful completion of the fourth year (as evidenced by receipt at the registrar's office of a certified transcript of the grades from an approved program). P lease see below for the require d and recommended Augustana Courses. Plan II A number of students interested in Medical Laboratory Science elect a program after obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major either in Chemistry or Biology. Following completion of the degree requiremen ts, the student will attend one additional year of educational study at an approved Medical Laboratory Science program (identical to the fourth year of Plan I). The advantages of this plan are tha t the student receives a bachelor's degree in an academic d iscipline that allows more flexibility in choices of professional career options. The particular course sequence would depend on the Biology or Chemistry major.

Clinical Laboratory Theory, Application And Correlations Lecture and case study exercises in the diagnosis and treatment of common disease states. Modern Foreign Languages An essential part of a liberal arts education is the study of world languages, cultures, and literatures. In addition to prep aring students for careers in teaching or for advanced language study at the graduate level, knowledge of a world lang uage is a strong asset and an increasingly essential skill in many career fields. Proficiency in one or more world languages can provide students with a significant com petitive edge in the global job market. The Department therefore encourages students to combine their major in Business Administration, Economics, Education, English, Government, History, Journalism, Nursing, Psychology, or Sociology, for example, with a second major or m inor in French, German or Spanish. Students may continue studying a lang uage begun in high school, or may select a new language. Advanced Placement (AP), CLEP, and Placement Exams The Department accepts Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits. See the Department website for additional information. New students who do not have AP, CLEP or transfer credit, who have a background in French, German or Spanish take a free language placement exam that specifies at which level they should continue their language study. Study, Work and Teaching Abroad Residence in a foreign country allows students to achieve higher levels of proficiency and to gain insights into a country's rich culture and customs. Dozens of opportunities to study and to work abroad are available to Augustana students and the majority of languag e majors spe nd at least one Interim or semester abroad. Post -graduate assistantships are available to teach English. Augustana faculty also lead Interim and Spring Break courses abroad. Certification Students who plan to teach with a major or minor concentration in a world language should be aware that the minimum number of credit hours necessary for certification in South Dakota is 18. Since minimum requirements in most other states are higher, students who plan to teach are strongly advised to obtain a language majo r. Assessment The Department of Modern Foreign Languages has set student learning outcomes for its language majors based on proficiency gui delines established by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL). The department continually reviews the applicability of those guidelines. Additional information can be obtained by visiting the department's website. For information on single l anguage majors or minors, see French, German or Spanish.

Baccalaureate degree for Registered Nurses : For information contact the Chair of the Nursing department. Philosophy The Philosophy major has two tracks: a Philosophy track and Religion/Philosophy track. The major is designed to give students a broad introduction to the philosophical enterprise, to relate that enterprise to the student's total educational experience, and to encourage creative reflection on life's deepest questions. The major is designed to acquaint students with the discipline of philosophy in both its historic and contemporary expressions. It aims to broaden students' intellectual horizons while heightening their mora l sensitivity and to develop their thinking and speaking skills while encouraging the integration of learning. While the study of philosophy is particularly important for students planning to enter the professions, the skills and attitu des acquired through philosophical inquiry will benefit anyone who wants to think more clearly, critically, flexibly, and comprehensively, no matt er what one's major or vocational goals may be. We are therefore eager to work with students who want to combine their study of ph ilosophy with other majors or areas of study.

Our goal is a program that prepares our students for lives of intellect ual growth and service. The Physics program is flexible and with the appropriate choice of courses can prepare students for work in industry, graduate study in physics or engineering, or teaching at the secondary level, among other options. In recent years, approximately 90% of ou r graduates have continued on to graduate or professional school. The Department of Physics also supervises the dual degree program in engineering in which students attend Augustana for three or four years and then complete the program with two years at an engineering school. This enab les the student to combine the advantages of a broad -based liberal arts education with their technical education. Students in this program receive a Bachelor of Arts from Augustana (in a major of their choice) and a Bachelor of Science in the chosen engine ering specialty from the engineering school. Cooperative plans are in place with ACADEMIC PROGRAM | 91 Columbia University (New York), Washington University (St. Louis), and the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis). Students i n the program are guaranteed admission to the engi neering school when recommended by Augustana. The particular preparatory courses that must be completed at Augustana depend upon which engineering school and which specific engineering program students wish to enter. Students are encouraged to work with t he Coordinator of the Dual Degree program in selecting their coursework. See Engineering Physics for more information.

Religion The Religion major urges students to study and wrestle with the diversity and richness of texts, ideas and communities within Christianity and within other religious traditions. The major is intended to give students a broad introduction to critical theological reflection, to relate that reflection to the students' total educational experience, and to respond creatively to the world in which they live in terms of their own religi ous and theological heritage. The major aims to broaden students' moral responsibility, to develop their critical thinking, speaking, and writing skills while encouraging them to consider faith and ethical commitments as preparation for a life of responsi ble service in church and society. Most importantly, the Religion major encourages students to engage enduring questions about the meaning of life in a context of liberal arts learning. Students may choose a Religion major as a viable liberal arts major w hich encourages them to think more clearly, critically, and comprehensively about questions that matter. It is also a major that may be chosen as preparation for seminary and graduate s tudy and church -oriented vocations. As a reflection of the holistic an d integrative orientation of a liberal education, courses are offered in the areas of Text and Context, Tradition and Culture, Contemporary Issues, and Seminar and Thesis Courses. Text and Context: Courses in this area stress the interpretation and analysi s of primary texts as they evolved in their own historical and cultural context and as they are interpreted and appropriated in other cultural and historical contexts. Tradition and Culture: Courses in this area discuss and analyze theological traditions a s they developed within their own historical culture and as they evolved in response to historical and cultural changes. Contemporary Issues: Courses in this area discuss and analyze topical issues from biblical, theological, or ethical perspectives. Seminar and Thesis: Courses in this area offer advanced work for Religion majors and other students interested in more in depth discussions of se lected topics within the theological and textual traditions.

Sociology In an increasingly complex soci ety, it is vital for students to understand how society operates and to recognize the social connections between daily lives and experiences and larger societal forces. The Sociology department curriculum enables students to identify, un derstand, and critically explore these connections. Students may draw from a broad range of topical areas including family, religion, medical sociology, deviance, gender, gerontology and social inequality. Because students of sociology grapple with a wide variety of contem porary social issues, a Sociology major or minor will equip students with basic tools for diverse career paths including graduate school preparation, administration, community development, human serv ices, law, criminology, health -related fields, ministry, etc. A sociology faculty advisor will work with each student to identify career interests and to make appropriate course selections.

Each Pre - Physical Therapy student, in consultation with his or he r advisor, should select several physical therapy schools to which application will be made and be careful to take all of the undergraduate courses which are required by those programs. Students from Augustana t ypically gain admission to public university physical therapy programs and to a number of private universities as well. Physical therapy schools select students on the basis of: 1) undergraduate academic performance; 2) GRE (Graduate Record Exam ) scores; 3) knowledge of the field of physical therapy gained during clinical observation; 4) letters of evaluation from professors and a physical therapist under whom one has observed; and 5) a personal interview. Admission to physical therapy school is competitive. PRE-PHYSICAL THERAPY SUGGESTED PROGRAM OF STUDY Most programs in physical therapy require 50 hours or more of observation in a physical therapy setting. The student should a rrange such an experience with his or her advisor.

Physician Assistant Most Pre -Physician Assistant students choose to maj or in Biology, but a student may choose to major in any discipline. While physician assistant programs look favorably upon an undergraduate record rich in challenging science courses, they also look for a bala nce between science courses and courses in the humanities and social sciences. Physician assistant programs expect that applicants have an understanding of and commitment to the profession. Students are encouraged to learn about the profession and patient care through internsh ips, volunteer experienc es and employment. Many programs require a significant patient contact experience. A career as a physician assistant is not a stepping -stone to medical school. Most physician assistant programs have very specific admission requirements. A student intere sted in a career as a physician assistant should identify the physician assistant programs in which he or she is interested in attending as early as possible. Pre -physician assistant students should consult with their advisors and the coordinator on a reg ular basis to discuss course selection and application procedures. Physician assistant schools select students on the basis of: 1) undergraduate academic performance; 2) GRE (Graduate Record E xam) scores; 3) patient care experience; 4) letters of evaluatio n from professors and other professional people; and 5) a personal interview.

The ministry demands thoroughly trained and compete nt men and women. Students are advis ed to check carefully through the requirements for the seminary they plan to attend with the help of an advisor in the Religion Department. In general, the seminaries of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; e.g., Luther Seminary, Wartburg Seminary, Trinity Seminary, and Lutheran School of Theology -Chicago, will require two years of English (including a basic course in communication), one year of Bible, two ACADEMIC PROGRAM | 119 years of Greek, one year of Philosophy, one year of history of Western civilization, and two ye ars of a modern foreign language or Hebrew or Latin. Veterinary Medicine Most pre -veterinary students choose to major in Biology, but a student may choose to major in any discipline. While veterinary schools look favorably upon an undergraduate record rich in challenging science courses, they also look for a balance between science courses and courses in the humanities and social sciences. Veterinary schools expect that applicants have an understanding of and commitment to the p rofession, which goes beyond a love of animals. Students are encouraged to learn about veterinary medicine through internships, volunte er experiences and employment. The admission requirements vary considerably among veterinary schools. A student interested in a career in veterinary medicine should identify the veterinary schools in which he or she is interested as early as possible. Pre -veterinary students should consult with their advisors and the coordinator on a regular basis to discuss course selection and application procedures.

Independent Scholarship (Regular course number): With the permission of the department involved, a student may take any regularly offered course through independent scholarship. Independent Study (199, 299, 399 or 499): In cooperation with a faculty member, a student may create an independent study course on any academic topic. The student and faculty member will design the course objectives, reading assignments, course requirements, a nd means of evaluation. General Requirements 1. At the time of registration the student must fi le a Declaration of Intent with the Registrar's Office to engage in independent learning. This proposal must bear the approval of the academic advisor, the faculty project advisor, and the chairperson of the department i n which the project will be carried out. 2. The student must file an approved Course Proposal for Independent Learning with the Registrar's Office no later than three we eks (4 days for Interim and Summer term projects) after the beginning of term during which the independent learning project is to begin. This proposal must bear the approval of the academic advisor, the faculty advisor, the chairperson of the department in which the study is to be carried out, and the Registrar. 3. The student and the instructor who is to direct the independ ent learning project are responsible for the academic soundness of the proposal. 4. With departmental approval, independent learning may be counted toward the major. 5. Students planning to complete an independent learning project over more than one semest er must enroll for the course at the time they receive formal approval for it. This enrollment may be considered as a part of the regular load or as an overload. If added a s an overload, there will be an additional charge. Students who find that it is impo ssible to complete an independent learning project may withdraw from the course without grade penalty, but without refund of tuition. Internships Students may take up to eight credit hours through internship study to count toward graduation requirements. Internship study experiences in most instances will be conducted in work settings off -campus, and in all cases they will relate to the academic major or career objectives of the student involved. The exceptions to the usual off -campus setting are the Augustana Administration Internship Program and the Center for Western Studies Internship Program, which are available on campus (see below for more information). All internships must conf orm to the following general requirements: 1. In contrast to independent learning, internships are centered around practical experiences; the action component is generally at least as important as reading and writing components. Since internships are designed to meet genuine needs in both public and pri vate sectors of society, the projects must first earn the support of the sponsoring agency or individual before the registration process may be completed. An intern must normally have an on -site supervisor in addition to a faculty supervisor. The on -site s upervisor will, almost without exception, be a permanent, full -time employee of the host organization. 2. Under normal conditions, the student must file with the Registrar an approved Course Proposal for Internship Study no later t han two weeks after the b eginning of the semester during which the internship project is to begin (or 4 days for Interim or Summer term projects). This proposal must bear the approval of the academic advisor, the faculty project advisor, the chairperson of the department in which the study is to be carried out, and the Registrar. ACADEMIC PROGRAM | 121 3. The student and the project advisor are responsible for the academic soundness of the proposal. All internship proposals will conform to the following guidelines: a. Internships should be available tho ugh not necessarily required in every department. b. Normally, only students with junior, senior or post -college standing will be eligible to take an internship. c. An internship involves a minimum of 40 hours of field experience for each credit hour earne d. d. Internships require a minimum of two conferences with the faculty project director pre - and post -conferences. Ideally there should be an additional conference for every credit hour more than one during the internship. The faculty project director mus t visit the internship site at least once (preferably twice) during the internship. If the internship is too distant from the campus to a llow this, the following options are available: i. an adjunct professor near the site must be contracted to provide thi s site visitation and evaluation, or ii. the faculty member may coordinate visits with the site supervisor through Skype, Facetime, etc. e. Internships include a reading assignment that bears upon the internship experience undertaken. f. Internships includ e a writing assignment that records the learning process (journal, log, observation report, etc.) as well as a summary paper that helps the intern reflect on the total internship experience in terms of anticipated and unanticipated learning out comes. g. Grading for internships should be based on a written evaluative report from the field supervisor, faculty observations and/or conferences with the intern, and the quality of the written work submitted. h. S/U grading is permissible for internship experiences . i. Students must be in good academic standing to participate in internships. These guidelines are also intended to make sure that a student has acquired a sufficient background in knowledge and theory r elated to the internship experience to gain maximu m benefit from it. 1. Although students may receive pay during an internship experience (dependent upon departmental policy), an internship should be a new experience based on a definite educational goal. Thus, students should not obtain internship credit for what is a regular job, whether part - or full -time, that they have been in previous to the start of the internship. An exception might be made if students assume a new pos ition or new responsibilities as part of the internship experience in their normal place of work. 2. Some departments may charge fees for internships in addition to tuition. 3. Although students may plan to complete an internship study project over more than one semester, they must enroll for the cour se at the time they received formal approval for it. This enrollment may be considered as one of their regularly required courses or as an overload. If added as an overload, they must pay the regular tuition charges for an additional course. If students find that it is impo ssible to complete an internship study project, they may withdraw from the course without penalty, but without refund of tuition. The Center for Western Studies Internship Program Students have a unique opportunity to participate in alternative learning experiences through the programs of the Center for Western Studies. Through these programs, students develop sensitivity to the history and cultural diversity of the prairie -plains region and learn about the practical aspects of managing a research agency. There are four maj or internship areas: archives and museum management; book editing and publishing; fund raising and marketing; and conference and special event administration. Combinations of these emphases are a lso possible and are encouraged. Interested students should c ontact the Center for Western Studies. The Augustana Administration Internship Program The Augustana Administration Program is designed to provide a junior or senior student an opportunity to observe and particip ate in a university administrative experience. Augustana Administration Internships will normally take one of the following forms: 1. A structured practical learning experience designed to familiarize a student with the critical elements of the administrator' s position in relation to the de velopment of the University. 2. A research oriented project that the university administrator or student has proposed. Possible areas include grant writing, marketing research, student development programs, financial analysis. 3. A combination of the above . The Augustana Administration Internship Program will conform to general internship requirements. Further information is avail able from Joni Krueger, Registrar.

Instructors will outline their specific attendance policies during the opening meeting of the class. These attendance expectations are also to be included in the course syllabus. Students who find it necessary to be absent because of illness or other reasons should notify the instructor before the class period. Students missing class or arriving late assume responsibi lity for communicating with the instructor. Instructor s may require students to provide verification of reasons for absence. Instructors have the right to request an unofficial withdrawal of a student from their course for non -attendance and lack of communication. Faculty and staff wishing to take students of f-campus for field trips, conferences, tours, athletic competitions, etc., must submit a roster to the Dean of Students Office at least one week in advance. Instructors are encouraged to make arrangements to accept course work, administer examinations ahe ad of time or allow make -up work, but reserve the right not to do so. Unofficial Withdrawal If the Registrar's Office receives confirmation from all of a student's faculty that a student has ceased attending all cours es without explanation, the Registrar will withdraw that student from all courses. Academic Classification Classifications are based on the attainment of the following number of credit hours earned; Freshman 0-27.99 Sophomore 28-57.99 Junior 58-89.99 Senior 90 and higher Academic Integrity Academic Integrity is vital to the academic environment at Augustana because it involves the search for and acquisition of kn owledge and understanding. Evaluation of each student's level of knowledge, understanding, and ability to synthesize and integrate materials requires tangible assessment via reports, examinations, and homework. Any willful misrepresentation of the relation between the work being evaluated and th e student's actual state of knowledge is an act of academic dishonesty. The following is a partial list of examples: Plagiarism Using the exact language of someone else without the use of quotation marks and without giving proper credit to the author Rearranging another's ideas or material and presenting them as though they are one's original work without giving appropriate acknowledgment Submitting a document written by someone else as one's own work Paying for or obtaining another's work and su bmitting it as one's own Giving or receiving answers to an exam Copying, with or without another person's knowledge, during an exam Doing class assignments for someone else Submitting a paper that has been purchased from a commercial research firm or the web Fabricating items on a bibliography Obtaining an unauthorized copy of a test in advance of its scheduled administration Using unauthorized notes during an exam Collaborating with other students on assignments when it is not permitted Altering answers on a scored test and submitting it for a re -grade Accessing and altering records in a grade book Stealing class assignments from other students and submitting them as one's own Fabricating laboratory or research data Destroying, stealing or sabotaging the work of other students Resubmitting a previously graded assignment for a different course ACADEMIC POLICIES ACADEMIC POLICIES | 185 Honor Code As a community of scholars, the students and faculty of Augustana University commit to the highest standar ds of excellence by mutually embracing an Honor Code. As a University of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, we understand the individual and col lective responsibility we have in fostering integrity. Ultimately, our purpose is to be an engaged bo dy of academically excellent, highly articulate, and morally centered persons who learn about and examine the world together. We believe that only when we are honest with ou rselves and each other can we begin to contribute to the world in a meaningful man ner. Augustana's Honor Code consists of inter -related elements that guide scholarship and learning; the Honor Pledge, the Honor Board, and a set of judicial procedures that guide the University 's adjudication of academic integrity violations. The complete procedures for implementation of the Honor Code are at www.augie.edu/honor. Honor Pledge The Honor Code states the principles that guide our work together. Students will sign an honor pledge on every examination a nd other assignments deemed appropriate by the faculty member. The Honor Pledge is as follows; \"On my honor, I pledge that I have upheld the Honor Code, and that the work I have done on this assignment has been honest, a nd that the work of others in this class has, to the be st of my knowledge, been honest as well.\" Honor Board The Honor Board has the responsibility for administering the Honor Code by developing the rules of procedure and educating th e campus community about academic integrity. The ten -mem ber Honor Board is composed of six students, four faculty members, and the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs who serves as the Chair of the Board. All have voting privileges except for the Chair of the Board. Honor Code Rights and Responsibili ties We aim in all our work to foster integrity as an abiding characteristic of the Augustana community. To that end, the Honor C ode is rooted in a shared covenant between faculty and students. The responsib ilities of every faculty member and student as vital participants in the Honor Code are defined as follows: Faculty Rights and Responsibilities: 1. Faculty autonomy is to be safeguarded, as the work of the class room is primarily the responsibility of faculty members. 2. Faculty members will choose whether or not to proctor examinations. 3. All faculty members will include statements that affirm the Honor Code in their syllabi. These statements will include descr iptions of likely penalties. Uniform language will be provided for faculty members to use. 4.

Students will be expected to sign the Honor Pledge after each examination and on other assignments deemed appropriate by the faculty member. 3. Students who do not sign the pledge will be contacted by t he instructor in regard to the reason. Students who do not sign the Honor Pledge because they have observed dishonest behavior by other students will need to provide written testimony in the event th at the case goes to a hearing before the Honor Board, bu t will not be obligated to testify in person and will also remain anonymous. 4. Students found to be in violation of the Honor Code shall not be permitted to withdraw from the class in which the violation occurred. Honor Code Determinations: At a minimum, a student found to have violated the Honor Code will be placed on disciplinary warning. 1. A disciplinary warning is a written notice that the student has violated the Honor Code. 2.

If disciplinary probation is issued, further violations will likely lead to a suspension, or expulsion. 4. Recommendation to the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs to suspend from the University. A suspension is a separat ion of the stud ent from Augustana for a definite period of time, after which the student is eligible to return. Conditions for readmission m ay be specified. 5. Recommendation to the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs to expel from the University. An expulsion is a permanent separation of the student from Augustana University.

ACADEMIC POLICIES | 187 Grading System The following grades are used in the evaluation of academic achievement: Grade Quality Point A+ 4.00 A 4.00 A- 3.70 3.30 B C 2.00 C- 1.70 D+ 1.30 D 1.00 D- 0.70 F 0.00 S/U: Satisfactory (C - and above) Unsatisfactory (D+ and below); no quality points (not used in calculation of GPA) I: Incomplete IP: Course in progress VS: Indicated on the transcript for a successfully completed audit VU: Indicated on the transcript for an unsuccessful audit The grades of F, U, VS, and VU earn neither credit hours nor quali ty points All repeated courses remain on the transcript with only the highest grade used in calculating the grade point average. *CEEL, Student Teaching, and Practicum courses are always graded S/U, as are the departmental courses so designated in this catalog. Other participation courses (typically numbered 095 -098), some Internships, and some Interim courses may be graded S/U. Students may also elect to have S/U grading applied to a maximum of two courses (8 credit hours) that are regularly graded A -F. Students choosing this option must notify the Registrar's Office in writing by no later than the last day to drop a course with a W (see the academic calendar e ach semester). In Progress Grades In progress (IP) grades are given only for courses taken under the Independent Learning Program or special project courses requiring more than one semester to complete. An IP grade is changed to an F one year after the beginning of the term in which the course w as begun. Approved IP grad ed courses include: Independent Scholarship Internship Senior Seminar Independent Study Practicum Student Teaching Incomplete Grades The student must initiate a request for an incomplete grade (I) before the end of th e academic term. An incomplete (I) is a temporary grade which the instructor may choose to give a student. The assignment of an incomplete grade is only appropriate when extraordin ary circumstances beyond the student's control, such as illness or necessa ry absence, have prevented the student from completing the course requirements at the end of the academic term. Incomplete grades are not to be given due to unsatisfactory work done in the c ourse. The student must have successfully completed a substantial portion of the course's work in order to receive an incomplete grade. The standard due date for all course work and grades will be midterm of the following semester. (Fall and Interim incomplete grades due late March; Spring and Summer incomplete grades d ue late October.) If an alternate date is arranged with the student and the instructor, the instructor must notify the Office of the Registrar. In no event may the due date exceed one year. 188| AUGUSTANA UNIVERSI TY 2020 -2021 U NDERGRADUATE GENERAL CATALOG Once the due date has passed, if a Change of Grade form has not been submitted to the Office of the Registrar, the incomplete grade will automatically change to an \"F\". When a student is assigned an incomplete grade, that individual is not eligible to be included on the Dean's List for that pa rticular term. Grade Revie w and Grade Changes Academic excellence and integrity are important to the faculty and students of Augustana University. If a student disagrees with a grade, they have the right to voice their concern. Evaluation of student work and assignment of grades on the basis of established academic criteria are the responsibility and prerogative exercised by each individual instructor. It is the responsibility of the student to maint ain all documentation for his or her class es, including copies of all syllabi, assignments and grades earned. If an instructor discovers a grading error, he or she may submit a Grade Change Form to the Office of the Registrar no later than the end of the following term. The only basis for a grade change is an error in grade assignment or calculation. Grades cannot be changed on the basis of additional work submitted or examinations retaken after a grade has been submitted, with the exception of \"I\" and \"IP\" gra des. If a student believes a grade w as assigned in error, because of a mistake in calculation or an error in recording a grade, the student should consult the instructor before the end of the second week of the following term. Students should be aware that, as a result o f review, a grade may be raised, lowered or left the same.

If the student needs a changed grade, he or she will need to repeat the course. Grade Appeals Students have the right to be protected against prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation. A student who wish es to appeal a final course grade on these grounds should first appeal to the instructor. This action should end the matter in most cases, but if not, t he student should follow the Academic Grievance Procedure in the Catalog. Grade Appeals fall under the same timeline as Grade Reviews. The process must begin no later than two weeks into the term following the contested grade: Fall semester grade review requests - no later than mid -February Interim (January term) grade review requests - no later than mid -February Spring semester grade review requests - no later than mid -September Summer term grade review requests - no later than mid -September Academic Grievance Procedure The academic grievance procedure shall be used in all cases involving grievances by students involving faculty or other students concerning alleged academic injustices relating to grades, or unprofessional conduct. Step 1 The student shall take a complaint to the instructor within two weeks into the follo wing term (mid -February for Fall or Interim issues; mid - September for Summer or Spring issues.) If the student feels unable to approach the instructor, the grievance may be taken to the chair of the department in which the instructor is a member (if the in structor is the department chair, the grievance should be taken to the division chair). If the grievance is redressed or the student is satisfied in this meeting with the instructor or the department/division chai r, the matter is settled. Step 2 If the stu dent is dissatisfied with the instructor's response to the grievance the student may take the grievance to the chair of the d epartment in which the instructor involved is a member or to the division chair if the instructor is the chair of the department. T his appeal must be brought within one week of the unsatisfactory response to the initial statement of grievance.

Veterans and their families can utilize the traditional GI Bill \u00ae as well as the Post 911 GI Bill benefits for education at Augustana. The following serves as formulation of policy with regard to these financial assistance programs. ROTC \u2014 Students who enroll in the Reserve Officer Training Corps may qualify for generous scholarships through the ROTC program. Coordination of th ese benefits with university -offered benefits will be at the discretion of the University. In general, tuition and fee costs covered by ROTC funds will not also be subsidized by Augustana gift assistance. In instances where the student has previously been offered gift assistance by the University, such gift assistance will be limited to the cost of a double room on campus as well as the cost of an on campus meal plan. No Augustana gift assistance will be provided for off -campus living arrangements. Yellow Ribbon Program \u2014 Veterans or their dependents who are declared eligible for the Yellow Ribbon program by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs may apply for the Augustana University Yellow Ribbon program. Veterans or their dependents must qualify at th e 100 percent level, with the veteran having served a minimum of 36 months active duty. If the applicant has been previously offere d gift assistance by the University, independent of the Yellow Ribbon program, the Yellow Ribbon award will supersede the previo us offer. Each year the University reserves the right to renew its Yellow Ribbon agreement with the Department of Veteran Affairs. Eligible veterans and their ACADEMIC POLICIES | 191 dependents are accepted into the Augustana Yellow Ribbon program on a first -come, first served ba sis, pending acceptance for admission to the University. Yellow Ribbon benefits do not apply to summer terms, and may be limited for study abroad. Veteran 100 Percent Eligibility \u2014 For students who are 100 percent eligible for VA benefits (through veteran status or through transfer of benefits), any previous offer of institutional gift aid may be adjusted. Active Duty Deployment Policy - Military deployment policy guidelines for students ordered to active military duty can be found here. Complaint Policy fo r Students Receiving VA Education Benefits - For students receiving VA education benefits, any complaint against the school should be routed through the VA GI Bill Feedback. The VA will then follow up through the appropriate channels to inves tigate the complaint and resolve it satisfactorily. The Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018 (Public Law 115 -407) was signed into law on December 31, 2018. In compliance with this law, Augustana University allows GI Bill and VR&E beneficiaries (Chapter 33 and Ch apter 31 beneficiaries) to attend a course of education or training for up to 90 days from the date the beneficiary provides a certificate of eligibility, or valid VAF 28 -1905. This allows a student to attend the course until VA provides payment to the ins titution. Augustana University will not impose a penalty, or require the beneficiary to borrow additional funds to cover tuition and fees due to late payments from VA. For more specific information on individual Veteran Education Programs, please contact the Department of Veterans Affairs, the South Dakota Department of Veterans Affairs or your unit's Education Office.

Students may enter this program by the invitation of a department or by application to and acceptance by a department. Depart ments shall make available to interested students their specific criter ia for honors. Normally, students must have a grade point average of 3.50 or greater in their major department as well as an overall grade point average of 3.00 or greater. Interested students should apply for admittance to the program through the chair of their major department no later than one year prior to their expected date of graduation.

The committee shall consist of a minimum of thre e faculty members including the advisor and one member from outside the department. Honors projects, though supervised, are to be done independently by the student. Departmental honors shall be awarded only to those students who complete written works or c reative projects that demonstrate high levels of competence in the use of specific skills central to the discipline and in general exhibit the highest standards of scholarly excellence. Students will not automatically receive honors distinction for complet ing an honors project. Departments may determine the specific occasion or forum, but the project, thesis, or report must be presented and defended at an open meeting attended by the committee as well as a member or members of the student's major departmen t, or at a meeting of a professional society no later than one month prior to graduation. The grade for an honors project and whether it merits honors distinction shall be determined by the committee and reported to the regis trar by the faculty advisor. Student Records/FERPA The education records of current and former students are protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA ). Education records are documents that relate directly to a student and include academic transcripts and supporting documents, student judicial records, financial aid records, and career placement records. Listed below are records not considered a part of a student's education record and are therefore not subject to FERPA provisions : personal records kept by a member of the university staff that are not revealed to others and are kept in the sole possession of the staff member; and student employment records that relate exclusively to the student in the capacity of an employee; a nd records from the Campus Safety Department which are maintained solely for law enforcement purposes; and health records maintained by the counseling services, health services and other recognized health care professionals, if thos e records are used s olely for treatment and made available only to those persons providing treatment.
