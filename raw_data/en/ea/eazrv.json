As a caregiver, you are continuously taking steps to protect your children \u2014 whether it's applying sun block or fastening your child in a safety seat. Vaccines are another important step to protect your child from illnesses and death caused by infectious preventable diseases. Vaccines are safe, and scientists are continually working to improve them. Every vaccine undergoes many tests before being licensed, and its safety continues to be monitored as long as the vaccine is in use. Most side effects from vaccination are minor, short-lived, and treatable, such as soreness at the site of injection or a low-grade fever. Serious reactions are very rare and have to be weighed against the very real risk of getting a dangerous vaccine-preventable disease. If you have concerns or questions, talk to your child's healthcare provider.
