A SPECIALIZED, PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH Each type of addiction comes with its own withdrawal symptoms. You or your loved one need a program that effectively relieves your specific physical and behavioral symptoms. For example, opioid withdrawal will yield a heightened sensitivity to pain, while cocaine withdrawal may cause paranoia and erratic behavior. The doctors and nurses at Recovery Unplugged are trained to provide expert treatment for all types of withdrawal. The detox process helps safely and comfortably purge your system of the drug and alcohol-related toxins that have built up in your system so you can begin focusing on the behavioral stages of the drug treatment process.

Addiction-trained detox doctors and nurses can help you overcome the worst of your symptoms so you're able to focus on getting clean and starting rehab. COMPASSIONATE, SUPPORTIVE AND HEALING ENVIRONMENT Rather than go through withdrawal by yourself in your home with no resources for safety, comfort or relief, medical detox allows you or your loved one to heal in a clean, comfortable atmosphere where you can get clinical and emotional support. SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MEDICATIONS TO ALLEVIATE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS Buprenorphine (Suboxone\u00ae), Lorazepam, Phenobarbital, Diazepam, and Librium are just a few of the medications that our doctors may choose for your care. Along with \"detox\" medications, comfort medications are available and are provided at the doctor's discretion. These medications alleviate nausea, headache, chills, sweats, and other symptoms. 24-7 MONITORING The reality of withdrawal is that it can be dangerous, and at times life threatening. Our doctors and nurses monitor you or your loved one around the clock to intervene in the event of any type of medical emergency, such as breathing, cardiac or respiratory issues. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DETOX? Addressing the physical aspects of addiction is only half the battle. After clients are medically stabilized and cleared to continue their treatment, they will undergo a thorough and comprehensive course of rehab. This process will allow them to address the behavioral issues associated with their drug addiction and learn to confront the origins of their substance abuse. Don't let withdrawal stop from you getting the help you need for addiction. "}
