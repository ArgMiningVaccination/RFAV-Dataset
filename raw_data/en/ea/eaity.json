Once students enter the program, they are referred to as medical residents. What can medical residents expect from the program? Medical residents will play a vital role in caring for patients of all ages. They will receive in-depth clinical experience, weekly academic teaching, explore areas of personal interest, and gain the skills of an exemplary physician. In the first year, residents will train under the guidance of practicing, credentialed physicians, also known as preceptors. In the first two months of the program, medical residents will complete core family training at the [Queen Elizabeth Hospital](/en/information/health-pei/queen-elizabeth-hospital) in Charlottetown. Later in the academic year, they transfer to [Prince County Hospital](/en/information/health-pei/prince-county-hospital) in Summerside to complete community family medicine and some specialty rotations. In the second year, residents can work as qualified physicians under the supervision of licensed physicians, as well as help with patient workload. How can I apply?
