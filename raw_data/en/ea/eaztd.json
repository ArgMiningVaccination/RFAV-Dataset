While historically these witnesses had immunity under the law , today that is no longer the case. \"While these witnesses had great legal protections in the past, those protections are now eroding,\" explained Matt Gracey , managing director, Risk Strategies / Danna-Gracey . \"It's important to note that while many physicians assume that they are covered by their malpractice insurance policies or that they have very little liability when they serve as expert witnesses, both of these are incorrect assumptions.\" Why Become an Expert Witness? According to Gracey , there are a num- ber of reasons why physicians choose to become expert witnesses. As the average age of physicians is increasing, many older physicians follow this path as a way to alleviate the daily grind of patient care.

Dr. Vania Fernandez was the previous president, and Dr. Wong said as presi-dent-elect, he worked in a coordinated effort with her and the other members of the board of directors. Since stepping into his new position on Jan. 1, Dr. Wong has reflected on what happened in the recent past and what's important for moving into the future. \"My predecessor dealt with COVID,\" he said, \"and we got exposed to the fragility of our healthcare delivery system - it gave us a vision of what we need todo in our society .\" He said COVID affect-ed everyone, but the ones with the worstoutcomes were those who did not haveaccess to good healthcare. \"They weremore vulnerable to the chronic diseasesfrom COVID.\" Dr. Wong has a genuine passion that everyone should have access to health-care. He commented, \"In Broward County , we are lucky to have such great healthcare systems: Memorial Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Miami Health System, Baptist Hospital, Broward Health and HCA.

CLARK, FACHE As Broward Health celebrates its 85th anniversary , the system is not only celebrating its history as a nonprofit, safety net hospital system, but is also looking forward to future initiatives that will enable Broward Health to keep meeting the evolving needs of the community it serves. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic in the past three years, Broward Health has forged ahead with strategic capital improvements like our new cardiac catheterization labs, a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and even a new mobile health unit that drives healthcare to underserved members of our community . We are also finalizing the build-out of a new stereotaxis robotic lab at Broward Health Medical Center. Thanks to strategic investments in real estate near our hospitals over the years, Broward Health is well-positioned to expand its footprint and add new capacities through both vertical growth and the construction of new facilities ranging from a freestanding emergency department and outpatient surgical centers to rehabilitation, clinical research and medical education facilities. In the pipeline now we have a new radiology suite at Broward Health Imperial Point, thanks to a generous donation. Plans are in the works for a housing development for our graduate medical education program as well as executive offices and other multi-purpose spaces near Broward Health Medical Center. Broward Health is planning Collaboration Is Key to Building a Healthier Community David J.

This is our 20th Annual Salute to Physicians and it never gets any easier to express just how important our doctors are to all of us. And never more so than these past few years. Doctors around the world dedicate their lives to helping all of us. Heaven knows they've pulled me out of some potentially terrible situations. They endure many years of school and grueling residency work to gain training and board certifications, not to mention working long hours to treat their patients. It takes a special kind of dedication to embark on a medical career, and all of us are indebted to those who do. So, whether you are an experienced physician, a fledgling medical stu- dent, or new practitioner, we can only say a simple heartfelt Thank You ... and hope you know and believe how much you mean to all of us. \"The practice of medicine is an art, not a trade; a calling, not a business; a calling in which your heart will be exercised equally with your head.\" \u2014 Sir William Osler L AT NAY LAHAPP egac LT DOC egacLTIONAL y cYAY D ORS' ycycA L B b y egen L T BUIL g nds y , o ory hist oughout Thr e b v ors ha doct s ' ealth d H ar w o t Br our built a ear y s 85- w o Br o o legends, o and e y oda o o e e t car p o legac y f T T g/ ealth or dH ar w visit e, o learn mor visio oes, our her ele e c w , y da ery v e e s w t tien pa v e ompas viding c o pr ery ur /85 onaries. e our t bra e. serv e siona w o Br g/ ealth.or dH ar /85 g ealth.or dH ar w o Br South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2023 3 d De E d t a c i d ll n io n an o i s s e f o pr ce x l e a c i n i l o c t t oc lD a n o i t a N r u , o y a y d r e v E d n a d e an v bo g a n i o r g o d f n o i t a c i d e d d ce an n e l l e br e l e ce r e a , w y a s D r o s d n pe e y d t i n u m m o r c c c E d x e h e t v o pr m o i d t n o y be s an t n e i t a g p n i p l e o h n t 0 , an 4 h e t r o e m h g t n i t ra e d i v o o pr s t r o t oc n d o n lle e c g n i be - l l e d w h an t l a e e h t ra e g r e a .

Six months ago, she joined Broward Health Medical Center as its new chief financial officer, and just two months ago she became a member and treas-urer-elect for ACHE of South Florida. \"I'm still the new kid on the block,\" she said about her tenure at Broward Health Medical Center, the largest hos-pital within the Broward Health System. \"The last six months have been a bit of a blur\u2014exciting and wonderful at the same time.\" Connelly-Rosati, who previously worked at Memorial Healthcare System, has spent the past six months getting to know the team at Broward and finding her way through a large onboarding process. \"I'm at the point where I feel settled most days, though there are still a few times when I'm not sure what direction is up,\" she laughed. A CPA, Connelly-Rosati \"fell into\" healthcare, but wasn't sure that it was the right path for her after graduating from the University of Miami. She started her career at Ernst & Young as an auditor, and ended up working with a healthcare client who owned and operated 70 hospitals across the country . \"Total transparency\u2014at the time, I decided I did not like healthcare from an accounting and finance perspective,\" she said. \"I went into real estate and spent three months there as an auditor but then the market crashed.\" Connelly-Rosati returned to healthcare, and as she invested more time in it\u2014and had \"truly amazing\" mentors who taught her the industry\u2014she fell in love with it. \"I love being part of a team dedicated to the greater good,\" she said. \"I like the opportunity I get to partner with caregivers on the front lines who are taking care of patients and doing my part in the background to support them.\" Connelly-Rosati first became involved with ACHE of South Florida two months ago when she was asked to speak on a panel. \"I had a great time with the other pan-elists, the moderator and the participants who stayed afterward, and it really caused me to take a step back and realize the value in networking with and learning from peers from different organization who oftentimes were facing the same challenges that I was,\" she said. Approached in the parking lot after the meeting, she was asked to join the board and to become the organization's next treasurer-elect. Having attended only one event and one board meeting so far, she says that she is just starting to dip her toe in the water. \"So far, what has impressed me the most is the camaraderie of the group; despite many of us being competitors or approaching challenges from different angles, we all come together for the benefit of our patients and coworkers,\" she said. \"Being able to learn from those around me who have more experience or different experiences or different perspectives enables me to be a better leader for my organi-zation, for my team, and for myself.\" ACHE OF SOUTH FLORIDA MEMBER SPOTLIGHT : Jen Connelly-Rosati Jen Connelly-Rosati Let's Connect: ACHE of South Florida Spotlight South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2023 5 BES -IN- T BES T IN F S S PHY -CLASS ORI FL SICIANS.

Miami-Dade County Broward County Palm Beach County Sain t Lucie County Lee County Collier County www.KidzMedical.comKK ZZ II Medical Providing care to infants, children and moms since 1988It's no secret that the U.S. healthcare industry is in deep distress. According to BDO's 2023 Healthcare CFO Outlook Survey , the forces that made last year so tough for healthcare \u2014 including higher labor and supply costs \u2014 aren't going away in 2023. In fact, they could get worse. This begs the question: What are healthcare CFOs going to do to improve their organizations' finances this year? 1. They're shifting their investments. This year, healthcare CFOs are signifi- cantly increasing investments in primary care, elder care and home care. Organizations that ramp up their elder care and home care capabilities will be better positioned to cater to the aging U.S. population and accommodate high-er numbers of Medicare patients. At the same time, demand for primary care is increasing, meaning the right invest-ments in this space could yield high returns for healthcare organizations. And CFOs aren't just investing in serv- ice lines: this year, healthcare CFOs are doubling down on telehealth, with 47% planning to increase investment in tele-health platforms. But with patients increasingly returning to in-person care over virtual or even hybrid offerings, CFOs planning significant investments in telehealth may want to ask themselves whether it's really the best place to direct their capital this year. 2. They're eyeing add-on deals. It looks like big deals are going out of style in healthcare, with more CFOs turning their attention to smaller add-on deals rather than mega-mergers. This trend is likely to solidify as the FTC con-tinues to block large healthcare mergers with antitrust lawsuits. At the same time, deals are slowing down as companies spend more time in the due diligence phase. Navigating the due diligence process is the top-cited deal challenge this year among health-care CFOs planning a transaction. We expect to see greater scrutiny during this part of the process, leading to longer deal timelines. Ultimately , we may see a focus on quality over quantity as healthcare companies pursue fewer, higher-ROI opportunities. 3. They're pulling back on digital. In this year's survey , just 34% of healthcare CFOs say they're pursuing digital transformation, down from 53% who said the same in last year's survey . CFOs seem to be replacing direct invest-ment with dealmaking: enhancing digital capabilities is one of the top-cited deal drivers in healthcare this year. In terms of specific technology solu- tions, healthcare CFOs seem to be under-investing in digital front doors/patient portals and EHR optimization. In BDO's 2022 Patient Experience Survey , 87% of patients who had used patient portals report finding them helpful. Neglecting to invest in digital front doors/patient portals could be a missed opportunity for healthcare CFOs. At the same time, a properly optimized EHR sys-tem can improve workflows and the patient experience, whereas an unoptimized system can actually create more work for clinicians. What healthcare CFOs should do this year: So, what should you be doing to strengthen your organization's financial position in the year ahead? Here are some ways you can prepare for the eco-nomic challenges on the horizon this year: Reevaluate your budget and financial obligations. This year, just 24% of healthcare CFOs are concerned about violating their bond and loan covenants. As we saw last year, however, the actual number of violations could be much higher. That means that some CFOs are likely overestimating their financial posi-tioning. Take a close look at your finances and identify any potential risk areas, even if you feel the risk is relatively low. Make sure you have a detailed plan of action should you discover you are heading for a violation. Make sure you don't fall behind on dig- ital. In times of hardship, it's tempting to reduce your investment in digital. At the same time, healthcare as an industry has traditionally been slow to adopt technol-ogy . Now that patients are driving a shift toward consumerism in healthcare, stay-ing in the analog age is no longer an option. If you want to earn patient loyal-ty , you need to deliver digital experiences that align with patients' expectations. One way you can do this is to implement online or self-scheduling through your patient portal. Consider making a transaction in tech or retail. Another way you can capitalize on the shift toward consumerism is exploring a transaction in the tech and retail spaces. Tech add-ons can be a great way to enhance your digital maturity . Many patients are turning to retailers for quick and convenient care \u2014 working through a retailer to offer care allows you to reach patients where they are instead of wait-ing for them to come to you.

Contact: Alfredo Partner 646-520-2870 / apirozzi@bdo.comHere's How Healthcare CFOs Are Strengthening Their Financial Positions This Year BY STEVEN SHILL South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com is one of the most prevalent congenital dis- abilities in America. Early identification is essential for a baby to develop speech and language. Newborn hearing screenings have become the norm in most states, including Florida, where legislation now requires hospitals to pro-vide these screenings to all newborns. KIDZ Medical Services (KIDZ) is a physician-owned healthcare network based in Coral Gables that adopted new technology and established the First Sounds Newborn Hearing Screening Program in 1996, long before it became mandatory . \"We were one of five centers in the state involved in its pilot study before becoming mandatory for all newborns,\" says Jorge E. Perez, M.D., co-founder of KIDZ Medical. Dr. Perez was instrumental in convincing state legislators in the mid 1990's to make this test mandatory for all newborns born in Florida. \"I educated our legislators that hearing loss was much more common than metabolic disorders which was already a mandatory test for all newborns born in the state,\" he explains. \"Recently , I've been involved in state committees establishing and imple-menting policies for congenital CMV testing on all newborns who failed the hearing screening.\" The importance of newborn hearing screening is often overlooked, but it is an essen- tial part of a baby's health and development, according to Barbara Greenberg-Cordero, Audiologist/Clinical Director at KIDZ. The First Sounds Newborn Hearing Screening Program is offered to over 20,000 newborns annually at the hospitals in which KIDZ neonatologists serve. The impact of the program is significant, especially when it comes to early intervention. \"Early identification of hearing loss or atypical hearing is essential to a child's out- come,\" explains Greenberg-Cordero. \"If a baby is screened by one month, identified by three months, and intervention begins by six months, any gaps in speech and language development can be closed.\" Last year, Greenberg-Cordero recommended upgrading to the Maico EasyScreen devices, which offer faster, more accurate, and more portable screening capabilities. KIDZ subsequently acquired 15 of these state-of-the-art devices to replace their exist-ing technology . This acquisition has significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of the newborn hearing screening pro-gram, notes Greenberg-Cordero. \"The technology is much faster, so that parents receive results much quicker, alle-viating their anxiety and concerns about their baby's hearing health,\" she says. The Screening Program offered by KIDZ is different from other programs in the state. One of the most significant differ-ences is that well-trained hearing screen-ing technicians perform the screenings. \"Our First Sounds program avoids referring too many babies for follow-up,\" Greenberg-Cordero adds. \"The program also emphasizes educating parents about how to monitor their baby's hearing health as they grow. This is essential because some programs do not discuss speech and lan-guage development or give parents examples of what signs to look for as their babies grow.\" Another unique aspect of the program is that they have a specific protocol for babies at higher risk for hearing loss. They perform two different screenings on babies at high-er risk, including those in the NICU and those with a family member with hearing loss in early childhood. This protocol ensures that at-risk babies can be flagged for follow-up more closely and have intervention earlier if needed. \"We hope to expand our program to more locations so that parents can receive the best service and information for their babies' hearing health,\" says Greenberg-Cordero. This program is just one example of how KIDZ stays ahead of the curve, using the latest technology and innovative approaches to provide the best care possible for new-borns. In addition, the organization's proactive approach has allowed it to set standards of care that others follow. Ultimately , the First Sounds Newborn Hearing Screening Program is a model for how healthcare organizations can take the initiative and adopt new technologies and approaches to provide the best care possible for their patients. Early intervention for hearing loss is essential. The First Sounds Newborn Hearing Screening Program ensures that no baby goes undiagnosed. \"As you can see from its inception in the mid 90's to now , we have always been involved in piloting, policy making and implementation,\" adds Dr. Perez.

It was a fast and straightforward process compared to the other hospital,\" Morris said. \"TGH was very caring and very efficient; there's a whole institute dedicated to transplants. The team keeps in touch and keeps you up to date, making sure you're doing what you're supposed to do when you're sup-posed to. They almost put more interest into everything than the patients do!\" Since the transplant procedure, Morris has been participating in an observational research study , thanks to the academic medical institution. The study uses a mailed blood test to analyze how well patients are receiving their donor organs and to detect early signs of possible organ rejection. \"I decided to take part in the research not only because I stood to benefit, but also because I was grateful and saw an opportunity to help other people,\" explained Morris. \"The testing tracked my bloodwork and let the team correct any-thing wrong very early . Fortunately , every-thing went well for me, so most of my fol-low-up care has been through telehealth appointments.\" When patients need care for rare or complex medical conditions, they look for the latest treatments and technologies and highly experienced doctors. Those are often found at academic medical institu-tions, and TGH is bringing that level of care and service to Florida's East Coast. Palm Beach County and Treasure Coast patients who need a higher level of care now have a direct connection to TGH's academic and research resources; they don't have to leave the state to receive world-class medical care. TGH has been the primary teaching hospital of the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine since the school was created in the early 1970s. TGH patients have access to cutting-edge academic med-icine and resources, which include a wider variety of clinical trials, research studies and breakthroughs, options for advanced immunotherapy procedures, enhanced personal treatment plans, and a conven-ient path to complex surgeries. \"As a research and academic hospital, we're not just practicing medicine. We're defining how it is practiced,\" said John Couris, president and CEO of TGH. More than 700 medical school residents and fellows receive specialty training at TGH in areas ranging from general inter-nal medicine to neurosurgery . In addition, University of South Florida medical, nurs-ing, pharmacy and physical therapy stu-dents all receive part of their training at TGH. Faculty of the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine admit and care for patients at TGH, as do private practice physicians, many of whom also serve as adjunct clinical faculty at USF Health. TGH is one of the highest-ranked hospi- tals in Florida by U.S. News & World Report for 2022-23 and the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine is ranked among the best grad schools in medical research for 2023. The college is commit-ted to converting discoveries into best-practice clinical care by building meaning-ful, applicable research programs. It has made significant strides in increasing the quality and diversity of research, helping drive USF's record growth in federally sponsored research and recruiting preemi-nent scientists who secure funding from the National Institutes of Health. \"Our sustained rise in national rankings reflects the rapidly increasing strength of our educational, research and clinical mis-sion,\" said Dr. Charles Lockwood, execu-tive vice president of USF Health and dean of the Morsani College of Medicine. \"We are now competing with the nation's most storied and respected programs. These outstanding metrics also position us to attract the highest-caliber students and faculty , further advancing our program into the national spotlight for its outstand-ing education, exceptional research and world-class clinical care.\" TGH has created a framework of state- of-the-art services for patients on Florida's East Coast, with the expertise and innova-tion of a preeminent academic medical center. The initiative began with an alliance with the Cancer Center of South Florida, which is now the TGH Cancer Institute. Since then, TGH has also estab-lished Health, TGH Digestive Health (formerly TGH Gastro Group of the Palm Beaches), TGH General Surgeons of the Palm Beaches, TGH Advanced Kidney Care and TGH Imaging. \"We are the state of Florida's hospital. We want to support, complement and aug-ment current care in the community , so patients can get what they need without leaving the state,\" Couris added. \"TGH is building a patient-centered system to deliver world-class care.\" T o learn more, please visit TGH.org/ThePalmBeaches.

Few physicians understand the role of a Medical Exec - utive Committee (MEC), if they did, more would want to be a part of it. Hospitals, sur-gery centers, PPOs and MCOs are all required to have a MEC, because they are the watchdog to safety , quality and success of their program. Through the delineation of services, the MEC is often involved in turf wars that everyone tries to carry out fairly , but it is difficult to give everyone what they want. The committee makes recommendations regarding quality of care, space, equipment, staffing, plan-ning, medical staff appointments, clinical privileges, credentialing, and most importantly they assess the ethical con-duct and professional performance of all members of the medical staff. The MEC is a very powerful committee, but few realize that. So what is the scope of responsibility for a MEC member? Medical Executive Committee's Power, Role and Responsibilities In general, the MEC Member is expected to: 1) To represent the medical staff; 2) To report to man- agement and the medical director the group's rec-ommendations; 3) To implement and enforce policies and pro-cedure pertaining to the medical; 4) To make recommen- dations on the manage-ment of the facility and the its members and sub-committees; As it pertains to other physicians, a MEC Mem ber is expected to: a) To review medical staff applications and delineation of privileges and make recommendations to the governing board; b) To review , analyze and make reason- able recommendations from observing the peer review performance and activi-ties: including clinical competence, qual-ity assurance, utilization review , risk management concerns, adherence to pol-icy and procedures, and corrective actions necessary to improve the facility and the medical staff that operates within it; c) To take all reasonable steps to ensure and improve professionalism, ethics and competence of the medical staff and facility . d) To take part in MEC ad hoc com- mittees to carry out the obligations including peer reviews and continuous quality improvement initiatives. While the role on an MEC does not sound very financially rewarding or \"sexy\", it is one of the main doorways for physicians who wish to become adminis-trators. Most Medical Executive Committee's will allow for guest non-members to sit-in and observe in general open meetings. The more involved a physician is in the MEC, the more likely they will understand its functions and the more likely they will be successful in what they choose to do as a career.

The new blood mobile was built com- pletely from the ground up, and it's larg- er and roomier than its predecessors, giving donors a more comfortable expe-rience. This new addition will help the blood supply remain at a healthy level and ensure the health and safety of the Southwest Florida community . All blood donations will stay within Lee County . This new blood mobile will join Lee Health's three other blood mobile buses, which is how the blood center collects 70-80% of its blood donations. Location is often a primary barrier to collecting blood donations. The buses make donating easier by meeting people at sites in the community , including churches, retirement facilities and high schools. 10 March 2023 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News When I was young (and before they stopped their shows in 2017 after 100+ years), my parents would often take my younger brothers and me to the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. As a kid I remember the spectacle of the three rings and must admit, my brothers and I, for the most part, were like, 'eh...it is ok'. Then I counter that with the first time I saw Cirque de Sole as an adult. I was literally blown away . That show is something that is hard to take your eyes off of. What does it mean to fasci-nate someone? It is more difficult to describe than it seems. Fascination is one of those, we know it when we see it things. It is also diffi-cult to pick up on why something we see, or experience resonates more than others in this category . When Ringling ceased its performances, they cited every excuse in the books. People don't like animal acts anymore. It's too expensive to put on a circus. We can't fill the seats like we used to. And so on. Meanwhile Cirque continued to gain popularity around the world and sells out night after night. When it comes to patient care, look to give people an experience like no one else. Avoid falling into the same traps that others do by looking to be different in a good way . Believe it or not there are things you and your team can do that will leave your patients and their families looking to come back again and again. It doesn't have to be over the top. If you look at Cirque, they did simple things better: live music, more artistry , themes, and no aisle concessions to name a few. After a six year hiatus to regroup, Ringling Brothers announced they would resume shows in the fall of 2023 - minus the animals. Something tells me that won't be enough. Avoid your organi-zation going the way of the circus. Look to fascinate your patient experi-ence every day! Jay Juffre is Executive Vice President, ImageFIRST .

BY JAY JUFFRE When It Comes T o Patient Care, Look T o Fascinate When the Florida legisla- ture officially gavels in on March 7, it will have just under two months to pass a state budget. While the budget is the only must-pass item, lawmakers also will debate numerous other proposals governing every-thing from the environment and education to health care and transportation. This session is vitally important for Florida hos-pitals. After three years of the pandemic and resulting economic losses and workforce shortages, hospitals need relief and support. Fortunately , the state is in a position of economic strength. With robust econom-ic growth, Florida ended 2022 with a budget surplus of $21.8 billion, the high-est ever. Reserves exceed $15 billion. Investing in our state's hospitals - the bedrock of the health care system - must be a priority . Florida residents deserve strong hospitals. Florida communities need them. And the state's economy depends on them. Hospitals are a key factor in Florida's economic success story . Florida hospitals had an annual economic output contribution of $177.8 billion in 2021, employing more than 322,000 Floridians with a total payroll of more than $28 billion. Each hospital job supports 1.73 additional jobs in the state, and every $1 spent by a hospital supports $1.25 in additional business activity . There's a saying in health care attrib- uted to Sister Irene Kraus, CEO of the Daughters of Charity National Healthcare System, \"No margin. No mis-sion.\" It means that without a positive financial margin, hospitals cannot do the work for which every Floridian relies on them. That sentiment can be extended to the relationship between hospitals and the state economy . Florida's economy would not be the envy of the nation without the contribution, output, and investments of its hospitals. Governor DeSantis' proposed budget, released last month, recognizes this rela-tionship. His budget proposes no Medicaid payment cuts to hospitals, maintains nurse workforce funding secured during the last legislative ses-sion, and invests in mater-nal and mental health pro-grams and services - all priorities for Florida hospi-tals. Lawmakers would do well to follow this health care- and economy-friend-ly roadmap and prioritize similar funding and invest-ments. In addition to protecting funding, improving access to timely , community-based behavioral health care and growing and retaining the health care workforce are two of Florida hospitals' biggest chal-lenges and priorities. The state faces a shortage of nearly 60,000 nurses by 2035. Too many health care workers are experiencing violence at work. A grow-ing number of Floridians of all ages are experiencing behavioral health crises and lack of access to needed care outside of hospitals' emergency departments. Solving these challenges requires long-term policy investment. This session, Florida hospitals will advocate for: \u0081 Continuing nurse education and workforce funding. \u0081 Strengthening criminal penalties against perpetrators of violence against health care workers, no matter where in the hospital they work. \u0081 Funding to increase the number of psychiatric beds for those who are invol-untarily admitted for treatment. \u0081 Holding health plan partners accountable for contract standards gov-erning payment, care authorizations, and network inclusion. \u0081 Building on existing community- based mental health programs, such as Community Action Teams, to help more Floridians get care they need more quickly . Legislative sessions are always about choices. What lawmakers choose to fund, change, or require reflects their choices and priorities. It's difficult to imagine a greater priority than health care and the institutions and individuals who work in them caring for all of us. Mary Mayhew is President and CEO, Florida Hospital Association Legislative Session Is An Opportunity to Prioritize Florida's Hospitals BY MARY MAYHEW South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2023 11A record-breaking 9,528 life- saving liver transplants were performed in the United States in 2022. While laudable, trans-plant surgeon David J. Reich, M.D., never loses sight of the thousands who die while wait-ing for a transplant, who never achieve wait-list eligibility , and those who are removed from the list due to declining health. \"We've made great strides improving access to transplant care in recent years by expanding the donor pool, but many potentially viable organs are still going to waste,\" says Dr. Reich, who recently joined Cleveland Clinic Florida's Transplant Center as Surgical Director of the Liver Transplant Program and Chief of the Innovative Technology and Therapeutics Program. \"That's why machine perfusion is such a game-changer and has the potential to further expand the supply of donor organs.\" Dr. Reich is a pioneer in the modern use of donation after circulatory death (DCD) organ transplantation and has spent much of his career investigating innovative technologies for artificial liver support and organ preservation. He pub-lished one of the first successful series on DCD liver transplantation in 2000 and has shepherded widespread, internation-al adoption of DCD over the past two decades. Donation after circulatory death Deceased organ donation is the main form of liver transplantation. While the majority are donation after brain death (DBD) organs, there is a growing trend in using DCD organs. \"Originally , all donor organs came from individuals who experienced car-diac or circulatory death,\" explains Dr. Reich. \"But in the 70s, this practice was abandoned in preference of organs from donors who experienced brain death because the organs do not suffer the effects of warm ischemic injury and are less prone to poor graft function.\" DCD organs experience lack of oxygen and damage due to anaerobic metabo-lism, as well as greater ischemia and reperfusion injury impacting organ recipients. \"In particu-lar, DCD livers result in higher rates of graft non-function and bil-iary complications, demonstrating the need for better preservation techniques,\" notes Dr. Reich. Organ preserva- tion with machine perfusion Static cold storage (SCS) has been used for decades with good outcomes to pre-serve and transport standard criteria donor (SCD) organs. It entails placing organs on ice with a preservation solu-tion. This method, however, does not achieve ideal post-transplant results with DCD or other extended criteria donor (ECD) organs. Recently , ECD organs are increasingly preserved with machine perfusion tech-nologies to circulate oxygenated blood and fluids through the donor organs before transplantation. Normothermic devices just gained FDA approval and hypothermic devices have completed or are close to completing clinical trials in the United States. \"With machine perfusion, we are working to improve how we preserve organs from donors who are older or with comorbidities and from DCDs,\" says Dr. Reich. \"Studies have demon-strated that both forms of machine perfu-sion can outperform SCS, providing bet-ter preservation, ability to test, treat and repair organs, increased access to trans-plant, and safer outcomes.\" Cleveland Clinic's transplant centers in Weston, Florida, and Cleveland, Ohio, have implemented normothermic and hypothermic machine perfusion preser-vation for certain liver transplants, using the OrganOx Metra normothermic device and the Bridge to Life VitaSmart hypothermic device. Only a few liver transplant programs have experience using both approaches to dynamic preservation. HOPE versus SCS Dr. Reich is continuing to add to this body of research as the national lead investigator for the Bridge to HOPE Liver Clinical Trial, which is evaluating the clinical safety and efficacy of SCS com-pared to cold storage followed by hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) with the VitaSmart Liver Machine Perfusion System. Cleveland Clinic's transplant centers in Florida and Ohio are two of the 15 study sites currently enrolling patients under-going liver transplantation with DBD and DCD organs. The study launched in December 2021 and is enrolling up to 244 patients over 2 years. Researchers are looking at the rate of early allograft dys-function between treatment groups, rates of ischemic cholangiopathy , and patient and graft survival post-transplantation. Dr. Reich presented early results from the multicenter, randomized, controlled trial last November at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 2022 Meeting. Based on the first 61 enrolled patients, a lower rate of early allograft dysfunction was observed in the HOPE arm (22%) compared to the SCS arm (34%). Patients in the HOPE arm also experi- enced a shorter median hospital stay post-transplantation than in the SCS group, 9.5 days compared to 11.4 days, respectively . \"These and our more recent results are very encouraging and give us great optimism about HOPE,\" says Dr. Reich.

That's how he describes the compassionate care, cutting-edge technology , excellent outcomes, and the collegial work environment within a comprehen-sive neurovascular program. \"Patient-centric care and working together to deliver the best outcomes is our sole focus. That includes EMT services, neurointerven-tional suite staff, and all the members of the Emergency medi-cine, Neurology , and Neurosurgery teams,\" said Dr. Kamal. A neurointerventionalist that specializes in stroke and blood vessel disorders in the brain and neck, Dr. Kamal feels privi-leged to make an immediate and lasting impact on his patient's lives. Many of Memorial's minimally invasive, catheter-based procedures now use a tiny artery in the wrist to treat brain aneurysms, place stents or remove clots, a newer approach Dr. Kamal says is safer, efficacious, and more comfortable for patients who can now go home the next day . \"I love seeing patients walk into my clinic back to their nor- mal self again after initially presenting to me with paralysis or loss of speech from a stroke.

When he began his medical career, life expectancy for those with CF was only 18 years. A decade ago, that number had more than doubled. Today , CF patients are living to 50 and beyond. \"Medications in the last five years have made a significant difference,\" said Dr. Scher, medical director of pediatric pul-monology at the Joe DiMaggio Children's Health Specialty Center in Wellington. \"I'm optimistic we'll have a cure in the near future, with all the industry-sponsored drug studies and genetic engineering going on.\" That would be a life-changing development for those who battle the disease on a daily basis and constantly struggle with the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs airways, causes infections, and makes it difficult to gain weight, among other effects. MEMORIAL PRIMARY CARE Foluso \"Joy\" Ogunsile, MD Research and improvements in the medication used to treat sickle cell disease are positively impacting survivability and quality of life for patients battling the genetic blood disorder. Dr. Joy Ogunsile, medical director at Memorial's sickle cell day center, says the advancements are providing hope to war-riors who once believed their diagnosis was equivalent to a death sentence. \"Now , people living with sickle cell disease have options for curative therapies,\" said Dr. Ogunsile, a hematologist that received fellowship training at Johns Hopkins Hospital. A native of Nigeria, Dr. Ogunsile is currently working to build a comprehensive pro- gram that provides optimum, evidence-based care in an empathetic way . She says the empathetic approach is critical for patients who not only deal with chronic, sometimes debilitating pain, but are also at greater risk of blood clots, stroke, liver disease, heart, and kidney failure. Oludara Amole, MD The future Dr. Oludara Amole was led into medicine as a child by her father, a scientist. \"Science was always a comfort-able arena for me,\" she said. Ultimately specializing in internal medicine, Dr. Amole works with patients with everything from common illnesses to chronic medical conditions. Her focus as a primary care doctor is to build trust that enables patients to feel comfort-able sharing themselves and their experiences. Dr. Amole, a graduate of and resident at the Medical College of Wisconsin, notes that empathy and communication are required to build the type of relationships that break down barriers and demonstrate her investment in a patient's health. \"It's more rewarding than I could have imagined,\" said Dr. Amole, a physician for seven years, three of them within Memorial Healthcare System. \"I feel supported and am given the tools to help patients achieve goals that are clearly outlined.\" MEMORIAL TRANSPLANT INSTITUTE Linda Chen, MD As the surgical director of Memorial's Living Donor and Pediatric Abdominal Transplant program, Dr. Linda Chen is in the difference-making business. \"Kidney transplants are inher-ently life-changing because we're able to give patients a quality of life they may have never had,\" said Dr. Chen, who has per-formed more than 2,000 transplants. \"It frees them from the hardships of dialysis and enables them to participate in activi-ties that would have been impossible before the surgery .\" Dr. Chen compares her role to that of a fireman who arrives with water to put out a fire. \"It's the greatest feeling.\" In addition to her surgical responsibili-ties, the Dr. Chen focuses on educating people about the opportunity to save multiple lives by being a living kidney donor. She says the extraction is very safe and delivers the greatest gifts of all, love and hope.SALUTE TO PHYSICIANS 26 March 2023 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News on March 3 Every day\u2014 Hono yo 30\u2014we value \u2014and especially oring So on Doc outh Fl rtise. ctors' Day lorida P Physicia ans owar Br AS hos A lorida c outh F S for patients and ealth AS\u00ae H A VIT The VIT d Palm Beach coun e teams in spice car communities. ou d their families thr e is grateful for al hcar e e her nties ar oe, n Dade-Monr ughout our e ou do to car ll y Referrals: 800 advanced illn to support yo AS . ess 24/365 ou and your patie 93 VIT nts with Since 1980 AS.com A Referrals: 800.

Located next to the emer- gency department's waiting area, the fast track vertical bays will provide a more comfortable and private space for patients to be seen. They will help expedite the ability to treat patients with non-urgent medical needs and begin treatment for higher-acu-ity patients. The vertical bays have enough space for the patient and a family member to sit upright in a chair rather than lie down on a bed. There are soothing beach scenes on the wall to help put patients at ease and a curtain dividing the bays for ample privacy . There will be a dedicated team working the fast track area on a daily basis. Patients may start in one of the bays and move back into the waiting area while they wait for tests and lab work to process or be admitted to the hospital. This allows more people to be seen and move through the emergency department.

South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2023 29 HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN & FACILITY Jupiter Medical Center leadership, lead donors and construc- tion partners recently gathered to witness the placement of the final structural beam for what will soon be the Johnny and Terry Gray Surgical Institute. The topping-off ceremony signi-fies progress for the construction project, which broke ground less than one year ago and is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. The highly anticipated 90,000-square-foot Surgical Institute will feature 16 smart operating rooms and two hybrid operating suites. Through the community's generous support, $52 million has been raised towards the $100 million project. In December, the not-for-profit hospital announced a transformative $25 mil-lion lead gift from Jupiter-based philanthropists Johnny and Terry Gray to name the institute. The Grays joined the hospi-tal's leadership team and others in signing the beam before a crane raised it into place. Their gift is complimented by other seven-figure gifts from The Mastroianni Family Foundation, Michael and Elizabeth Ruane, Steven and Kathrine Pinard, Joseph and Barbara Charles and Nelson and Nathalie Ferreira. The facility's \"smart\" operating rooms will accommodate complex surgeries, while the hybrid suites offer surgeons the ability to transition from a minimally invasive surgery to an open procedure, enhancing the patient experience and improv-ing outcomes. The \"operating rooms of the future\" will use state-of-the-art equipment that is digitally integrated. The sur-gical team will be able to access and transmit a patient's images from the operating room to additional specialists for real-time consultation, resulting in a multi-disciplinary , comprehensive approach to care. In addition to advanced operating rooms, the Institute will provide a spacious reception area for loved ones along with pri-vate consultation rooms to meet the surgeon before or after a procedure. Recognizing the importance of real-time communi-cation, leading-edge technology will be integrated into the Institute's design, providing seamless updates from the care team to a patient's family .

One industry that is beginning to see the potential of artificial intelligence is architecture. Architects traditionally have relied on their knowledge and experience to design and construct buildings and other structures. However, artificial intelligence (AI) in the near future will be embraced to help shape and optimize architectural design, allowing for more efficient and cost effective designs. AI can potentially be used to automate many of the tedious tasks that go into designing a building, such as drafting, calcu-lating, and modeling. AI powered software can accurately gen-erate 3D models that are both visually appealing and struc-turally sound. This helps architects save time, as they no longer have to manually create models or use third party soft-ware. Additionally , AI can help architects to identify patterns and trends in their designs, as well as uncover potential prob-lems and solutions. This helps to optimize the design process and ensure that the final product is of better quality . AI can also be used to create an environment in which architects can col-laborate more efficiently . AI powered software can provide architects with a virtual workspace in which they can share and discuss ideas and concepts. This enables architects to work together in real time, regardless of their physical location, and can help to speed up the design process. AI can also be used to analyze the data from these conversations, helping to identify potential issues and solutions that may not have been previ-ously considered. Finally , AI can help to optimize the construction process by providing architects with a better understanding of the materi-als and components that are needed for each project. AI pow- ered software can analyze information about the building's design and the environment in which it will be built, helping to identify , or suggest the best materials for the job. This helps to ensure that the construction process runs smoothly and that the final product is of improved quality . Charles Michelson is President of Saltz Michelson Architects.

Kidney failure is a growing crisis in the United States. According to the CDC, more than 1 in 7 Americans are living with ESRD (end stage renal disease) and 80% are 65+. March is National Kidney Month raising awareness to the numerous ways of treating and reducing the impact of kidney failure. CHS dialysis clinics offers treatment provided by an onsite registered dialysis nurse. This treatment eliminates outpatient drawbacks, such as infection risk and the need to travel to a clinic which is also disruptive, confusing and time consuming. Catholic Health Services on site-dialysis can better deliver patient care with fewer hospital admissions. Dialysis is needed when your own kidneys can no longer take care of your body's needs. As a result, wastes and toxins build up in the bloodstream. Dialysis does the work of your kidneys, removing waste products and excess fluid from the blood. Hemodialysis is a type of dialysis which consists of a machine that filters and cleans the blood then returns it to a cleaned body . Our skilled nursing and rehabilitation hospital patients who are receiving this treatment need it 3 times per week and it that takes around four hours. \"By providing dialysis treatments on site, we eliminate the need for frequent to and from dialysis clinics. It lets us focus on improving the lives of our residents\" states Julia Shillingford, Director of Nursing for St. Anne's Nursing Center, Catholic Health Services South Campus.

Falcon Cove Middle School Students Aid Patients and Families at Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital National Junior Honor Society stu-dents at Falcon Cove Middle School in Weston have been busy selling Domino's coupon cards, but it's not because they're hungry for pizza. The students recent- ly embarked on a fundraising campaign, using the Domino's discount cards to raise $5,000 for Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital Foundation. The dollars, which were given at a ceremonial check presentation, underwrote the cost of kid-sized, electric cars younger children can drive throughout the Garth Brooks Teammates for Kids Child Life Zone. \"The Falcon Cove students continue to do beautiful, give back, kindness-oriented activities that really show our families and children how much they care,\" said Caitlin Stella, CEO of Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital. \"We're so proud of them because they're great examples of kids who look at Joe DiMaggio as their own children's hos-pital and try to find ways to give back, whether it's their time or through fundraising.\" The check presentation was the centerpiece of an event in the child life zone that was attended by Stella Stringer, the advisor to Falcon Cove's honor society students, top fundraisers, and parents. \"With the pandemic, this group of students see the need to give back because they've seen their siblings go through a tough time when they were in elementary school or their neighbors. So, when Joe DiMaggio asked us, once again, to step up, they didn't hesitate,\" said Stella. This is the third consecutive year Falcon Cove honor society students have made a $5,000 gift to the children's hospital's foundation, with previous donations supporting art and bibliotherapy programs. Delray Medical Center Is First Hospital in Florida to T reat Alzheimer's Patient with Non-invasive Focused Ultrasound T echnology Delray Medical Center is the first hospital in Florida to treat an Alzheimer's disease patient using non-invasive focused ultrasound technology as part of a groundbreaking study being conducted in collaboration with Florida Atlantic University's (FAU) Institute for Human Health and Disease Intervention. In the FDA-approved clinical trial, focused ultrasound technology is used to disrupt the blood-brain barrier in participating Alzheimer's patients. Alzheimer's may be caused by a buildup of certain proteins in the brain. Precisely guided by magnetic-res-onance imaging, ultrasound waves are directed at specific areas of the patient's brain to create a temporary opening in the blood-brain barrier where the protein buildup may be reduced. The Delray Medical Center patient enrolled in the clinical trial received the first of three treatments at the hospital on Feb. 15. \"Delray Medical Center is proud and excited to be a leader in this effort to deter- mine the safety and efficacy of this potentially revolutionary treatment for Alzheimer's patients,\" said Lloyd Zucker, M.D., FAANS, a board-certified neurosurgeon and Medical Director of Neurosurgery at Delray Medical Center. \"The study will help determine whether the use of this non-invasive focused ultrasound technology can lead to cognitive improvement in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\" \"Drug passage through the blood-brain barrier is perhaps one of the greatest chal- lenges in neurology ,\" said Gregg Fields, PhD, Executive Director, Florida Atlantic University's Institute for Human Health and Disease Intervention (I-Health), a profes-sor of chemistry and biochemistry in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, and the program director for the project. \"The treatment of the first patient in Florida with the non-invasive focused ultrasound technology represents a significant advancement for potential drug delivery and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. In tandem, we are also working on non-invasive, blood-based monitoring to determine if treatments are effective.\" The clinical trial, called ExAblate Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Disruption for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Insightec's ExAblate Model 4000 T ype 2.0 System as a tool for disrupting the blood-brain barrier in probable Alzheimer's patients. The study , part of Florida's Brain State initiative, is being conducted at up to eight sites in the country . Patients who meet the specific study criteria receive three focused ultrasound treatments, two weeks apart, and will be followed for five years after the final procedure. Since COVID-19, the world has drastically changed in terms of where we work and how we work. Many companies shifted to fully remote work, which caused people to change their views on the workplace. Many are thriv-ing off the benefits of working from home such as work-life balance, control over com-mute, access to more opportunity and choos-ing where they want to work. Some people do not thrive in an environment where they're isolated and must rely on themselves to stay on track with deadlines and projects. This is where a hybrid schedule may play a keen role for some. This helps them maintain the schedule they're used to, but still offers the flexibility that so many desire. Because of the virtual distance, people had to readjust how they interacted and maintained relationships with employees and clients. Various companies are providing things such as huddles, happy hours, and are continuously searching for new ways to encourage more personal relationships within the workplace. Arranging weekly check-ins, virtual lunches, company contests/ challenges and coffee chats can motivate employees to take regular breaks and stir up conversation. Social groups can help remote employees con-nect with people who may have similar interests. This may provide an opportunity to learn about other departments and more about the company they work for. According to LinkedIn data, remote work listings increased by 357% between May 2020 and May 2021. Even before the pandemic, 25% of people considered switching jobs in hopes to pursue a better work-life balance and avoid productivity pressure in an office setting (Hogan Assessments). A few challenges surrounding working from home are staying on track and managing time. Creating daily or weekly routines can help alleviate pressure and help people stay proactive. Some employees may feel like it is more men-tally taxing to collaborate on projects in remote work environments, then walking down the hall to a conference room. To prevent burnout associated with those feelings, people should focus on quality over quantity when it comes to communicat-ing with colleagues, consider consolidat-ing meetings and maintain healthy boundaries. Working remotely isn't one size fits all; this is where the topic of hybrid work comes to surface. Organizations should recognize the factors that contribute to the ample dif-ference in an employee's approach to work and relationships. Employees can establish and maintain workplace rela-tionships while still holding onto flexibil-ity and time at home. In retrospect, this provides higher productivity and less time spent commuting. Office space can now be used for collaborative projects, team meetings and can help reduce office footprints and overhead. Remote work leaves organizations with expanded talent pools, which grants them access to the global workforce. In today's world, we are constantly searching for more ways to improve mental health, wellbeing and overall job satisfaction. Lowering turnover, burnout, uncertainty and workplace anxiety should be every organization's goal. Reconfiguring benefits systems, hosting virtual happy hours and providing regular one-on-one meetings with managers, are great ways to get ahead of any problems, share thoughts and keep employees engaged. There are many work from home models avail-able, with their relevance depending on the specific business and employee needs. As work from home options expand, companies will continuously have to adapt to the new work from home reality , listen to their employees and ensure their needs and mental health are being taken care of to ensure a safe, healthy and very productive future. HIMpros offers excellent work from home options in a variety of non-clinical health- care roles. Betsy Johnson is Founder & CEO, HIMpros.

Copyright \u00a9 2022we've dropped the ball for preventive diseases; how do we have access to affordable and accessible preventive care for the com-munity . It's an insane system that favors the chronic diseases that cost trillions of dollars.\" We have a tremendous amount of talent and research going on; all of these are great institutes for chronic diseases.\" However, he went on to say , \"I think we've dropped the ball for preventive diseases; how do we have access to affordable and accessible preventive care for the community . It's an insane sys-tem that favors the chronic diseases that cost trillions of dol-lars.\" Because of his passion, he said he has been involved with the BCMA for many years. \"I got enamored with the philosophy of protecting the health of the people of Broward; we have limited resources, but we are able to work collectively for the agenda of healthcare.\" Dr. Wong has spent 30 years at Pembroke Pines My Care, where he is medical director and practices in primary care and family medicine. He gave an example of a patient who walked into his office, and when he checked his sugar he discovered it was 400. \"I see this and I think, 'Where were you 10 years ago?' So that's a problem.\" He believes one answer is to help get patients engaged and get them more educated about their illnesses. \"When you have those components, you have power. Things like telehealth and intelligence platforms help us educate and empower our patients and that maximizes compliance and minimizes cost. That's my goal. It's value-based care, and I'm very interested in that.\" Dr. Wong also expressed his concern for young doctors who are entering the system, saying the journey of becoming a doc-tor is so incredibly hard - not only do they make life and death decisions, but they also face the challenges of insurance and malpractice. However, he said, \"When you help a patient in that most necessary moment and they give you a hug, that is priceless. That keeps your passion going, but it gets harder every year to continue that passion. Medicine is a vocation, it's a calling that touches your heart.\" With all of this in mind, Dr. Wong has a mission for the BCMA during his year as president, and he refers to it as \"CPT.\" He explained: \"C - I want them to connect, to connect with themselves, to connect with the community , to connect with patients, to be better physicians. I think a better doctor is a better person, and I want them to collaborate and communi-cate their ideas with compassion.\" The P is for protection. Dr. Wong wants them to protect their health, protect their profes-sion, and protect the patients' rights, to be advocates. \"And T is for transformation of the mindset - go from why to why not, from good to better to best. To embrace new ideas, because in medicine now the only thing constant is change, so embrace it. Use technology to engage patients, because an engaged patient is a better person, a better patient. Those are the values I'm trying to move forward.\" He mentioned again why his involvement in the BCMA is so important: \"I'm 60 now and I have to give something back. I've been in this community for almost 50 years, 30 years practic-ing down here, and it's the right thing to do because we've got to move forward.\" He added, \"I might need those services someday! And doing nothing is not an option.\" For more information, visit www.bcma.com or call (954) 714-9477. Continued from page 1Cover Story: New BCMA President Has Passion for HealthcareDoctors are also natural learners and natural teachers, both of which serve them well by being expert witnesses. \"On the stand, they get to teach the judge and jury about dif- ferent aspects of interesting cases, and that really appeals to them,\" said Gracey . COVID has also affected the medical profession, and doctors who had to close or limit their practices are looking for some-thing else to do with their expertise. Becoming an expert wit-ness doesn't require any new licenses, though some states, including Florida, require them to register. The pay is good, too - expert witnesses can make $500-$1,000 per hour, which serves as a good primary or side income. \"In the highest form of expert witness practice, doctors are really furthering the practice of good medicine,\" said Gracey . \"If they are completely objective and ethical, they will often opine on bad medicine that needs to have light shined upon it, and in legal terms, be punished. \"They also don't have to speak in legalese; they are asked to give their medical - not legal - opinions, and that fits hand-in-glove with what many doctors have the expertise to do.\" The Laws Have Changed While there is a lot of literature written about recruiting expert witnesses, there is very little mentioned about the increasing liability faced by doctors taking this role. \"When you look at English law , for the last 400 years expert witnesses have had immunity ,\" said Gracey . \"In 2011, the United Kingdom removed those immunities, and this was a huge move on their part. \"What has happened in the U.S. is that states are now chip- ping away at the longstanding doctrine of expert witnesses having immunity ,\" he continued. \"Six states officially allow expert witnesses to be sued in some fashion, and it appears that many more are considering it.\" Some medical societies have also weighed in on the practice, with both the neurosurgical and orthopedic professional soci-eties establishing programs to sanction members who give false testimony in courts of law or binding arbitration hearings. \"All around the country , we are seeing either a decrease in protections or discussions about decreasing protections,\" said Gracey . \"Many doctors believe that they have no liability what-soever because of longstanding laws, but as society changes, so will the laws. It will start with egregiously false testimony , then chip away at erroneous false testimony .\" Because physicians are not covered under traditional liability insurance, they should look for stand-alone policies that specifically cover the role of an expert witness, noted Gracey . \"With the amount of money they are able to make as expert witnesses, these policies, which are not costly , are only a small expense.\" For more information, contact Matt Gracey at (800) 966-2120 or visit www.dannagracey.com.Cover Story: Liability Protection Eroding for Expert Witnesses Continued from page 1 \u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081Visit us online at www.southfloridahospitalnews.comSouth Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com March 2023 37 E-mail Your Editorial Submissions to editorial@southfloridahospitalnews.com BELIEVE BELONG A PLACE TONURSING PROGRAMS EVERY STAGE IN YOU l programs ar e available to r esidents of all U.S. states.

Not all South University , West Palm Beach, University Centr e, 9801 Belveder \u00a9 2022 SSOUTHUNIVERSITY.EDU | 855-209 HEALTHCARE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE HEALTHCARE EDUCATION BY JOSH BAXT The phrase \"big data\" can have vastly different meanings. To fundamental discovery researchers, it could be the readout from whole genome sequencing. For clinicians, it could mean deidenti-fied patient data from electronic health records. For telemedicine specialists, it could indicate aggregated information streams from remote devices. Population health researchers might say all of the above. This diversity can be a blessing and a curse. Data offers great promise to help address some of the world's most intractable health issues. Still, the medical and research communities are just beginning to figure out how to manage these data streams and translate them into coherent information. To help overcome these issues, and elevate big data's impact on education, research, outreach and patient care, the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine recently launched the Department of Informatics and Health Data Science. The new depart-ment seeks to become a nexus, where new thinking, and collaborations between dis-parate interests, can align to achieve common goals. \"Our gift as a clinical institution is that we care for people,\" said Azizi Seixas, Ph.D., interim chair of the department. \"To improve how we provide that care, we must adopt a precision approach, but what does that even look like? Each individual is a constellation of different factors: their biology , DNA, behavior, psychology , environ-ment - and we have to understand all of it. To truly provide personalized care, we must embrace a continuously learning health system.\" Reimagining How Information Is Acquired and Used The department seeks to refine academic medicine and health care across five pil- lars: research, clinical care, education, private venture, and service and outreach. \u0081 In research, the department will integrate lab and clinical research findings, elec- tronic health records and population health studies, ultimately translating that infor-mation into new therapies. \u0081 On the clinical side, the team will advance telemedicine, smart devices and other remote health applications. \u0081 In education, the department seeks to expand collaborations with life sciences and tech companies to build internship programs and develop a new generation of innovators who thrive on information. \u0081 Private venture governs how the Miller School interacts with the larger life sci- ences and tech communities to catalyze the thoughtful exchange of ideas and more rapidly advance therapeutic innovations. \u0081 Outreach is developing new collaborations with South Florida's many communi- ties, such as partnering with minority-serving institutions to help them advance their research. \"We want to generate a free exchange of intellectual capital, ideas and technologies,\" said Dr. Seixas, \"to dive into traditional informatics, while also elevating understudied areas, such as population health.\" Embracing a Wiser Health Care System Dr. Seixas believes these and other approaches will help create a health care system that freely shares knowledge and experience and relies on data to provide the best possible clinical judgment. This emerging system would better integrate current technologies, and share data throughout the ecosystem, as well as accelerating how new tech-nologies are vetted and ultimately adopted. The primary goal is to leverage data to better understand biology , clinical care and communities. Sharing the Intellectual Wealth Dr. Seixas and colleagues believe the Miller School and the department are in an ideal position to accumulate new knowledge and share it in the community . This process has already begun, as the Miller School and Institute of Data Science and Computing have joined the National Institutes of Health's AIM-AHEAD program, which supports efforts to build machine learning infrastructure at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions and tribal colleges. \"We currently have two pilot programs,\" said Dr. Seixas, \"with Florida Atlantic University , Florida Memorial University , Miami Dade College, and Caridad Health Center, the largest free clinic in Florida. We are building up their AI infrastructure to process and deidentify electronic medical records. It will give them more data for their own research, as well as attracting pharmaceutical companies and clinical trials.\" But the Miller School community extends far beyond South Florida. Miami is a gateway to the Caribbean, Central and South America, Africa and North America, and all these regions will be part of the equation. \"There's already a free exchange of commerce and culture, and we'd like to share technology as well,\" said Dr. Seixas. \"Whatever we can build in South Florida, we can build anywhere in the world.\" What Data Can Do The New Department of Informatics and Health Data Science seeks to redefine how data can power patient care, education, research and outreach - and catalyze innovation.

South University continues to be discovered by the traditional college student, but South has long served the non-traditional stu-dent in supporting their desire to improve their lives and that of their families with highly respected professional programs. South University offers all levels of degrees: Associate, Bachelor, Master, and Doctorate, and SU is Regionally Accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The South difference is easy to explain: small classes and personalized attention make South University a unique learning experience, offering all learning modalities, including online, on-campus, virtual, and the ability for our students to blend these modalities to meet their busy schedules while earning their degree. Although South University has an administrative team to help students be successful, the charge into the community is led by a cooperative effort of the Community Outreach and Admissions Departments. These individuals work to host and attend every opportunity to edu-cate our community about South University Programs and collaborate with students from initial meeting through graduation. Once a student has enrolled with South University , the support and encourage-ment of Admissions and Outreach does not stop, as Student Services and Academic Support continue to serve the ever-changing needs of our students. South University champions our students' efforts with an outstanding Academic Support Coordinator to tutor and counsel students with technical support, eBook support and the course-by-course tutors needed to be successful. South offers our students a rolling admissions process with fresh new 10-week starts every 5 weeks to allow the stu-dent to begin or renew their academic goals when they're ready . This allows a stu-dent to start sooner, and with five 10-week sessions per year, the student may com-plete up to 20 classes in one year and set a pace toward graduation much faster than traditional semester-based institutions. Our undergraduate programs include Associate of Science in Allied Health and Associate of Science in Physical Therapy Assistant. The Physical Therapist Assistant graduates boast a 100% pass rate on their boards. Our Bachelor programs include the traditional Business, Criminal Justice, Psychology and Healthcare Management, along with the high demand of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Our nurs-es are found in every hospital in Palm Beach County and beyond. Our master degree programs are designed to be com-pleted in 6 10-week terms (Master of Business Administration, Master of Healthcare Administration, Master of Criminal Justice, and our combination Master of Business Administration/Master of Healthcare Administration). With our Clinical Mental Health Counseling being a 2-year program. The Master of Medical Science in Anesthesia Science and the Master of Science in Physician Assistant Program here at South University , West Palm Beach offer an exceptional, instructive journey in which the chief focus is to advance each cohort into becoming successful, innova-tive, skillful clinical leaders. We are so excited to announce that the inaugural class of the South University West Palm Beach MSPA program is set to graduate in March 2023! These students have paved the way for our future PA cohorts, and will undoubtedly make a positive impact to society and the community as newly certi-fied Physician Assistants. As fairly new programs, the cohorts are growing, and our reputation is becoming well known in the community . Our stu-dents represent a level of professionalism, adaptability , and grit that contest the long-established programs. We advocate to recruit diverse student cohorts and faculty that is reflective to the surrounding com-munity and progressively advances these professions. This is done by understanding the immense importance of taking a holis-tic approach when reviewing candidates and therefore matriculating cohorts that are multiculturally , socio-economically , ethnically , and intellectually diverse. The uniqueness of the Anesthesiologist Assistant Program, is the full simulation lab/mock operating room that has all of the equipment and supplies you would find in a real-world operating room. Our AA faculty sometimes joke that we could open someone up right here at the campus and perform a full-blown operation! Our staff strive for customer service superiority , and the faculty work excep-tionally hard to ensure from the moment the students walk into new student orien-tation, to the day they graduate, they will receive nothing short of an excellent expe-rience here at the educational hidden gem, South University of West Palm Beach.

It is the only univ veersity in t n Holis rs reedentialiCareers in healthcare administration continue to grow as the overall industry attempts to work through the post-pandemic transi-tional challenges. These challenges include severe labor issues that necessitate a closer look at staff short-ages both today and for the immediate future. Options may be limited but identi-fying this issue as a priority is a must. Most healthcare organizations need to devote time and resources into the future training and academic preparation of staff, including those at the bedside. These front door initiatives are essential and remain a critical compo-nent of any successful intervention geared toward effective human resource management. At the same time, appro-priate oversight must be provided to retain staff already employed. A \"revolv-ing door\" situation will not be successful in the long or short term. To manage this human resource oppor- tunity and challenge efficiently , health-care management needs to be given the proper tools and resources. Considering the current environment, raising prices is not an option to address this ongoing cost pressure. Value-based reimburse-ment will create more pres-sure on providers by high-lighting the cost of care even more. Healthcare con-sumers are finding them-selves with rising out-of-pocket exposure even as they have decent insurance, drawing more attention to the industry-wide cost of care growth. Current mid- and execu- tive-level management must be educated in cur-rent human resources man-agement practices that will encourage and support success. Determining the resources available in the community and those offered through educational formats created and provided by local higher education insti-tutions is essential. These institutions must have experts to challenge and edu-cate current management teams; they provide contemporary and advanced approaches for excelling within our existing competitive and ever-changing environment. The Health Administration Program within the College of Business at Florida Atlantic University has both the expert-ise and understanding needed and serves as an invaluable resource for the commu-nity . In addition to FAU's undergraduate and graduate programs in health admin-istration, we have the ability to work with teams and organizations as well as individuals to design needed educational support through corporate training and certificate programs. Our health admin-istration degree programs are guided by cutting-edge curriculum routinely evalu-ated to ensure industry relevance and compatibility . Courses are taught by highly qualified and experienced faculty who consistently receive recognition from the healthcare field and our stu-dents. We offer an industry leading, highly regarded executive program attractive to working executives with its weekend and online class formats. Healthcare is a dynamic industry with unlimited opportunities and currently experiencing intense volatility that will bring about unprecedented change. Stay relevant and count on the Health Administration Program at Florida Atlantic University to provide your learning needs with either a degree-focused format or a certificate program or with custom-developed trainings to upskill your teams and organizations.

As a seasoned HR leader in strategy and operations, the pub-lication honored Lytle as one of the region's outstanding professionals in health care. SFBW cited Lytle for his work helping lead ChenMed's innovation and strategic initiatives. It also rec-ognized his accomplishment as President-Elect of the HR Association of Broward County . Lytle is one of more than 30 honorees this year from the fields of health care, accounting, banking and finance services, education, hospitality , insurance, legal, marketing and public relations, real estate and construction, technology and transportation, and logis-tics. Prior to joining ChenMed, Lytle worked for retail giants, Target and Walmart, supporting retail healthcare operations and leading teams that supported enterprise-wide HR operations within pharma-cy , vision and primary care clinics. Lytle also has experience in talent acquisition, professional relations, talent development and employ-ment branding. Stephen Lytle It's easy to say that \"Housing Is Healthcare\" is a slogan or quip, like many politicians who use the phrases \"Increase Jobs, Improve Education, or Be Tough on Crime\", when in fact most of those slogans don't amount to any substantial action to solve those problems. But housing does improve healthcare and healthcare agency outcomes. TaskForce Fore Ending Homelessness (TaskForce) encountered 5,388 people experiencing homelessness on the streets of Broward County in 2022. Of those, 34% (1,831) of them suffered from a physical health condition that required medical attention. This may seem like a small number when dealing with thousands of patients a year, but as uninsured individuals, with no regular physician for follow up care , the emergency room becomes their \"family doctor\" and hospi-tal beds become recovery beds. They have no other choice. Using the old 80/20 business rule, by repeatedly accessing the ER with simple and sometimes not so simple procedures, 20 per-cent of patients who are homeless and unin-sured in Broward County can result in 80 per-cent of emergency room costs. There are multiple models across the country that show cost savings gained when hospitals partner and invest in housing with non-profits that serve the homeless population. Our collaborative programs provide a roof over their heads and Case Management servic-es. Case Managers are trained to connect peo-ple in housing with employment or disability benefits, medical insurance, and doctors who can start practicing medical manage-ment and preventive health with our clients. These combined services lead to better medical outcomes, less visits to the hospital, and more pay-ments for the medical services they receive. A recent study by one of our prominent housing providers showed a 97% reduction in hospital-izations and an 87% improvement in overall health per year for people who were placed into housing com-pared to when those same clients were homeless on the streets. There are three overlooked oppor- tunities for hospitals and healthcare systems to save money and improve patient care: 1) Collaborate with a non-profit partner that works with the homeless population to under-stand what is needed to house more people. 2) Encourage local legislators to invest in policies and initiatives that will house people with serious health concerns. 3) Analyze the data to determine how many patients are homeless, how often they are using the hospital inappropriately for primary care and how much money could be saved by help-ing them access housing? Housing means a lot of things to the people we get off the streets, but for those that are suf-fering from health issues there is no greater reality than their Housing Is Healthcare.

FALCONER Accolades Accolades 42 March 2023 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsI was explaining to a potential member about the South Florida Hospital & Healthcare Association and said about our knowledge that it was \"several miles wide, but only an inch deep.\" As a small hospital and healthcare trade associa-tion with tight staffing, it is not possible for us to gain depth of knowledge at the expense of not doing other things required by the Association. Therefore, periodically , I like to do a swim around the pond and identify areas of current or growing importance. Medicaid continuous enrollment. Since mid-2020 states that accepted enhanced Medicaid funding agreed to not do annual Medicaid redetermination process to assure that all the persons on the state Medicaid rolls are still eligible. With the wild swings in the labor market during the strong COVID-19 years of 2021-22, it made sense as people found themselves employed and unemployed with some frequency . Recent Congressional action has negated that requirement for no redeterminations and now states are in the process of doing redetermina-tions and they must be completed by May 2024. Why is this important? Well, it is estimated that anywhere between 15 and 18 million people will lose coverage. Worse, an estimated 6.7 million children will lose their CHIP coverage! A Georgetown University Center for Children and Families study , \"found that 72 percent of children will likely lose coverage because of state bureaucratic issues, not because of ineligibility . According to the report, the nation's uninsured rate for children (5 percent in 2021) could more than double if states do not rede- termine eligibility correctly .\" [Becker's] Texas board charges 23 nurses in fake degree. Sadly , we are likely going to see more issues involving the issuance of fake degrees. While this headline was from Texas, Florida already had its scandal (likely more to come). This has implications for the students, some who claimed they were duped, and to health- care providers who hired these candi- dates in good faith. There will be more. And, on some lighter notes ... COVID vaccines.
