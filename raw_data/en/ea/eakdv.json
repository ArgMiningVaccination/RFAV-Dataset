After reading them, you may decide to incorporate them into your lifestyle too! Why essential oils popular? 1. We need alternative healthcare Essential oil knowledge was lost when modern medicine became popular in the United States. This is because people used to think Western medicine was more evolved, and therefore should have greater respect. Some innovations, like life-saving surgeries and fertility procedures are truly miraculous. However, this standard of care is only focused on palliative measures. It doesn't address the root cause of health imbalances. We need and expect more. We're realizing that Western Medicine is not making us healthier. We are wising up and asking: WHY is this happening to me? WHAT does my body need to be healthier? HOW can I maintain health? Nature, traditional medicines, alternative health practitioners, and your own intuition are the best guides. Essential oils are gifts from nature that help support physiological functions, improve mood, control infections, and thereby add to our health. 2. Essential oils are effective alternatives to toxic products We are living in a toxic soup that triggers many health problems in our population. Visit [EWG.org](http://ewg.org/) to learn more about pesticides, herbicides, antibacterial agents, and other threats in our environment. They're still legal in the U.S., even they disrupt hormones, destroy gut flora, decrease immunity, and [cause cancer](https://falconhealingarts.com/how-to-keep-your-family-safe-from-glyphosate-and-other-toxins-2/). Therefore, it's up to manufacturers to remove them from their products or up to consumers to stop buying them. Essential oils can clean our homes and bodies. Many families make their own home and personal care products using essential oils. There's also some trusted companies who provide ready-made products using essential oils. These are safe and effective replacements to toxic conventional products found on grocery store shelves. 3. Essential oils have been used effectively for thousands of years Did you know essential oils have been used from the beginning of history? Ancient Chinese, Indian, Greek, and Egyptian civilizations prized them for their beauty enhancing, spiritual, and therapeutic value. So even though they are new to Americans, that's not so in the rest of the world. Our culture is starting to respect older modalities like my profession of Chinese Medicine, as well as using Essential Oils. I would not call it a trend. Americans are just now seeing what has always been around - an awakening of sorts! 4. People want to feel empowered & resourceful with health choices Many people these days don't believe that \"doctors know best\". It's important to have a health practitioner as a guide or for a different perspective. However, most people have the awareness to know when they're well or not though, and whether it's an emergency. They know how to research and experiment with natural remedies and determine if they're working. Moms in particular, want to trust their instincts more. They want to be resourceful and feel empowered with their choices, just as our ancestors were. They know their children better than anyone else! It's easy for them to use essential oils and they're accepted well by their children. Experience shows them that essential oils work well to manage illness in the family and to boost their health. 5. There's tons of research to support essential oil efficacy Each year, hundreds of research studies validate essential oil efficacy. Here are just a few that show essential oils can improve one's health naturally: [Protective essential oil attenuates influenza virus infection: An in vitro study in MDCK cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2994788/) [The Effectiveness of Aromatherapy in Reducing Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5192342/) [The effects of preoperative aromatherapy massage on anxiety and sleep quality of colorectal surgery patients: A randomized controlled study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29458940) Certainly, the excitement behind essential oil use is backed by a compelling need!
