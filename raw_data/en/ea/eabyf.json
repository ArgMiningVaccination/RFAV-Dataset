Quantitative andqualitative data forthisresearch were collected through a wide range ofmethodologies including participant observation, photographic recording, semi-structured interviewing, andthechronicling ofpersonal life- histories. CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION The Structural Adjustment Policies (SAPs) implemented by developing countries likeTrinidad (andTobago)1inthe1980s have severely affected those at,andbelow, thepoverty line, especially groups ofwomen, children and elderly people (PAHO/WHO 1994; Safa and Antrobus 1992). These policies, prescribed bytheWorld Bank and the International Fund (IMF) foraddressing balance ofpayments problems, brought about alarming increases inhealth care costs with theresult that biomedical health careservices arenow outside thereach oflarge ondiabetes, itwasshown thattraditional orhome remedies were used along with cosmopolitan medicine, even though diabetics reported thattheywere warned against theuseofhome remedies byhealth professionals. Thestudy predicts that shortages ofmedication, increasing and household arelikely tocause intheir households, inbiomedical facilities (asnursing and support personnel) (Mariesknd 1980), and intraditional health care systems (as traditional birth attendants) (Turshen 1991). Graham (1985:25-26) states quite appropriately that informal health carehasremained part ofthedomestic economy, molded bytherelations which are the location forthe acquisition andapplication ofspecialist skills. These two dimensions have been closely related historically, with theprocess ofmale domination converging with the process ofprofessionalization todefine thehealth work of women. Women invariably informal Compilers ofhealth data have consistently limited their concerns tobiomedical practitioners and the facilities inwhich they operate. There istheneed, therefore, tostudy allhealth care systems SAPs asaresult of balance ofpayments problems intheir developing economies. These policies had negative effects onnational employment, income levels, food prices. 3 social infrastructure, education and housing. Additionally, there were specific reductions inpublic expenditures forhealth careandthesubsequent increase intheprivatization ofhealth care services. Theimplementation ofthese policies increases in health care costs. Asaresult, theresponsibility forhealth carewas shifted from thestate tothehousehold which on women \"who strategies\" (SafaandAntrobus 1992:50; seealsoPhillips 1994). InTrinidad, the health and social services received smaller financial allocations between 1982 and1990,which resulted (Beckford 1975). Sinha (1988:147) argues that intheCaribbean, health care services available tomothers and their neonates arenotutilized compared to information fewmothers thedevelopment \"normal\" deliveries aredischarged after 24hoursj According to biomedical practitioners, early discharge subjects awoman tocertain risks. For example, physical complications may occur, which caninclude discomfort at anepisiotomy orcesarean with possible atrophy, anddiuresis may occur. The patient may confront other changes, such asfatigue, problems inmeeting the needs ofherinfant, role conflict, andadjustment within parental andfamily relationships. Early hospital discharge means thatmany ofthe nurturing and infant care skills previously taught by health professionals ... arenowcrammed into ashort time frame just prior tohospital discharge, when the client's attention isoften focused at home. (Youngkin andSzmania 1994:520) haspointed thematernal 5 \"difficult todescribe.\" Itadds thatwhile data areavailable onthenumbers of doctors and other health professionals, clinics, health establishments, and hospitals, \"there areother resources onwhich only partial information is available.\" This study isexactly about those \"other resources\" that are provided athome and inthecommunity topostnatal women and their neonates after theyhave been discharged from biomedical institutions. Few health careproviders possess aclear idea oftheextent towhich medical toidentify the roles plays inthehealth care ofparturient women andpatients ingeneral. women their neonates. Emphasis isplaced onthemasseuse-patient interaction as part ofthetotal medical health care system. Ialsoattempt todescribe and analyze how thebiomedical system impacts onthe traditional medical system, and toexamine theextent oftheretention oftraditional beliefs and practices among different generations ofwomen cross-culturally. Astudy of this nature should provide biomedical practitioners with the basis for understanding andpromoting thewelfare medical practitioners would become familiar with thecultural background of their ethnically diverse parturient female patients. This understanding should facilitate theformulation ofaculturally sensitive health careprogram 6 inwhich local theincorporation ofmore traditional intheir biomedical regimens. Medical ofmedicine oftheir Traditional medicine is dynamic, andnotstatic, because itislocated within alarge national context in which theforces ofthepolitically dominant culture have penetrated over time (Romanucci-Ross tradition\" offolkmedicine, knowledge shared between users andpractitioners (Press 1978:72). Traditional medical systems articulate theories ofdisease etiology andremediation within alarger cultural framework ofmoral, ethical, religious, and supernatural concerns. The underlying causes ofillnesses aregenerally seen assome kind ofimbalance blessings and pilgrimages, good dietandexercise (Hufford 1988). Traditional medical systems aremore open than other systems and their therapeutics, therefore, aremore likely toinclude substantial imputs of biomedicine intheir tothefolkmedical ofprayers to, and faith in,asupernatural being.^l Traditional health careconventions in Trinidad have sprung mainly from thefolkmedical systems ofIndia and 7 Africa where immigrant laborers were onprint and other forms ofmedia and frequently having formal organizations and curricula for participant instruction orpractitioner training (e.g. naturopathy orchiropractic) (O'Connor 1995). The alternative medicine sector, ofwhich the\"health food movement\" isthebestexample, hasenjoyed steady growth over thepast 20 years indeveloped countries (Hufford 1988). Some commentators believe this trend signifies animportant change invalues, areaction against thatastate more narrowly asanexpression ofdissatisfaction with thescientific andtechnological dominance official health caresystem isreferred tobyarange ofterms, of itistheform ofmedicine that Inkeeping with the scientific tradition, itspractitioners have striven toseparate themselves from broader social and cultural concerns and influences. Itsconcepts andmethods havebecome universal inapplication and arenotaltered significantly bydifferent ecological environments. Its practitioners discount religious, metaphysical, and philosophical considerations from their explanatory models ofdisease anddysfunction 8 (O'Connor 1995). Though scientific medicine has itspractitioners form care inTrinidad's health careprogram. Perhaps themost distinctive feature ofthegrowth of health services inThird World countries, likeTrinidad, isthatthese services have been promoted byaffluent capitalistic countries (Banerji 1984). The increasing commercialization ofhealth-related products (Banerji 1984) and thedemonstrated power ofscience andtechnology (Singer 1989) beamed through satellite television stations areconvincing people ofthemagic of western medicine. Atthenational enjoys cooperation, andprotection ofthecountry's legalsystem and other supporting social institutions: government licensing and regulatory bodies, third-party payment systems, preferred access tofederal and private and research monies, high prestige social status and their concomitant benefits, including professional associations with substantial lobbying power and professional publications with influential reputations forauthority. (O'Connor 1995: 5) Thestate-supported modem medical system, which tends tobesynonymous with amonopolistic medical \"establishment\" and adoctor-dependent, hospital-based, curative health care model, does notgenerally recognize, cooperate with, oradjust tothe traditional medical systems (Good et al. 1979:141). Thetwoexist sidebyside, yetremain functionally unrelated inany organizational sense. There isthe belief that with the recognition of traditional medicine andthepolitical commitment tohumanistic health care reform, better useofscarce resources forthecommon good canbemade. 9 Techniques andmedications ofmodem practice are increasingly filtering down tolocal healers. Folk, popular andorthodox medical practices may coexist, compete and intermingle with oneanother within asingle community, nation orregion.

Midwives found favor with parturient women because ofacombination offactors which included cost, convenience, familiarity, perceived quality andduration ofcare. Their main duties were latermonopolized bymainly male obstetricians whonow operate inpublic and private hospitals (see also Burghart and Reissland 1989). Midwives acquired their knowledge mainly from older midwives who themselves hadnoformal training inobstetrics.

The elderly midwives/ masseuses oftoday, remain the last repositories oftraditional knowledge onmaternal andchild health care (seealsoCosminsky 1982). The urgency ofthesituation demands that these former-midwives bestudied before they,andtheknowledge they hold, disappear forever. 15 Literature Review From acritical medical perspective, most ofthe literature on,or referring to,traditional medicine intheCaribbean remains descriptive, and atheoretical (e.g. Niehoff and Niehoff 1960, Sobo 1993). richethnographic material onillness Minott disprove thehypothesis that rural mothers domore self-treatment than their urban counterparts and thatthey believe more infolk causes ofillness.

Additionally, they ignored gender and class perspectives, andthe explanatory models ofbiomedical practitioners arenotfully articulated (cf. Keck 1993; Kleinman etal.1978).

Without such analysis, health planners and would beunable todesign programs of intervention thatwould besocially andculturally relevant and effective. The general health situation inTrinidad hasimproved significantly over thepast three decades. Thecountry hasincreased the level oflife expectancy, reduced the rates ofinfant mortality, and diminished the incidence ofcommunicable diseases. Childhood diseases preventable through immunization have either disappeared orhavecome tobeseen asonly a minor nuisance. Ontheother hand, thecountry's dominated byheart disease, malignant neoplasms, diabetes mellitus, andcerebrovascular disease, closely resembles that ofdeveloped countries. 20 21 Additionally, new factors likeanaging population, unemployment, and financial constraints, nowcombine topose realthreats tothe relatively good health status enjoyed uptothistime(TG 1996). Country Profile ThrRepublic ofTrinidad andTobago comprises two tropical islands which arethemost southern islands. Trinidad is located only 11kilometers (7miles) north-east ofVenezuela which places it nearer mainland South America than any oftheother Commonwealth Caribbean countries. Trinidad hasanarea of4,828 square kilometers (1,864 sq. miles) while nearby Tobago hasanarea of300square kilometers (116 sq. miles). Trinidad was \"discovered\" byColumbus in1498andwas ruled by Spain forvarying periods until final British in1797. itsorigins tomassive eighteenth- andnineteenth-century immigration oflaborers whowere brought mainly and India, as slaves andindentured servants, towork onthesugar cane plantations.

Agriculture comprises only asmall share oftheGDPandemploys about 10percent ofthe total labor force. to inthecountry's in unemployment, malnutrition andpoverty (Caribbean Economic Handbook 1985:145). Faced with rising debt-service payments, falling export earnings, andawidening budget deficit, aseries ofausterity measures were introduced in1988under theIMF Structural Adjustment Program. Asurvey ofliving conditions conducted in1992(MSD 1996) revealed thatpoverty level had increased from 1988 to35.9 percent due todifficult national economic circumstances. andfemale- headed households were thegroups that forurban areas numbers ofIndians both attheleadership andmembership levels. 25 Inearly 1988, Robinson, astheAfro-Trinidadian Prime Minister, sacked four Indian members from hiscabinet, including theforeign minister anddeputy leader oftheNAR, Basdeo Panday. The conflict raised thesensitive issue of racial divisions within theTrinidadian society because theexpelled ministers drewmuch oftheir support from theIndian community. In1989, the expelled ministers regrouped themselves under anew political party, andthe United National Congress (UNC) wasformed. Agreat embarrassment tothe onmany Caribbean societies isthe definition, nature, and extent ofsocial and cultural pluralism (see Glazier 1985). Trinidad isaclassic example ofacountry where significant differences inethnic, racial, religious, classandgender differences canbefound. emphasize \"pluralism,\" \"heterogeneity,\" \"diversity,\" or\"acculturation\" astheoretical concepts agree that there are significant social and cultural differences between Indians and allother groups inthesociety.

Each ethnic group maintains cultural cohesion, andpresents continuous resistance when itsmembers trytoassimilate cultural elements ofwhat isperceived tobelong tothe \"Other.\" Significant intersect with variables ofclassandgender (Keur andRubin 1960). Until the1960s, Indians were essentially rural agricultural residents andAfricans were living andworking inthetowns (Brawer 1965). Rapid changes inurban migration andWesternization have taken place and the ethnic identity ofIndians hasbecome more complex. Lieber itfeasible or practical tosustain traditional behavioral patterns. Such individuals face pressure bytheoverwhelming Afro-Creole voices tomodify their behavior or conform toacreolized version ofaTrinidadian culture. Headds thatIndian cultural intentions have been most fully realized inrural ethnically homogenous settings. What Lieber fails torealize isthat theIndians who have leftthecountryside have notforgotten their roots/routes and they, in fact, revisit their natal homes todraw sustenance and tonourish their transplanted identities (seeEricksen 1992:174). Moreover, Indians relocate themselves inurban areas amongst fellow Indians which makes itpractical forthem tocongregate andsharecommon cultural activities. Since Indians in than those inthecountrysides (ILO 1995:106), they arebetter disposed tohavemore material resources toexpress 27 their ethnic identities ofwhich musical bands andsinging performances are justtwoexamples. Electoral politics intheisland have always been divided sharply along ethnic lines. The results oftheNovember 1995 general election were a watershed inthepolitical history ofthemulti-ethnic state. The results resulted inanabrupt transition inpower from apredominately African regime for34 years. Thechange ishaving serious ramifications inthesociety and is manifesting itself indisguised political protest movements ledbyAfrican leaders atalmost every level ofthesociety.

Overview ofTheories Medical anthropology isthestudy ofhealth-related phenomena. These range from theindividual-level biological studies, such examining cultural differences onhypertension 1996). The fieldembraces many perspectives and fociofconcern. Anthropologists who study disease and health-related behavior inan ecological setting belong totheschool ofecological ofhealth anddisease phenomena. From theecological perspective, disease ecology focuses on the interaction between two organisms: thepathogen andthehost. Adherents ofthisparadigm have been such ofthemeans ofproduction, export ofcapital, extraction ofprofit, and racial (Singer 1989). The biological orbiocultural school ischaracterized byresearch on questions ofhuman biology and medical ecology asthey examine relationships among biological, environmental, andcultural factors (McElroy 1990). Central tobiocultural studies istheinterest inthebody\u2014 constraining factors byusing biological indicators asanthropometric blood pressure apparatus, etc.Ultimately, however, thegoal ofsuch research isto 42 illustrate how people indifferent environments, cultural groups, and societies respond toillness andcome toconfront theconstraints ontheir approach isthat have aligned themselves soclosely toa Western biomedical model disease thattheydonotquestion how political andeconomic factors maydetermine acommunity's health- behavior (Singer 1989). Medical anthropologists alsostudy biomedicine itself, exploring the ways inwhich itissocially, culturally, and historically constructed. The proponents oftheclinical and clinically applied anthropological theoretical approach havebeen criticized because oftheclinical settings inwhich they work, and therole they unwittingly perform insustaining thedominant political andeconomic system (Rhodes 1990). They focus onusing the concepts ofanthropology toexplain andsuggest changes forthehealth care system, and patients within thesystem. Some anthropologists take care of patients, but this activity occurs primarily because they alsohave clinical training asaphysician, nurse orcounselor likeToni Tripp-Reimer applied anthropology isseen asthe application of anthropological data, research methods, and theory toclinical matters (Chrisman andJohnson 1996) Medical anthropological studies have brought into focus global structures andpower relations, aswell ashegemonic ideologies that transcend geographic boundaries.

Critical anthropologists areovertly driven bypolitical motivation andtheyperceive science itself tobesuspect, being Idwell on,andmove from, close encounters with postnatal women and their interaction with informal health care providers tothelarger encompassing holism ofthepolitical-economic structure. The theoretical orientation toother schools islimited, because theyremain toorooted inthedirect interaction with their participants andcannot rise above theinsitu setting (Wolf 1982). Critical medical anthropologists are concerned with synthesizing themacrolevel understandings ofpolitical- economy with themicro-level sensitivity andawareness ofconventional They focus onsocially constructed units ofindividuals that have aneconomic and cultural commonalty, such asclasses, institutions, or nation-states, but stress thehierarchical nature ofgroup differentiation.

Revisions were done toensure that thequestions were clear, non-leading, relevant, and socio-culturally appropriate. Ibegan with simple socio- economic inquiries ofanon-intrusive nature and thenmoved intomore personal useofsecondary source materials such asinformational handouts, brochures, posters, local newspapers, periodicals, official documents andcensus reports.

Professional dominance is interpreted asinadequate communication ofinformation tothepatient, an apparent insensitivity togive information.

Qualitative literature onmaternal isalmost non-existent. Analysis ofavailable information forexample, show rates of26deaths per100,000 live births, while Haiti, Paraguay, Peruand Bolivia reveal death rates of230, 270, 303,and480per 100.000 respectively. Oftheapproximately 500,000 maternal deaths occurring intheworld each year, almost 99percent take place indeveloping countries. However, there hasbeen ageneral decline under fiveyears in Central countries such asBelize, Guyana, St.Kitts-Nevis andJamaica other poisonings, andchromosomal Infant deaths inthe postneonatal period arecaused most frequently bycongenital anomalies, pneumonia, accidents, and intestinal infections (PAHO/WHO 1994:416.). Of the528children under theageof15yearswho died inTrinidad were under one year, died because of perinatal problems (PSTT 1989:7). Neonatal deaths occur mainly because of maternal bleeding. Babies whose birth weight islessthan 2.5kg(51b8oz)are fivetimesmore likely todieasthosewhohave normal weight. According to United Nations data (cited inTG1990:6), about 23outofevery 1,000 children born inTrinidad andJamaica donot livepast their fifth birthday. Though thetwocountries have thelowest infant mortality rate intheregion, these deaths were caused bychildhood diseases thatcould have been prevented if theinfants were adequately immunized and otherwise protected (MOH 1996:7). The diseases that topthe listarediarrhea (caused mainly by gastroenteritis), acute respiratory infections, vaccine preventable diseases, and malnutrition. Again, Idonothave sufficient dataonperinatal deaths atMt.Hope Women's Hospital todetermine age, sex,educational and ethnic differences 81 Infant mortality (under 1year ofage per 1,000 live births) Source: U.S.Bureau oftheCensus, 1994. 82 onmothers inorder onthenumber andgender ofstill births. The datashow that still births comprise 17.7per 1,000 live births, with female fetuses dying ataslightly higher ratethan males. Inother developing countries, thisfinding supports thewidespread among elderly with arateof28.4 compared tothose with deaths Indian than African mothers. Inmyselected sample frame of336postnatal women, about eight percent ofthelive-birth infants ofIndian mothers haddied as compared tofivepercent African mothers. This ethnic difference canbe explained bythedemographic location and poverty-levels oftheIndian population. Most Indians live intherural areas oftheisland (Clarke 1986) which arecharacterized byfewer biomedical (21%)when finds thatIndian rates aregenerally higher intherural areas. Fertility Rates andTeenage Mothers Fertility levels inLatin America and theCaribbean have over thepasttwodecades, women have aslightly larger number ofchildren than their Indian counterparts. While African mothers have anaverage of 2.4children, Indian women average 2.3.This figure would beslightly larger than thepresent national average because the percentage oflow-income women atMt.Hope isover-represented. But generally, fertility levels havebeen declining over theyearsamong allethnic groups inTrinidad. Myfigures are, nevertheless, consistent with previous fertility rates calculated byothers. Inasurvey conducted in1990, forexample, Henry and Demas (1991:73) Indian women ofpast trends inwhich theywere bearing slightly more children than African counterparts. (1978) posits ethnic differences inmating patterns. National fertility surveys (e.g.Abdulah 84 1991) reveal that there arenosignificant ethnic differences inthe ideal number ofchildren women thought amother should have. The fertility rate inTrinidad increases dramatically inNovember- December, which isapproximately ninemonths after theannual Carnival frolic (Diptee 1991). Thegovernment census figures reveal that there is usually atwopercent increase inthebirth rate afteryoung drunken semi- nude revelers perform gyrating dances late into the night. The dramatic increase in\"Carnival babies\" continues tothisdaydespite atMt.Hope Women's Hospital reveal that of336postnatal women, 29(8.6%) Indians have given birth toatleastonechild foraman of African descent (Figure 4-3). This figure isalmost women, 12(3.6%) ofwhom have partner Inother the data indicate thatnearly twice asmany Indian women arecohabiting with African men ascompared with African women aremating with Indian men. The 8.6percent figure forIndian women would behigher than thenational estimate because myfigures aredrawn from dataonwomen living mainly in 85 Figure 4-3 Fertility rates ofwomen inracially-mixed unions (n=41). 86 interesting thatthe fertility rate ofIndian women inmixed sexual unions isconsiderably (2.6) than that African two children inaracially-mixed union when compared totheir Indian counterparts. Indian women, however, outnumber African women inallthe other number-of-children categories. Ifmycalculations itstillholds true thatmore dougla women are cohabiting with non-Indian men than non-Indian women with Indian men.10 There aresome other variables related tofertility levels which Asmaybeexpected, a1977survey (WFS 1981:8) revealed thatyounger women their older counterparts. There wasnodisparity inteenage ratesamong the different averaged 1.1children. Concurrently, common-law women hadahigher fertility level than married orvisiting women. Rural areas had asomewhat higher average than urban areas. Inthe1987 demographic andhealth survey, therewasasharp increase intheageatfirst birth (birth ofthe first child) forallethnic groups (Rampersad 1989:20). The sharpest increase occurred among Indian women, which could have been partly responsible fortheirlower fertility rateandhigher contraceptive use.A similar survey conducted in1990showed that the fertility ratewas slightly 87 higher inrural thanurban areas. Fertility differentials were alsoseenwhen educational background was considered; whereas women with less than completed primary education had four children onaverage, those with completed secondary certification had 2.3children (1990) government report (Tull under 20years oldinTrinidad is keeping abreast 1,000 statistic inLatin America (UN 1995:xviii). Based onaselected sample reveal thenumber ofAfrican descent and16(27%) were Indians. More than one-third of Indian teenage mothers were impregnated bynon-Indian men. This finding disputes theclaim Family organizations intheCaribbean areformed bysocio-economic as well asbyhistoric and ethnic factors. Three types ofunion have been recognized intheEnglish-speaking Caribbean. They arelegally registered marriages thecouple and hischildren. Union formation patterns inTrinidad areavery complex social and cultural phenomenon. The difference between the African andIndian families reflect, essentially, thepatriarchal forms ofthe Indians incontrast with thefemale-centered patterns oflower-class black women. African family life ischaracterized byhighly unstable sexual relationships, lowmarriage rates, high illegitimacy rates, andfemale-centered households which contain groups inbothcommon-law and visiting unions, identity arebased onmotherhood and notmarriage (Safa 1986).Among low-income African women, marriage more likely tocome long after their children havegrown up(Pulsipher 1993). Trinidad (andGuyana) co-residential countries ofmarriage among toa1990survey (Henry andDemas 1991:72), the population inco-residence isnearly alike among the three major ethnic /racial groups-- African, Indian andMixed. However, morewomen of 89 Indian descent tend tobeformally married (54%) rather than living together orvisiting (14%), while istrueamong women and43% inlessformal arrangements). Mydata,drawn from Mt.Hope Women's Hospital medical records JuneandSeptember, 1996, indicate that75percent ofIndian parturient women claim married. Does thismean thatthere isadramatic increase intherate of Indian (particularly Hindu) marriages inTrinidad since 1990? Probably not. What seems tobealikely explanation isthattheIndian/Hindu ofhaving achild outside ofwedlock haspressured many expectant mothers tochoose this socially and culturally sanctioned category ofmarital status. Theexpectant mother wants thechild toberegistered information (see achild \"legitimately\" and to return home totheir stable residential partners (husbands) after hospital discharge. While most researchers (e.g.WFS 1981) concur thatcommon-law and visiting unions play arelatively modest role inthemating patterns of women ofIndian origin, theyhave failed tobring their analysis tobearonthe various ethnic groups within theIndian community. Based onmy1996 Mt. Hope data, Ihavefound thatpostnatal Indian women who arenotinlegally registered unions aremore likely inreligion. About half(45%) of 90 theIndian areRoman Catholics arenotlegally married, and one-third (33%) ofother Christian Indians were also incommon-law or visiting relationships. These figures contrast with thesmall number of Hindu (21%) andMuslim (22%)women toremarry (ceremonially orofficially) inrecognition ofthecommunity's beliefs that a Hindu woman canmarry only once, and that aHindu bride should bea virgin.12Thereason why fewer Hindu andMuslim women bear children outside anofficially sanctioned union isthat there isthedeep-rooted taboo of illegitimacy within their respective religious /cultural traditions. Indiscussing theageofentry into initial marriage, Roberts andBraithwaite (1962:234) do, however, remark that \"thevery small number ofEast who Hospital, show ofAfrican andIndian women who cohabit withmen ofanother racewere formally married. African women were slightly more inclined tomarry their-Indian bedmates than their Indian counterparts (38%compared to33%). This isan indication that racially-mixed sexual unions are stillnot socially sanctioned inthepolitically and ethnically society ofTrinidad. One indication ofthis istheproportionally ofphotographs newspapers. Itseems that partners ofracially-mixed unions find ingetting tocome the\"unholy\" matrimony. Compared Christian Indian women are more likely toengage incommon-law and visiting unions aswell asin sexual relationships with non-Indian men. Clarke (1971:215) observes that, likeAfricans, andunlike Hindu orMuslim Indians, partners. Hestates thatchildren andceremonial accolades usually conferred upon thosewhomarry within their raceand African women ofchild-bearing ageinTrinidad aremore likely tobe involved incommon-law and their Indian counterparts (Harewood 1978:122; WFS 1981:8). Formal marriages, therefore, represent only aminority ofsexual unions among African women. theabsence oftheAfrican father inthefamily intheCaribbean has become such acommon feature that society itself sometimes takes for granted. Compared toIndian women, thechildbom toanAfrican woman is 92 more likely tobean\"outside ofanAfrican bed-mate. This child is considered \"illegitimate\" according tolegal union status, butalsobecause it was conceived (often covertly) byamanwho woman. minimal contact with Research (Bell 1970) inthelate1960s indicates thatAfrican fathers weremore involved in feeding, playing, holding, bathing, andchanging diapers than their Indian counterparts. The fact that Indian mothers expected their husbands to contribute more tothecare ofthechildren atthattime, reflected thattheyhad begun Green (1964:14) observes that inthe1960s while African mothers were more likely toleave their children inthecare ofothers, Indians were ever- present, protective andindulgent.

The extra attention and social support given topostnatal women inTrinidad precludes them from experiencing postpartum depression. Inallthecross-cultural situations outlined, however, men arenoticeably absent from thenetwork of individuals who assist during thisperiod ofconfinement. Much socialization ofhealth and illness behavior (i.e. definition of signsandsymptoms, patterns ofutilization, health practices, etc.), isacquired is absent inthenuclear family. Thesweeping social over thedecades have drastically altered theroleofelderly members ofthefamily, andhave shifted many functions tonon-family situations, theroleofgrandmothers isoften excluded ormarginalized (UN 1996). Ihave found that contact between thegrandmother and women is influential notonlyonthe(frequency of)useoftraditional medicine, butalso useordisuse ofmodem medicine. Like traditional masseuses, their beliefs and actions often function asameans ofcovert resistance against the knowledge ofbiomedical practitioners. The beliefs ofelderly grandmothers aresometimes challenged bytheir veryown adult children. Indian woman complained: These oldpeople don'tknowwhy theydothings. They don't have any logical reason why they tellyou todo things. They justdothings because their old-time friend did itortheirmother did it. 100 And thegrandmothers responded: These young people .. .when you tellthem something, they feelyoudon'tknow whatyoutalking about.

Despite their misgivings, nearly allofthepostnatal women comply, inone way ortheother, with theinstructions oftheir Pillsbury 1978). Grandmothers function notonly asconsultants and providers of medicine, but also asmediators between private, community and official modalities oftreatment. Thehigh rateofteenage intheCaribbean hasproduced some 35years oldwho are neither knowledgeable norable toassume the traditional grandmother role (Senior 1991). Howdopostnatal women inTrinidad select treatments among the various medical modalities which include self-medication, grand-mothers' assistance, masseuses, priests, anddoctors? Ihave found strong evidence to indicate thatwomen move backand various resources. specialist. These treatments include herbal remedies, boiled water, special foods andpharmaceutical products. Grandmother' treatment include allthe 101 interventions recommended oradministered bythe child's grandmother or anyolder adult female inthecommunity. Older family members, neighbors and friends arethemost frequently mentioned interpersonal source of information inthis classification (see alsoLitman 1979).

CHAPTER 5 TRADITIONAL MASSEUSES home and/or traditional health care givers riseuptofillthevoid. The services they provide arecomprehensive and include aspects of biomedicine aswell astraditional medicine itself. Intheir practice, masseuses inTrinidad1represent varying degrees oftraditionalism, acculturation and modernism (see alsoCosminsky 1982). One reason of masseuses persist tothisday istheir success insatisfying patients' physical, mental, psychological, emotional, spiritual and social needs. Thedecrease in both thenumber ofmidwives/ masseuses andpenetration ofEuro-American transmitted through education, religion, television, etc.(seeMiller 1994). Profile ofTraditional Masseuses Traditional masseuses inTrinidad belong totheolder group inthe society (defined here public andprivate policy-makers concerned with thequality oflifeforelderly people indeveloping over90years old. Itistrue haveempowered them tobecome workers rather than dependents, producers rather consumers, and caregivers rather than care recipients. Ofthe34masseuses Iinterviewed during thesummers of1994, 1995 and 1996, only four (12%) were non-Indians, mainly Africans. Thevast majority (88%) were Indian women oftheHindu religious denomination. Non-Indian masseuses were aspopular astheir Indian counterparts even among Hindu clientele. Ethnicity, therefore, isanimportant variable inthe profession ofmassaging, and itinfluences the (seealsoSargeant difference between theAfrican (orSpanish) andIndian massaging therapeutic repertoire istheuseofprayers and rituals which accompany thehealing process. Inthisrespect, non-Indian masseuses have become quite and the appropriation ofaHindu world view ofhealth and healing.

Hindu masseuses aresought more forperformance ofHindu rituals than thebodily manipulation itselfwhich compliments the massage. Hindu masseuses who treat Christian andMuslim women, avoid hurting their religious sensibilities byaborting the ritual aspects oftheir (masseuses') healing repertoire. Inkeeping with national statistical trends, education shows thewell- established, yet striking inverse relationship with theage ofmasseuses. Educational attainment issubstantially lower among theoldest agegroups completing education beyond primary school. Masseuses 65years andolder could neither read norwrite English, though most ofthem were bilingual inEnglish andHindi. They had little formal schooling andhadnever consulted anybookonthesubject ofhuman biology, not tomention obstetrics andgynecology. Generally, theAfrican masseuses went toschool foralonger period than their Indian counterparts. Uptothe1950s, Indian girlswere in theirnew role asgrandmothers, feelcaught inthenever- Ill ending reproductive spiral ofhousework and childcare.

From family models, masseuses learnt how to recognize and treatmany women and childhood complaints including culture-specific bodily dislocations likehassuli, nara, andboochet.

Relations with Others The attitude ofliving sexual partners ofthemasseuses toward their profession was investigated todraw conclusions ongender issues inthe private andpublic domains. Most ofthemasseuses (65%) disclosed that their husbands were either neutral orsupportive oftheirwork intreating patients who visited theirhomes, and thateven off-duty police officers visited her fortreatment. To avoid conflict with herhusband and allthehousework was satisfactorily completed, some husbands (and parents-in-law) insisted that their wives remain within their suspicious eyesight. African masseuses alsohad todevise strategies toresist their partners' control. had thatmidwifery andmassaging were \"dirty\" work.

Doctors seldom refer their patients toamasseuse ofother traditional healer asanalternative source ofhelp.

Later studies show thatmassage stimulates the release offood absorption hormones, which allows theinfants toextract more nutrients from their diet (Villano 1992:32). Themassaged infants weremore active and responsive during sleep/wake behavior observations, and sleptmore soundly. They also showed more mature habituation, orientation, motor activity, alertness and range ofstatebehaviors ontheBrazelton scale. Massaged infants alsoscored intensive care unit, producing acost ofapproximately US$3,000 per infant.

Apractical approach would betoinclude beneficial elements oftraditional medicine in theformulation ofnational health policies. self-care and thereliance methods oftherapy utilizes produced bymultinational corporations andsoldbypharmacists andeven privately-operating physicians themselves. Self-reliance should 229 utilization oflocal an opportunity information about sickness and health with biomedical personnel; (2)allowing their voices tobeheard indiscourses on policy implementation; over andmaterial resources. Rather thanempowering people byproviding them withmodem information, foreign technology, technical support, and decision-making possibilities, PAHO's recommendations would weaken people bydisregarding their traditional knowledge, beliefs and practices. Biomedical and anthropological researchers need todetermine which traditional thatare beneficial orpositive tohealth should be actively adopted inhealth education and practice. These practices include the consumption ofcertain protein-rich foods during pregnancy and the bymasseuses done tofirm the abdomen, tighten thepelvic floor muscles, stimulate blood circulation, and aidinthehealing ofsutured episiotomies. Sitzbathwith boiled saltwater is another traditional medical practice which hasfound favor with themedical community. Itisrecommended both asaprophylactic measure and asa 230 means toreduce therisk ofbacterial infection. Maternal and infant massage, andsun-walking ofthe infant, have been recommended bybiomedical researchers. Psycho-social and attention begiven tolaboratory and clinical tests toidentify thetherapeutic results ofselected medicinal plants, animal products, andmineral substances. IntheThird World where technological resources are limited, people should notbe\"educated\" todiscard their traditional therapeutic practices unless these measures have been proven to beabsolutely dangerous totheir health control andexpropriate thepower oflaypeople tohealthemselves and to shape theirownenvironment (Illich 1976). Harmless traditional practices which donothave any obvious ill effects, butwhich have positive psychological efficacy, should atleast be tolerated bybiomedical practitioners. These traditional practices mayinclude abstaining from cutting thehair until thechild can talk, orattaching an amulet tothenewborn's clothes toprevent the evil-eye. Non-invasive therapeutic measures which have positive psychological effects, such as meditation and prayers, also fall inthis category. Uncertain traditional practices, which canbedefined asthose with possible beneficial aswell as 231 harmful effects, canbeignored bythebiomedical community. This category may include theuseofcertain herbs. These customs, forwhich different interpretations are possible, should also beunopposed pending further observation and empirical study. Harmful traditional practices having deleterious effects, asfarashealth isconcerned, should bediscouraged. One example inthiscategory istheuseofaurinated Harmful practices should bethemain source ofconcern forMaternal and Child Health personnel and willrequire modification byfriendly persuasion andconvincing demonstration (Williams and Jelliffe 1978). International agencies, likePAHO, have noble ideas ofcommunity participation andeducation astwokeycomponents ofprimary health provision indeveloping countries. The rational forsuch proposal isthat \"communities must assume increasing responsibility fortheirown health, tothisendhealth willprovide thenecessary knowledge to enhance theconcept ofself-care\" (Carr members andhealth facilities or refurbished (seeHarry-Ashley care theyhavenoknowledge oftreating even minor ailments appropriately.

The main problem inharnessing thislocal resource, asaway ofsupplementing government 1978b), lieswithin thestate model. Theaim ofthegovernment should beto recognize useful elements inthe traditional medical system, and to incorporate these aspart ofitsnational health plan. The present public health system should make more useofexisting localandnatural resources\u2014 as isbeing done with therapeutic process ofself-medication. Myproposed model alsoadvocates the maximum useoftraditional healers and/or their therapeutic practices which would minimize the dependency onWestern medical services and medication (seeScheper-Hughes 1884).
