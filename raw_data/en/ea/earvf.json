Goldthread is used for digestive disorders, parasite infections including leishmaniasis, and trichomoniasis, and a skin condition called psoriasis. How does it work? Goldthread might decrease acid in the stomach. It also appears to have antibacterial effects.

Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate [(detailed description of each of the ratings).](#) [](https://www.rxlist.com/quiz_vitamins_and_supplements/quiz.htm) QUESTIONSee Answer Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Goldthread is UNSAFE during pregnancy. It contains a chemical called berberine that is thought to cross the placenta and may cause harm to the developing child. Brain damage due to too much bilirubin has developed in newborn infants exposed to berberine. Beginning research suggests pregnant women who take goldthread during the first three months of pregnancy increase the risk that their newborns will have birth defects affecting the central nervous system. It's also UNSAFE for breast-feeding mothers to take goldthread. Berberine and other harmful chemicals in goldthread can be transferred to the infant through breast milk. Cyclosporine ( [Neoral](https://www.rxlist.com/neoral-drug.htm), [Sandimmune](https://www.rxlist.com/sandimmune-drug.htm))Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider. The body breaks down cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) to get rid of it. Goldthread might decrease how fast the body breaks down cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune). This might cause there to be too much cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) in the body and potentially cause side effects. Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider. Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Goldthread might decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications. Taking goldthread along with some medications that are broken down by the liver can increase the effects and side effects of some medications. Before taking goldthread, talk to your healthcare provider if you are taking any medications that are changed by the liver. Some medications changed by the liver include The appropriate dose of goldthread depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for goldthread. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using.
