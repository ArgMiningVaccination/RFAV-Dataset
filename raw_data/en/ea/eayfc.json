She combines her innate abilities with years of in depth Ayurvedic training and experience to provide holistic healing. After a treatment with her, I always leave feeling she has taken me to a transcendental place that has healed me to my core and I'm ready to take on the world again. I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to experience these sessions with Shivani and encourage others to do the same. She will tailor the session with your individual needs in mind and heart and help bring you to a state of balance. ~Mindy | | "}
