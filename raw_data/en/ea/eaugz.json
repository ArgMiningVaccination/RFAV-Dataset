Not a place for discussion of illicit and illegal compounds. I understand from what I've read and what family has told me, too much magnesium or the wrong type for the person can cause diarrhea. I have megadosed (^ 2g several times a day) many types of magnesium (oxide, glycinate, citrate, threonate) and never experienced side-effects, not even diarrhea. I take it for chronic neck and back tension and I only experience benefits when I take what I think are absurdly high amounts - several grams a day. If you take really high doses like me and get no diarrhea from even citrate could that mean you're super degicient? Would you have to be super deficient to need to take almost 2 g three times a day for relief? This has been on my mind for a long time. I appreciate any guidance someone can share. "}
