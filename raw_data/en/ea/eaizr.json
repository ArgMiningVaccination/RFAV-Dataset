The lien shall dissolve in the event of the recipient's discharge from the medical institution and return home. Such dissolution of the lien does not discharge the underlying debt and the estate remains subject to recovery under estate recovery provisions in Subsections 025.14 through 025.30 of these rules. A request for release of the lien shall be directed to the Department of Health and Welfare, Estate Recovery Unit, Towers Building, Sixth Floor, P.O. Box 83720, 450 W.

(7-1-96) h. Shares of stocks, bonds and mutual funds to the be nefit of the deceased reci pient are assets of the estate. The current market value of all stocks, bonds and mutual funds must be proved as of the month preceding settlement of the estate claim. (7-1-96) 19. Value of Estate Assets . The Department shall use fair market va lue as the value of the estate assets. (7-1-96) 20. Limitations on Estate Claims . Limits on the Department's claim against the assets of a deceased recipient shall be subject to Sections 56-218 and 56-218 A, Idaho Code. A claim against the estate of a surviving spouse of a predeceased recipient is limited to the value of th e assets of the estate that were community property, or the deceased recipient's share of the separate property, and jointly owned property.

No recovery shall be made if the recipient received MA as the result of a crime committed against the recipient. (7-1-96) 21. Expenses Deducted From Estate . The following expenses shall be deducted from the available assets to determine the amount available to satisfy the Department's claim: (7-1-96)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 30 IAC 2006a. Burial expenses, which shall include only those reasonably necessary for embalming, transportation of the body, cremation, flowers, clothing, and services of the funeral director and staff shall be deducted.

A marriage settlement agreement or other such agreement which separates assets for a marrie d couple does not eliminate the debt against the estate of the deceased recipient or the spouse. Transfers under a ma rriage settlement agreement or other such agreement may be voided if not for adequate consideration. (7-1-96) 25. Release of Estate Claims . The Department shall release a claim when the Department's claim has been fully satisfied and may release its claim under the following conditions: (7-1-96) a.

When a written agreement with the authorized representative to pay the Department's claim in thirty-six (36) monthly payments or less has been achieved. (7-1-96) 26. Purpose of the Undue Hardship Exception . The undue hardship exception is intended to avoid the impoverishment of the deceased recipient's family due to the Department exercising its estate recovery right. The fact that family members anticipate or expect an inherita nce, or will be inconvenienced economically by the lack of an inheritance, is not cause for the Depart ment to declare an undue hardship. (7-1-96) 27. Application for Undue Hardship Waiver . An applicant for an undue hardship waiver must have a beneficial interest in the estate and must apply for the waiver within ninety (90) days of the death of the recipient or within thirty (30) days of receiving noti ce of the Department's claim, whichever is later.

Any beneficiary of the estate of a deceased recipient may apply for waiver of the estate recovery claim based on undue hardship. Any claim may be waived by the Department, partially or fully, because of undue hardship .

Providers also agree to provide all materials and services without unlawfully discriminating on the grounds of race, age, sex, creed, color, national origin, or physical or mental handicap. (3-22-93) 027. -- 029. (RESERVED). 030. THIRD PARTY LIABILITY. 01. Determining Liability of Third Parties .

In determining whether MA is payable, the Department is to treat any third party liability as a current resource when such liability is found to exist and payment by the third party has been made or will be made within a reasonable time. (11-10-81) 03. Withholding Payment . The Department must not withhold payment on behalf of an eligible MA recipient because of the liability of a third party when such liability, or the amount thereof, cannot be currently established or is not currently available to pay the recipient's medical expense.

The Department will seek reimbursement from a third party for MA when the party's liability is established after MA is granted, and in any other case in which the liability of a third party existed, but was not treated as a curren t resource, with the exceptions of EPSDT and EPSDT related services. (5-3-03) a. The Department will seek reimbursement for MA from a recipient when a recipient's liability is established after MA has been granted; and (11-10-81)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 32 IAC 2006b. In any other situation in which the recipient has received direct payment from any third party resource and has not returned the money to the Department for MA service received. (11-10-81) 05. Billing Third Parties First . Medicaid providers must bill all other sources of direct third party payment, with the exception of absent parent (court ordered) without secondary resources, prenatal, EPSDT and EPSDT related services before submitting the claim to the Department. If the resource is an absent parent (court ordered) and there are no other viable resources available or if the claims are for prenat al, EPSDT, or EPSDT related services, the claims will be paid and the resources billed by the Department. (2-4-91) 06. Accident Determination . When the patient's Medicaid card in dicates private insurance and/or when the diagnosis indicates an accident for which private in surance is often carried, the claim will be suspended or denied until it can be determined that there is no other source of payment. (11-10-81) 07. Third Party Payments in Excess of Medicaid Limits . The Department will not reimburse providers for services provided when the amount received by the provider from the third party payor is equal to or exceeds the level of reimbursement allowed by MA for the services. (11-10-81) 08. Subrogation of Third Party Liability . In all cases where the Department will be required to pay medical expenses for a recipient and that recipient is entitled to recover any or all such medical expenses from any third party, the Department will be subrogated to the rights of the recipient to the extent of the amount of medical assistance benefits paid by the Department as the result of the occurrence giving rise to the claim against the third party. (11-10-81) a. If litigation or a settlement in such a claim is pursued by the MA recipient, the recipient must notify the Department. (11-10-81) b. If the recipient recovers funds, either by settlement or judgment, from such a third party, the recipient must repay the amount of benefits paid by the Department on his behalf. (11-10-81) 09. Subrogation of Legal Fees .( 1 1 - 1 0 - 8 1 ) a. If an MA recipient incurs the obligation to pay attorney fees and court costs for the purpose of enforcing a monetary claim to which the Department is subrogated, the amount which the Department is entitled to recover, or any lesser amount which the Department may agree to accept in compromise of its claim, will be reduced by an amount which bears the same relation to the total amo unt of attorney fees and court costs actually paid by the recipient as the amount actually recovered by the Departme nt, exclusive of the reduction for attorney fees and court costs, bears to the total amount paid by the third party to the recipient. (11-10-81) b. If a settlement or judgment is received by the recipient which does not specify portion of the settlement or judgment which is for payment of medical expenses, it will be presumed that the settlement or judgment applies first to the medical expenses in curred by the recipient in an amount equa l to the expenditure for benefits paid by the Department as a result of the paym ent or payments to th e recipient. (11-10-81) 031. MEDICAID COST RECOVERY FROM PARENTS. The Department intends to recover from a child's parent, all or part of the cost of Medicaid services to the child in a Nursing Facility (NF), in an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR), in a Personal Care Services (PCS) provider's home under twenty-four (24) hour care, or under Home Care for Certain Disabled Children (HCCDC). The child must be under eighteen (18). Recovery is from the child's natural or adoptive parent. Recovery is made under Sections 32-1003, 56-203B, and 56-209b, Id aho Code. Upon application for Medicaid, the applicant assigns to the state of Idaho his rights to recover paymen ts for his medical expenses from any liable third party, including a parent.

No eligible child will be denied Medicaid services if a responsible parent fails to pay the assessment. Medicaid payments to providers will not be reduced if the parent fails to pay. (7-1-97)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 33 IAC 200601. Parent Gross Assessment Income . Parent gross assessment income is the parents' adjusted gross income as reported on the last calendar year's state inco me tax form 40 (Total Adjusted Income) or 40EZ (Adjusted Gross Income). Parents who did not reside in Idaho for the entire year must use the federa l income tax form 1040 or 1040A (Adjusted Gross Income). (7-1-97) a. Parents living together and filing separately must use their combined income from both individuals' tax returns. Where the child's parent lives with the child's stepparent, the amount on the line entitled \"Total Adjusted Income\" or \"Adjusted Gross Income\" on either tax form must be ad justed by subtracting the stepparent's income. (7-1-97) b. Parents who have not yet filed a tax return must provide an estimated adjusted gross income amount. The tax return must be provided to the Department when filed. (7-1-97) c. Parents who claim this year's income is substantia lly different from their previous adjusted gross federal or state income must provide proof of their actual income. (7-1-97) d. Parents whose adjusted gross income includes a substantial proportion of non-liquid earnings may petition for an adjustment to their gross assessment income. Such adjustment may be granted following a contested case hearing, at which the burden shall be upon the parent to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would be manifestly unfair to assess the full amount of the adjusted gross income. Any present adjustment to the gross assessment income shall include the recapture of any deferr ed amount at a time when the non-liquid portion of the parent's earnings are or become subject to liquidation. The am ount to be recaptured may be required to be secured by an appropriate instrument. (7-1-97) 02. Stepparent Income . Where the parent's spouse is the child's stepparent, the parent's community property interest in the stepparent's income is not income to the parent for calculating the parent's assessment income (AI). (7-6-94) 03. Two Parent Assessment . Where the child's parent s are living apart, each parent is separately assessed. The assessment of each parent is lowered, if neces sary, so the total assessment fo r the child is not more than the Medicaid payments made for the child during the assessment year. (7-6-94) 04. Family Size . Family size includes the child's natural, step, or adoptive parents if living in the home. Family size also includes natural and adoptive siblings if living in the same home. Family size does not include the child's step siblings. The Medicaid child under HCCDC is included if living in the home and is counted twice in the calculation of th e family size. (7-1-97) 05. Annual Assessment Calculation . The annual assessment is based on the AI and family size. Calculate the annual assessment following the steps in Subsections 031.05.a. through 031.05.d. The Third Party Recovery (TPR) unit calculates the assessment based on information provided by the parent. (7-1-97) a. Step 1. From the parent's AI, deduct all payments for court-ordered child support. (7-6-94) b. Step 2. From the AI, subtract two hundred percent (200%) of the Federal Poverty Guideline (FPG) for the family size. The FPG is published annually in the Federal Register by the federal Office of Management and Budget. The annual FPG change takes effect the following July for calculating the assessment. (7-6-94) c. Step 3. Multiply the result from Step 2, up to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), by ten percent (10%), between fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) and sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) by twelve percent (12%), between sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) and seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) by fourteen percent (14%), and multiply the remainder over seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) by fifteen percent (15%). (7-6-94) d. Step 4. Add together the results of each calculation in Step 3. Add the total to the amount calculated in Step 2. This is the annual assessment. (7-6-94) e. Step 5. From the amount in Step 4, deduct the annua l amount paid for health insurance premiums if IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 34 IAC 2006this insurance covers th e Medicaid child. (7-6-94) 06. Monthly Assessment Amount . The monthly assessment is determined by dividing the annual assessment calculated in Subsection 031.05 by twelve (12). Where the child is living in a nursing facility or ICF/MR and is not receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or other income, his thirty dollar ($30) personal needs allowance is deducted from the monthly assessment. (7-6-94) 07. Initial Assessment . The parent(s) will be identified by the Field Office when a child applies for or receives Medicaid help in the cost of NF or ICF/MR care or applies for HCCDC Medicaid or twenty-four (24) hour care in a PCS provider's home. The Field Office will provide this information to the TPR unit. (7-1-97) 08. TPR Contact . The TPR unit will notify the parent(s), in writing, of their legal responsibility to share in the cost of NF, ICF/MR, HCCDC, or other Medicaid services for the child. The notice will be sent within thirty (30) days of the date the child's Medicaid application is approved. Income and expense reporting forms will be provided to the parent(s). The parent can provide his IRS income tax forms for the previous year in place of an income report. (7-1-97) 09. Noncooperation . A monthly assessment equal to the aver age Medicaid reimbursement rate for the child's level of care, as published by the Department for the previous year, is used if a parent fails to provide income information; provides false or mislead ing statements; misrepresents, conceals or withholds facts to avoid financial responsibility. (7-6-94) 10. Notice of Assessment Amount and Hearing Rights . The TPR unit sends the parent(s) written notice of the assessment amount within ten (10) days of the date the assessment is calculated, and notice of the parent's right to a hearing in accordance with Subsection 031.20 of these rules. The notice shall include the following information: (7-1-97) a. The notice shall inform the parent of the amount calculated as the monthly assessment. (7-1-97) b. The notice shall inform the parent that he or sh e may request a hearing to contest the Department's calculation of the assessment amount. The notice shall incl ude information that a pre-hearing conference may be scheduled prior to a hearing. The notice shall include the time limits and instructions for requesting a hearing. (7-1-97) c. The notice shall inform the parent that if he or she does not request a hearing within the time limits TPR Unit will be used. (7-1-97) d. The notice shall inform the parent that only a pa rent who owes an assessment amount may request a hearing. (7-1-97) 11. Assessment Year . The first assessment year is the twelve (12) month period beginning with the effective month of the child's eligibility for Medicaid. Subsequent assessment years are twelve (12) month periods beginning the same calendar month as the first assessment year began. (7-1-97) 12. Assessment Limit . The total assessment for an assessment year will not exceed the Medicaid payments made for the child for the assessment year. (7-6-94) 13. Interim Adjustments . The assessment amount can be adjusted up to four (4) times during an assessment year, if the parent asks for recalculation, based on lower AI. The parent must prove his AI is lower than income used for the yearly assessme nt. Recalculation is not automatic when the assessment formula changes in January. (7-6-94) 14. Annual Adjustment . The AI is recalculated yearly in the same month as the initial assessment. The assessment is adjusted, if necessary. The parent must be sent a notice of the adjusted assessment. The parent can request an adjustment of the yearly assessment. The parent must provide a copy of his federal or state tax filing for that calendar year or other proof of annual income. The annu al income is compared to the parent's AI for that tax year. If the AI is less than the AI used to calculate the assessment, the assessment is adjusted. (7-1-97)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 35 IAC 200615. Annual Reconciliation . The parent's assessment and the Medicaid cost excluding services provided by school districts or developmental disability centers for the child are reconciled at assessment year end. If the parent paid more than the Medicaid cost for the child, a credit is issued . If the child is no longer a Medicaid recipient, a refund is issued. Where a parent has more than one (1) child whose Medicaid costs are subject to recovery, the monthly assessment will be divided by the number of children whose costs are subject to recovery. Each child's prorated share of the assessment is then compared to the Medicaid costs for that child to determine whether a refund will be issued. No reconciliation is required where the difference between the projected AI and actual income for the tax year is a minimum of three thousand dollars ($3,000) or ten percent (10%) of annual AI, whichever is more. (7-6-94) 16. Annual Support Deduction Reconciliation . Where the parent paid more child support than was deducted, he is entitled to a credit or refund, if he so chooses. If the child is no longer a recipient of NF, ICF/MR, twenty-four (24) hour care in a PCS provider's home or HCCDC Medicaid, the parent is entitled to a refund of the amount he overpaid. (7-1-97) 17. Payment Schedule . The parent may pay his annual assessment in four (4) payments yearly, for services already paid or projected to be paid by Medicai d. The parent may negotiate a different payment schedule with the TPR Unit. (7-6-94) 18. Enforcement . Failure of a responsible parent to pay the assessment will be referred to the Office of the Attorney General for initiation of collection proceedings and appropriat e legal action, including civil suit, garnishment, attachment, and any othe r legal process to accomplish the purpose of Sections 32-1003, 56-203B and 56-209b, Idaho Code. Collection will be enforced by the Bureau of Child Support Services (BCSS). (7-1-97) 19. Out-of-State Parents . Responsible parents living out-of-state will be contacted and assessed to the same extent as Idaho residents. The Department may enter into reciprocity of enforcem ent agreements with states with similar provisions. (7-6-94) 20. Administrative Appeals . Hearings to contest the Department's calculation of the assessment amount shall be governed by the hearing provisions of IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings\".

A hospital may request a continued stay review from the Department or its design ee when the appropriate care of the recipient indicates the need for hospital days in excess of the originally approved number. The continued stay review request may be made no later than the date authorized by the Department or its designee. Approval of additional days will be based on the following criteria: (3-30-01) a. Documentation sufficient to demonstrate the medical necessity criteria is still met; and (3-30-01) b. A plan of care that includes documentation suffic ient to demonstrate that the child's psychiatric condition continues to require services which can only be provided on an in-patient basis, including twenty-four (24) hour nursing observation, under the direction of a psychiatrist or other physician qualified to treat mental disease; and (3-30-01)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 49 IAC 2006c.

(10-24-88) i. Nursing care, physician's services, medical so cial services, and counseling are core hospice services and must be routinely provided by hospice employees. Supplemental core services may be contracted for during periods of peak patient loads and to obtain physician specialty services. (10-24-88) 09. Hospice Reimbursement--General . With the exception of payment for physician services (see Subsection 104.11), Medicaid reimbursement for hospice care will be made at one (1) of four (4) predetermined rates for each day in which an individual receives the respective ty pe and intensity of the services furnished under the care of the hospice. The four (4) rates are prospective rates; there will be no retroactive rate adjustments other than the application of the \"cap\" on overall payments and the limitati on on payments for inpatient care, if applicable. (7-1-94) a. A description of the payment for each le vel of care is as follows: (10-24-88) i. Routine home care. The hospice will be paid the routine home care rate for each day the patient is in residence, under the care of the hospice, and not receiving continuous home care. This rate is paid without regard to the volume or intensity of routine home care services provided on any given day. (10-24-88) ii. Continuous home care. Continuous home care is to be provided only during a period of crisis. A period of crisis is a period in which a patient requires continuous care which is primarily nursing care to achieve palliation and management of acute medical symptoms. Care must be provided by either a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse and a nurse must provide care for at least half the total period of care. A minimum of eight (8) hours of care must be provided during a twenty-four (24) hour day which begins and ends at midnight. This care need not be continuous and uninterrupted. If less skilled care is needed on a continuous basis to enable the person to remain at home, this is covered as routine home care. For every hour or part of an hour of continuous care furnished, the hourly rate will be reimbursed to the hospice up to twenty-four (24) hours per day. (10-24-88) iii. Inpatient respite care. The hospice will be paid at the inpatient respite care rate for each day that the recipient is in an approved inpatient f acility and is receiving respite care. Payment for respite care may be made for a maximum of five (5) days at a time including the date of admission but not counting the date of discharge in any monthly election period. Payment for the sixth and any subseque nt day is to be made at the appropriate rate routine, continuous, or general inpatient rate. (10-24-88) iv. General inpatient care. Payment at the inpatient rate will be made when general inpatient care is provided. No other fixed payment rates will be applicable for a day on which the recipient receives hospice general inpatient care except as describe d in Subsection 104.11. (7-1-94) b. Date of discharge. For the day of discharge from an inpatient unit, the appropriate home care rate is to be paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. When th e patient is discharged as deceased, the inpatient rate, either general or respite, is to be paid for the discharge date. (10-24-88) c. Hospice payment rates. The Medicaid hospice paym ent rates are the same as the Medicare hospice rates, adjusted to disregard cost offsets attributable to Medicare coinsurance amount s. Under the Medicaid hospice benefit, no cost sharing may be imposed with respect to hospice services rendered to Medicaid recipients. (10-24-88) d. Obligation of continuing care. After the recipient's hospice benefit expires, the patient's Medicaid hospice benefits do not expire. The hospice must continue to provide that recipient's care until the patient expires or IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 64 IAC 2006until the recipient revokes the election of hospice care. (10-24-88) 10. Limitation on Payments for Inpatient Care . Payments to a hospice for inpatient care must be limited according to the number of days of inpatient care fu rnished to Medicaid patients. During the twelve (12) month period beginning N ovember 1 of each year and ending October 31 of the next year, the aggregate number of inpatient days (both general inpatient days and inpatient respite care) may not exceed tw enty percent (20%) of the total number of days of hospice care provided to all Medicaid recipients during the same period by the designated hospice or its contracted agent(s). (10-24-88) a. For purposes of computation, if it is determined that the inpatient rate should not be paid, any days for which the hospice receives payment at a home care rate will not be counted as inpatient days. The limitations on payment for inpatient days are as follows: (10-24-88) i. The maximum number of allowable inpatient days will be calculated by multiplying the total number of a provider's Medicaid hospice days by twenty percent (20%). (10-24-88) ii. If the total number of days of inpatient care to Medicaid hospice patients is less than or equal to the maximum number of inpatient days computed in Subsection 104.10.a., then no adjustment is made. (7-1-94) iii. If the total number of days of inpatient care exceeds the maximum number of allowable inpatient days computed in Subsection 104.10.a., then the payment limitation will be determined by: (7-1-94) (1) Calculating the ratio of the maximum allowable inpatient days to the number of actual days of inpatient care, and multiplying this ratio by the total reimbursement for inpatient care that was made. (10-24-88) (2) Multiplying excess inpatient care days by the routine home care rate. (10-24-88) (3) Adding the amounts calculated in Subsections 104.10.a.iii.(1) and 104.10.a.ii.(2). (10-24-88) (4) Comparing the amount in Subsection 104.10.a.iii.(3) with interim payments made to the hospice for inpatient care during the \"cap period\". (10-24-88) b. The amount by which interim payments for inpa tient care exceeds the amount calculated as in Subsection 104.10.a.iii.(4) is due from the hospice. (7-1-94) 11. Payment for Physician Services . The basic rates for hospice care represent full reimbursement to the hospice for the costs of all covered services related to the treatment of the recipient's terminal illness, including the administrative and general activities performed by physicians who are employees of or working under arrangements made with the hospice. These activities would generally be performed by the physician serving as the medical director and the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group. Group activities include participation in the establishment of plans of care, superv ision of care and services, periodic review and updating of plans of care, and establishment of governing policies. The costs for these services are included in the reimbursement rates for routine home care, continuous home care, and inpatient respite care. (10-24-88) a. Reimbursement for a hospice employed physician's direct patient services which are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with th e usual Idaho Medicaid reim bursement methodology for physician services. These services will be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and, the related payments will be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Subsection 104.12 has been exceeded. The only physician services to be billed by a hosp ice for such services are direct patient care services. Laboratory and X-ray services are included in the hospice daily rate. (7-1-94) b. V olunteer physician services are excluded from Medicaid reimbursement with the following exceptions: (10-24-88) i. A hospice may be reimbursed on behalf of a vo lunteer physician for specific direct patient care services which are not rendered on a volunteer basis. The hospice must have a liability to reimburse the physician for those services rendered. In determining whether a service is provided on a volunteer basis, a physician must not IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 65 IAC 2006distinguish which services are provided voluntarily on the basis of the patient's ability to pay. (10-24-88) ii. Reimbursement for an independent physician's direct patient services which are not rendered by a hospice volunteer is made in accordance with the usual Idaho Medicaid reimbursement methodology for physician services. These services will not be billed by the hospice under the hospice provider number and they will not be counted in determining whether the overall hospice cap amount per Subsection 104.12 has been exceeded. The only services to be billed by an attending physician are the phys ician's personal professional services. Costs for services such as laboratory or X-rays are not to be included on the attending physician's billed charges to the Medicaid program. The aforementioned charges are included in the daily rates paid and are expressly the responsibility of the hospice. (7-1-94) 12. Cap on Overall Reimbursement . Aggregate payments to each hospice will be limited during a hospice cap period per Subsection 104.01. e. The total payments made for servi ces furnished to Medicaid recipients during this period will be compared to the \"cap amount\" for this period. Any payments in excess of the cap must be refunded by the hospice. (7-1-94) a. The overall cap will be compared to reimbursement after the inpatient limitation is computed and subtracted from total reimbursement due the hospice. (10-24-88) b. \"Total payment made for services furnished to Me dicaid recipients during this period\" means all payments for services rendered during the cap year, re gardless of when payment is actually made. (10-24-88) c. The \"cap amount\" is calculated by multiplying the number of recipients electing certified hospice care during the period by six thousand five hundred do llars ($6,500). This amount will be adjusted for each subsequent cap year beginning November 1, 1983, to refl ect the percentage increase or decrease in the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It will also be adjusted as per Subsection 104.13. (7-1-94) d. The computation and application of the \"cap amount\" is made by the Department after the end of the cap period. (10-24-88) e. The hospice will report the number of Medicaid recipients electing hospice care during the period to the Department. This must be done within thirty (30) days after the end of the cap period as follows: (10-24-88) i. If the recipient is transferred to a noncertified hospice no payment to the noncertified hospice will be made and the certified hospice may count a complete recipient benefit period in their cap amount. (10-24-88) f. If a hospice certifies in mid-month, a weighted average cap amount based on the number of days falling within each cap period would be used. (10-24-88) 13. Adjustment of the Overall Cap . Cap amounts in each hospice's cap period will be adjusted to reflect changes in the cap periods and designated hospices during a recipient's election period. The proportion of each hospice's days of service to the total number of hospice days rendered to the recipient du ring their election period will be multiplied by the cap amount to determine each hospice's adjusted cap amount. (6-23-89) a. After each cap period has ended, the Department wi ll calculate the overall cap within a reasonable time for each hospice participating in the Idaho Medicaid Program. (10-24-88) b. Each hospice's cap amount will be computed as follows: (10-24-88) i. The share of the \"cap amount\" that each hospice is allowed will be based on the proportion of total covered days provided by each hospice in the \"cap period\". (6-23-89) ii. The proportion determined in Subsection 104.13.b. for each certified hospice will be multiplied by the \"cap amount\" specified for the \"cap period\" in which the recipient first elected hospice. (7-1-94) c. The recipient must file an initial election during the period beginning September 28 of the previous IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 66 IAC 2006year through September 27 of the curren t cap year in order to be counted as an electing Medicaid recipient during the current cap year. (6-23-89) 14. Additional Amount for NF Residents . An additional per diem amount will be paid for \"room and board\" of hospice residents in a certified NF receiving routin e or continuous care services. In this context, the term \"room and board\" includes, but is not limited to, all assistance in the activities of daily living, in socializing activities, administration of medication, maintaining the cleanliness of a resident's room, and supervision and assisting in the use of durable medical equipment and prescribed therapies. The additional payments and the related days are not subject to the caps specified in Subsections 104.10 and 104.12. The room and board rate will be ninety-five percent (95%) of the per diem interim reimbursement rate assigned to the facility for those dates of service on which the recipient was a resident of that facility. (7-1-94) 15. Post Eligibility Treatment of Income . Where an individual is determined eligible for MA participation in the cost of long term care, the Departme nt must reduce its payments for all costs of the hospice benefit, including the supplementary amounts for room and board, by an amount determined according to Subsection 160.03 of this rule. (7-1-97) 105. HOME HEALTH SERVICES. 01. Care and Services Provided .

In order to participate as a Home Health Agency (HHA) provider for Medicaid eligible persons, the provider must be licensed as re quired by the state, and be certified to participate in the Medicare Program. Loss of either state license or Medicar e Program certification will be cause for termination of Medicaid provider status. (7-15-87) 03. Payment Procedures . Payment for home health services will be limited to the services authorized in Subsection 105.01 and must not exceed the lesser of reas onable cost as determined by Medicare or the Title XIX percentile cap. (12-31-91) a. For visits performed in the first state fiscal year for which this subsection is in effect, the Title XIX percentile cap will be established at the seventy fifth percentile of the ranked costs per visit as determined by the Department using the data from the most recent finalized Medicare cost reports on hand in the Bureau on June 1, 1987. Thereafter the percentile cap will be revised annually, effective at the beginning of each state fiscal year. Revisions will be made using the data from the most recent finalized Medicare cost reports on hand thirty (30) days prior to the effective date. (8-1-92) b. When determining reasonable costs of rented medical equipment ordered by a physician and used for the care of the patient the total rental cost of a Durable Medical Equipment (DME) item shall not exceed one- twelfth (1/12) of the total purchase price of the item. A minimum rental rate of fifteen dollars ($15) per month is allowed on all DME items. (5-1-92) c. The Department may enter into lease/purchase ag reements with providers in order to purchase medical equipment when the rental charges tota l the purchase price of the equipment.

(11-10-81) 106. DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES. The Department will purchase or rent, when medically necessary, reasonable, and cost effective, durable medical equipment (DME) and medical supplies for participants residing in community settings including those provided through home health agency plans of care which meet the requirements found in Subsections 105.01 and 105.02. No payment will be made for any participant's DME or medical supplies that are included in the per diem payment while such an individual is an inpatient in a hospital NF, or ICF/MR. The participant has a responsibility to reasonably protect and preserve equipment issued to him. Replacement of medical equipmen t or supplies that are lost, damaged or broken due to participant misuse/abuse are the responsibility of the participant. When multiple features, models or brands of equipment or supplies are available, coverage will be limited to the least costly version that will reasonably and effectively meet the minimum requirements of the individual's medical needs. (3-15-02) 01. Medical Necessity Criteria . Department standards for medical necessity are those national standards set by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servi ces (CMS) in Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carrier Supplier Manual, hereafter referred to as DMERC. Exceptions to Medicare coverage are contained in this Section of these rules. DME/medical supplies will be purchased or re nted only if ordered in writing (signed and dated) by a physician as listed in DMERC. Date of delivery is considered the date of service.

If such condition exists, and treatment is required at the recipien t's location, or transport of the recipient for treatment in another location by ambulance is the only appropriate mode of travel, the Depart ment will review such claims and consider authorization for emergency ambulance services. If an emergency does not exist, prior written authorization to transport by ambulance must be secured from the Department or its desi gnee. For purposes of reimbursement, in non-emergency situations, the provider must provide justification to the Department or its designee that travel by ambulance is medically necessary due to the medical condition of the recipient, and that any other mode of travel would, by reasonable medical judgement of the Department or its designee, result in death, serious impairment of a bodily function or major organ, and/or serious jeopardy to the overall health of the recipient.

In situations where personnel and equipment from a licensed ALSI provider boards an ALSII or BLS ambulance, the transporting ambulance may bill for ALSI services as authorized by the Department or its designee. In situations where medical personnel and equipment from a medical facility are present during the transport of the recipient, the transporting ambulance may bill at the ALSI or ALSII level of service. The transporting provider must arra nge to pay the other provider for their services. The only exception to the preceding policy is in situations where medical personnel employed by a licensed air ambulance provider boards an ALSI, ALSII, or BLS ground ambulance at some point, and the air ambulance medical personnel also accompany and treat the recipient during the air ambulance trip. In this situation, the air ambulance provider may bill the appropriate base rate for the air ambulance trip, an d may also bill the charges as sociated with their medical personnel and equipment as authorized by the Department or its designee.

The Department will reimburse the appropriate base rate. This service requires authorization from the Department or its designee, usually on a retrospective basis. (4-6-05) j. If an ambulance vehicle and crew have returned to a base station after having transported a recipient to a facility and the recipient's physician orders the recipient to be transferred from this facility to another facility because of medical need, two (2) base rate charges, in addition to the mileage, will be considered for reimbursement. If an ambulance vehicle and crew do not return to a base station and the patient is transferred from one (1) facility to another facility, charges for only one (1) base rate, waiting time, and mileage will be considered. (7-1-98) k. Round trip charges will be allowed only in circumstances when a facility in-patient is transported to another facility to obtain specialized services not available in the facility in which the recipient is an in-patient. The transport must be to and from a facility that is the nearest one with the specialized services. (7-1-98) l. If a licensed transporting EMS provider responds to a recipient's location and upon examination and evaluation of the recipient, finds that his condition is such that no treatment or transport is necessary, the Department will pay for the response and evaluation service. This service requires authorization by the Department or its designee, usually on a retrospective basis. No payment will be made if the EMS provider responds and no evaluation is done, or the recipient has left the scene. No payment will be made to an EMS provider who is licensed as a non-transporting provider. (4-6-05) m.

All medical supplies including but not limited to gauzes, bandages, tapes, compresses, cottons, sponges, hot water bags, ice bags, disposable syringes, thermometers, cellucotton or any other type of pads used to save labor or linen, and rubber gloves; and (1-16-80) xii. Social and recreational activities; and (1-16-80)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 119 IAC 2006xiii. Items which are utilized by individual patients but which are reuseable and expected to be available, such as bed rails, canes, crutches, walkers, wh eel chairs, traction equipment, and other durable medical equipment. (11-10-81) b. Intermediate Care-Mentally Retarded. The minimum content of care and services for ICF/MR must include the services identified in Subsection 160.01.a. and Subsection 180.08, and social and recreational activities. DHW authorized purchases of specialized wheelchair and seating systems, and an y authorized repairs related to the seating system, which are paid to a medical vendor directly by DHW will not be included in the content of care of ICFs/MR. The specialized wheelchairs and seating systems must be designed to fit the needs of a specific ICF/MR resident and cannot be altered to fit another client cost effectively. (7-1-99) c. Direct Care Staff. Direct Care staff in an ICF/MR are defined as the present on-duty staff calculated over all shifts in a twenty-four (24) hour period for each de fined residential living unit. Direct care staff in an ICF/MR include those employees whose primary du ties include the provision of hands-on, face-to-face contact with the clients of the facility. This includes both regular and live-in/sleep-over staff. It excludes professionals such as psychologists, nurses, and others whose primary job duties are not the provision of direct care, as well as managers/ supervisors who are responsible for the supervision of staff. (5-25-93) d. Level of Involvement. Level of involvement relates to the severity of an MA recipient's mental retardation. Those levels, in decreasing level of severity, are: profound, severe, moderate, and mild. (5-25-93) e. Direct Care Staffing Levels. The reasonable leve l of direct care staffing provided to an MA recipient in an ICF/MR setting will be dependent upon the level of involvement and the need for services and supports of the recipient as determined by the Department, or its representative, and will be subject to the following constraints: (7-1-94) i. Direct care staffing for a severely and profoundly retarded recipient residing in an ICF/MR must be a maximum of sixty-eight point twenty five (68.25) hours per week. (5-25-93) ii. Direct care staffing for a moderately retarded recipient residing in an ICF/MR must be limited to a maximum of fifty-four point six (54.6) hours per week. (5-25-93) iii. Direct care staffing for a mildly retarded recipient residing in an ICF/MR must be limited to a maximum of thirty four point one two five (34.125) hours per week. (5-25-93) f. The annual sum total level of allowable direct care staff hours for each residential living unit will be determined in the aggregate as the su m total of the level of staffing allowa ble for each resident residing in that residential living unit as determined in Subsection 160.01.e. (5-25-93) g. Phase-in Period. If enactment of Subsection 160.01.e. requires a facility to reduce its level of direct care staffing, a six (6) month phase-in period will be allowed from the date of the enactment of this section, without any resulting disallowances. Should disallowances result, the hourly rate of direct care staff used in determining disallowances will be the weighted average of the hourly rates paid to a facility's direct care staff, plus the associated benefits, at the end of the phase-in period. (5-25-93) h. Exceptions. Should a provider be able to show convincing evidence docum enting that the annual aggregate direct care hours as allowed under this section will compromise their ability to supply adequate care to the clients, as required by federal regulations and state rules, within an ICF/MR residential living unit and that other less costly options would not alleviate the situation, the Depart ment will approve an additional amount of direct care hours sufficient to meet the extraordin ary needs. This adjustment will only be available up through September 30, 1996. (7-1-99) 02. Conditions of Payment . (2-25-93) a. As a condition of payment by the Department for lo ng-term care on behalf of MA recipients, each fully licensed long-term care facility is to be under the supervision of an administrator who is currently licensed under IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 120 IAC 2006the laws of the state of Idaho and in accordance with the rules of the Bur eau of Occupational Licenses. (5-25-93) b. Nursing facilities and ICF/MR facilities will be reimbursed in accordance with Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Rules Governing Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho\". (5-25-93) 03. Post-Eligibility Treatment of Income . Where an individual is determined eligible for MA participation in the cost of his long term care, the Department must reduce its payment to the long term care facility by the amount of his income considered available to meet the cost of his care. This determination is made in accordance with Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.05, Section 585, \"Rules Governing Eligibility for Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)\". (5-25-93) a. The amount which the MA recipient receives from SSA as reimbursement for his payment of the premium for Part B of Title XVIII (Medicare) is not considered income for patient liability (see Subsection 165.02 and Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.05, Subsection 522.02.c., \"Rules Governing Eligibility for Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)\". (5-25-93) b. Payment by the Department for the cost of long te rm care is to include the date of the recipient's discharge only if the discharge occurred after 3 p.m. an d is not discharged to a related ICF/MR provider. If a Medicaid patient dies in a nursing home, his date of death is covered regardless of the time of occurrence. If an admission and a discharge occur on the same date, then one (1) day of care shall be deemed to exist. (7-1-99) 04. Payments for Periods of Temporary Absence . Payments may be made for reserving beds in long- term care facilities for recipients during their temporary absence if the facility charges private paying patients for reserve bed days, subject to the following limitations: (10-22-93) a. Facility Occupancy Limits. Payment for period s of temporary absence from long term care facilities will not be made when the number of unoccupied beds in the facility on the day preceding the period of temporary absence in question is equal to or greater than the larger of: (4-6-83) i. Five (5) beds; or (4-6-83) ii. Five percent (5%) of the total number of licensed beds in the facility. (4-6-83) b. Time Limits. Payments for periods of temporary absence from long term care facilities will be made for: (4-6-83) i. Therapeutic home visits for other than ICF/MR residents of up to three (3) days per visit and not to exceed a total of fifteen (15) days per calendar year so long as the days are part of a treatment plan ordered by the attending physician. (7-1-99) ii. Therapeutic home visits for ICF/MR residents of up to thirty-six (36) days per calendar year so long as the days are part of a written treatment plan ordered by the attending physician. Prior approval from the RMU must be obtained for any home visits exceeding fourteen (14) consecutive days. (7-1-99) c. Limits on Amount of Payments. Payment for reserve bed days will be the lesser of the following: (4-6-83) i. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the audited allowable costs of the facility unless the facility serves only ICF/MR residents, in which case the payment will be one hundred percent (100%) of the audited allowable costs of the facility; or (12-22-88) ii. The rate charged to private paying patients for reserve bed days. (4-6-83)05. Payment Procedures . Each long term care facility must submit its claims to the Department in accordance with the procedures established by the Department. The Department will not pay for a claim in behalf of a MA recipient unless the information on the claim is consis tent with the information in the Department's computer IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 121 IAC 2006eligibility file. (11-10-81) 06. Long-Term Care Facility Responsibilities . In addition to the responsibilities set forth in Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Rules Governing Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho,\" each long term care facility administrator, or his authorized representative, must report: (7-1-94) a. The following information to the appropriate Field Office within three (3) working days of the date the facility has knowledge of: (7-13-89) i. Any readmission or discharge of a recipient, and any temporary absence of a recipient due to hospitalization or therapeutic home visit; and (7-13-89) ii. Any changes in the amount of a recipient's income; and (1-16-80) iii. When a recipient's account has exceeded one thousand eight hundred dollars ($1800) for a single individual or two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800) for a married couple; and (7-1-99) iv. Other information about a recipient's finances which potentially may affect eligibility for MA. (11-10-81) b. PASARR. All Medicaid certified nursing facilities must participate in, cooperate with, and meet all requirements imposed by, the Preadmission Screening and Additional Resident Review program (hereafter \"PASARR\") as set forth in 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart C, which, pursuant to Idaho Code Section 67-5229, is incorporated by reference herein. (7-1-98) i. Background and purpose. The purpose of these pr ovisions is to comply with and implement the PASARR requirements imposed on the state by federal law. The purpose of those requirements is to prevent the placement of individuals with mental illness (MI) or mental retardation (MR) in a nursing facility (NF) unless their medical needs clearly indicate that they require the level of care provided by a nursing facility. This is accomplished by both pre-admission screening (PAS) and additional resident review (ARR). Individuals for whom it appears that a diagnosis of MI or MR is likely are identified for furthe r screening by means of a Level I screen. The actual PASARR is accomplished through a Level II screen where it is dete rmined whether, because of the individual's physical and mental condition, he or she requires the level of services provided by an NF. If the individual with MI or MR is determined to require an NF level of care, it must also be determined whether the i ndividual requires specialized services. PASARR applies to all indivi duals entering or residing in an NF, regardless of payment source. (7-1-98) ii. Policy. It is the policy of the Department that the difficulty in providing specialized services in the NF setting makes it generally inappropriate to place individua ls needing specialized services in an NF. This policy is supported by the background and development of the federal PASARR requirements, including the narrow definition of MI adopted by federal law. While recognizing that th ere are exceptions, it is envisioned that most individuals appropriate for NF placement will not require services in excess of those required to be provided by NFs by 42 CFR 483.45. (11-6-93) iii. Inter-agency agreement. The state Medicaid agency will enter into a written agreement with the state mental health and mental retarda tion authorities as required in 42 CFR 431.621(c). This agreement will, among other things, set forth respective duties and delegation of responsibilities, and any supplemental criteria to be used in making determinations. (11-6-93) (1) The \"State Mental Health Authority\" (hereafter \"SMHA\") is the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (11-6-93) (2) The \"State Mental Retardation or Developmental Disabilities Authority\" (hereafter \"SDDA\") is the Division of Family and Community Services of the Department, or its successor entity. (11-6-93) iv. Coordination. The PASARR process is a coordina ted effort between the state Medicaid agency, the SMHA and SDDA, independent evaluators and NFs. PASARR activities, to the extent possible, will be coordinated through the Regional Medicaid Units (RMUs). RMUs will al so be responsible for record retention and tracking IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 122 IAC 2006functions. However, NFs are responsible for assuring that all screens are obtained and for coordination with the RMU, independent MI evaluators, the SMHA and SDDA, a nd their designees. Guidelines and procedures on how to comply with these requirements can be found in \"Statewide PASARR Procedures\", a reference guide. (11-6-93) (1) Level I Screens. All required Level I reviews must be completed and submitted to the RMU, prior to admission to the facility. (11-6-93) (2) Level II Screens. When a NF identifies an indivi dual with MI and/or MR through a Level I screen, or otherwise, the NF is responsible for contacting the SMHA or SDDA (as appropriate), or its designee, and assuring that a level II screen is completed prior to admission to the facility, or in the case of an existing resident, completed in order to continue residing in the facility. (11-6-93) (3) Additional Resident Reviews (ARR). An individual identified with MI and/or MR must be reviewed and a new determination made promptly after a signi ficant change in his/her physical or mental condition. The facility must notify the RMU of any such change with in two (2) working days of its occurrence. For the purpose of this section, significant change for the client's ment al condition means a change which may require the provision of specialized services or an increase in such services. A significant change in physical condition is a change that renders the client incapable of responding to MI or D.D. program interventions. (7-1-98) v. Determinations. Determinations as to the need fo r NF care and determinations as to the need for specialized services should not be made independently. Such determinations must often be made on an individual basis, taking into account the condition of the resident and capability of the facility to which admission is proposed to furnish the care needed. When an individu al identified with MI and MR is admitted to a NF, the NF is responsible for meeting that individual's needs, except for the provision of specialized services. (7-1-94) (1) Level of care. (11-6-93)(a) Individual determinations. Must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. (11-6-93) (b) Categorical determinations. Recognizing that individual determinations of level of care are not always necessary, those categories set forth as examples at 42 CFR 483.130(d) are hereby adopted as appropriate for categorical determinations. Wh en NF level of care is determined approp riate categorically, th e individual may be conditionally admitted prior to completion of the determination for specialized services. However, conditional admissions cannot exceed seven (7) days, except for respit e admissions, which cannot ex ceed thirty (30) consecutive days in one (1) calendar year. (11-6-93) (2) Specialized services. Specialized services for mental illness as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(1), and for mental retardation as defined in 42 CFR 483.120(a)(2 ), are those services provided by the state which due to the intensity and scope can only be delivered by personnel and programs which are not in cluded in the specialized rehabilitation services required of nursing facilities under 42 CFR 483.45. The need for specialized services must be documented and included in both the resident asse ssment instrument and the plan of care. (11-6-93) (a) Individual determinations. Must be based on evaluations and data as required by these rules. (11-6-93) (b) Group determinations. Catagorical determinations that specialized services are not needed may be made in those situations permitted by 42 CFR 483.130. The same time limits, imposed by Subsection 160.06.b.v.(a)(2) shall apply. (11-6-93) vi. Penalty for non-compliance. No payment shall be made for any services rendered by a NF prior to completion of the Level I screen and, if required, the Level II screen. Failure to comply with PASARR requirements for all individuals admitted or seeking admission may also subject a NF to other penalties as part of certification action under 42 CFR 483.20. (11-6-93) vii. Appeals. Discharges, transfers, and preadmission screening and additional resident review (PASARR) determinations may be appealed to the extent required by 42 CFR, Part 483, Subpart E, which, pursuant IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 123 IAC 2006to Idaho Code, 67-5229, is incorporated by reference he rein. Appeals under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with the fair hearing provisions of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declarat ory Rulings,\" IDAPA 16.05.03, Section 300. A Level I finding of MI or MR is not an appealable determination. It may be disputed as part of a Level II determination appeal. (7-1-98) viii. Automatic repeal. In the event that the Pread mission Screening and Annual Resident Review program is eliminated or made non-mandatory by act of congress, the provisions of Subsection 160.06.b. of this chapter shall cease to be operative on the effective da te of any such act, without further action. (11-6-93) 07. Provider Application and Certification . (1-16-80) a. A facility can apply to participate as a nursing facility. (7-1-94) b. A facility can apply to participate as an ICF/MR facility. (1-16-80) 08. Licensure and Certification . (7-13-89) a. Upon receipt of an application from a facility, the Licensing and Certification Agency must conduct a survey to determine the facility's compliance with certification standards for the type of care the facility proposes to provide to MA recipients. (7-13-89) b. If a facility proposes to participate as a skilled nursing facility, Medicare (Title XVIII) certification and program participation is required before the facility can be certified for Medicaid. The Licensing and Certification Agency must determine the facility's compliance with Medicare requirements and recommend certification to the Medicare Agency. (7-1-94) c. If the Licensing and Certification Agency determines that a facility meets Title XIX certification standards for nursing facility care or ICF/MR, the Section must certify to the appropriate branch of government that the facility meets the standards for NF or ICF/MR types of care. (7-1-94) d. Upon receipt of the certification from the Licen sing and Certification Agency, the Bureau may enter into a provider ag reement with the long-term care facility. (7-13-89) e. After the provider agreement has been executed by the Facility Administrator and by the Chief of the Bureau, one (1) copy must be sent by certified mail to the facility and the original is to be retained by the Bureau. (11-10-81) 09. Determination of Entitlement to Long-Term Care . Entitlement to MA participation in the cost of long-term care exists when the individual is eligible fo r MA and the RNR has determined that the individual meets the criteria for NF or ICF/MR care and services. Entitlement must be determined prior to authorization of payment for such care for an individual who is either a recipient of or an applicant for MA. (7-1-94) a. The criteria for determining a MA recipient's need for either nursing facility care or intermediate care for the mentally retarded must be as set forth in Subsections 180.03 or 180.08. In addition, the IOC/UC nurse must determine whether a MA recipient's needs could be met by non-inpatient alternatives including, but not limited to, remaining in an independent living arrangement or residing in a room and board situation. (7-1-94) b. The recipient can select any certified facility to provide the care required. (11-10-81) c. The final decision as to the level of care required by a MA recipient must be made by the IOC/UC Nurse. (7-1-94) d. The final decision as to the need for DD or MI active treatment must be made by the appropriate Department staff as a result of the Level II screening process. (7-13-89) e. No payment must be made by the Department on behalf of any eligible MA recipient to any long- term care facility which, in the judgment of the IOCT/UCT is admitting individuals for care or services which are IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 124 IAC 2006beyond the facility's licensed level of care or capability. (7-1-94) 10. Authorization of Long-Term Care Payment . If it has been determined that a person eligible for MA is entitled to MA participation in the cost of long-term care, and that the facility selected by the recipient is licensed and certified to provide the level of care the recipient requires, the Field Office will forward to such facility an \"Authorization for Long-Term Care Payment\" form HW 0459. (7-1-94) 161. HOSPITAL SWING-BED REIMBURSEMENT. The Department will pay for NF care in certain rural hospitals. Following approval by the Department, such hospitals may provide service to recipients who require NF level of care as defined by Subsection 180.03 in licensed hospital (\"swing\") beds. (7-1-94) 01. Facility Requirements . The Department will approve hospitals for NF care provided to eligible recipients under the following conditions: (7-1-94) a. The Department's Licensure and Certification Section finds the hospital in conformance with the requirements of 42 CFR 482.66 \"Special Requirements\" for hospital providers of long-term care services (\"swing-beds\"); and (8-23-90) b. The hospital is approved by the Medicare program for the provision of \"swing-bed\" services; and (5-1-84) c. The facility does not have a twenty-four (24) hour nursing waiver granted under 42 CFR 488.54(c); and (8-23-90) d. The hospital must not have had a swing-bed approval terminated within the two (2) years previous to application for swing-bed participation; and (8-23-90) e. The hospital must be licensed for less than one hundred (100) beds as defined by 42 CFR 482.66(a)(1) for swing-bed purposes; and (8-23-90) f. NF services in swing-beds must be rendered in beds used interchangeably to furnish hospital or NF type services. (7-1-94) 02. Recipient Requirements .

The recipient is determined to be entitled to such services in accordance with Subsection 080.01; and (7-1-94) b. The recipient is authorized for payment in accordance with Subsection 160.10; and (12-31-91) 03. Reimbursement for \"Swing-Bed\" Patient Days . The Department will reimburse swing-bed hospitals on a per diem basis utilizing a rate established as follows: (8-23-90) a. Payment rates for routine NF services will be at the weighted average Medi caid rate per patient day paid to hospital based NF/ICF facilities for routine services furnished during the previous calendar year. ICF/MR facilities' rates are excluded from the calculations. (7-1-94) b. The rate will be calculated by the Department by March 15th of each calendar year. The rate will be based on the previous calendar year and effective retroac tively for dates of service on or after January 1 of the respective year. (8-23-90) c. The weighted average rate for NF swing-bed days will be calculated by dividing total payments for routine services, including patient contribution amounts but excluding miscellaneous financial transactions relating to prior years, by total patient days for each respective leve l of care occurring in the pr evious calendar year. (7-1-94)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE IDAPA 16.03.09 - Rules Governing Department of Health and Welfare the Medical Assistance Program Page 125 IAC 2006d. Routine services as addressed in Subsection 160 .01.a. include all medical care, supplies, and services which are included in the calculation of nursing facility property and nonproperty costs as described in Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.10, \"Rules Governing Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho\".

Reimbursement of ancillary services not included in the nursing facility rates furnished for extended care services will be billed and determined in the same manner as hospital outpatient reasonable costs in accordance with Medicare reasonable cost principles, except that reimbursement for prescription drugs will be in accord with Section 126. (7-1-94) g. The number of swing-bed days that may be reimbursed to a provider in a twelve (12) month period will be limited to the greater of one thousand ninety five (1,095) days which may be prorated over a shorter fiscal period or, fifteen percent (15%) of the product of the average number of available licensed beds in the hospital in the period and the number of days in the fiscal period. (8-23-90) 04. Computation of \"Swing-Bed\" Patient Contribution . The computation of the patient's contribution of swing-bed payment will be in accordance with Subsection 160.03. (12-31-91) 162. ADMINISTRATIVELY NECESSARY DAY (AND). An Administratively Necessary Day is in tended to allow a hospital time for an orderly transfer or discharge of recipient inpatients who are no longer in need of a con tinued acute level of care. ANDs may be authorized for inpatients who are awaiting placement for NF level of care, or in-home services which are not available, or when catastrophic events prevent the schedule d discharge of an inpatient. (7-1-94) 01. Documentation Provided . The hospital will provide the Department's designee complete and timely documentation prior to the patient's anticipated discharge date in order to be considered. Authorization for reimbursement will be denied for all untimely requests and tardy submittal of requested documentation. All requests for AND must be made in writing, or by telephone. Hospitals must make the documentation and related information requested by the Department's Medicaid Policy Section designee available within ten (10) working days of the date of the designee's request in order for subsequent payment to be granted.

(7-1-94) 163. -- 164. (RESERVED). 165. RELATIONSHIP OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO MEDICARE. 01. General Relationship . In processing MA payments in behalf of recipients eligible for Medicare, the Department must determine the availability of resources from both Parts A and B of Title XVIII. The Department is to pay only the deductible and co-insurance amounts of those services covered by Parts A and B. (11-10-81) 02. \"Buy-In\" Coverage . The Department has an agreement with the Social Security Administration to pay the premiums for Part B of Title XVIII for each recipient eligible for Medicare and MA regardless of whether the client receives a financial gran t from the Department. (6-1-91) a. The effective date of the \"Buy-In\" for a client approved for MA and an AABD grant is the first month of eligibility for the AABD grant. (6-1-91) b. The effective date of the \"Buy-In\" for a client approved for MA who also receives SSI, but not AABD, is the first month of eligibility for MA. (6-1-91) c. The effective date of the \"Buy-In\" for a client approved for MA who does not receive an AABD grant or SSI is the first day of the second month following the month in which he became eligible for MA (third month of MA eligibility). (6-1-91) d. After the effective date of the \"Buy-In\" it takes th e Social Security Admini stration approximately three (3) months to update its records to show the Department's payment of the \"Buy-In\" premium. (11-10-81) e. The Field Office will advise each recipient who is paying Part B Medicare premiums to discontinue payments beginning the month the \"Buy-In\" becomes ef fective. Policies for treatment of the \"Buy-In\" for determining eligibility for MA or AABD, grant amount for AABD, or patient liability are in Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA 16.03.05, \"Rules Governing Eligibility for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (AABD)\". Policies for treatment of the \"Buy-In\" for determining client participation of an HCBS client are found in Subsection 160.03.e. (7-1-94) 166. -- 169. (RESERVED). 170. RELATIONSHIP OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO DEPARTMENT OF VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION. The Department has entered into agreements with DVR regarding areas of responsibility, joint planning, referrals, coordination, consultation, exchange of information and other matters of mutual concern.
