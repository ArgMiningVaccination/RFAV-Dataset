Responsibility for the final content of this report rests entirely with the authoring committee and the institution. P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS ix Preface In the last century, many answers have been given by health professionals to the question \"how much weight should I gain while I am pregnant?\" In the early 1900's, the answer was often only 15-20 pounds. Between 1970 and 1990, the guideline for weight gain during pregnancy was higher, 20-25 pounds, and in 1990, with the publication of Nutrition During Pregnancy , it went higher still for some groups of women. This most recent guideline reflected new knowledge about the importance of maternal body fatness before conception, as measured by body mass index, for the outcome of pregnancy. It had become clear that heavier women could gain less weight and still deliver an infant of good size. Since that time, the obesity epidemic has not spared women of reproductive age. In our population today, more women of reproductive age are severely obese (obesity class III; 8 percent) than are underweight (3 percent) and their short- and long-term health has become a concern in addition to the size of the infant at birth. Clearly the time had come to reexamine the guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy. To prepare for this possibility, the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine held a workshop in 2006 to evaluate the availability of data that could be used reexamine the current guidelines. Based on the outcome of this workshop, numerous federal agencies (Department of Health and Human Services: Health Resources Services Administration; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity; National Institutes of Health: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Development; National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Division of Nutrition Research Coordination Office on Women's Health; Office on Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; and Office on Minority Health; as well as the March of Dimes) agreed to sponsor the work of this committee. The committee was asked to review the determinants and a wide range of short- and long- term consequences of variation in weight gain during pregnancy for both the mother and her infant. Based on the outcome of this review, the committee was asked to recommend revisions to the current guidelines if this was deemed to be necessary. In addition, the committee was asked to consider the approaches that might be necessary to promote appropriate weight gain and to identify gaps in knowledge and make recommendations about priorities for future research. Although many studies relevant to the committee's charge have been published since 1990 and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) completed their report Outcomes of Maternal Weight Gain while the committee was gathering data, many gaps in knowledge remained. To address this problem, the committee held a public session with project sponsors, and two workshops. We are grateful to those who participated in these sessions for sharing their experience and wisdom. We are also grateful to a number of individuals who supplied data to the committee: Aimin Chen, Amy Branum, Alan Ryan, Andrea Sharma, Joyce Martin, Sharon Kirmeyer, K.S. Joseph, Marie Cedergren, Raul Artal, and with special thanks to Patricia Dietz. The committee also commissioned additional analyses of data from both Denmark and the United States. We thank our consultants, Ellen Aagaard Nohr, Amy Herring, and Cheryl Stein P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS x for these analyses and for their contributions to the committee's work. The committee also felt that it was important to understand what would be involved in analyzing the trade-off between mother and infant in risk of adverse outcomes of variation in weight gain during pregnancy. To accomplish this, we commissioned such an analysis based on the data at hand. We thank our consultant, James Hammitt, for conducting these analyses and for his contribution to the committee's work. The committee's 14 members gave freely of their expertise and volunteered their time and energy in all aspects of the preparation of this report, from developing its intellectual framework, writing the text and deliberating about the recommendations and conclusions of the report.

P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1 Summary Since 1990, the last time the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy, many key aspects of the health of women of childbearing age have changed. This population now includes a higher proportion of women from racial/ethnic subgroups and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) have increased among all population subgroups. Moreover, high rates of overweight and obesity are common in the population subgroups that are at risk for poor maternal and child health outcomes. Finally, women are also becoming pregnant at an older age and, as a result, are entering pregnancy more commonly with chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes, which put them at risk for pregnancy complications and may lead to increased morbidity during their post-pregnancy years. These and other factors suggested a need to reexamine the IOM (1990) guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy and consider whether revision might be warranted. In response to these concerns, sponsors1 asked the Food and Nutrition Board of the IOM and the Board on Children, Youth, and Families in the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education of the National Research Council to review the IOM (1990) recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy. Specifically, the committee was asked to review evidence on relationships between weight gain patterns before, during, and after pregnancy, and maternal and child health outcomes; consider factors within a life-stage framework associated with outcomes such as lactation performance, postpartum weight retention, cardiovascular and other chronic diseases; and recommend revisions to existing guidelines where necessary. Finally, the committee was asked to recommend ways to encourage the adoption of the weight gain guidelines through consumer education, strategies to assist practitioners, and public health strategies. GUIDELINES FOR WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY The new guidelines for GWG that are shown in Table S-1 are formulated as a range for each category of prepregnancy BMI. This approach reflects the imprecision of the estimates on which the recommendations are based, the reality that good outcomes are achieved within a range of weight gains, and the many additional factors that may need to be considered for an individual woman. It is important to note that these guidelines are intended for use among women in the United States. They may be applicable to women in other developed countries. However, they are not intended for use in areas of the world where women are substantially shorter or thinner than American women or where adequate obstetric services are unavailable. The new guidelines differ from those issued in 1990 in two ways. First, they are based on the World Health Organization (WHO) cutoff points for the BMI categories instead of the previous ones, which were based on categories derived from the Metropolitan Life Insurance tables. 1S ponsors include: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration,; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; and the March of Dimes. Additional support came from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health and the National Minority AIDS Council. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS S-2 Second, and more importantly, the new guidelines include a specific, relatively narrow range of recommended gain for obese women. TABLE S-1 New Recommendations for Total and Rate of Weight Gain during Pregnancy, by Prepregnancy BMI Total Weight Gain Rates of Weight Gain * 2nd and 3rd Trimester Prepregnancy BMI R ange in kg Range in lbs Mean (range) in kg/week Mean (range) in 0.5-2 kg (1.1- 4.4 lbs) weig ht gain in the first trimester (based on Siega-Riz et al., 1994; Abrams et al., 1995; Carmichael et al., 1997) These new guidelines should be considered in the context of data on women's reported GWG. Data from several large groups of women indicate that the mean gains of underweight women fall within the new guidelines, but some normal weight women may exceed these new guidelines and a majority of overweight or obese women will likely exceed them. These data provide a strong reason to assume that interventions will be needed to assist women, particularly those who are overweight or obese at the time of conception, in meeting the guidelines. These interventions may need to occur at both the individual and community levels and may need to include components related to both improved dietary intake and increased physical activity. The committee intends that the guidelines shown in Table S-1 be used in concert with good clinical judgment as well as a discussion between the woman and her care provider about diet and exercise. If a woman's GWG is not within the proposed guidelines, clinicians should consider other relevant clinical evidence, modifiable factors that might be causing excessive or inadequate gain, and information on the nature of excess GWG (e.g. fat or edema) as well as both the adequacy and consistency of fetal growth before suggesting that a woman modify her pattern of weight gain. Special Populations Women of Short Stature The IOM (1990) report recommended that women of short stature (< 157 cm) gain at the lower end of the range for their prepregnant BMI. The committee was unable to identify evidence sufficient to continue to support a modification of GWG guidelines for women of short stature. Although women of short stature had an increased risk of emergency cesarean delivery, this risk was not modified by GWG. Women of short stature did not have an increased risk of having an small-for-gestational age (SGA) or large-for-gestational age (LGA) infant or of excessive postpartum weight retention over taller women. SUMMARY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS S-3 Pregnant Adolescents Evidence available since the IOM (1990) report is also insufficient to continue to support a modification of the GWG guidelines for adolescents (< 20 years old) during pregnancy. The committee also determined that prepregnancy BMI could be adequately categorized in adolescents by using the WHO cutoff points for adults, in part because of the impracticality of using pediatric growth charts in obstetric practices. Adolescents who follow adult BMI cutoff points will likely be categorized in a lighter group and thus advised to gain more; however, younger adolescents often need to gain more to improve birth outcomes. Racial or Ethnic Groups Although an increasing proportion of pregnant U.S. women are members of racial or ethnic minority groups, the limited data available to the committee from commissioned analyses suggested that membership in one of these groups did not modify the association between GWG and the outcome of pregnancy. As a result, the committee concluded that its recommendations should be generally applicable to the various racial or ethnic subgroups that make up the American population although additional research is needed to confirm this approach. Women with Multiple Fetuses Recent data suggest that the weight gain of women with twins who have good outcomes varies with prepregnancy BMI as is clearly the case for women with singleton fetuses. Inasmuch as the committee was unable to conduct the same kind of analysis for women with twins as it did for women with singletons, the committee offers the following provisional guidelines: normal weight women should gain 17-25 kg (37-54 pounds), overweight women, 14-23 kg (31-50 pounds) and obese women, 11-19 kg (25-42 pounds) at term. Insufficient information was available with which to develop even a provisional guideline for underweight women with multiple fetuses. These provisional guidelines reflect the interquartile (25th to 75th percentiles) range of cumulative weight gain among women who delivered their twins, who weighed 2,500 g on average, at 37-42 weeks of gestation. DEVEOPMENT OF THE GUIDELINES FOR WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY The committee worked from the perspectives that the reproductive cycle begins before conception and continues through the first year postpartum and that maternal weight status throughout the entire cycle affects both the mother and her child. To inform its review of the literature and to guide the organization of its report, the committee reevaluated the conceptual framework that guided the development of the IOM (1990) report. To account for advances in our scientific understanding of the determinants and consequences of GWG, the committee developed a modified conceptual framework (Figure S-1). However, it retained the same scientific approach and epidemiologic conventions used previously and discussed in detail in the IOM (1990) report.

SOURCE: Modified from IOM, 1990. SUMMARY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS S-5 The committee began its work by considering appropriate BMI cutoff points and describing trends over time in maternal prepregnancy BMI and GWG among American women. In addition, data were sought on both the determinants and consequences of GWG. The search for such data revealed major gaps in data collection and analysis. Key Finding S-1: The WHO cutoff points for categorizing BMI have been widely adopted and should be used for categorizing prepregnancy BMI as well. Key Finding S-2: Currently available data sources are inadequate for studying national trends in GWG, or postpartum weight, or their determinants. Action Recommendation S-1: The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services conduct routine surveillance of GWG and postpartum weight retention on a nationally representative sample of women and report the results by prepregnancy BMI (including all classes of obesity), age, racial/ethnic group, and socioeconomic status. Action Recommendation S-2: The committee recommends that all states adopt the revised version of the birth certificate, which includes fields for maternal prepregnancy weight, height, weight at delivery, and gestational age at the last measured weight. In addition, all states should strive for 100 percent completion of these fields on birth certificates and collaborate to share data, thereby allowing a complete national picture as well as regional snapshots. Research Recommendation S-1: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct studies in large and diverse populations of women to understand how dietary intake, physical activity, dieting practices, food insecurity and, more broadly, the social, cultural and environmental context affect GWG. In developing its recommendations, the committee identified a set of consequences for the short- or long-term health of the mother and the child that are potentially causally related to GWG. These consequences included those evaluated in a systematic review of outcomes of maternal weight gain prepared for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as well as others based on data from the literature outside the time window considered in that report. To address conflicts and gaps within the available literature, the committee commissioned four additional analyses from existing databases. The committee considered the results from these commissioned analyses in conjunction with evidence from published scientific literature. Postpartum weight retention, cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes mellitus, and pregnancy- induced hypertension or preeclampsia emerged from this process as being the most important maternal health outcomes. The committee removed preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus from consideration because of the lack of sufficient evidence that GWG was a cause of these conditions. Postpartum weight retention and, in particular, unscheduled primary cesarean delivery were retained for further consideration. Measures of size at birth (e.g. SGA and LGA), preterm birth, and childhood obesity emerged from this process as being the most important infant health outcomes. The committee recognized that both SGA and LGA, when defined as < 10th percentile and > 90th percentile of weight-for- gestational age, respectively, represent a mix of individuals who are appropriately or inappropriately small or large. In addition, the committee recognized that being SGA was likely to be associated with deleterious outcomes for the infant but not the mother, while being LGA was likely to be associated with consequences for both the infant and the mother (e.g., cesarean delivery). WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS S-6 Key Finding S-3: Evidence from the scientific literature is remarkably clear that prepregnancy BMI is an independent predictor of many adverse outcomes of pregnancy. As a result women should enter pregnancy with a BMI in the normal weight category. Key Finding S-4: Although a record-high proportion of American women of childbearing age have BMI values in obesity classes II and III, available evidence is insufficient to develop more specific recommendations for GWG among these women. Research Recommendation S-2: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct studies in all classes of obese women, stratified by the severity of obesity, on the determinants and impact of GWG, pattern of weight gain, and its composition on maternal and child outcomes. Key Finding S-5: There are only limited data available with which to link GWG to health outcomes of mothers and children that occur after the neonatal period. Research Recommendation S-3: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct studies on the eating behaviors, patterns of dietary intake and physical activity, and metabolic profiles of pregnant women, especially obese women, who experience low gain or weight loss during pregnancy. In addition, the committee recommends that researchers conduct studies on the effects of weight loss or low GWG, including periods of prolonged fasting and the development of ketonuria/ketonemia during gestation, on growth and on development, and long-term neurocognitive function in the offspring. Research Recommendation S-4: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct observational and experimental studies on the association between GWG and (a) glucose abnormalities and gestational hypertensive disorders that take into account the temporality of the diagnosis of the outcome, and (b) the development of glucose intolerance, hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors as well as mental health and cancer later in a woman's life. Research Recommendation S-5: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct studies that (a) explore mechanisms, including epigenetic mechanisms, that underlie effects of GWG on maternal and child outcomes and (b) address the extent to which optimal GWG differs not only by maternal prepregnancy BMI but also by other factors such as age (especially among adolescents), parity, racial/ethnic group, socioeconomic status, co-morbidities, and maternal/paternal/fetal genotype. Research Recommendation S-6: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct observational and experimental studies to assess the impact of variation in GWG on a range of child outcomes, including duration of gestation, weight and body composition at birth, and neurodevelopment, obesity and related outcomes, and asthma later in childhood. Based on the available published literature as well as the reports of its consultants, the committee ascertained the GWG value or range of values associated with lowest prevalence of the outcomes of greatest interest. When weighting the trade-off among these outcomes, the committee considered, within each category of prepregnant BMI (a) the incidence or prevalence of each of these outcomes, (b) whether the outcomes were permanent (e.g. neurocognitive deficits) or potentially modifiable (e.g. postpartum weight retention) and (c) the quality of the available data. The committee compared the resulting ranges with those developed in the SUMMARY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS S-7 quantitative risk analysis conducted by its consultants. Finally, the c ommittee considered how its possible recommendations might be accepted and used by clinicians and women. Research Recommendation S-7: To permit the development of improved recommendations for GWG in the future, the committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to (a) conduct studies to assess utilities (values) associated with short- and long-term health outcomes associated with GWG for both mother and child and (b) include these values in studies that employ decision analytic frameworks to estimate optimal GWG according to category of maternal prepregnancy BMI and other subgroups. APPROACHES TO ACHIEVING RECOMMENDED WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY To meet the recommendations of this report fully, two different challenges must be met. First, a higher proportion of American women should conceive at a weight within the range of normal BMI values. Meeting this first challenge requires preconceptional counseling and, for many women some weight loss. Such counseling may need to include additional contraceptive services as well as services directed toward helping women to improve the quality of their diets and increase their physical activity. Preconception counseling is an integral part of the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control (Johnson et al., 2006). Practical guidelines for preconceptional care are provided in Nutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation: An Implementation Guide (IOM, 1992). The need to meet this challenge reinforces the importance of preconceptional counseling as the cornerstone for achieving optimal outcomes of pregnancy and improved health for mothers and their children. Action Recommendation S-3: The committee recommends that appropriate federal, state and local agencies as well as health care providers inform women of the importance of conceiving at a normal BMI and that all those who provide health care or related services to women of childbearing age include preconceptional counseling in their care. Second, a higher proportion of American women should limit their GWG to the range specified in these guidelines for their prepregnant BMI. Meeting this second challenge requires a different set of services . The first step in assisting women to gain within these guidelines is letting them know that they exist, which will require educating their healthcare providers as well as the women themselves. Action Recommendation S-4: The committee recommends that relevant federal agencies, private voluntary organizations, and medical and public health organizations adopt these new guidelines for GWG and publicize them to their members and also to women of childbearing age. Individualized attention is called for in the IOM (1990) guidelines and was an element in all of the interventions that have been successful in helping women to gain within their target range. Guidelines on providing such care are provided in Nutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation: An Implementation Guide (IOM, 1992). The increase in prevalence of obesity that has occurred since this report was written suggests that this recommendation has only become more important. In offering women individualized attention, a number of kinds of services could be considered. Health care providers should chart women's weight gain and share the results with them so that they become aware of their progress toward their weight-gain goal. To assist healthcare providers in doing this, the committee has prepared charts that could be used as a WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS S-8 basis for this discussion with the pregnant woman. These charts are meant to be used as part of an assessment of the progress of pregnancy and a woman's weight gain, looking beyond the gain from one visit to the next and toward the overall pattern of weight gain. In addition, women should be provided with individualized advice about both diet and physical activity (ACOG, 2002). This may require referral to a dietitian as well as other appropriately qualified individuals, such as those who specialize in helping women to increase their physical activity. These services may need to continue into the postpartum period to give women the maximum support to return to their prepregnant weight within the first year and, thus, to have a better chance of returning to a normal BMI value at the time of a subsequent conception. Individualized attention is likely to be necessary but not sufficient to enable most women to gain within the new guidelines. Family- and community-level factors must also be addressed if women are to succeed in gaining within these guidelines. Further research on these kinds of multilevel, ecological determinants of GWG is needed to guide the development of comprehensive and effective implementation strategies to achieve these guidelines. In addition, special attention should be given to low-income and minority women, who are at risk of being overweight or obese at the time of conception, consuming diets of lower nutritional value, and of performing less recreational physical activity. Action Recommendation S-5: To assist women to gain within the guidelines, the committee recommends that those who provide prenatal care to women should offer them counseling, such as guidance on dietary intake and physical activity, that is tailored to their life circumstances. Research Recommendation S-8: The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services provide funding for research to aid providers and communities in assisting women to meet these guidelines, especially low-income and minority women. The committee also recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services provide funding for research to examine the cost-effectiveness (in terms of maternal and offspring outcomes) of interventions designed to assist women in meeting these guidelines. CONCLUDING REMARKS Although the guidelines developed as part of this committee process are not dramatically different from those published previously (IOM, 1990), fully implementing them would represent a radical change in the care provided to women of childbearing age. In particular, the committee recognizes that full implementation of these guidelines would mean: Offering preconceptional services, such as counseling on diet and physical activity as well as access to contraception, to all overweight or obese women to help them reach a healthy weight before conceiving. This may reduce their obstetric risk and normalize infant birth weight as well as improve their long-term health. Offering services, such as counseling on diet and physical activity, to all pregnant women to help them achieve the guidelines on GWG contained in this report. This may also reduce their obstetric risk, reduce postpartum weight retention, improve their long-term health, normalize infant birth weight and offer an additional tool to help reduce childhood obesity. Offering services, such as counseling on diet and physical activity, to all postpartum women. This may help them to eliminate postpartum weight retention and, thus, to be able to conceive again at a healthy weight as well as improve their long-term health. SUMMARY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS S-9 The increase in overweight and obesity among American women of childbearing age and failure of many pregnant women to gain within the IOM (1990) guidelines alone justify this radical change in care as women clearly require assistance to achieve the recommendations in this report in the current environment. However, the reduction in future health problems among both women and their children that could possibly be achieved by meeting the guidelines in this report provide additional justification for the committee's recommendations. These new guidelines are based on observational data, which consistently show that women who gained within the IOM (1990) guidelines experienced better outcomes of pregnancy than those who did not (see Chapters 5 and 6). Nonetheless, these new guidelines require validation from experimental studies. To be useful, however, such validation through intervention studies must have adequate statistical power not only to determine if a given intervention helps women to gain within the recommended range but also to determine if doing so improves their outcomes. In the future, it will be important to reexamine the trade-offs between women and their children in pregnancy outcomes related to prepregnancy BMI as well as GWG, and also to be able to estimate the cost-effectiveness of interventions designed to help women meet these recommendations.

PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 11 Setting the Stage for Revising Pregnancy Weight Guidelines: Conceptual Framework BACKGROUND Improvement of maternal, fetal, and child health are key public health goals. Over the past four decades, changes in public health trends have challenged the healthcare sector to provide optimal guidance to women before, during, and after pregnancy to achieve healthy outcomes for themselves and their newborns. The report, Maternal Nutrition and the Course of Pregnancy (NRC, 1970) developed from concern about high neonatal and infant mortality rates in the United States compared to other developed countries. In that report, the Committee on Maternal Nutrition recognized the positive relationship between gestational weight gain (GWG) and birth weight. The committee also noted the positive association between prepregnancy maternal weight and birth weight and the fact that higher prepregnancy maternal weight reduced the impact of GWG on birth weight. The report advised an average gestational weight gain of 24 pounds (20-25-pound range) and advised against the then-current practice of limiting GWG to 10-14 pounds. A subsequent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990) offered recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy based on prepregnancy maternal body mass index (BMI). The report also made specific weight gain recommendations for population subgroups, including adolescents, members of racial and ethnic groups, women of short stature, and women carrying twins. The report also details historic trends in weight gain recommendations and guidelines. These recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy have been adopted by or have been influential in many countries. Reviews of observational studies support that women who enter pregnancy at a normal BMI and gain within the ranges recommended in the IOM (1990) guidelines are more likely to have a good birth outcome than women who gain outside the recommended ranges (Taffel et al., 1993; Abrams et al., 2000; Gross, 2006). In the years since the release of the weight gain recommendations from the IOM (1990) report, some dramatic shifts in the demographic and epidemiologic profile of the U.S. population have occurred. Notably, prepregnancy BMI and excess GWG have increased across all population groups, particularly minority groups (Yeh and Shelton, 2005; Kim et al., 2007). These and other factors suggested a need to consider whether a revision of the IOM (1990) pregnancy weight gain guidelines is needed. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1-2 RATIONALE FOR REVISING THE GUIDELINES General Principles Framing the Guidelines The IOM (1990) pregnancy weight guidelines were developed principally in response to concerns about low birth weight infants. Although adverse health outcomes for excess weight gain were considered in the IOM (1990) weight gain guidelines, these recommendations were derived largely from data collected in the 1980 National Natality Survey (Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nmihs/abnmihs.htm [accessed March 3, 2008]) and focused on preventing premature births and small-for-gestational age infants. The IOM (1990) report and a subsequent report, Nutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation (IOM, 1992), identified specific actions practitioners could take to achieve the recommendations in working with patients. They also identified a series of research recommendations for epidemiologic, basic, and applied research to enable better estimates of GWG, prepregnancy weight for height, and gestational duration, which affect study design and interpretation. INDICATORS FOR REVISING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE GUIDELINES In 1996 an expert work group was convened by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to examine issues relating to maternal weight gain that had been published in the IOM (1990) report. The purpose of this group was to determine whether new research provided a basis for practitioners to change guidance for GWG, and to recommend future directions for research, training, and/or other programmatic initiatives. The group concluded that formal revision of the IOM (1990) weight gain recommendations was not yet warranted; however reservations were expressed that the recommendations for African-American women, young adolescents, and women of short stature were too specific (Suitor, 1997). Since publication of the IOM reports Nutrition During Pregnancy (1990) and Nutrition During Lactation (1991) and the subsequent Implementation Guide (1992), the population of U.S. women of childbearing age has become more diverse. Although low birth weight remains a significant concern during pregnancy, new health concerns have emerged. These include the greater prevalence of women who are overweight or obese entering pregnancy, which puts them at high risk for pregnancy complications. For example, data from the 2003-2004 round of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that 28.9 percent of women of reproductive age (20-39 years old) were obese (BMI 30 kg/m2) and 8.0 percent were extremely obese (BMI 40 kg/m2) (Ogden et al., 2006). Women are becoming pregnant at an older age and enter pregnancy with chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, which also puts them at risk for pregnancy complications and may lead to increased morbidity during their post- pregnancy years (Cleary-Goldman et al., 2005; Joseph et al., 2005; Delpisheh et al., 2008). EMERGING TRENDS FROM RESEARCH ON GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN Weight patterns (underweight and overweight) and GWG have short- and long-term consequences for the health of the mother. For example, prepregnancy BMI above normal values (19.8-26 kg/m2) is associated with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes (GDM), cesarean delivery SETTING THE STAGE FOR REVISING PREGNANCY WEIGHT GUID ELINES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1-3 (Doherty et al., 2006; Abenhaim et al., 2007), and failure to initiate and sustain breastfeeding (Hilson et al., 1997; Li et al., 2003; Kugyelka et al., 2004). Increased maternal BMI and GWG have also been associated with higher fat mass in infants and subsequent overweight in children (Hillier et al., 2007; Oken et al., 2007). Collectively, these trends and newer research prompted concern about the appropriateness of existing guidelines for GWG to support optimal outcomes for mother, infant, and child. Specifically there were concerns about the implications of the recommendations for (1) the health of the mother, particularly for women who are overweight, underweight, older, adolescent, or short in stature; (2) for infant and child health; and (3) for other metabolic processes that may affect the in utero environment. Another concern that has frequently been raised by researchers and practitioners is the difference between BMI categories used in the IOM (1990) report and those used in the report Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI, 1998) in cooperation with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which are based on a report from the World Health Organization (1995). This is a problem for practitioners as well as for researchers. Most importantly, despite the effort made to publicize the recommendations of the IOM (1990) report, including the development of a guide to assist the medical profession to implement these guidelines (IOM, 1992), many healthcare providers have not used these guidelines and many women have not followed them (Abrams et al., 2000). SETTING THE STAGE FOR REVISING THE GUIDELINES In response to such concerns, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of HHS requested that the National Research Council and the IOM convene a workshop in May 2006. The purpose of this workshop was to review trends in maternal weight; explore emerging research findings related to the complex relationship of the biological, behavioral, psychological, and social interactions that affect maternal and pregnancy weight on maternal and child health outcomes and discuss interventions. The following specific questions were addressed by the workshop were: What research and databases describe the distribution of maternal weight (prior to, during, and after pregnancy) among different populations of women in the United States? What research and databases inform understanding of the effects of different weight patterns (including underweight and overweight) during pregnancy on maternal and child health outcomes? What research has been conducted to describe the individual, community, and healthcare system factors that impede or foster compliance with recommended GWG guidelines? What opportunities exist for Title V maternal and child health programs to build on this knowledge to help childbearing women achieve and maintain recommended weight? What future research and data collection efforts could improve the efforts of Title V programs to support women from different racial and ethnic backgrounds in their WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1-4 efforts to comply with recommended weight guidelines and to improve their maternal health? The workshop summary report, Influence of Pregnancy Weight on Maternal and Child Health (NRC-IOM, 2007) , includes a review of U.S. trends in maternal weight (before, during, and after pregnancy) among different populations of women. The workshop report also includes a discussion of the determinants of GWG; the relationships among maternal weight, GWG, and the health of women and children; interventions in healthcare and community settings that help women achieve appropriate weight levels during and after pregnancy; and emerging themes that warrant further examination in future studies. Taken together, the workshop and its summary report reinforce the need to reexamine recommendations for GWG, especially in light of the current obesity epidemic, and to highlight ways to encourage their adoption. THE COMMITTEE'S TASK Sponsors1 asked the IOM's Food and Nutrition Board and the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education Board on Children, Youth, and Families to review and update the IOM (1990) recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy and recommend ways to encourage their adoption through consumer education, strategies to assist practitioners, and public health strategies. The committee was asked to address the following tasks: 1. Review evidence on the relationship between weight gain patterns before, during, and after pregnancy and maternal and child health outcomes, with particular attention to the prevalence of maternal obesity racial/ethnic and age differences, components of GWG, and implications of weight during pregnancy on postpartum weight retention and maternal and child obesity and later child health. 2. Within a life-stage framework consider factors in relation to GWG that are associated with maternal health outcomes such as lactation performance, postpartum weight retention, cardiovascular disease, metabolic processes including glucose and insulin- related issues, and risk of other chronic diseases; for infants and children, in addition to low birth weight, consider early developmental impacts and obesity related consequences (e.g., mental health, diabetes). 3. Recommend revisions to the existing guidelines, where necessary, including the need for specific pregnancy weight guidelines for underweight, normal weight, and overweight and obese women and adolescents and women carrying twins or higher- order multiples. 4. Consider a range of approaches to promote appropriate weight gain, including: Individual (behavior), psychosocial, community, healthcare, and health systems; 1 Sponsors include: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration,; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity; National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; and the March of Dimes. Additional support came from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health and the National Minority AIDS Council. SETTING THE STAGE FOR REVISING PREGNANCY WEIGHT GUID ELINES PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1-5 Timing and components of interventions; and Ways to enhance awareness and adoption of the guidelines, including interdisciplinary approaches, consumer education to men and women, strategies to assist practitioners to use the guidelines, and public health strategies; and 5. Identify gaps in knowledge and recommend research priorities. Approach to the Task The committee approached its task by gathering information from existing literature, which included a systematic review of the literature by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (Viswanathan et al., 2008) (see Appendix E for literature reviewed). The committee also gathered information from presentations by recognized experts in three workshops (see \"Open Sessions\"). It consulted with additional experts in relevant fields and commissioned new data analyses. Contributions made to the committee by consultants are noted throughout the report. The information-gathering activities laid the groundwork for the committee's work of deliberating on issues relevant to the task and formulating a strategy to address the scope of work. This task was not regarded by the committee as a formal systematic, evidence-based review as the full range of literature did not lend itself to this type of task. Rather, because of the wide-ranging and large literature on this subject, the committee relied on its collective expertise to determine how much weight to give to all of the sources of information at its disposal. The committee worked from the perspective that pregnancy-related weight begins before conception and continues through the first year postpartum and affects both the mother and her child. In consideration of Task 1, given the magnitude and complexity of the task, the committee determined that it was unable to address maternal weight history before entering pregnancy other than to take prepregnant BMI into account. Whenever possible, the committee sought and presented data on outcomes associated with GWG by racial/ethnic groups. This was done in the spirit of documenting disparities across racial/ethnic groups that the committee anticipated would reflect the strong socio-economic differentials and not biological differences across these groups. This assumption is grounded in the fact that ethnicity is, by definition, a socio-cultural construct and race, the way it is defined in the U.S., has been shown to be a social and not a biological construct (Goodman, 2000). It is noteworthy that the committee was not charged with evaluating either the safety or effectiveness of the IOM (1990) guidelines. However, observational studies clearly indicate that gaining within the 1990 guidelines is associated with better pregnancy outcomes (and, presumably, greater safety) than gaining outside of them (Taffel et al., 1993; Abrams et al, 2000; Gross, 2006). Moreover, safety and effectiveness of a set of guidelines is a function of many factors, including adoption and use of them by the health care team, acceptance and actual use of them by their target audience, any barriers the target audience might experience in achieving the guidelines and, finally, whether those who actually meet the guidelines have better outcomes. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT This report is organized into 8 chapters in which the committee describes what is known about GWG, with particular attention to demographic and other factors associated with GWG WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1-6 that falls above or below recommended levels, identifies data ga ps, and makes recommendations based on the committee's findings. The report begins by introducing the reasoning for a reexamination of pregnancy weight guidelines, based on data that have been gathered since the publication of Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990). To inform its review of the literature and to guide the organization of this report, the committee reevaluated the conceptual framework that guided the development of the IOM (1990) report. The committee developed a modified conceptual framework (see Figure 1-1) to account for advances in scientific understanding of the determinants and consequences of GWG. However, it retained the same scientific approach and epidemiologic conventions used previously and discussed in detail in the IOM (1990) report. Several changes in the conceptual framework are noteworthy. The committee chose to highlight the importance of numerous environmental factors as determinants of maternal factors that lead to GWG. It is recognized that some of these act through maternal factors to influence GWG and its consequences, while others may affect those consequences by other routes. Trends in GWG are considered in Chapter 2, with particular attention to weight gain in racial or ethnic subgroups of the U.S. population. Composition and components of GWG are addressed in Chapter 3. Since the IOM (1990) report was prepared, the importance of the placenta in the dialogue between the mother and fetus has become more apparent and the physiology and metabolism of the components of weight gain, including the placenta, are also discussed in Chapter 3. In consideration of the determinants of GWG, the committee chose to distinguish between maternal factors that are fixed at conception (e.g., age, racial or ethnic group, parity) and those that could potentially be modified during the gestation period (e.g., smoking, drug use, medical conditions that could be treated). These factors are discussed in Chapter 4. The new conceptual framework draws attention to outcomes in the perinatal period as well as those that occur postpartum and also much later in the lives of mothers and their children. These consequences of GWG are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6. Recommendations for action and approaches to implementation are discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. Recommendations for research are presented at the end of each chapter. The data reviewed in the chapters is tabulated in accompanying appendixes.

These are evaluated together because BMI before and after pregnancy and GWG are interrelated. It is also important to examine trends in key maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes that are related to maternal weight before pregnancy and also to GWG. This information provides a context for understanding the sociodemographic and behavioral environment that may influence successful promotion of healthy GWG and optimal pregnancy outcomes. TRENDS IN MATERNAL WEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN Maternal Body Mass Index One of the most serious issues that practitioners and scientists have faced in the past 30 years is the increase in prevalence of overweight and obesity among American women of childbearing age (Flegal et al., 1998; Mokdad et al., 1999; IOM, 2005; Kim et al. 2007). The prevalence of obesity in women 12 to 44 years of age has more than doubled since 1976 (Table 2-1). Data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in 1999-2004 showed that nearly two-thirds of women of childbearing age were classified as overweight (as defined by BMI 25 kg/m2) and almost one-third were obese (BMI 30 kg/m2) (personal communication, A. Branum, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], December 2008). Obesity is far more common among racial or ethnic minority groups and increases in prevalence with advancing age. Importantly, the prevalence of severe obesity, once a relatively rare condition, has increased dramatically among women of childbearing age (Table 2-1). Between 1979 and 2004, class I and II obesity doubled and class III obesity tripled. Trends are similar by age. The prevalence of all classes of obesity is lowest in white non-Hispanic women, and highest in non-Hispanic black women, where the prevalence of class I obesity approaches 25 percent, and the prevalence of class II and III obesity each exceeds 10 percent. Almost one-fifth of Hispanic women have class I obesity, with the proportions of class II and III obesity each approaching 10 percent.

Based on data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), one-fifth of American women are obese (BMI > 29 kg/m2) at the start of pregnancy, a figure that has risen 70 percent in the last decade (Kim et al., 2007) (Figure 2-1). Although the prevalence of overweight has increased slightly in the population as a whole and among black and white women, the prevalence of obesity doubled in white women and increased by 50 percent in black women. These statistics are based on data from only nine states; no nationally representative data are available from a modern cohort to provide trends in pregravid BMI values. FIGURE 2-1 Trends in the distribution of BMI* from 1993 to 2003 among prepregnant U.S. women in the total population and by race or ethnicity. *IOM BMI categories were used WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-4 Body Mass Index Classification The report Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990) recommended the use of BMI to classify maternal prepregnancy weight. The four prepregnancy BMI categories used in that report were selected to be consistent with 90 percent, 120 percent, and 135 percent of the 1959 Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's ideal weight-for-height standards\u2014the standard most commonly used in the United States when the report was written. Since then, the World Health Organization (WHO, 1998) has developed and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI, 1998) has adopted the use of new BMI categories. The WHO BMI categories are based on different considerations and, as a result, are defined differently than those in the Institute of Medicine (1990) report. The WHO BMI categories also include several grades or categories of obesity (see Table 2-2). The weight gain categories identified in IOM (1990) classify more women as underweight than the more stringent WHO cutoff point, while the WHO categories classify more women as overweight and fewer women as obese, with similar differences by race or ethnicity and age. In 1999-2004, with either the IOM or WHO cutoff points, about half of women are overweight (BMI > 26 with IOM cutoff point or > 25 with WHO cutoff point) (Figure 2-2). In addition, it is impractical to expect that pediatric growth charts are available in most obstetric practices. Adolescents that follow adult BMI cutoff points will likely be categorized in a lighter group and thus advised to gain more; however, young teens often need to gain more to improve birth weight outcomes.

Branum, CDC, Hyattsville, Md., April 15, 2008. Gestational Weight Gain Assessment of both prepregnant BMI and GWG requires rigorous methods of data collection (see Table 2-3). Unfortunately, most of the data available to the committee were not collected with a high level of rigor, and most studies relied on recalled weight values (see Table 2-4). Although the IOM (1990) report called for collection of national data on GWG, prepregnancy height, and weight for proper surveillance, today there are still no nationally representative data with which to study trends in GWG in the United States.

WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-8 Trends in Gestational Weight Gain The data obtained by standard U.S. birth certificates from 49 states illustrate that from 1990 to 2005 among mothers of term, singleton pregnancies, reported weight gains of < 16 pounds and > 40 pounds both increased (Figure 2-3). Weight gain within the broad recommended range (16 to 40 pounds) (IOM, 1990) declined slowly during this 15-year period. Unfortunately, the standard birth certificate lacks data on maternal prepregnancy weight and height. Thus, data from this source cannot provide information about GWG relative to prepregnant BMI category. In addition, the data on prepregnancy weight was self-report, which are more variable than clinical measures. The loss in precision and the degree of bias due to self report must be taken into account in interpreting self-reported data. Important differences were found in low and high gains by maternal race or ethnicity and age. The greatest increase in the proportion of women with a weight gain > 40 pounds from 1990 to 2005 was among white women (Figure 2-4). In 2005, adolescents (< 20 years old) were more likely to gain excessive weight during pregnancy than women 35 years of age and older. Between 1990 and 2005, there was a 31 percent increase in GWG of at least 40 pounds in singleton pregnancies among adolescents (NCHS, 2007a). In 2005, weight gain of < 15 pounds was more common among black and Hispanic than among white women (Figure 2-5). Within each racial or ethnic group, the proportion of women with low gains increased with advancing age.

Birth certificate data may yield more useful statistics for weight gain surveillance in the near future. After the IOM (1990) report called for collection of maternal prepregnancy weight and height, these fields were added to the 2003 revised U.S. birth certificate, and by 2006, 19 states were using the revised birth certificate. At present, the two large surveillance systems collecting data on GWG and prepregnancy BMI in the United States, PRAMS and PNSS, (see Appendix A for descriptions) permit identification of trends in recommended weight gains, although neither system is nationally representative. For PRAMS, GWG is taken from the birth certificate and other data is either pulled from medical records or maternal recall. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-10 PRAMS collects GWG data from birth certificates, and maternal prepregnancy height and weight are obtained from maternal interview in the postpartum period. Currently, 37 states, New York City and the Yankton Sioux Tribe (South Dakota) participate in PRAMS (Available online: http://www.cdc.gov/prams/ [accessed February 5, 2009]). For the analysis of trends in GWG reported here, data were limited to the eight PRAMS states with at least 70 percent response rates and to women with complete data on prepregnancy BMI and singleton, term pregnancies (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Maine, New York [excludes New York City], Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia). Limitations in the dataset, including self-reported weight, were considered. In 2002-2003, PRAMS data indicate that the mean GWG was highest in underweight and normal weight women and declined in overweight and obese women among all racial/ethnic groups (Figure 2-6). The mean GWG among underweight and normal weight women in all racial/ethnic groups was within the recommended range, whereas it was higher than the recommendations for overweight women. For obese women, average weight gains were well above the 15-pound recommended minimum. Similar trends were observed in 1992-1993 and 1998 (data not shown).

DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRENDS P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-11 In 2002-2003, nearly half of underweight women represented in the PRAMS data gained within the range recommended by IOM (1990), while 30.6 percent and 19.5 percent gained below and above the recommendations, respectively (Figure 2-7). For normal weight women, GWG varied little over this 10-year period. There was a small decrease in the proportion of women gaining less than, while a larger proportion of women gained in excess of the IOM (1990) recommendations. The majority of overweight women had weight gains greater than the recommended range (Figure 2-7). By 2002-2003, only about one-quarter of overweight women gained within the recommended range. For obese women, there was a modest rise in the prevalence of excessive weight gain from 1993-1994 to 2002-2003. By the end of the observation period, only one-third of obese women gained within the recommended range. Among women in all BMI categories, no more than 50 percent of women gained within the recommended range. FIGURE 2-7 Distribution of gestational weight gain by prepregnancy BMI category among singleton, term deliveries from 1993 to 2003.

WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-12 The other large data source, the PNSS, collects data on low-income women participating in public health programs (predominantly Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC]) from 26 states, five tribal governments, and one U.S. territory. For the analyses described below, data on pregravid BMI were used to determine whether weight gains fell above, within, or below the ranges recommended by IOM (1990). In this analysis, the data also were not limited to singleton, term pregnancies. The data from the PNSS show that from 1997 to 2007 in the total population of participating women, the proportion who gained within the range recommended by IOM (1990) changed very little within BMI groups (Figure 2- 8). During the observed period, less than 30 percent of women with BMIs in the normal, overweight, and obese categories gained within the recommended ranges. The percentage of underweight women gaining within the recommended range rose slightly from nearly 36 percent in 1997 to just over 40 percent by 2007, while the percentage gaining below the recommended range declined from 41 percent to 32 percent. Furthermore, by the end of the observation period, approximately 46 percent of normal weight women, 46 percent of obese women, and 59 percent of overweight gained in excess of the recommendations (IOM, 1990). Similar time trends were observed when the PNSS data were stratified by race or ethnicity. In all racial/ethnic groups, the rates of high weight gains increased, low weight gains decreased, and recommended weight gains varied little (Figure 2-9). Non-Hispanic black women and Hispanic women had similar rates of low weight gain and were more likely than non-Hispanic white women to gain less than the recommended levels. Non-Hispanic white women were most likely to gain weight above the recommendations (IOM, 1990). Taken together, data from PRAMS and PNSS illustrate that less than half of the women in these populations met the IOM (1990) recommendations for GWG. Importantly, none of the data highlighted here provide information on pattern of weight gain.

POSTPARTUM WEIGHT RETENTION Postpartum weight status is usually determined by subtracting the prepregnancy weight from a weight obtained at a time after delivery. Postpartum weight status for a population can be represented in a variety of ways, including absolute weight change, percentage who retain a specific amount of weight over the prepregnancy weight (e.g., 10 or 20 pounds), or proportion of women whose BMI category changes from before to after pregnancy. Furthermore, it is important to assess postpartum weight retention according to both prepregnancy body size (e.g., BMI) and adequacy of GWG. Therefore, studies of population trends in maternal postpartum weight retention build upon and extend the data required to assess the adequacy of GWG. Unlike pregnancy, when maternal weight is monitored and routinely recorded in the clinical record, data on maternal postpartum weights are not widely available, particularly for times later in the year after birth. In addition to the data on GWG provided by PNSS, this surveillance system also collects cross-sectional data on maternal weight at the mother's WIC recertification visit in the postpartum period. From 2004 to 2006, there were more than 1.4 million postpartum records with GWG and prepregnancy BMI in PNSS, but only about 49,000 of these occurred at 6 months postpartum or later and therefore provided useful information on postpartum weight retention in this low-income population sample (personal communication, A. Sharma, CDC, Atlanta, Ga., December 2008). Notably, PNSS data are not nationally representative and the women with postpartum records at > 24 weeks' postpartum were less likely to be non-Hispanic white and more likely to be Hispanic compared to the women with an early postpartum PNSS record. These data suggest that at 6 months postpartum or later (median [SD], 30.6 [5.1] weeks), the mean postpartum weight retention was 11.8 (15.3) pounds. Approximately half of women retained more than 10 pounds, and one-quarter retained more than 20 pounds (personal DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRENDS P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-15 communication, A. Sharma, CDC, Atlanta, Ga., December 2008). In this sample, black women retained more weight postpartum than white or Hispanic women in every BMI and weight gain category (Figure 2-10). In all BMI categories and racial/ethnic groups, mean postpartum weight retention and the percentage of women retaining > 20 and > 10 pounds increased as GWG category increased (Figure 2-11). Among all women who gained above the range recommended by IOM (1990), mean postpartum weight retention was 15 to 20 pounds (Figure 2-10). When analyses were restricted to data collected at 24 weeks' postpartum or later, more than 60 percent of women in all racial/ethnic groups who gained above the range recommended by IOM (1990) retained > 10 pounds postpartum. More than 40 percent of women who gained excessively retained > 20 pounds (Figure 2-11).

The Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II) is a federally sponsored longitudinal study of approximately 4,000 mother-infant pairs that included questions about postpartum weight retention. Respondents were more likely to be non-Hispanic white and to have higher education and lower parity than the general U.S. population. At 2.0-4.9 months postpartum, one-third of women retained > 10 pounds and 12 percent retained > 20 pounds. At 11-13.9 months, only 24 percent of women retained > 10 pounds, but 12 percent still retained > 20 pounds (derived from IFPS II. Available online: http://www.cdc.gov/ifps/questionnaires.htm [accessed April 28, 2009]). In all BMI categories and at each postpartum visit, mean postpartum weight retention and the percentage of women retaining > 20 and > 10 pounds increased as GWG category increased (Figure 2-12). For normal weight and underweight women, weight retention decreased as time postpartum increased in all weight gain categories (classified according to IOM, 1990). Normal weight women who gained above the range recommended by IOM (1990), however, had a decrease in mean postpartum weight through 39 weeks' postpartum, but had an increase in their mean postpartum weight at 55 weeks (Figure 2-13). For overweight and obese women who gained above the recommended range, mean postpartum weight decreased as postpartum time increased, while obese women who gained less than the range recommended by IOM (1990) gained weight across the postpartum period. Importantly, obese women who gained within or less than the recommended range maintained a postpartum weight below their prepregnancy weight.

DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-18 In summary, taken together, data from both the PNSS and the IFPS II suggest that gaining above the range recommended by IOM (1990) is associated with excess maternal weight retention postpartum, regardless of prepregnancy BMI. The data from the IFPS II highlight that for most women, weight retention declines as time postpartum increases. However, postpartum weight retention remains a problem for a large proportion of mothers, even at one year after birth. These data also show that obese women who gained within or below the recommended ranges experienced a net loss in weight from their prepregnancy weight. However, for those who gained below their recommended range, the more time that passed after the birth, the more they experienced a net increase in weight and approached their prepregnancy weight. The racially diverse PNSS suggests that among low-income women, black women retain more weight than white or Hispanic women regardless of their prepregnancy weight or GWG category. Compared with the IFPS II, which is a higher-income sample, the low-income women in PNSS retained more weight. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF MOTHERS Since 1990, there has been an increase in the racial and ethnic diversity of U.S. births (Table 2-5). A greater proportion of infants in 2005 were born to nonwhite mothers, with the largest increase in births from Hispanic mothers. Childbearing by unmarried mothers sharply increased in this 15-year period to a record high of 36.9 percent. More mothers attained high levels of education; in 2005, more than one-quarter of mothers had 16 years or more of education. The proportion of births for mothers 35 years and older also increased substantially in this interval. Although the teenage birth rate had been steadily declining since 1991, preliminary data from 2006 suggest that the overall birth rate for teenagers rose 3 percent to 41.9 births per 1,000 females 15-19 years of age. Teenage mothers 10-14 years of age were the only group that did not experience an increase in birth rate during this time. Finally, the proportion of mothers who reported any smoking during pregnancy declined by about 50 percent over the rates reported prior to 1990 (CDC, 2004).

Lifestyle Characteristics Dietary Practices Dietary intake No comprehensive national data is available on dietary intake practices of pregnant women. However, data from other surveys indicates that population-wide, less than 2 percent of females 14-30 years of age and less than 6 percent of females 31-50 years of age met WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-20 the recommended number of combined fruit and vegetable servings in 1999-2000 (Guenther et al., 2006) (Figure 2-14). Additionally, approximately two-thirds of women ages 14-50 years of age did not consume at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day (BRFSS, 2007; Serdula et al., 2004). See Appendix B for additional information on nutritional intake. No other nationally representative data on dietary intake among pregnant women or women of childbearing age are available. Among the population as a whole ages 19-39 years, total energy intake increased by 18 percent (1,856 to 2,198 kilocalories [kcal] per day) from 1977- 1978 to 1994-1996. This included a sharp 58 percent increase in energy from snacks (244 to 387 kcal/d) as well as the proportion of total energy from fast foods and meals eaten at restaurants, including fast-food establishments (Nielsen et al., 2002). In addition, the proportion of energy from soft drinks nearly tripled; energy from fruit drinks doubled, while energy from milk decreased (Nielsen and Popkin, 2004). From 1994-1996 to 1999-2000, there was little change in overall diet quality as measured by the Healthy Eating Index 2005 (Guenther et al., 2006). American's diets consistently met national recommendations for total grains and meat or beans, but were far below the recommendation for whole grains, dark-green and orange vegetables, and legumes. Intakes of sodium and energy from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars were well above national recommendations. 28.329.738.1 5.41.1 1.5 0102030405060708090100 14-18 GroupPercent of Childbearing-Aged WomenConsumed Recommended Servings per Day Consumed 5 Servings per Day F IGURE 2-14 Percentage of U.S. childbearing-aged women who consumed the recommended number of servings of fruits and vegetables per day and five servings of fruits and vegetables per day.

DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRENDS P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-21 Dieting There was a steady rise in the prevalence of attempted weight loss among women of childbearing age from 1989 to 2000 (Serdula et al., 1994, 1999; Bish et al., 2005). In 2000, 60 and 70 percent of overweight and obese women, respectively, were attempting to lose weight, while 29 percent of women whose BMI was < 25 kg/m2 also were attempting to lose weight (Bish et al., 2005). Importantly, data from the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) also suggest an increase in the prevalence of attempted weight loss among women who reported being pregnant. In 1989, 3.6 percent of pregnant women who participated in the BRFSS said that they were attempting to lose weight (Cogswell et al., 1996). This figure doubled to 7.5 percent in 2003 (Bish et al., 2009). Furthermore, in 2003, 34.3 percent of women were trying to maintain their weight, that is, to keep from gaining weight (Bish et al., 2009). Food insecurity Food insecurity is defined as \"whenever the availability of nutritionally adequate and safe food or the ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways is limited or uncertain.\" In 2006, 10.9 percent of U.S. households (12.6 million) had either low food security (6.9 percent) or very low food security (4.0 percent). It is difficult to obtain a nutrient-dense diet in an environment of food insecurity, and this has important implications for GWG (USDA; available online at http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/ERR49/ERR49.pdf [accessed April 21, 2009]). Pregnancy and lactation require modest increases in energy but greater increases in vitamin and mineral intake. For pregnant women to gain an appropriate amount of weight and meet their nutrient requirements, dietary changes to promote high nutrient density and appropriate energy intake is required. Unfortunately, the lack of nationally representative data on pregnant and postpartum women limits understanding of dietary trends among this important population subgroup. Physical Activity Healthy People 2010 ( DHHS, 2000) and the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines (DHHS, 2008) provide recommended levels of physical activity and emphasize that inactivity has adverse health consequences. Data from the BRFSS indicate that although the proportion of women of childbearing age who reported no recreational physical activity decreased between 1994 and 2004, one in five women aged 18-29 years of age and almost a quarter of those in their thirties and forties reported no physical activity in 2004 (Figure 2-15) (CDC, 2005). Similarly, barely half of women of childbearing age met the guideline in Healthy People 2010 for aerobic activity in 2005, although the prevalence has increased significantly since 2001 (Figure 2-16) (CDC, 2007).

In 2000, 15.8 percent of pregnant women met minimum physical activity recommendations (Evenson et al., 2004) and only 6 percent of pregnant women met recommendations for vigorous DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRENDS P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-23 physical activity (Petersen et al., 2005). In these analyses, physical activity varied by maternal race/ethnicity, age, and education; and there was some evidence that physical activity was lower among women who worked outside the home. In 2005, almost half of white, non-Hispanic U.S. women of all ages met the Healthy People 2010 objective for physical activity; only 36 percent of black, non-Hispanic women, 40 percent of Hispanic women, and 47 percent of other-race women did so (CDC, 2007). Physical activity increased with education, from 37 percent among women who did not graduate from high school to 53.3 percent among college graduates (CDC, 2007). In summary, a high proportion of women of childbearing age fail to meet current guidelines for physical activity before or during pregnancy. The committee identified only limited data on physical activity or inactivity among pregnant women. The committee identified no data on postpartum mothers or physical activity according to BMI and weight change before, during, and after pregnancy. Psychological Characteristics Depression Changes in appetite and weight are among the diagnostic criteria for major depression (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). In their meta-analysis, Gaynes et al. (2005) estimated that one in seven women will develop depression during pregnancy or after delivery. Although nationally representative data specific to women during and after pregnancy are not available, data for U.S. women of childbearing age illustrate striking increases in the prevalence of major depression from 1991-1992 to 2001-2002 in the total population and among white and black women (Figure 2-17) (Compton et al., 2006). Similar trends were observed among women 30 to 44 years of age, but the rates of major depression were lower than those of women age 18-29 years. Given that more than 10 percent of women of childbearing age may be depressed, screening and intervention for symptoms of depression during pregnancy may be required to achieve better GWG.

WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-24 Other Psychological Characteristics Other psychological factors that may influence GWG include stress, social support, and attitude toward weight gain (see Chapter 4). The committee did not identify any nationally representative data specific to women during and after pregnancy that were indicative of trends or prevalence of these factors related to GWG. PREGNANCY OUTCOMES RELATED TO GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN Gestational Diabetes Data from birth certificates collected nationally illustrate that there has been a striking increase in the prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy in each age group (Figure 2-18), with the largest increase over time among women in the oldest age group (40 or more). However, the majority of birth certificates did not distinguish between pre-gestational diabetes (diagnosis before the index pregnancy) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM; diagnosis during the index pregnancy). With data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey from 1989 to 2004, Getahun et al. (2008) determined trends in the prevalence of GDM among U.S. women 14 to 45 years of age. GDM increased by 122 percent, from 1.9 percent in 1989-1990 to 4.2 percent in 2003-2004. Furthermore, among women 35 years of age and older, the rate for GDM was highest among black women.

(2008) investigated population trends in the incidence rates of pregnancy- induced hypertension (preeclampsia and gestational hypertension [see Appendix A for definitions]) in the United States for 1987-2004 with data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey. The age-adjusted rate of preeclampsia increased 25 percent from 1987-1988 to 2003- 2004. Gestational hypertension rates nearly tripled during the same period (Figure 2-19). The authors noted that clinical diagnostic criteria, revised in the 1990s, may have simultaneously caused an exaggerated rise in the rate of gestational hypertension and an attenuated increase in the rate of preeclampsia over the study period. They concluded that the small but consistent elevation in the rate of preeclampsia is a conservative estimate of the true population-level change.

WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-26 Cesarean Delivery T he rate of total cesarean deliveries in the United States increased almost fivefold between 1970 and 1988 and then declined to 20.7 percent in 1996 (Figure 2-20). Since then, the rate increased 50 percent to 31.1 percent\u2014the highest rate ever recorded\u2014in 2006 (Menacker et al., 2006; MacDorman et al., 2008). Primary cesareans (births to women with no previous cesarean delivery) mirror the pattern for total cesareans, while vaginal birth after a previous cesarean (VBAC) increased beginning in the mid-1980s, peaked in 1996, and then has declined since that time (MacDorman et al., 2008). An increase in primary cesarean deliveries appears to be the result of changes in obstetric practice rather than in medical risk profiles or maternal request (Menacker et al., 2006; MacDorman et al., 2008). However, a recent meta-analysis concluded that maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of cesarean delivery (Chu et al., 2007). The expanded availability of BMI data in U.S. birth certificates since 2003 will allow future researchers to more clearly understand relationships between maternal prepregnancy BMI, GWG, and cesarean deliveries in the United States. F IGURE 2-20 Total and primary cesarean rate, 1970-2004, and VBAC, NCHS, PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-27 Maternal Mortality T he crude maternal mortality rate (deaths per 100,000) steadily decreased in the United States from 83.3 in 1950 to 8.2 in 1990; increased rates since 2000 are believed to be due to changes in coding and increased surveillance (Hoyert, 2007; available online at http://mchb.hrsa.gov/whusa08/hstat/mh/pages/237mm.html [accessed January 14, 2009]). Nonetheless, in 2005, the age-adjusted maternal mortality rate was 9.6 for non-Hispanic white, 8.2 for Hispanic or Latina, and 31.7 for non-Hispanic black mothers, indicating an important disparity by race. Furthermore, among women 35 years and older the mortality rate in 2005 was 28.9 for white women and 112.8 for black women (NCHS, 2007b). A recent case-control study based on a statewide Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review in Florida reported that maternal mortality was increased three-, four-, and fivefold with class I (BMI 30-34.9), class II (BMI 35- 39.9), and class III obesity (BMI 40), respectively. Given the rising rates of obesity in the population, additional studies on obesity and maternal mortality are needed (Thompson et al., 2005). Infant Mortality The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants less than 1 year of age per 1,000 live births) in the United States was 6.71 in 2005 (MacDorman et al., 2008). The dramatic decrease in infant mortality that occurred during the last half of the twentieth century has slowed since 2000 (Figure 2-21), and the United States has fallen behind many other developed countries in infant survival (NCHS, 2007b). Trends are similar for other measures, including early and late neonatal mortality and post-neonatal mortality, although perinatal mortality has continued to decrease steadily since 1990 (Martin et al., 2008). Disparities in infant mortality according to maternal racial or ethnic group continue (Figure 2-22). In 2005, the infant mortality rate for non-Hispanic black mothers was three times higher than for Cuban mothers, who had the lowest rate; Puerto Rican and American Indian or Alaskan Native mothers also had rates above the national average. 05101520253035404550 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2004 YearDeaths per 1,000 Live BirthsBlack All races White FIGURE 2-21 Infant mortality rates in the United States, 1950 through 2004, by race.

Birth Weight There is a strong association between very low birth weight (due to preterm delivery or extreme fetal growth restriction) and infant mortality that decreases as birth weight increases until it reaches about 4,500 g, when there is a slight increase in infant mortality due to problems associated with macrosomia (Mathews and MacDorman, 2007). Although rates of infant morality have decreased over time, the reverse J-shape of this relationship has not changed. The proportion of small infants increased and large infants decreased among all reported births between 1990 and 2005 (Figure 2-23). This downward shift in the overall distribution of birth weight is attributable in part to an increase in multiple births, but the pattern is similar for singleton births. Other possible explanations for these trends in birth weight include a greater prevalence of older mothers, who tend to have more complications of pregnancy, as well as increased use of assisted reproductive technology and obstetrical procedures, including labor induction and elective cesarean deliveries. FIGURE 2-23 Percentage distribution of births by birth weight, United States, 1990 and 2005. SOURCE: NCHS, 2007a. DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRENDS P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-29 Rates for low birth weight and very low birth weight increased in the United States between 1990 and 2005, when the overall rate of low birth weight among singletons was 6.41 percent and the overall rate of very low birth weight was 1.14 percent. The lowest rates of low birth weight are among Hispanics and white infants, the highest among black infants; Native American, and Asian-Pacific Islander infants fall in between (Figure 2-24). Low birth weight also varies by maternal age, with greater prevalence among women < 20 and > 40 years of age (Martin et al., 2008). 4681 01214 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 YearPercent of U.S. Live BirthsWhite, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native Asian/Pacific Islander Hispanic FIGURE 2-24 Trends in low birth weight of live-born singleton infants in the United States from 1990 through 2005, by race and ethnic background.

Small-for-Gestational Age Births Small-for-gestational age (SGA) is used as a proxy to examine poor fetal growth (see Chapter 4) but can also include infants who are small but healthy due to their familial genetic background (Jaquet et al., 2005; Svensson et al, 2006). SGA rates for all groups decreased between 1990 and 2000 and then increased in 2005 (Table 2-6). Rates among non-Hispanic black infants were almost twice as high as those of white infants and were not appreciably different by gender. However, Hispanic and Asian female infants had lower SGA rates than males.

Reasons for this decrease are not known but could include routine testing for GDM and increased cesarean deliveries performed at earlier gestational ages (Menacker et al., 2006).

WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-32 Preterm Birth In 2005, 12.5 percent of all births were delivered preterm. The preterm birth rate has increased 20 percent since 1990 and 9 percent since 2000 (Figure 2-25). The greatest increase has been among late preterm births, those occurring at 34-36 weeks' gestation, which have climbed 25 percent since 1990. The preterm birth rate for singleton gestations increased 13 percent from 1990 to 2005, again with late preterm births accounting for a majority of the increase. An increase in the rates of cesarean deliveries and induced births contributes to but does not completely explain this trend in late preterm births (March of Dimes, available online at http://www.marchofdimes.com/files/MP_Late_Preterm_Birth-Every_Week_Matters_3-24- 06.pdf [accessed January 14, 2009]). There is a striking racial disparity in the rate of preterm birth (Figure 2-26). In the past 15 years, non-Hispanic black women were about twice as likely as non-Hispanic white women to deliver before 37 weeks' gestation. Since 1990, the preterm birth rate increased 38 percent for non-Hispanic whites and 10 percent for Hispanic births. There was a decrease in preterm births among non-Hispanic black mothers through most of the 1990s. However, the preterm birth rate is up 12 percent since 2000.

Breastfeeding Analysis of data from the Ross Laboratories Mothers Survey, a large, national survey (Ryan et al., 2002), shows that the rates of breastfeeding initiation (in-hospital) and breastfeeding at six months rose by 16 percent and 14 percent, respectively, in the 1990s. In 2001, rates were at their highest point in 40 years (Figures 2-27 and 2-28). Recent data from the National Immunization Survey, a population-based survey conducted by the CDC, shows that these rates continued to rise from 2000 to 2004. There are remarkable disparities in rates of breastfeeding. Mothers who were white or Hispanic, older, college-educated, and not enrolled in WIC were significantly more likely to breastfeed and exclusively breastfeed in the hospital and at six months (Ryan et al., 2002).

Childhood Obesity Nationally representative data show continuous increases in obesity (BMI 95th percentile) among American school-aged children and adolescents from 1980 to the present (http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/childhood/prevalence.htm; Accessed April 15, 2009) (Figure 2-29). Recent data suggest that this trend may be slowing (Ogden et al., 2008). Population estimates from 2003 through 2006 suggest that almost a third of 2-19 year olds were at or above the 85th BMI percentile for sex and age (Ogden et al., 2008). Of these, 16 percent were above the 95th percentile, well above the Healthy People 2010 goal of 5 percent, and 11.3 percent were above 97th percentile (rates of high BMI varied by age and race-ethnicity). Non- Hispanic black adolescents have a dramatically greater prevalence of overweight compared to non-Hispanic whites; Mexican American girls also have somewhat higher rates (Table 2-8).

F INDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Findings 1. Since the release of the weight gain recommendations of IOM (1990): There has been a striking increase in the prevalence of maternal overweight and obesity, particularly among black, Hispanic, and older women; There has been an increase in the racial and ethnic diversity of U.S. births, as well as a rise in the proportion of older and unmarried mothers and a decrease in the proportion of teenaged mothers; and Low (< 16-pound) and high (> 40-pound) GWG has become more common. 2. American women of childbearing age are far from meeting national goals for dietary intake and physical activity, yet there is a dearth of nationally representative data on dietary intake, dieting practices and food insecurity, among women of childbearing age in general and among pregnant women in particular. 3. About half of reproductive-aged American women are trying to lose weight, and another one-third of pregnant women may be attempting to maintain their weight. The prevalence of attempted weight loss during pregnancy doubled in the past 20 years. 4. Rates of preterm birth, GDM, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are increasing. The rise in cesarean births and the decline in LGA births appear to result from medical practice patterns and social factors. 5. In the past 10 years, improvements that were observed during the twentieth century in maternal mortality and poor infant outcomes (mortality and low birth weight) have declined or ceased. 6. There are racial and ethnic disparities in nearly all weight-related predictors and outcomes reviewed. 7. Currently available data sources are inadequate for studying national trends in GWG. Even after the IOM (1990) report called for more sophisticated analyses, major gaps in GWG surveillance remain; specifically, data on prepregnancy weight and height, reliance on self-reported weight gain, and nationally representative sources are lacking. 8. Gestational weight gain in excess of the recommended range for BMI is associated with significant postpartum weight retention. 9. Major gaps in surveillance of postpartum weight exist. Notably, most national studies lack data on postpartum weight and/or the variables needed for its proper interpretation WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 2-36 (namely, prepregnancy height and weight, GWG, dietary intake, physic al activity, and breastfeeding status). Action Recommendations Action Recommendation 2-1: The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services conduct routine surveillance of GWG and postpartum weight retention on a nationally representative sample of women and report the results by prepregnancy BMI (including all classes of obesity), age, racial/ethnic group, and socioeconomic status. Action Recommendation 2-2: The committee recommends that all states adopt the revised version of the birth certificate, which includes fields for maternal prepregnancy weight, height, weight at delivery, and gestational age at the last measured weight. In addition, all states should strive for 100 percent completion of these fields on birth certificates and collaborate to share data, thereby allowing a complete national picture as well as regional snapshots. Supporting Actions 1. At the first prenatal visit, health care providers should record weight at last menstrual period and maternal height without shoes. Gestational weight gain should be based on measured weights (in light clothing and no shoes) abstracted from prenatal records. Gestational age at the last recorded weight should be documented, preferably through an early ultrasound, to properly evaluate adequacy of weight gain. To aid in data analysis, all data should be collected in a continuous form rather than categorically. 2. As part of maternal weight surveillance, health-care providers should document the prevalence of obesity grades I, II, and II rather than categorize women into one obesity group (BMI > 30 kg/m2). Areas for Additional Investigation The committee identified the following areas for further investigation to support its research recommendations: The research community should conduct future monitoring of GWG; and Federal agencies should standardize the use of the WHO BMI cutoff points in all data collection relevant to monitoring weight gain in pregnancy.

DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRENDS P Composition and Components of Gestational Weight Gain: Physiology and Metabolism Gestational weight gain (GWG) is a unique and complex biological phenomenon that supports the functions of growth and development of the fetus. Gestational weight gain is influenced not only by changes in maternal physiology and metabolism, but also by placental metabolism (Figure 3-1). The placenta functions as an endocrine organ, a barrier, and a transporter of substances between maternal and fetal circulation. Changes in maternal homeostasis can modify placental structure and function and thus impact fetal growth rate. Conversely, placental function may influence maternal metabolism through alterations in insulin sensitivity and systemic inflammation and, thus influence GWG. This chapter provides relevant background material on normal physiologic and metabolic changes that occur during pregnancy and are related to GWG. The discussion begins with a review of total and pattern of GWG in singleton, twin, and triplet pregnancies. Next, the unique chemical composition and accretion rates of maternal, placental, and fetal components of GWG are presented, followed by discussions of fundamental biology of fetal and placental growth and fetal-placental physiology underlying GWG. Lastly, pathophysiologic conditions that may adversely affect GWG are reviewed to provide a foundation for understanding changes in body weight and composition during pregnancy.

WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-2 2TOTAL AND PATTERN OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN Total Gestational Weight Gain The total amount of weight gained in normal-term pregnancies varies considerably among women. Nevertheless, some generalizations can be made regarding tendencies and patterns of GWG in singleton and multiple pregnancies. Singleton Pregnancies An examination of studies published in the United States from 1985 to the present indicate that the mean total GWG of normal weight adult women giving birth to term infants ranged from a low of 10.0 to a high of 16.7 kg (Appendix C [Tables C-1A and C-1B] contains a tabular summary of the studies examined by the committee). Among adolescents, in general, GWG tended to be higher compared with adult women (means ranged from 14.6 to 18.0 kg in the studies examined). A consistent finding across studies was an inverse relationship between GWG and pregravid body mass index (BMI). Figure 3-2 illustrates a similar relationship with data derived from Abrams et al. (1986). Since the release of the report, Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990) and its guidelines for GWG, a number of studies have examined GWG among overweight and obese women. Bianco et al. (1998) found that the mean GWG for 613 obese (BMI > 35) women averaged 9.1 \u00b1 7.4 kg. Thirteen percent of the women, however, gained more than 16 kg, and 9 percent either lost or failed to gain weight. In a cohort study using birth certificate data from 120,251 obese women in Missouri, 18, 30, and 40 percent of the women gained < 6.8 kg in obese classes I, II, and III, respectively. The amount of total gain associated with minimal risk for preeclampsia, caesarean delivery, large for gestational age (LGA), and small for gestational age (SGA) outcomes was 4.6-11.4, and 0-4.1 for class I and II obesity, respectively; and weight loss of 0-4.1 kg for class III obesity (Kiel et al., 2007) (see Chapter 2 for definition of obesity classes). A prospective study of a cohort of 245,526 Swedish women confirmed that GWG among obese women (BMI = 30-34.9) and very obese women (BMI 35) was lower (11.1 and 8.7 kg, respectively) than among non-obese women (Cedergren, 2006). Low GWG (< 8 kg) occurred in 30.2 and 44.6 percent of the obese and very obese women, respectively. Among the 62,167 women in the Danish National Birth Cohort with data on GWG, about 36 percent of the obese women exhibited low rates of gain (0.28 kg per week). Fifty percent gained between 0.28 and 0.68 kg per week, and 14 percent gained > 0.68 kg per week (Nohr et al., 2007). Obese women (BMI = 30-40) participating in a prenatal intervention gained less weight (adjusted GWG = 7.52 kg) than controls (adjusted GWG = 9.78 kg), and experienced no difference in pregnancy outcome (Claesson et al., 2008). In summary, from a population perspective, obese women as a group gain less weight than non-obese women, nevertheless GWG can vary widely.

Twin Pregnancies Total GWG in twin pregnancies is generally higher than in singleton pregnancies; averaging from 15 to 22 kg (Appendix C, Table C-2). Outcomes associated with GWG in twin pregnancies, as with singleton pregnancies, are a function of pregravid BMI. Several studies have shown that, when stratified by pregravid BMI, increased GWG is associated with increased twin birth weight among underweight, normal weight, and overweight, but not obese, women (Brown and Schloesser, 1990; Luke et al., 1992; Lantz et al., 1996). Yeh and Shelton (2007) found that mean twin birth weights in the population studied increased incrementally from 2,237 g to 2,753 g for total GWG < 35, 35-45, 46-55, and > 55 pounds, respectively. The odds, however, of having a twin delivery at > 36 weeks gestation and birth weight > 2,500 g were significantly lower among w omen who gained < 35 pounds (AOR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.37-0.65) and significantly higher among > 55 pounds (AOR 2.24, 95% CI: 1.51-3.33) compared to those who gained 35-45 pounds. Interestingly, GWG > 55 pounds was associated with an approximate 1.5 times greater likelihood of having a maternal complication (cumulative of GDM, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and anemia [AOR 1.63, 95% CI also of having a cesarean delivery [AOR 1.85, 95% CI 1.20-2.87]). The cumulative weight gain stratified by pregravid BMI for mothers of twins born at 37-42 weeks of gestation and with an average twin birth weight 2,500 g is shown in Table 3-1. Cumulative and rates of weight gain by trimester are presented in Appendix C, Tables C-3A and C-3B. In summary, GWG in twin gestations mirrors that in singleton pregnancies, i.e. there is an inverse relationship between maternal GWG and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. These results suggest that a balance is needed between optimal GWG for maternal and twin outcomes.

Hediger, Ph.D. For more details on this historical cohort, see Luke et al. (2003). Triplet and Quadruplet Pregnancies Fewer studies are available on triplet and quadruplet pregnancies (Appendix C, Table C-2). In a large cohort study, GWG among mothers carrying triplets was found to range from 20.5 to 23.0 kg at 32-34 weeks and for quadruplets from 20.8 to 31.0 kg at 31-32 weeks (Luke, 1998). In the same cohort, the mean total GWG in 38 triplet pregnancies was found to be 20.2 kg at 33.4 weeks (Luke et al., 1995). The rate of gain before 24 weeks gestation was 0.48 kg per week and 0.96 kg per week after 24 weeks (Luke et al., 1995). In data from a different cohort, GWG was found to be a function of BMI category. Median GWG was 15.5, 21.8, and 15 kg for low-, normal-, and high-BMI categories, respectively (Eddib et al., 2007). Pattern of Gestational Weight Gain The pattern of GWG is most commonly described as sigmoidal (Hytten and Chamberlain, 1991), but linear, concave, and convex patterns of weight gain have been observed as well (Villamor et al., 1998). Singleton Pregnancies In the report Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990) the average rates of GWG for well- nourished women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies are reported as approximately 0.45 kg per week during the second trimester and 0.40 kg per week during the third trimester. Several studies, published since that report, indicate that higher rates of GWG in the second and third COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-5 trimesters are common among American women with normal range BMI values (Appendix C, Tables C-1A and C-1B). The pattern of GWG by maternal BMI category was examined in a large cohort of women from University of California, San Francisco (Abrams, et al., 1995; Carmichael et al., 1997). Mean rate of gain was 0.169 kg per week in the first trimester. Mean weight gains were higher in the second (0.563 kg per week) than the third trimester (0.518 kg per week) in all groups except for obese women. The average gains in the second and third trimester were higher in underweight and normal weight women than in overweight and obese women. Birth weight was correlated most strongly with gain in the second trimester (32.8 g/kg GWG versus 18 and 17 g/kg in the first and third trimesters, respectively). In another study, mean rates of GWG in non-obese, low-income black and white women were 2.48 kg in the first trimester and 0.49 and 0.45 kg per week in the second and third trimesters, respectively (Hickey et al., 1995). In contrast, rates of weight gain of predominantly Hispanic women ( n = 7,589) participating in the Prematurity Prevention Project were similar in the second (0.52 kg per week) and third trimesters (0.53 kg per week) (Siega-Riz et al., 1996). In this study, the third-trimester gain was slightly lower in women who delivered preterm (0.50 vs. 0.53 kg per week). A similar pattern of GWG was found in adolescents, although the median gain and rate of gain were higher throughout gestation. From mid-pregnancy to term the rate of gain was 0.51 kg per week (Hediger et al., 1990). In summary, the pattern of GWG is generally higher in the second trimester and is related to maternal pregravid BMI. However, pattern of GWG can vary depending on maternal ethnicity and age. Twin Pregnancies A series of observational studies examined outcomes associated with the rate of GWG in women with twin pregnancies who delivered infants at 37-42 weeks gestation with mean birth weights exceeding 2,500 g. Luke et al. (1992) found that low rate of GWG, defined as < 1.0 pound/week, was associated with a significantly lower mean birth weight for twins compared to singletons ( , -0.137; p = 0.001). Significantly higher rates of GWG in the third trimester were observed among women whose mean birth weights for twins was > 2,500 g compared to women w ith birth weights for twin that was < 2,500 g, regardless of BMI category. No significant differences were seen for first and second trimester GWG rates. Among a large multiethnic population of 646 twin pregnancies at > 28 weeks gestation, birth w eight increased by 14, 20, and 17 g for each pound of weight gained between 0 and 20 weeks gestation, 20 and 28 weeks gestation, and 28 weeks to birth, respectively (Luke et al., 1997). Mean total GWG was 17.4 kg in a larger cohort of 1,564 twin births of > 28 weeks' gestation from the same population (Luke et al., 1998). In a another study from the same population database, Luke et al. (2003) found that rates of GWG associated with optimal outcomes were greater for underweight and normal weight women than for overweight and obese women. These results are similar to those of singleton pregnancies. COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN As pregnancy progresses, protein, fat, water, and minerals are deposited in the fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid, uterus, mammary gland, blood, and adipose tissue (Figure 3-3). The products of conception (placenta, fetus, amniotic fluid) comprise approximately 35 percent of the total GWG (Pitkin, 1976).

Reprinted with permission. Maternal Components of Gestational Weight Gain Total Body Water Accretion Total body water (TBW) accretion is highly variable during pregnancy and largely under hormonal control. Across several studies, TBW accretion measured by deuterium or antipyrine tracers averaged about 7-8 liters (L) in healthy pregnancies (Hytten and Chamberlain, 1991). Expansion of the extracellular fluid (ECF) measured using the tracer sodium thiocyanate is estimated to be about 6-7 L. For a reference 12.5-kg GWG, total water gain at term is distributed in the fetus (2,414 g), placenta (540 g), amniotic fluid (792 g), blood-free uterus (800 g), mammary gland (304 g), blood (1,267 g), and extravascular-ECF (1,496 g) with no edema or edema, and ECF with generalized edema (4,697 g) (Hytten and Chamberlain, 1991). Maternal age, parity, and height did not affect the incidence of edema, but overweight women had greater generalized edema than underweight women. As pregnancy advances, plasma volume expansion measured using Evans blue dye increases up to 45 percent (Rosso, 1990). Maternal plasma volume expansion correlates positively with birth weight. Monthly bioimpedance analysis (BIA) measurements in 170 healthy pregnant women confirmed the progressive expansion of TBW, intracellular water (ICW), and ECF during pregnancy (Larciprete et al., 2003). Total body water accretion was positively correlated with birth weight, in agreement with other investigations (Langhoof-Roos et al., 1987; Lederman et al., 1997; Mardones-Santander et al., 1998; Butte et al., 2003). COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-7 Fat-Free Mass P rotein Accretion Protein is accrued predominantly in the fetus (42 percent), but also in the uterus (17 percent), blood (14 percent), placenta (10 percent), and breasts (8 percent) (Hytten and Chamberlain, 1991). Protein accrual occurs predominantly in late pregnancy. Protein deposition has been estimated from measurements of total body potassium (TBK) accretion measured by whole-body counting in a number of studies of pregnant women (King et al., 1973; Emerson et al., 1975; Pipe et al., 1979; Forsum et al., 1988; Butte et al., 2003). King et al. (1973) observed a rate of TBK accretion of 24 milliequivalents (meq) per week between 26 and 40 weeks' gestation. Pipe et al. (1979) found a 312 meq potassium (K) increase. Lower increments of 110 and 187 meq at 36 weeks were found over pregravid values in two other studies (Forsum et al., 1988; Butte et al., 2003). Based on a potassium-nitrogen ratio in fetal tissues of 2.15 meq potassium/g nitrogen, the total protein deposition estimated from the longitudinal studies of King et al. (1973), Pipe et al. (1979), Forsum et al. (1988), and Butte et al. (2003) is 686 g. A study of 108 black adolescents, showed a mean rate of TBK accretion of 21 meq per week between 16 and 35 weeks' gestation, consistent with adult studies (Stevens-Simon et al., 1997). In summary, these recent studies suggest that protein accretion may be less than the approximate (~1 kg) estimates of the earlier findings of Hytten and Chamberlin (1991). Fat Mass Fat Accretion The distribution of fat deposited during pregnancy is distinct to pregnancy. Figure 3-4 shows that, based on serial measurements of skinfold thickness at seven sites made in 84 healthy, pregnant women, fat appears to be deposited preferentially over the hips, back, and upper thighs up to about 30 weeks gestation (Taggart et al., 1967).

WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-8 Evidence using computer tomography in 14 women suggests that childbearing may be associated with preferential deposition of visceral fat (Gunderson et al., 2008). However, the majority of fat deposited during pregnancy is subcutaneous. Magnetic resonance imaging to assess fat deposition and distribution in 15 healthy women before and after pregnancy (Sohlstrom and Forsum, 1995) found that of the adipose tissue gained during pregnancy, 76 percent was deposited subcutaneously, similar to the fat distribution before pregnancy. Of the total fat deposition, 46 percent was in the lower trunk, 32 percent in the upper trunk, 16 percent in the thighs, 1 percent in the calves, 4 percent in the upper arms, and 1 percent in the forearms. Postpartum, fat was mobilized more completely from the thighs than the trunk and non- subcutaneous fat in the upper trunk actually increased postpartum. Measurement of fat mass during pregnancy is technically challenging because the usual methodologies are imprecise, invalid, or not applicable to pregnancy. Skinfold measurements lack the precision necessary to estimate changes in fat mass accurately. Two-component body composition methods based on TBW, body density, and TBK, however, are invalid during pregnancy because of the increased hydration of fat-free mass (FFM) that occurs during pregnancy. The constants for hydration, density, and K content of FFM used in two-compartment models are not applicable to pregnant women and would lead to erroneous estimations of FFM and fat mass (FM). Corrected constants for the hydration, density, and K content of FFM in pregnancy have been determined (van Raaij et al., 1988; Hopkinson et al., 1997). Two- component models that use the corrected constants are satisfactory for use with pregnant women, as are three- or four-component models (Fuller et al., 1992) in which the hydration or density of FFM is measured. Fat accretion models estimated in pregnant women using corrected two-component models, or three- and four-component body composition are summarized in Appendix C, Table C-4. Figure 3-5 shows a four-compartment body composition model of FM, TBW, protein, bone mineral, and non-osseous mineral measured by hydrodensitometry, deuterium dilution, and densitometry (dual energy X-ray absorptometry, DXA) (Lederman et al., 1997). When applied (after pregnancy) to 200 healthy women at 14 and 37 weeks of gestation the model showed that obese women gained significantly less fat than underweight and normal weight women (8.7 vs. 12.6 and 12.2 kg, respectively). There were no differences in the amount of TBW gained among the underweight, normal weight or obese women. The majority of women studied did not conform to the recommendations of IOM (1990). Sixty-seven percent of underweight, 61 percent of normal weight, 69 percent of overweight, and 78 percent of obese women gained outside the recommended ranges. Fat accretion paralleled GWG; FM gain was positively correlated with GWG ( r = 0.81) and inversely correlated ( r = -0.25) with pregravid weight. For those that gained within recommendations from IOM (1990), FM gain was highest among the underweight (6.0 kg), followed by the normal weight (3.8 kg), overweight (2.8 kg), and obese (-0.6 kg). For those who gained less than the recommendations, FM gain was 0.6 kg in the underweight, 1.3 kg in the normal weight, 0.3 kg in the overweight, and -5.2 kg in the obese. For those that gained more than the recommendations, FM was highest in the underweight (6.9 kg), followed by the normal weight (6.0 kg), overweight (4.2 kg), and obese (3.1 kg).

SOURCE: Lederman et al., 1997. Another four-compartment body composition model based on TBK, TBW, body volume, and bone mineral content measured by whole-body counting, deuterium dilution, hydrodensitometry, bone, and DXA (pre- and postgravid only) was used before pregnancy, at 9, 22, and 36 weeks of gestation; and at 2, 6, and 27 weeks after delivery (Butte et al., 2003) (see Figure 3-6). Protein accretion was measured by prompt-gamma activation measurements of total body nitrogen (TBN) taken before and after pregnancy. Total body K and TBN did not differ before and immediately after pregnancy, but did decline postpartum. On average, weight gain was 42 percent FM and 58 percent FFM. GWG was correlated linearly with gains in 0.39), r FFM ( r = 0.50), and FM ( r = 0.76). Gains in TBW, TBK, protein, and FFM did not differ among low-, normal- and high-BMI groups; only FM gain was higher in high-BMI group who also gained more weight. The body composition changes in those women who gained (mean 14.4 kg) within IOM (1990) recommendations were TBW (7.1 kg), TBK (5.0 g), protein (370 g), FFM (8.4 kg), and FM (4.1 kg). Postpartum weight retention positively correlated with GWG and FM gain, but not with total TBW, TBK, or FFM gain. Postpartum FM retention positively correlated with GWG and FM gain. FM retention at 27 weeks' postpartum was higher in those who gained above the recommendations (5.3 kg) than those that gained within (2.3 kg) and below (-0.5 kg) them. Birth weight was positively correlated with gains in weight, TBW, TBK, protein, and FFM, but not FM gain. Lederman et al. (1997) also found that maternal weight and FFM, but not FM, at term related to birth weight. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-10 In summary, much of the variance in GWG is accounted for by the increase in fat mass, because that much of an increase in FFM also represents and increase in water. Similar to what was observed in GWG, the increase in fat mass during gestation in inversely proportional to pre- gravid obesity. The relationships between accretion of maternal fat mass as a function of pre-gravid obesity may relate to pregravid maternal metabolic function. Sixteen healthy lean women were measured for body composition, basal oxygen consumption (VO 2), and insulin sensitivity before pregnancy and at 12-14 weeks and 34-36 weeks of gestation (Catalano et al., 1998). In early pregnancy, women with abnormal glucose tolerance had smaller increases in FM (1.3 kg) and percentage FM (1.6 percent) compared to those with normal glucose tolerance (2.0 kg, 3.6 percent). Fat accretion did not differ from early to late gestation but changes in maternal insulin sensitivity were inversely correlated with changes in energy expenditure and FM accretion in early but not late pregnancy.

COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-11 Placenta Placental Weight There is a linear relationship between fetal growth and placental mass, fetal weight, and placental growth in both early and late gestation (Molteni et al., 1978). There is a significant increase in the mean placental weight and the fetal-placental weight ratio with advancing gestation in pregnancies that are appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) and LGA. In infants that were born SGA, placental weight showed no increase after 36 weeks, but the fetal-placental weight ratio continued to increase. Therefore, although there may be further growth of the fetus, albeit not optimal, there is a lack of placental growth commonly referred to as placental insufficiency. The basis for altered placental growth and function may be related to a variety of pathologies such as nutritional, vascular (e.g., hypertension, diabetic vasculopathy), or anatomic disorders. There are a limited number of cases of higher-order placental weights in higher multiples, but Pinar et al. (2002) published a series of reference weights from triplet pregnancies. See Table C- 5 in Appendix C for normative criteria for placental weight in singleton, twin, and triplet pregnancies. Placental Growth Normal placental growth using human tissue is difficult to ascertain because placentas obtained from early pregnancy are often the result of an abnormal pregnancy outcome. Prior to 20 weeks, most placentas are obtained at the time of either spontaneous or elective termination. In mid-pregnancy, placentas are obtained after either a preterm delivery or dysfunction such as placenta previa or abruptio placenta. Placental Development There are structural and functional changes in placental development with advancing gestation. Teasdale (1980) described these changes in placentas delivered in healthy pregnancies between 22 and 40 weeks' gestation. The first stage of placental growth lasting through 36 weeks is characterized by increases in the parenchymal and non-parenchymal tissue. The parenchyma is composed primarily of intravillous space, the trophoblast tissue (i.e., cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast), and fetal capillaries of peripheral and stem villi. The non-parenchymal tissue is composed of the decidual and chorionic plates, intercotyledonary septa, fetal vessels, connective tissue, and fibrin deposits. The second phase of placental development lasting from 36 weeks until term is the maturation phase. The maturation phase of placental growth is characterized by an increase in fetal growth but without an increase in placental functional or parenchymal tissue. During the maturation phase there is only an increase in non-parenchymal (i.e., nonfunctional) placental tissue. These relationships are all consistent with the importance of early placental growth and development needed to support the rapid fetal growth in the last trimester of pregnancy when fetal weight increases from a mean of 1,000 g to 3,400 g in the general U.S. population. In addition to the weight and structural changes in placental development, there also may be differences in placental function as a consequence of a women's pregravid BMI. In general, obese women are more likely to have larger placentas and neonates in comparison to average-WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-12 weight women. As discussed previously the alterations in maternal metabolic function during pregnancy are most likely mediated through placental hormone and cytokine production, which in turn affect maternal fat accretion and nutrient availability necessary for fetal growth. Recently, Challier et al. (2008) reported that the placentas of obese women (pregravid BMI > 30 kg/m2) had a two- to threefold increase in the number of macrophages in comparison with placentas of average-weight (pregravid BMI < 25 kg/m2) women. There was also increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- ), and IL-6. Hence, the chronic inflammation associated with obesity may affect placental growth and function, thereby altering maternal metabolic function and resulting in the women with pregravid obesity having decreased maternal pre-gravid maternal insulin resistance and decreased maternal fat accretion but increased placental and fetal growth. Placental Growth Because of the intrinsic problem of using cross-sectional data to determine normal placental growth, there developed an interest in the use of ultrasound to estimate placental growth using various volumetric measures. Bleker and Hoogland (1981) estimated placental volumes using longitudinal ultrasonographic techniques. Placental volume was 200 cm2 at 21 weeks' gestation, 300 cm2 at 28 weeks, and 500 cm2 at term. The placental area was found to increase linearly until 24 weeks. There was a decreasing growth rate in the last trimester, although 15 percent of placentas showed a continuous increase through pregnancy. Abramovich (1969) was able to obtain placental weights at the time of abdominal hysterectomy with an intact amniotic sac. The average weight of the placenta at 10-12 weeks was 51 g, 12-14 weeks 66 g, 14-16 weeks 85 g, 16-18 weeks 110 g, and 18-20 weeks 141 g. Placental Composition The composition of the placenta varies with gestational age as well as maternal metabolic status. Approximately 88 percent of placental weight is water. In comparison, the fetus at term has approximately 80 percent water in its fat-free mass. In studies of Widdowson and Spray (1951), the composition of placentas ranging from 17 to 40 weeks' gestation was analyzed. The mean percentage of water was 88 percent, protein 11 percent, and fat 1 percent. Garrow and Hawes (1971) similarly reported that in more than 700 placentas, the blood-free placenta had approximately 10 percent protein. In a further analysis of the effect of maternal diabetes on placental composition, Diamant et al. (1982) described increased placental mass, amount of DNA, glycogen, and lipids in the placentas of women with diabetes compared to a normal glucose-tolerant control group. The relative changes in glycogen and fat exceeded the changes in weight and mg of DNA, suggesting that a true increase in glycogen and fat per placental cell may have occurred. The increase in lipids in the placenta of the women with diabetes consisted primarily of triglycerides and phospholipids but not cholesterol (See Table C-6 in Appendix C for placental lipid content). COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-13 Fetus Patterns of Fetal Growth for Singletons, Twins, and Triplets Singletons With the exception of longitudinal studies using methods such as ultrasound, all measures of fetal growth are cross-sectional by definition (i.e., each fetus having been measured only once) Hytten and Chamberlain, 1991). The criteria that are commonly used are to classify fetal growth (1) SGA (i.e., birth weight less than the 10th percentile for gestational age); (2) average (AGA; i.e., birth weight between the 10th and 90th percentile for gestational age); and (3) LGA (i.e., birth weight greater than the 90th percentile for gestational age). These criteria were arbitrarily chosen to help assess the neonatal risk for both short-term and, more recently, long-term morbidity. Since that time there have been numerous other publications relative to fetal growth rates. For the fetus that is deemed viable, fetal weight, as a measure of fetal growth, is usually determined at the time of delivery . The gestational age of viability has decreased steadily over the years and the fetus is now considered potentially viable at 23-24 weeks. Therefore, most of the fetal growth curves relating to viable fetuses rely on clinical data starting from the mid- second trimester. Although the numbers are small, there appears to be minimal variation in fetal growth through 25 weeks' gestation (Archie et al., 2006). Recently, Thomas et al. (2000) published data comparing gestation-specific growth parameters with those developed in the late 1960s using data from 85 nurseries including 27,229 neonates. For neonates at < 30 weeks' gestation, there were smaller variances and lower average weights, lengths, and head circumferences than previously published norms. For neonates > 36 weeks' gestation, the variance was similar, but the neonates were larger and heavier. The authors concluded that using older growth curves resulted in misclassification of gender- and race- specific criteria for SGA and LGA. Since then, many investigators have observed an increase in birth weight at term (Orskou et al., 2001; Ananth and Wen, 2002; Surkan, 2004; Catalano, 2007). Hence, the use of current birth weight curves is important in the assessment of fetal growth. Oken et al. (2003) published U.S. birth weight curves based on the 1999 and 2000 United States Natality datasets from 22 through 44 weeks gestation. Although gestational age is an important factor related to fetal growth, other factors affect not only fetal growth but the pattern of growth. These include gender (Figure 3-7)\u2014males grow more rapidly from the mid-third trimester through term. Other factors that can affect fetal growth include maternal age, height, weight, GWG, obesity, and parity (Catalano et al., 2007). Paternal factors can also affect fetal growth, although they explain much less of the variance than maternal factors (Klebanoff et al., 1998). High altitude results in decreased fetal growth as does maternal hypoxia. Maternal medical problems, e.g. hypertensive disorders, autoimmune disease, and smoking can also result in decreased fetal growth. In contrast, maternal diabetes without evidence of vascular involvement often results in increased fetal growth (see Chapter 4 for detailed discussion).

SOURCE: Oken E., K. P. Kleinman, J. Rich-Edwards, and M. W. Gillman. 2003. Reprinted with permission from BMC Pediatrics 3: 6, by BioMed Central. The question of ethnic differences in fetal growth and implications for neonatal health has become more relevant recently. Kierans et al. (2008) evaluated all births in British Columbia from 1981 through 2000 and examined fetal growth and perinatal mortality in Chinese, South Asian, First Nation (Native American Indian), and other (primarily Caucasian) populations. They concluded that the ethnic differences in fetal growth rates were physiologic, not pathologic. The rate of premature delivery (i.e., before 37 weeks' gestation) in the United States is approximately 12.5 percent. As such, birth weight tables that rely on actual neonatal weights for preterm infants represent a much smaller percentage of all births. Furthermore, there is evidence that infants born prematurely are smaller than infants of the same gestational age who remain in utero (Weiner et al., 1985). In summary, normal fetal growth is relatively uniform until mid-second trimester. At term there is much greater variation in fetal weight as a result of varying determinants of GWG and other maternal factors (see Chapter 4 for complete discussion). Lastly, there has been an increase in term birth weight in developed countries over the last two decades, most likely because of the increased prevalence of obesity. Twins and Triplets Fetal growth in multiple gestations can be considered very similar to singleton growth until the third trimester. Although there is a tendency to consider multiple gestations as being growth restricted, Blickstein (2002) described the fetal mass of a multiple pregnancy as \"growth promoted\" and the smaller size of the fetus as \"growth adapted\". In addition to previously discussed variables that may affect fetal growth such as gender and parity, in twin gestations, chorionicity may also affect fetal growth. Ananth et al. (1998) reported that COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-15 twins from monochorionic gestations weigh on average 66 g less than those from dichorionic gestations after correction for gestational age. Gielen et al. (2007) reported on customized birth weight charts in more than 4,277 twin pairs in Flanders from 1964 through 2002. In their study, birth weight was affected by maternal parity and age. Zygosity, fetal gender, chorionicity, fusion of the placentas, placental weight, and site of umbilical cord insertion all influenced twin birth weights. These variables can account for as much as a 1,000 g difference in weight at term. After 40 weeks' gestation, there is a decrease in weight of twins with a monochorionic monozygotic placentation, while dichorionic dizygotic twins continue to grow. Min et al. (2000) estimated growth in 1,831 twin pregnancies using ultrasound at 2-week intervals from 20 through 40 weeks' gestation. The weight difference between twins and singleton pregnancies at their respective 50th percentiles was 147 g (10 percent) at 30 weeks' gestation, 242 g (14 percent) at 32 weeks' gestation, 347 g (17 percent) at 34 weeks' gestation, 450 g (19 percent) at 36 weeks' gestation, 579 g (22 percent) at 38 weeks' gestation, and 772 g (27 percent) at 40 weeks' gestation. Lastly, Glinianaia et al. (2000) reported on 690 triplets born in Norway from 1967 through 1995. The birth weight by gestational age curves of the triplets were almost identical to those of singleton and twin gestations before 30 weeks. From 31 weeks of gestation onward, the median birth weight of triplets consistently diverged from that of twins. At 38 and 39 weeks' gestation the difference reached 478 and 541 g, respectively, with a weight difference between twins and triplets of 650 g in the 10th percentile at 39 weeks. In summary, the growth rate in multiple gestations is similar to growth rate in singleton gestations up to approximately 30 weeks' gestation. In the third trimester, there is a decrease in individual fetal growth, more so in triplets than in twins and may be related to placental function. Fetal Body Composition The human fetus at term has a significantly different body composition than most other mammalian species. At birth the human fetus has approximately 12-16 percent body fat. In contrast, laboratory animals have 1-2 percent body fat at birth (Widdowson, 1950). Theoretically, the accrual of fetal fat has two possible sources: one is from the transfer of free fatty acids from the mother, and the second is de novo synthesis of fatty acids from substrates such as glucose, lactate, and acetate provided by the mother (Girard and Ferre, 1982). Regardless of the substrate source, fetal insulin is required for the fetus to increase adipose tissue stores. The remaining tissue in the human fetus is lean body mass or FFM, which consists primarily of glycogen, protein, and water. At birth the human fetus has approximately 40 g of glycogen, primarily in muscle and liver tissue (Girard and Ferre, 1982). The protein content of the term fetus is approximately 12.8 percent of total body weight, or 15 percent of FFM (i.e., about 500 g; Fomon et al., 1982; Spady, 1989). The remainder is water. In the human fetus at term, approximately 80 percent of FFM is water (Fomon et al., 1982). Temporal changes in fetal growth and body composition have been characterized using ultrasound. The human fetus at 28 weeks weighs approximately 1 kg. Over the next 12 weeks the fetus gains approximately 2.5 kg. Fetal fat tissue begins to accrue in the mid-second trimester. Into the third trimester, however, there is a decrease in FFM as a percentage of total body weight. Bernstein et al. (1997) reported that, although the rate of fetal FFM accretion appeared linear when taken in aggregate, the compartments of FFM changed differentially. Peripheral muscle growth accelerated, and head circumference decelerated in late gestation. Fetal fat deposition accelerated as a quadratic WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-16 function. Hence, fetal growth of FM and FFM follow unique patterns and offe r an additional means to assess normal and abnormal growth. The gold standard for estimating body composition is carcass analysis. Sparks (1984), in his review of the data on 169 carcass analyses of fetuses, concluded that the differences in FFM are less variable at each gestational age than the fat content As with GWG, the variation in fetal growth may be related to the fat content of the fetus, which may reflect the intrauterine environment, while the FFM may be more representative of genetic factors. Koo et al. (2000) using DXA, found that among the 214 singletons studied, neonates whose birth weight was < 2,500 g had 6 to 14 percent body fat. Neonates whose birth weight was > 2,500 g had 8 to 20 percent body fat. The mean percentage of body fat for a 3,500-g infant was 16.2 percent. Using total body electrical conductivity, Catalano et al. (2003) reported that body fat was 10.4 + 4.6 percent in 220 term healthy singleton neonates. The difference in r esults between the two studies primarily represents differences in methodologies. Birth weight and neonatal body composition are related to changes in maternal body composition. Butte et al. (2003) used DXA to assess body composition in 63 term infants at 2 weeks of age and related these data to changes in maternal body composition measured using a multi-component model. Birth weight correlated positively with prepregnancy weight ( r = 0.34), prepregnancy FM ( r 0.32), GWG ( r = 0.35), net GWG ( r = 0.26), rate of weight gain ( r = 0.28), and gestational age ( r = 0.49). Birth weight was correlated significantly with gestational gains in TBW ( r = 0.37), TBK ( r = 0.35), and FFM ( r = 0.39), but not FM. Maternal FFM gains in the first, second, and third trimesters were shown by multiple regression to make independent contributions to birth weight. Maternal TBW gains during the second and third trimesters and maternal TBK gain in the third trimester were independent predictors of birth weight. Infant body composition at 2 weeks of age (FFM, FM, or percent FM) was not correlated with maternal body composition before or after pregnancy or with maternal gains in TBW, TBK, FFM, and FM during pregnancy. As is true for birth weight, multiple factors are associated with alterations in fetal body composition. Some of these factors are genetic. For example, at birth, male fetuses have greater lean body mass than females, and as a consequence, females have a higher percentage of body fat (Catalano et al., 1995; Ibanez et al., 2008). Maternal factors that have the strongest effect on fetal growth and primarily affect fetal fat accretion include parity, GWG, and medical problems. Maternal parity is positively correlated with neonatal adiposity (Harvey et al., 2007). Birth weight is significantly greater in neonates of overweight and obese women than underweight or normal weight women because of increased FM, not FFM (Sewell et al., 2006; Hull et al., 2008). Maternal weight gain is associated with both increased fetal FFM and increased FM and is related to maternal pregravid BMI (Catalano and Ehrenberg, 2006). Maternal medical problems, such as gestational diabetes mellitus, are associated with an increase in birth weight again because of increased FM, and in the macrosomic neonate a relative decrease in FFM (Catalano et al., 2003; Durnwald et al., 2004). Environmental factors also affect fetal body composition (see Chapter 4). Maternal smoking has a negative effect on fetal growth on the order of 150 g, which primarily decreases fetal FFM (Lindsay et al., 1997). Increased altitude has been reported to be associated with a 339-g decrease in birth weight. Crown-head length was shown to be reduced by 1 cm although the sum of five skinfolds was 5 mm greater, in those born at high altitude compared to those born at sea level (Ballew and Haas, 1986). In their study of > 400 newborns using total body electrical conductivity, Catalano and Ehrenberg (2006) found that maternal COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-17 pregravid BMI had the strongest correlation with maternal weight gain and GDM, as a factor associated with fetal adiposity. In summary, the human fetus has a high percentage of body fat (12-16 percent) at birth compared to most mammalian species. Fetal fat mass contributes the greatest percentage of variance in birth weight, is affected by the in utero environment, and is more strongly correlated with maternal pre-gravid BMI than GWG. Amniotic Fluid Amniotic fluid has four major sources of volume flow into and out of the amniotic sac in late gestation (Ross and Brace, 2001). The two major inflow sources are fetal urine and lung liquid secretions. The two major outflows are fetal swallowing and intra-membranous absorption. Brace and Wolf (1989) reported on a series of 705 published amniotic fluid volumes based on either direct collection or dye dilution techniques. At 8 weeks of gestation the volume increases at a rate of 10 mL per week, and at 13 weeks the volume increases to 25 mL per week. The maximal increase in amniotic fluid of 60 mL per week occurs at 21 weeks' gestation. The weekly volume increment then decreases and reaches zero at 33 weeks' gestation (i.e., the time at which maximal volume is reached). There is wide variation in the amount of amniotic fluid in a normal pregnancy. Decreased amniotic fluid (i.e., oligohydramnios) occurs in approximately 8.2 percent of pregnancies, and increased amniotic fluid (i.e., polyhydramnios) occurs in approximately 1.6 percent of pregnancies (Ross and Brace, 2001). Oligohydramnios may occur as a consequence of fetal renal obstruction or dysplasia and may be associated with fetal growth restriction. Polyhydramnios is associated with various fetal structural anomalies such as congenital esophageal atresia, fetal anemia, congenital infections, and maternal diabetes. Given the wide range of normal amniotic fluid volume at term, this compartment may affect maternal GWG by as much as 1 kg. Therefore, amniotic fluid volume is an important component of maternal weight gain. MATERNAL PHYSIOLOGY The unique physiologic, metabolic, and endocrine milieu of the pregnant woman is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying GWG. The pregnant woman undergoes dramatic physiologic changes in anticipation and in support of fetal growth. Many of the obligatory components of GWG (for example, TBW) are directly related to the alterations in maternal physiology necessary to grow and develop a healthy fetus and placenta. Cardiovascular Changes In early pregnancy, cardiac output increases about 30-50 percent as a result of an increase in heart rate\u2014primarily stroke volume\u2014and remains elevated until term (Hytten and Chamberlain, 1991). As pregnancy progresses, blood flow increases to the uterus, kidney, skin, and probably the alimentary tract. Arterial blood pressure may decrease in mid-pregnancy. This is a result of increased peripheral vasodilatation and in order to maintain perfusion this results in an increase in cardiac output and relatively small decreases in mid-gestational blood pressure. Venous blood pressure rises in the lower limbs due to mechanical and hydrostatic pressure in the pelvis, causing edema in the lower limbs. Because of these cardiovascular changes, it is possible to have reduced exercise tolerance and dyspnea. Physiological changes in circulation during pregnancy are marked and variable (Gabbe et al., 1991; Hytten and Chamberlain, 1991). Plasma volume increases progressively to 50 percent by WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-18 30-34 weeks of gestation. Importantly, plasma volume expansion is correlated with clinical performance and birth weight. Poor plasma volume expansion is associated with a poorly growing fetus and poor reproductive performance. The increases in maternal plasma volume account for a significant portion of the increase in total body water during pregnancy. Red blood cell mass also increases about 18 percent by term without iron supplementation and 30 percent with iron supplementation. Minute ventilation increases 30-40 percent by late pregnancy due to increased tidal volume. Oxygen consumption increases only 15-20 percent, resulting in an increase in alveolar and arterial P AO2 (partial pressure of oxygen) and a fall in PACO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) levels (Gabbe et al., 1991). Renal Changes Renal plasma flow increases 70 percent over pregravid levels by 16 weeks of gestation and is maintained until late pregnancy when it falls slightly (Gabbe et al., 1991). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases early in pregnancy, up to 50 percent by term. As a result of the increased GFR, serum levels of urea and creatinine decline. Plasma osmolarity declines early in pregnancy due to a reduction in serum sodium and associated anions. There is a net accumulation of approximately 900-1,000 meq of sodium in the fetus, placenta, and intravascular and interstitial fluids. There is a large increase in tubular sodium reabsorption during pregnancy, promoted by increased aldosterone, estrogen, and deoxycorticosterone. Plasma renin activity, renin substrate, and angiotensin levels increase five- to tenfold above the pregravid values. The adaptations in maternal renal physiology during gestation are among the primary mechanisms accounting for the increase in plasma volume and hence total body water during gestation. Endocrine Changes The plasma concentration of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) increases significantly, reflecting increased hepatic synthesis (Gabbe et al., 1991). Estrogen-induced increases in CBG lead to elevated plasma cortisol concentration; with a three-fold increase occurring by the end of the third trimester. The concentration of the metabolically active free cortisol also progressively increases through gestation due to increased production and decreased clearance. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level is suppressed during pregnancy due to the action of estrogen and progesterone. The plasma concentration of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) declines during pregnancy due to an increase in metabolic clearance by the placenta and maternal liver. The renin-angiotensin system changes dramatically during pregnancy. The adrenal gland remains responsive to the trophic action of angiotensin II, even though a refractory effect of pressors to angiotensin II develops early in pregnancy. This provides a probable explanation for the expansion of plasma volume during pregnancy. The secretion of prolactin from the pituitary and uterine decidua increases steadily during pregnancy. In contrast, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone are suppressed to levels similar to the luteal phase of ovulation. Growth hormone secretion is inhibited presumably by placental growth hormone production. In normal pregnancy, thyroxine-binding globulin concentration is increased and the circulating pool of extrathyroidal iodide is decreased due to increased renal clearance. These changes cause the thyroid to enlarge and to synthesize and secrete the thyroid hormones T 4 (thyroxine) and T 3 (triiodothyronine) more actively. Despite elevated total T 4 and T 3, the concentrations of active hormones (free T 4 and free T 3) are unchanged during normal pregnancy, COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-19 with the exception of a transient increase in the first trimester in some women (Gabbe et al., 1991; Glinoer, 2004). Adipose tissue produces an array of adipokines known to have profound effects on metabolism and fertility, but their role in reproductive performance is yet to be fully understood. In addition to adipose tissue, leptin and its receptor, TNF- , and resistin also are expressed in the placenta (Mitchell et al., 2005). Serum adiponectin was found to be lower in the third trimester and this correlates with a decrease in insulin sensitivity (Catalano et al., 2006). Increases in maternal fat mass most likely are related to the decreases in circulating adiponectin concentrations. Metabolic Changes Many of the metabolic adjustments of pregnancy are well established in early pregnancy when fetal nutrient demands are still minor. Minimal nutrient balances are usually positive, reflecting the anabolic state of the fetus and the mother. In the absence of nausea or \"morning sickness,\" most women experience an increase in appetite in the beginning of pregnancy (Gabbe et al., 1991). Several gastrointestinal changes occur during pregnancy, including decreased tone and motility of the stomach, reduced gastric acid secretion, delayed gastric emptying, and increased gastric mucous secretion as a function of increased progesterone. Motility of small intestine is also reduced during gestation; however, except for enhanced iron absorption, nutrient absorption is unchanged. These physiologic changes may affect the pattern of gestational weight gain in early gestation. Changes in protein and nitrogen metabolism occur in early pregnancy, presumably in response to pregnancy-related hormones (Kalhan, 2000). Serum total -amino nitrogen deceases, as does the rate of urea synthesis and the rate of transamination of branched-chain amino acids, which are aimed at conservation of nitrogen and protein accretion in pregnancy. Protein turnover on a weight basis, however, does not change (Kalhan, 2000). Serum total protein and albumin fall progressively and by term are 30 percent lower than non-pregnant values (Hytten and Chamberlain, 1991). The concentrations of binding proteins for corticosteroids, sex steroids, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D are also increased. Changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism occur during pregnancy to ensure a continuous supply of nutrients to the growing fetus (Butte, 2000). In early pregnancy, glucose tolerance is normal or improved slightly, and peripheral (muscle) sensitivity to insulin and hepatic basal glucose production are normal or increase by as much as 15 percent (Catalano et al., 1991; 1992; 1993). As pregnancy advances, nutrient-stimulated insulin responses increase progressively despite only minor deterioration in glucose tolerance, which is consistent with progressive insulin resistance (K\u00fchl, 1991). In late pregnancy, insulin action is 50-60 percent lower than in non-pregnant state (Ryan et al., 1985; Buchanan et al., 1990; Catalano et al., 1991; 1992; 1993). By the third trimester, basal and 24-hour mean insulin concentrations may double (Lesser and Carpenter, 1994). The first and second phases of insulin release are increased threefold by late pregnancy (Catalano et al., 1991). These alterations in maternal insulin sensitivity affect not only glucose metabolism but also lipid metabolism resulting in a decreased ability of insulin to suppress lipolysis (Catalano et al., 2002). The return of normal physiologic function after delivery may occur rapidly over a matter of days\u2014for example, an improvement in insulin sensitivity (Ryan et al., 1985)\u2014or over a matter of weeks\u2014for example, a return to a normal non-pregnant renal glomerular filtration rate (Sims and Krantz, 1958). The alterations in maternal physiology are mediated by placental factors as WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-20 evidenced by the significant increase in maternal insulin sensitivity within days after delivery of the fetus and placenta. The alterations in maternal metabolism have generally been ascribed to placental hormones such as hPL, progesterone, and estrogen (Kalkhoff et al., 1979; Ryan and Enns, 1988). Recently, Kirwan et al. (2002) have reported that circulating cytokines (i.e., TNF- concentration) were inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity. The metabolic changes in insulin sensitivity during pregnancy are modified by inflammatory factors (Friedman et al. 1999; 2008). In women with normal glucose tolerance during pregnancy who lose significant weight postpartum, there is a return to normal metabolic function. However, in women with GDM, particularly if there is no decrease in postpartum weight or adiposity, there remains a significant inflammatory milieu that results in chronic insulin resistance, increasing the risk of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Depending on the pregravid insulin sensitivity status of the woman, insulin sensitivity may increase or decrease during early pregnancy. In the very insulin-sensitive woman, insulin sensitivity most often decreases and is accompanied by an increase in adipose tissue and basal metabolic rate (Catalano et al., 1998). In contrast, in the more insulin-resistant woman (e.g., those who are obese or have GDM), insulin sensitivity often increases and is accompanied by a decrease in basal metabolic rate and potential loss of adipose tissue (Okereke et al., 2004) (Figure 3-8). These physiologic changes may help to explain in part the relative decrease in weight gain in obese insulin-resistant women compared to the greater increases in weight in lean insulin-sensitive women in early gestation. The placental factors related to these alterations in insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, and adipose tissue are not well understood relative to metabolic alterations in late pregnancy. Although there is a significant increase in maternal leptin concentrations in early pregnancy (Hauguel-de Mouzon et al., 2006), most likely related to placental production, the increased leptin concentrations do not appear to be associated differently with energy expenditure or fat accretion between lean and obese women.

COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-21 FETAL-PLACENTAL PHYSIOLOGY Transport Function Three primary functions of the placenta are to serve as a barrier or filter, to transport substances between maternal and fetal circulation, and to cover a large spectrum of endocrine activity. Changes in fetal growth rate have been shown to result from effects related to maternal homeostasis and associated changes in placental structure or function in both normal and non- normal pregnancies (Thame et al., 2004; Desoye and Kaufman, 2005; MacLaughlin et al., 2005; Swanson and Bewtra, 2008). Changes in the maternal environment have been shown to have an impact on specific steps of placental transport of the major energy substrates (i.e., glucose, lipids, amino acids; Hauguel de-Mouzon and Shafrir, 2001). For example, maternal diabetes results in increased availability of glucose, which is transported directly across the placenta for fetal utilization (Baumann et al., 2002). In contrast to glucose, which is transported along a concentration gradient, regulation of lipid transfer from maternal to fetal circulation is more complex. The placenta has the capacity to regulate the uptake, storage, and release of maternal lipids through multiple regulatory mechanisms and thus control fetal plasma lipid composition (Haggarty, 2002). Changes in the maternal environment may also modify placental endocrine function. For example, changes in maternal circulating cholesterol affect lipid metabolism in human term placenta (Marseille-Tremblay et al., 2008). Higher cholesterol uptake may subsequently impact steroidogenesis because cholesterol is the primary precursor for progesterone synthesis (Pasqualini, 2005). Interaction of Maternal and Placental Metabolism The question of whether or how placental function(s) may have an impact on maternal metabolism has received little attention. Besides the uterus, the feto-placental unit, intra- and extravascular fluids, and mammary gland, most of the weight gain that occurs over the course of a pregnancy lies in changes in maternal adipose tissue mass. In this context, the placental contribution to weight changes through the action of systemic factors that control the pathways of lipid synthesis and storage within the adipocyte must be taken into consideration. The placenta does not release adipogenic substrates into the maternal circulation. Hence, the most probable routes by which placental function would alter the regulation of lipogenic pathways are modulation of maternal insulin sensitivity and inflammation, as discussed previously. Placental Hormone Production Sex steroids and hPL, which best reflect the endocrine function of the placenta, have been primary candidates for regulation of maternal insulin sensitivity (Leturque et al., 1989). Although estrogens certainly have insulin sensitizing properties, the action of progesterone is clearly linked to diminishing insulin sensitivity and weight gain (Kalkhoff, 1982; Gonzalez et al., 2000; Xiang et al., 2007). Hence, an imbalance in placental progesterone production may be a contributing factor to maternal weight regulation. Human placental lactogen is the most abundant polypeptide hormone produced by the placenta with strong anabolic and lipolytic properties. Inasmuch as hPL enhances maternal nitrogen accrual, this process could possibly contribute to weight regulation and that possibility has been the subject of speculation (Florini et al., 1966). However, the lipolytic action of hPL on adipose tissue has received more experimental support. One consequence of the lipolytic effect of hPL is the re-orientation of maternal metabolism WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-22 toward lipid rather than glucose utilization to favor glucose sparing for the fetus. Interestingly the ability of hPL to mediate pregnancy-induced insulin resistance, as suggested by Grumbach et al. (1968) was never fully established. Thus, the exact contribution of hPL to the regulation of maternal homeostasis remains to be established. Further, whether hPL synthesis is modified in pathologic pregnancies also has not been confirmed (Stewart et al., 1989). Just as occurs in white adipose tissue, the placenta synthesizes a cytokines except leptin, which is released in large amounts in maternal circulation, likely act in either a paracrine or autocrine manner. Obesity and diabetes are associated with increased placental leptin production and maternal hyperleptinemia, but the consequences of high systemic leptin are unclear at this time (Hauguel-de Mouzon et al., 2006). Resistance to the central satiety effect of leptin during pregnancy as a possible consequence has been considered (Grattan et al., 2007). Another potential contribution of the placenta to the regulation of maternal metabolism and subsequent alteration in maternal weight gain is systemic inflammatory priming by circulating syncytiotrophoblast microparticles (STBMs). Syncytiotrophoblast microparticles bind to monocytes and stimulate production of inflammatory cytokines (Germain et al., 2007; Rovere-Querini et al., 2007). In addition to local placental inflammation, these microparticles are potential contributors to the altered systemic inflammatory response in pregnancy (Challier et al., 2008). Consequently, increased macrophage infiltration into maternal adipose tissue in combination with increased insulin resistance may contribute to the regulation of adipose mass during pregnancy (Xu et al., 2003). Taken together there is little direct evidence that placental hormonal factors directly regulate maternal homeostasis and particularly quantitative changes in adipose tissue mass. The role of progesterone, hPL, and leptin in maternal insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis remains to be established, but inflammatory mechanisms are novel potential regulatory pathways that will also have to be examined. ABNORMAL MATERNAL METABOLISM Weight Loss During Pregnancy Weight loss or no GWG as a result of dietary caloric insufficiency will induce maternal hormonal and metabolic responses. Given the obligatory weight gain in the maternal tissues (uterus, breast, blood), and the fetal-placental unit, a weight gain less than ~7.5-8.5 kg would imply mobilization of maternal adipose tissue and possibly protein stores. Metabolic profile, dietary patterns, and eating behaviors of pregnant women undergoing weight loss or no weight gain have not been studied, but expected changes in fuel homeostasis can be deduced from studies conducted in pregnant women subjected to fasting. Fasting in Pregnant Women During 84 hours of fasting before elective termination of pregnancy at 16-20 weeks' gestation, ketonemia, increased urinary nitrogen excretion, and exaggerated reduction in gluconeogenic amino acids were detected in pregnant women (Felig, 1973). Glucose and insulin were lower, and acetoacetate and -hydroxybutyrate were two to three times higher, in pregnant than non-pregnant women at 12-60 hours but not 84 hours (Felig and Lynch, 1970). Weight loss averaged 3.1 kg in non-pregnant women and 3.2 kg in pregnant women. Metzger et al. (1982) COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-23 subjected lean ( n = 11) and obese ( n = 10) pregnant women and lean ( n = 14) and obese ( n = 13) non-pregnant controls to an 18-hour fast. At 12 hours, there were no significant differences between groups, but by 16 and 18 hours, substantial increases in FFA and -hydroxybutyrate (HA), which were inversely correlated with glucose, were seen in the pregnant women. There was a significant difference in FFA concentrations between obese and lean pregnant women only at 16 hrs of fasting. In contrast there were no significant differences in BHA levels at any time point between lean and obese women. Ketonuria and Ketonemia in Pregnancy As first described by Freinkel (1980), pregnancy can be considered a condition of \"accelerated starvation\" because of the changes in maternal metabolism. The accelerated starvation occurs because of the increase in insulin resistance, particularly related to lipid metabolism, as discussed previously. As a result, there is an increased risk of developing ketonuria and ketonemia in pregnancy even among women with normal glucose tolerance. Chez and Curcio (1987) reported that eight of nine women with clinically normal pregnancies developed ketonuria at various times during their pregnancy. Gin et al. (2006) measured capillary blood ketones and HA using a portable capillary meter in women with normal glucose tolerance (controls) and those with GDM three times a day from 25 to 37 weeks' gestation. Fasting ketonuria was strongly correlated with ketonemia in controls but not in women with GDM. There was a chronic increase in ketonemia levels in 12 percent of the controls and 47 percent of the women with GDM. Pregnant women develop ketonemia much earlier than non-pregnant women during prolonged fasting because of the accelerated starvation. Felig (1973) studied women between 16 and 22 weeks' gestation who elected termination of pregnancy and were willing to undergo prolonged fasting and compared them with a non-pregnant control group. After an overnight fast of at least 12 hours and for the first 36 to 60 hours of starvation, blood HA and acetoacetate concentrations were two- to threefold higher in the pregnant group than in the non-pregnant group. The increase in lipolysis among the pregnant women was attributed to increases in hPL. The ketone concentrations in maternal blood were equivalent to those in amniotic fluid and were fortyfold above levels in fed subjects. The assumption is that amniotic fluid levels represent maternal-to-fetal transport. Felig (1973) also hypothesized that ketones become an important metabolic fuel for the fetal brain once glucose concentrations decrease, because the human fetal brain has the enzymes necessary for ketone oxidation. Coetzee et al. (1980) reported that 19 percent of obese, insulin-dependent diabetic women on 1,000-kilocalorie (kcal) diets developed ketonuria. In contrast, in diabetic women eating higher- energy diets, only 14 percent had ketonuria, and in pregnant non-diabetic women, only 7 percent developed ketonuria. Measurement of blood ketones was never positive if the urine measure was 2 plus and acetoacetate levels were always less than 1 mmol/L. There was no difference in neonatal outcomes among the three groups. In summary, pregnant women are more likely to develop elevated measures of blood HA and acetoacetate during prolonged fasting (after 12-18 hours) as a result of the metabolic and hormonal changes in pregnancy. Pregnant women with diabetes are more likely to develop elevated blood ketones than women with normal glucose tolerance. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance have elevated blood ketone levels some time during gestation. Although the evidence is based on associations and does not demonstrate causality, caution should be exercised regarding weight loss during pregnancy or no WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-24 GWG given the propensity ketonemia, increased urinary nitrogen excretion, and decreased gluconeogenic amino acids and the potential to adversely impact the neurocognitive development of the offspring. There are significant consequences of caloric insufficiency, low GWG, and poorly controlled diabetes for the child and these are discussed in Chapter 6. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Findings 1. Total GWG in normal-term pregnancies displays considerable variability; nevertheless, some generalizations can be made regarding mean tendencies and patterns of GWG: a. A consistent inverse relationship is observed between GWG and pregravid BMI category; b. Mean GWG ranges from 10.0 to 16.7 kg in normal weight adults and 14.6 to 18.0 kg in adolescents giving birth to term infants; c. The pattern of GWG is most commonly described as sigmoidal, with mean weight gains higher in the second than the third trimester across BMI categories, except for obese women; and d. Lower GWGs, on the order of 11 kg and 9 kg, have been confirmed in large cohorts of obese women and very obese women, respectively. 2. The committee relied on observational GWG data of women giving birth to twins born at 37-42 weeks of gestation and with an average twin birth weight 2,500 g: a. Mean GWG of normal weight women with twin births ranged from 15.5 to 21.8 kg; b. GWG for triplets ranged from 20.5 to 23.0 kg at 32-34 weeks and for quadruplets from 20.8 to 31.0 kg at 31-32 weeks; and 3. When stratified by WHO prepregnancy BMI categories sample sizes from data on twins was insufficient to designate a value for underweight women with pregravid BMI <18.5 kg/m2. 4. The extent to which fat mass accretion is critical rather than incidental to pregnancy is not clear, but unrestrained weight gain leads to postpartum weight retention. 5. Placental size is strongly correlated with fetal growth, averaging approximately 500 g in singleton pregnancies. 6. Amniotic fluid weight may affect maternal gestational weight gain by as much as 1 kg at term. 7. Gestational gains in weight, total body water, total body potassium, protein, and FFM, but not FM, are positively correlated with birth weight across all BMI categories. 8. Poor plasma volume expansion is associated with a poorly growing fetus and poor reproductive performance. 9. Pregnancy is a condition of systemic inflammation that also influences maternal and fetal nutrient utilization. 10. During prolonged fasting, i.e. 16-18 hours, pregnant women are more likely to develop COMPOSITION AND COMPONENTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAI N PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 3-25 elevated measures of blood HA and acetoacetate. In women with diabetes, plasma FFA and HA were inversely associated with intellectual development of the offspring at 3-5 years of age. Therefore, caution is warranted regarding periods of prolonged fasting and weight loss during pregnancy and the development of ketonuria. Research Recommendations Research Recommendation 3-1: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct studies in all classes of obese women, stratified by the severity of obesity, on the determinants and impact of GWG, pattern of weight gain and its composition on maternal and child outcomes. Research Recommendation 3-2: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct studies on the eating behaviors, patterns of dietary intake and physical activity, and metabolic profiles of pregnant women, especially obese women, who experience low gain or weight loss during pregnancy. In addition, the committee recommends that researchers conduct studies on the effects of weight loss or low GWG, including periods of prolonged fasting and the development of ketonuria/ketonemia during gestation, on growth and on development and long-term neurocognitive function in the offspring. Areas for Additional Investigation The committee identified the following areas for further investigation to support its research recommendation. The research community should conduct studies on: Potential effects of maternal weight loss on components of maternal body composition for both the mother and the fetus, particularly in obese women; and Mechanisms by which placental hormonal factors and systemic inflammation impact the regulation of maternal metabolism during pregnancy.

Acta 4 Determinants of Gestational Weight Gain The total amount of weight gain during pregnancy is determined by many factors. Aside from physiological factors (discussed in Chapter 2); psychological, behavioral, family, social, cultural, and environmental factors can also have an impact on gestational weight gain (GWG). Understanding these factors as determinants of GWG is an important component of revising weight gain guidelines for women during pregnancy. Several conceptual models guided the committee's consideration of determinants of GWG. The ecological perspective recognizes that health behavior such as GWG is influenced at multiple levels. Brofenbrenner (1979) identified multiple levels of environmental influence on health behavior in general: The microsystem - face-to-face interactions in specific settings, such as family, school, or a peer group; The mesosystem (a system of microsystems) - the interrelations among the various settings in which the individual is involved, such as that between the family and the workplace; The exosystem - the larger social system in which the individual is embedded, such as the extended family or community; and The macrosystem - cultural values and beliefs, such as cultural beliefs about GWG. Other models which recognize the multiple determinants of health behavior or outcome include the health field model, which identifies multiple domains including: the physical and social environments that exert influences on health behavior and outcome; and the epidemiological model which describes a triad of epidemiologic factors to model the complex and interrelated factors contributing to the increasing rate of obesity in the United States and other countries. One of the triad components describes an \"obesogenic\" environment as \"the sum of influences that the surroundings, opportunities, or conditions of life have on promoting obesity in individuals or populations\" (Swinburn and Egger, 2002). This obesogenic environment includes physical, economic, policy, and socio-cultural factors that can influence eating and physical activity behaviors. Collectively, these models place emphasis on how the health of individuals is influenced by not only physiological functioning and genetic predisposition, but by a complex interplay of these biological determinants with social and familial relationships, environmental influences, and broader social and economic contexts over the life course. They further suggest that intervention efforts to change health behavior or outcome, such as GWG, should address not only \"downstream\" individual-level phenomena (e.g. physiologic pathways to disease, individual and lifestyle factors) and \"mainstream\" factors (e.g. population-based interventions), but also \"upstream,\" societal-level phenomena (e.g. public policies) (IOM, 2000). WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-2 Another model, the life-course perspective (Kuh and Ben-Shlomo, 1997), perceives life not in disconnected stages, but as an integrated continuum; it recognizes that each stage of life is influenced by the life stages that precede it, and it, in turn, influences the life stages that follow (See Chapter 6 for detailed discussion). Some of the most significant determinants of GWG at multiple levels (social/institutional, environmental, neighborhood/community, interpersonal/family, and individual levels) occur across the life course (Figure 4-1). The following discussion begins with a review of the evidence for a direct relationship between a given determinant (identified in the Conceptual Framework) and GWG. Where data are lacking, rationale are provided for why the committee thinks that it is potentially an important determinant which merits further research. The committee's review of evidence (tabulated in Appendix D) included both epidemiologic and clinical studies. Since this research discipline is focused largely on observational studies the committee recognized the need for proof of causality for determinants and outcomes significantly associated with GWG. FIGURE 4-1 Schematic summary of determinants associated UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-3 SOCIETAL/INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS Media The committee was unable to identify studies that examined specifically the media's influence on GWG. From a life course perspective, however, it is plausible that the media may influence GWG by having an effect on eating and exercise habits that are established well before pregnancy. Several previous reports have documented the influence of advertising and marketing on children's food, beverage, and sedentary-pursuit choices that can adversely affect energy balance (Kunkel, 2001; IOM, 2006). An extensive systematic literature review concluded that food advertisements promote food purchase requests by children to parents, have an impact on children's product and brand preferences, and affect consumption behavior (Hastings et al., 2003). Other studies have shown that the media can encourage sedentary behaviors, such as television watching, that may adversely affect energy balance (Gortmaker et al., 1996; Gortmaker et al., 1999; Robinson, 1999; IOM, 2005; Epstein et al., 2008). Such eating habits and sedentary behaviors shaped during childhood and adolescence may be carried into young adulthood and continued into pregnancy and thus indirectly affect GWG. Moreover, by influencing energy balance over the long run these habits and behaviors may also have an impact on prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) as well as other biological determinants of GWG. Not all media influences are negative, however. Media can be used to convey consumer information and public health messages, such as those regarding youth smoking, and seat belt and child car seat use. Social marketing programs that have used the media, either as focused efforts or as part of multi-component campaigns to promote physical activity or healthy diet in adults, have produced mixed results, often because discerning their impact is a challenge. The most successful social marketing programs have received more funding, been better sustained, and were shaped by formative research (IOM, 2006). Taken together, available evidence is inconclusive about the media's influence on GWG. However, it is plausible that the media may exert its influence indirectly by affecting prepregnancy BMI and other biological determinants, as well as influencing eating habits and sedentary behaviors that are established well before pregnancy . Culture and Acculturation The committee was unable to identify studies that examined specifically the effects of culture and acculturation factors on GWG. However, cultural norms and beliefs may influence dietary behavior and physical activity, thereby affecting energy balance and, indirectly, GWG. For example, there is a belief among women of all ages, ethnic groups, and income and education levels that the consumption of certain foods marks a child before birth; which may then lead to certain food preferences and avoidances (IOM, 1992; King, 2000). There is also the belief that diet can influence ease of delivery. Most women know that low GWG will produce a small infant, which will be delivered more easily than a larger one. In some cultures this knowledge may encourage women to \"eat down\" in late pregnancy in order to avoid a difficult birth (King, 2000). Understanding these cultural norms and beliefs is important for effectively communicating recommendations for GWG. Acculturation, the process in which members of one cultural group adopt the beliefs and behaviors of another, is often associated with adoption of unhealthy behaviors, including food choices. Using nativity or duration of residence in the U.S. as a proxy for acculturation, several WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-4 studies have found greater rates of overweight and obesity among children and non-pregnant adults who are more acculturated, compared to their less acculturated counterparts (Lizarzaburu and Palinkas, Hubert 2007; Fuentes-Afflick and Hessol, 2008). A population-based study of 462 mothers in California found that in the three months before pregnancy, foreign-born Latinas had the lowest contribution of fat to total energy intake and the highest dietary intake of carbohydrate, cholesterol, fiber, grain products, protein foods, folate, vitamin C, iron, and zinc, compared to the dietary intake of white non-Latinas and U.S.-born Latinas (Schaffer et al., 1998). Other researchers have also documented increased risk for adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight, among U.S.-born women compared to foreign-born women of the same ethnic origin (Ventura and Taffel, 1985; Scribner and Dwyer, and Weeks, 1996; Singh and Yu, 1996; Fuentes-Afflick and Lurie, 1997; Jones and Bond, 1999; Callister and Birkhead, 2002; Baker and Hellerstedt, 2006). In these studies, however, GWG is usually not reported, and so the contribution of GWG to adverse outcomes is unclear. Taken together, there is indirect evidence that cultural and acculturation factors can influence GWG even though conclusive evidence for a direct effect is lacking. Health Services The U.S. Public Health Service Expert Panel on the Content of Prenatal Care recommended that pregnant women receive advice on gaining an appropriate amount of weight during pregnancy even though an influence of weight gain advice on GWG has not been conclusively demonstrated (DHHS, 1989). Several intervention studies have been conducted using nutrition advice alone (Orstead et al., 1985; Bruce and Tchabo, 1989) or such advice linked with home visits by nutritionists and supplemental food (Rush, 1981; Bruce and Tchabo, 1989), a nurse home visitation program (Olds et al., 1986), and the provision of prenatal care through multidisciplinary rather than traditional clinics (Morris et al., 1993). In three of the studies (Rush, 1981; Olds et al., 1986; Morris et al., 1993) the differences in mean GWG between intervention and control groups were not statistically significant. In two other studies (Orstead et al., 1985; Bruce and Tchabo, 1989) intervention groups gained significantly more weight than the control groups; however, the findings may be limited by gestational age bias. Additionally, only mean GWG was reported in the studies and no comparisons were made using different cutoff points based on pregravid BMI further limiting interpretation of the findings. Brown et al. (1992) developed a prenatal weight gain intervention program based on social marketing methods. While circumstances arose that hampered full evaluation of the program, preliminary evidence suggests that GWG and birth weight of African Americans in the intervention group did not differ significantly from those of whites, whereas both weight gain and birth weight were significantly lower in African Americans than in whites in the control group. Hickey (2000) identified several threats to the validity of previous studies on prenatal weight gain advice and actual GWG. These include, in addition to differences in pregravid nutritional status and BMI, issues such as self-selection bias, recall bias, differences in time during gestation when nutrition advice was given, variation in content and frequency of advice, the pairing of advice with other food or nonfood interventions, individual and social characteristics of the provider as contrasted with those of the pregnant woman, and racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in weight gain advice given to women. Given all these threats, the evidence to evaluate the influence of prenatal weight gain advice on actual GWG is weak. DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-5 Policy For the purpose of this report, policy is defined broadly to include principles, guidelines, or plans adopted by an organization to guide decisions, actions, and other matters. As an example of how policy can influence GWG, the weight gain recommendations from the report, Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990) have been endorsed by obstetric organizations in the United States and many other countries. A 2005 cross-sectional survey mailed to 1,806 practicing members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) showed that more than 85 percent of the 900 respondents report counseling their patients about GWG often or most of the time (ACOG, 2005). The survey did not, however, assess the respondents' knowledge of the IOM (1990) guidelines or the content of counseling (Power et al., 2006). The few studies that have examined the advice given for GWG, however, have shown that women often receive inconsistent or erroneous advice. Cogswell et al. (1999) found in a survey of approximately 2,300 women that they appear to be influenced by professional advice in the weight gain they believe is appropriate and the weight gain they actually achieve. Of the 1,643 women who recalled weight gain advice, 14 percent reported being advised to gain less than the recommended levels, and 22 percent were advised to gain more. Provider advice to gain below the recommended levels was associated with actual weight gain below the recommendations (an adjusted odds ratio of 3.6), and advice above the guidelines had the same odds ratio for higher rates of gain. Moreover, 27 percent of women reported receiving no advice about GWG; thus nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of women in this study reported receiving no advice or inappropriate advice from health professionals regarding GWG. In a more recent study, Stotland et al. (2005) found that 79 percent of the nearly 1,200 women of all BMI ranges in the study reported a target GWG, or how much weight women think they should gain during pregnancy, within the IOM (1990) guidelines, as compared to only 59 percent reported in Cogswell et al. (1999). Given that the women in the Cogswell et al. cohort delivered in 1993, the authors speculated that the IOM (1990) guidelines are now more widely applied or accepted than they were in 1993. Still, Stotland et al. (2005) found that one-third (33 percent) of women received no advice from health professionals regarding GWG, and less than half (49 percent) reported receiving advice within guidelines. In sum, the IOM (1990) guidelines appear to influence what women believe to be appropriate weight gain during pregnancy, though their influence on actual GWG may be less, in part because many health professionals are providing no or inappropriate advice about GWG. Another example of how policy can influence GWG is the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Rush et al. (1988) conducted a national evaluation of WIC programs and found that a reversal of low weight gain in early pregnancy and greater total weight gain during pregnancy occurred among women who enrolled in WIC compared with controls. They also found greater intake of protein, iron, calcium, vitamin C, and energy among WIC participants. However, subsequent evaluations (Joyce et al., 2008) have challenged these earlier findings and found more limited associations between WIC participation and GWG. Nonetheless, it is possible that policy that increases food access would have an impact on dietary pattern and GWG. Policy that does not directly affect pregnant women can also have an effect on GWG. Examples include policy recommendations to restrict food and beverage advertising and marketing to young children, to develop and implement nutritional standards for all competitive foods and beverages sold or served in schools, or to promote physical activity in schools (IOM, WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-6 2007). These policies can influence the development of children's eating and exercise habits, which will be important later in life. ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS Altitude There is inconsistent evidence about the influence of altitude on GWG. Jensen and Moore (1997) examined the effect of high altitude on GWG and birth weight using Colorado birth certificates. They did not find any significant difference in GWG among women residing at 3,000 to 5,000 feet; 5,000 to 7,000 feet; 7,000 to 9,000 feet; and 9,000 to 11,000 feet. Mean birth weight, however, decreased and low birth weight rates increased with increasing altitude. The decline in birth weight associated with increase in altitude was found to be independent of and not interactive with gestational age, GWG, parity, maternal smoking, pregnancy-induced hypertension and other factors associated with birth weight (Jensen and Moore, 1997). Environmental Toxicants The committee was unable to identify studies that examined specifically the effects of exposures to environmental toxicants on GWG. There is some evidence linking environmental contaminants such as organophosphate and organochlorine compounds to fetal growth, but the evidence is inconsistent (Dar et al. 1992; Wolff et al., 2007). Additional research may better define the relationships among environmental exposures, GWG, and fetal growth. Natural and Man-made Disasters The committee was unable to identify studies that examined specifically the effects of natural or man-made disasters on GWG. However, it is plausible that disasters can affect GWG indirectly by influencing resource availability (including food supply), healthcare access, and stress levels (Callaghan et al., 2007). Several studies have documented the impact of disasters on pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth (Weissman et al., 1989; Cordero, 1993; Glynn et al., 2001; Lederman et al., 2004) and fetal growth restriction (Eskenazi et al., 2007; Landrigan et al., 2008); however, it remains unclear whether these adverse outcomes were caused by low GWG. NEIGHBORHOOD/COMMUNITY DETERMINANTS Access to Healthy Foods Evidence for a direct influence of neighborhood or community factors, such as access to healthy foods, on GWG is lacking. However, because appropriate nutrient intake and weight gain during pregnancy requires a safe and adequate food supply, it is likely women who live in areas where residents have poor accessibility to foods may be at increased risk for inadequate or inappropriate GWG and associated poor pregnancy outcomes (See Chapter 2 for trends in dietary practices and Appendix B for supplemental information). A study of urban retail food markets and birth weight outcomes in upstate New York found pregnant women who lived in proximity to urban retail corner markets without fresh produce, dairy, and other healthy foods had significantly more low birth weight infants compared to women who had access to supermarkets where healthy foods were available. These findings were independent of income level; however, DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-7 the study did not report on GWG (Lane et al., 2008). Laraia et al. (2004) investigated associations between the distance of a supermarket from home and diet quality of pregnant women, measured by a Diet Quality Index (DQI). They found that women who lived more than four miles from a supermarket had a two-fold greater risk of falling into the lowest DQI quartile compared to women who lived 2 miles from a supermarket, but the authors also did not report on GWG. Opportunities for Physical Activity While a growing body of evidence has demonstrated the role of the built environment for populations at high risk for obesity (See Chapter 2 for trends in physical activity), only one study was identified that examined the relationship between neighborhood contexts and GWG. Laraia et al. (2007) conducted a study of neighborhood factors associated with physical activity and weight gain during pregnancy. They found that social spaces, defined as the presence of parks, sidewalks, and porches as well as the presence of people, including nonresidential visitors, was associated with decreased odds for inadequate or excessive GWG. The social spaces scale was also associated with decreased odds of living greater than three miles from a supermarket. These findings suggest that neighborhood environments can influence GWG by providing access to healthy foods and opportunities for physical activities. INTERPERSONAL/FAMILY DETERMINANTS Family Violence Several studies examined GWG in the context of family violence (Parker et al., 1994; McFarlane et al., 1996; Siega-Riz al., 2006). Siega-Riz and Hobel (1997) found in a clinic sample of 4,791 Hispanic women in Los Angeles that physical abuse was associated with a greater than threefold risk for inadequate GWG among obese and overweight women. Moraes et al. (2006) found in a study of 394 pregnant women in Brazil that those with the highest physical abuse score gained, on average, 3 to 4 kg less than women unexposed to intimate partner violence. Boy and Salihu (2004) conducted a systematic review and found that abused pregnant women had less GWG than non-abused women. These studies suggest an association between intimate partner violence and insufficient GWG. Marital Status Several studies have examined the relationship between marital status and GWG. Kleinman et al. (1991) and Ventura (1994), who used 1992 U.S. national data, found that unmarried mothers were more likely than married mothers to gain less than 7.3 kg during pregnancy. Olsen and Strawderman (2003) found in a cohort of 622 healthy adult women that 38 percent of married women had gained above IOM (1990) guidelines, compared to 42 percent for women who were separated or divorced, and 48 percent for single women. They also found that 21 percent of married women had gained below IOM (1990) guidelines, compared to 23 percent for single women and 29 percent for women who were separated or divorced. Thus married women were more likely to gain within the IOM (1990) recommended weight gain range than single or separated/divorced women. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-8 Partner and Family Support Evidence to support a relationship between partner support and GWG is lacking at this time. Dipietro et al. (2003) found in a cross-sectional study of 130 women with low-risk pregnancies that partner support was associated with negative pregnancy body image, but not with attitudes or behaviors toward GWG. Siega-Riz and Hobel (1997) found that receiving financial support from the infant's father was significantly associated with decreased risk of poor GWG for overweight and obese women, but not for underweight or normal weight women. Several studies have examined the influence of family support on GWG. Stevens-Simon et al. (1993) found in a sample of 99 pregnant adolescents that attitudes toward GWG were directly related to their perceived family support. Negative weight gain attitudes were most common among heavier adolescents, depressed adolescents, and adolescents who did not perceive their families as supportive. Gutierrez (1999) reported from a study of 46 pregnant Mexican American adolescents that the most powerful factors contributing to good food practices during pregnancy were maternal concern about the well-being of the infant, role of motherhood, and family support system; the contribution of family support to GWG attitudes or actual GWG was not reported in this study. MATERNAL FACTORS Sociodemographic Factors Gestational Weight Gain in Adolescents Adolescent pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, SGA births, and increased risk of neonatal mortality, although reported risk associations vary (Chen et al., 2007). To reduce these risks, the IOM (1990) report recommended that pregnant adolescents gain weight within the ranges for adult women unless they were under 16 years of age or less than two years post-menarche. In either of these cases, adolescents were encouraged to gain at the upper limits of the GWG guidelines for their prepregnancy BMI category. The youngest adolescents as well as somewhat older adolescents who conceive soon after menarche may still be growing themselves (Scholl and Hediger, 1993). Even girls who become pregnant for a second time during adolescence may still be growing. Scholl et al. (1990) showed that adolescents who were still growing during a first pregnancy delivered infants whose birth weight did not differ from those who were not growing. This was not true among adolescents who were still growing during a second pregnancy; their infants were significantly lighter at birth than those who were not growing themselves. The possibility of a competition for nutrients between the still-growing adolescent gravida and her fetus has been advanced as an argument for recommending relatively higher gains for at least some pregnant adolescents. What has been found instead is that still-growing adolescents are not mobilizing their fat gain during pregnancy to enhance fetal growth but, rather, are supporting the continued development of their own fat stores (Scholl et al., 1994). In a retrospective review of natality data from 2000, Howie et al. (2003) reported an increased likelihood for excessive GWG among adolescents compared to older women. Other authors have corroborated that younger adolescents have a higher GWG compared to older DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-9 adolescents and adults, but whether the infant benefits from this greater weight-gain is not yet clear (Hediger et al. 1990; Scholl et al., 1990; Stevens-Simon et al., 1993). This is in part because\u2014as is also the case for adult women\u2014increases in GWG not only reduce the risk of delivering a low birth weight infant but also increases the risk of delivering a macrosomic infant (Scholl et al., 1988). Nielsen et al. (2006) showed that birth weight outcomes improved in all prepregnancy BMI groups when GWG increased from below to within the lower half of the weight gain recommended by IOM (1990) in a cohort of 815 pregnant African-American adolescents. Further gains were not beneficial, particularly for infants of adolescents with a high prepregnancy BMI. The possibility that adolescents who gained at the upper end of the range for their BMI category might have an excess risk of postpartum weight retention or the later development of obesity was not considered in formulating the 1990 guidelines, but has long been recognized as a possible downside of recommending relatively high weight gains for them (McAnarney and Stevens-Simon, 1993). Adolescents who have given birth are heavier (Gigante et al., 2005) with more adipose tissue (Gunderson et al., 2009) than adolescents who have not. Gestational weight gain was a significant predictor of increase in BMI 6 and 9 years post delivery in all prepregnancy BMI categories among the 330 primiparous black adolescents studied by Groth (2008). In addition, those who gained above the IOM (1990) guidelines were more likely to have become obese by 9 years post delivery than those who gained within the guidelines. In summary, the relationship of GWG to fetal and birth outcomes, postpartum weight retention, and risk for future overweight/obesity appears to be generally similar to that for adult women. However, information on these subjects is more limited for pregnancy among adolescents, particularly younger adolescents, than it is for adult women. Data generated since the IOM (1990) report, particularly related to the risk of developing postpartum weight retention and obesity in adult women who had been pregnant as young adolescents, support the recommendation that \"...until more is known, adolescents less than two years post-menarche should be advised to stay within the IOM-recommended BMI-specific weight range without either restricting weight or encouraging weight gain at the upper end of the range\" (Suitor, 1997). Gestational Weight Gain in Older Women Increased maternal age is significantly associated with risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth (Fretts, 2005; Reddy et al., 2006), low birth birth, and SGA (Cnattingius et al., 1992; Delpisheh et al., 2008). In addition to poor outcomes, pregnancy in older women is also associated with increased risk for pregnancy complications, e.g. hypertension, diabetes, placenta previa, and placental abruption (Joseph et al., 2005). Women who become pregnant after age 35 differ from their younger counterparts in several factors that can influence pregnancy outcome, including prepregnancy weight (or BMI) and GWG. In a study of obese and non-obese women who were pregnant, Gross et al. (1980) found that a greater proportion of obese subjects were older and of higher parity than non-obese subjects. The obese subjects also had higher rates of chronic hypertension, diabetes, and inadequate GWG. Prysak et al. (1995), in a retrospective comparison of pregnancy characteristics between older ( 35 years old) and younger (25-29 years old) nulliparous women, found that the older women had significantly lower mean GWG than the younger women. In addition, obesity was significantly greater in the older compared to the younger women. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-10 Pregnant women over 35 years of age who were enrolled in the WIC program were evaluated by Endres et al. (1987) for nutrient intake, prepregnancy weight, and GWG compared to adolescents aged 15-18 years. Prepregnancy BMI was calculated for both groups and more than 50 percent of the older women were identified as obese prior to pregnancy. The study found no significant difference in total nutrient intake between the groups (neither met the RDAs), but the younger women had higher mean energy intakes ( P = 0.006) and greater cumulative GWG in the third trimester (9.5 kg versus 7.6 kg) than the older women. In sum, several studies reported higher prepregnancy BMI and lower GWG among older women, compared to their younger counterparts. The contributions of GWG to birth outcomes, postpartum weight retention, and subsequent overweight/obesity among older women remain unclear. Table 4-1 summarizes reports from the last three decades on GWG by age and racial/ethnic group.

Race or Ethnicity Few studies have examined racial-ethnic differences in GWG, and even fewer studies have considered the influence of the many possible determinants of GWG among different racial/ethnic groups or alternatively, adjusted for race/ethnicity in their analyses. Caulfield et al. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-12 (1996), for example, found that among 2617 black and 1253 white women delivering at a university hospital during 1987-1989 only 28.2 and 32.5 percent of black and white women, respectively gained within the ranges recommended by IOM (1990). Black women are at increased risk for gaining less weight than recommended, when controlled for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, height, parity, education, smoking, hypertension, duration of pregnancy, and fetal sex. Chu et al. (2009) assessed the amount of GWG among 52,988 underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese U.S. women who delivered a singleton, full-term infant in 2004-2005 using PRAMS data (2004-2005). They found that black women were significantly more likely than white women to gain less than 15 pounds, but less likely than white women to gain more than 34 pounds. A review of birth records of 913,320 singleton births in New York City from 1995 to 2003 found that Asian and non-Hispanic black women were more likely to gain 0 to 9 kg, whereas Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women were more likely to gain 20+ kg during pregnancy (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Stein [see Appendix G, Part III). Table 4-2 presents GWG among women of different race and ethnicity in this study population. Taken together, the limited data on the influence of race/ethnicity on GWG is suggestive of inadequate GWG among some racial/ethnic groups. However, the paucity of data on a national level and the lack of observational studies based on pre-pregnancy BMI preclude drawing any conclusions about the influence of race/ethnicity on GWG (see Chapter 2 and Figure 2-6 for trends in GWG for racial/ethnic groups by prepregnancy BMI).

DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-13 Socioeconomic Status The committee found limited evidence for associations between GWG and socioeconomic status (SES), and few studies that considered the influence of the many possible determinants of GWG among different SES groups; or alternatively, adjusted for SES in their analyses (see Appendix D). Using 2004-2005 PRAMS data, Chu et al. (2009) found that women with less than 12 years of education were more likely to gain less than 15 pounds, and less likely to gain more than 34 pounds, compared to women with more than 12 years of education (Table 4-3). This analysis, however, did not control for pre-pregnancy BMI or other factors that could potentially influenced GWG.

WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-14 Food Insecurity Food insecurity is closely tied to socioeconomic status and thus, it is included in the discussion even though it is arguably a modifiable factor. Several studies have identified a relationship between food insecurity, defined as \"whenever the availability of nutritionally adequate and safe food or the ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways is limited or uncertain\" and overweight/obesity (Anderson, 1990). These studies have shown a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity among women living in food insecure households compared to women living in food secure households (Frongillo et al., 1997; Olson, 1999; Townsend et Basiotis and Lino, 2003; CDC, 2003; Crawford et al., 2004). The mechanisms mediating this association are not well understood, but reports in the literature addressing eating patterns support the idea that food deprivation can result in overeating (Olson and Strawderman, 2008). Polivy (1996) found that food restriction or deprivation, whether voluntary or involuntary, results in a variety of changes including the preoccupation with food and eating. It has also been suggested that food-insecure households tend to purchase calorie-dense foods that are often high in fats and added sugars as an adaptative response to food insecurity (Drewnowski and Darmon, 2005). More recently, Jones and Frongillo (2007) found food insecurity without hunger to be associated with risk for overweight/obesity, but not with subsequent weight gain in women of all racial/ethnic groups. Wilde and Peterman (2006) examined the relationship between food insecurity and change in self-reported weight over 12 months in a national sample of non- pregnant women. These investigators found that women in households that were marginally food secure were significantly more likely to gain 4.54 kg (10 pounds) or more in a year compared to women in food secure households. While food insecurity and obesity have been shown to be positively associated in women, little is known about the direction of causality between food insecurity and obesity. Olson and S trawderman (2008) found in a cohort of 622 healthy adult women from rural areas followed from early pregnancy until two years postpartum that food insecurity in early pregnancy was not associated with increased risk of obesity at two years postpartum. However, obesity in early pregnancy was significantly associated with increased risk of food insecurity at two years postpartum, suggesting that the causal direction of the relationship between food insecurity and obesity likely goes from obesity to food insecurity. Moreover, they found that women who were both obese and food insecure in early pregnancy were at greatest risk of major gestational and postpartum weight gain, suggesting that food insecurity may play a role in GWG (trends in food insecurity are shown in Chapter 2). Genetic Characteristics The role of DNA sequence variation in the regulation of body weight is being investigated in many laboratories around the world. However, the role of genetic factors in the modulation of weight gain during pregnancy has not received much attention to date. The committee was unable to identify studies dealing with familial aggregation or heritability of GWG. The only evidence comes from a small number of reports focusing on the contribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in specific genes on GWG. At present no study has considered the important issue of nutrition or physical activity interactions with genes on GWG. Several studies have considered the effect of the Trp64Arg allelic substitution in the beta 3 adrenergic receptor gene (ADR 3) on weight gain during pregnancy (Festa et al., 1999; Yanagisawa et al., 1999; Alevizaki et al., 2000; Tsai et al., 2004; Fallucca et al., 2006). The DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-15 homozygotes for the 64Arg allele were found to have gained more weight from baseline to gestational weeks 20 to 31 than heterozygotes in Austrian mothers (Festa et al., 1999). In pregnant women with type 2 diabetes, a gain in BMI of more than 5 units was found to have a prevalence of 12.2 percent in homozygotes for the Trp allele, 19.2 percent for the heterozygotes and 28.6 percent for the Arg allele homozygotes (Yanagisawa et al., 1999). However, in the latter study from Japan, there were no differences among the three genotypes for GWG. In a study from Greece, no differences among the ADRB3 genotypes were found for the rate of weight gain (g/day) calculated from the difference between the prepregnancy reported body weight and the weight measured between weeks 28 and 36 of gestation (Alevizaki et al., 2000). Similarly, no differences were observed among genotypes in a Taiwanese population for weight gain at 24 to 31 weeks of gestation (Tsai et al., 2004). In the largest study to date, 627 pregnant women from Italy were studied and no effect of the ADRB3 polymorphism on GWG was found (Fallucca et al., 2006). In the same study, a marker in the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) gene was also not associated with GWG. The Pro12Ala polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPAR2) was typed in pregnant Turkish women (Tok et al., 2006). Among 62 women who had gestational diabetes (GDM), those with the Ala allele gained more weight during pregnancy but this was not observed in 100 non-diabetic pregnant women. The 825 cytosine/thymidine (C/T) base substitutions, a common polymorphism of the G-protein beta-3 subunit gene, was studied in 294 women with uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies with term deliveries ranging from 37 to 40 weeks (Dishy et al., 2003). Pregnant women homozygous for the T allele (17.4 \u00b1 0.9 kg) gained significantly more weight than the C allele carriers (15.1 \u00b1 0.4 kg). However, the sample was composed of women from various ethnic ancestries which may have affected the results in an undetermined manner. From this small body of data, it is not possible to conclude whether there is a role for specific genes and alleles in GWG. None of the studies reported to date were based on sufficiently large sample sizes to ensure that adequate statistical power was available to identify the effects of alleles or genotypes with a small effect size. Studies conducted on large samples of ethnically homogeneous pregnant women will be needed to be able to understand the contribution of specific genes and sequence variants to GWG. Genetics and Birth Weight Gestational weight gain is associated with the weight of the infant at birth even though there may not always be a cause and effect relationship and despite the fact that reverse causation often cannot be excluded. In this context, it is useful to consider the role that genetic factors may play in the variation of birth weight. In particular, it is important to understand the potential role of risk alleles at specific genes on risk for SGA and LGA. The topic of the heritability of birth weight has been addressed for more than 50 years in the scientific literature. The evidence up to the late 1970s was reviewed (Robson, 1978) in a three volume treatise on Human Growth. The conclusion was that the fetal genotype played a small role on birth weight, probably of the order of 10 percent, while the maternal genotype accounted for about 24 percent of the total variance. These estimates were derived from data on full siblings, half-siblings, first cousins, mother-child, father-child, and monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Recent twin studies have consistently generated slightly higher significant genetic components for birth weight in the range of 20 percent to 40 percent (Vlietinck et al., 1989; WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-16 Whitfield et al., 2001; Dubois et al., 2007). A recent report from Norway on birth weight was obtained in the mother, father, and up to three singleton offspring (included data from 101,748 families) (Lunde et al., 2007). It concluded that the fetal genetic component of birth weight adjusted for birth order, sex and generation reached 31 percent. The heritability estimates reached 31 percent for birth length and 11 percent for variation in gestational age. Given the ample statistical power of the latter study, 31 percent represents the most valid and reliable heritability estimate to date of the contribution of the fetal genes to birth weight (Beaty, 2007). The latter is concordant with the 25 percent value reported in another large Norwegian study of trios composed of mother-father-firstborn child (Magnus et al., 2001). Importantly, variation in birth weight is influenced by a number of other factors besides the genetic makeup of the newborn. Several studies have found a role for the maternal genotype on the weight of the newborn. In the large Norwegian study cited above, maternal genetic factors accounted for 22 percent of the variation in birth weight (Lunde et al., 2007). Of particular interest is whether there is a paternal genetic component to birth weight. In a study of 6,811 white singletons and their natural parents, the effect of parental height and weight on the length and weight at birth of an offspring was evaluated (Griffiths et al., 2007). It was observed that the effects of parental height on birth weight are similar for the two parents. However, the influence of the mother's weight on the infant's birth weight was stronger than that of the father. In a report on parental role in the familial aggregation of SGA based on 256 cases, it was found that both parents contributed almost equally to the risk (Jaquet et al., 2005). The risk of SGA for an infant at birth was 4.7 times greater for mothers and 3.5 times for fathers who were themselves SGA compared to those who were of average weight for gestational age. The risk of a SGA infant was however 16 times higher when both parents had been SGA (Jaquet et al., 2005). The most compelling data for a role of paternal birth weight on weight of the offspring at birth comes once again from a Norwegian study. A total of 67,795 trios of father-mother- firstborn child were used to plot the birth weight of infants against paternal birth weight by classes of maternal birth weight (Magnus et al., 2001). The regression of a child's birth weight on the father's birth weight was 0.137 while that on the mother's birth weight reached 0.252. The effect of paternal birth weight was about the same within each category of maternal birth weight, with no significant interaction effects between parental birth weight levels. Evidence for a role of specific genes with a focus on their implications for diabetes on birth weight is limited (McCarthy and Hattersley, 2008). Glucokinase encoded by the GCK gene is an enzyme that phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in the pancreas, where it serves as a glucose sensor and is the rate limiting step in glucose metabolism. A defect in the pancreatic glucose sensing mechanisms of the fetus could potentially reduce weight at birth and have profound effects on the regulation of glucose and insulin later in life. Mutations altering highly conserved amino acids in GCK were genotyped in 58 offspring and their mothers from the UK (Hattersley et al., 1998). When a mutation was present in the fetus but not carried by the mother, weight at birth was diminished by more than 500 g. A concordant observation was that in 19 pairs of siblings discordant for a GCK mutation, the infant with the mutation weighed about 500 g less at birth than the other sibling (See Figure 4-2). When a mutation was absent in the fetus but present in the mother, mean birth weight was higher by about 600 g. When the mutation was present in both mother and fetus, body weight at birth was normal. The low and high birth weights associated with a number of GCK missense mutations are thought to reflect variation in fetal insulin secretion resulting from the GCK fetal genotype and indirectly from the fetal response to maternal hyperglycemia (Hattersley et al., 1998). This may represent an explanation DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-17 for some of the fetal programming cases in which there is an association between low birth weight and later insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In a short report of four cases from Italy exhibiting different GCK mutations, three had substantially lower than average birth weight (Prisco et al., 2000). One recent study focused on the effect of the adenosine (A) allele (SNP at position -30) at the GCK gene on birth weight (Weedon et al., 2005). Using data from 2,689 mother-child pairs, the A allele in the mother was associated with a 64 g increase in the offspring birth weight. There was no effect of the offspring GCK genotype at this particular mutation on birth weight. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta (HNF1 ) is a transcription factor, encoded by the HNF1 gene, critical for the development of the pancreas. Birth weight was studied in 21 patients with HNF1 mutations (Edghill et al., 2006). Weight at birth was low in all cases, with a median weight of 2.7 kg. In 13 of these patients born to unaffected mothers, 69 percent were SGA at birth, with a median percentile weight of 3 (Figure 4-2). Another transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4 ) is involved in the regulation of pancreatic insulin secretion. The HNF4 gene is responsible for MODY-1 and accounts for about 4 percent of all maturity-onset diabetes in the young (MODY) cases (McCarthy and Hattersley, 2008). Mutations in HNF4 also associate with type 2 diabetes. Weight at birth was studied in 108 infants from families with HNF4 mutations (Pearson et al., 2007). Birth weight was increased by 790 g in HNF4 mutation carriers compared to non- mutated family members (Figure 4-2). Fifty-four percent of mutation carriers were macrosomic compared with 13 percent for non-mutation family members. FIGURE 4-2 The impact on birth weight of a fetus inheriting three common maturity-onset diabetes in the young (MODY) gene mutations.

DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-18 In another candidate gene study, a common SNP in the fat mass and obe sity associated gene (FTO) was investigated for its relationship to weight at birth in 234 full-term, healthy newborns (Lopez-Bermejo et al., 2008). An allelic variant known to influence body weight and fat mass in children and adults was not associated with birth weight but an association became evident after about two weeks postnatally. Another line of evidence for a role of genes on birth weight and thus perhaps on GWG comes from scanning the whole genome. Three studies have dealt with genome-wide linkages using panels of highly polymorphic markers and birth weight. The first was based on 269 Pima Indians from 92 families and 503 autosomal microsatellite markers (Lindsay et al., 2002). A quantitative trait locus (QTL) was identified on chromosome 11 (logarithmic odds [LOD] for an imprinted locus = 3.4), suggesting that a paternally imprinted gene at map position 88 cM was influencing birth weight in this population (Lindsay et al., 2002). Subsequently, a QTL on chromosome 6q was shown to be linked to birth weight in Mexican-Americans from the San Antonio Family Birth Weight Study (LOD = 3.7) and partially replicated in a European-American population (LOD = 2.3) (Arya et al., 2006). The latest study using this approach was also on Hispanic newborns from Texas (Cai et al., 2007). Birth weight was available from birth certificates for 629 children from 319 families. Birth weight was highly heritable in this population and a QTL was identified on 10q22 with a LOD score of 2.6. From this body of data, one can draw the preliminary conclusion that: (a) there is a fetal genotype effect on weight at birth (about 30 percent of the adjusted variance), (b) both parents' genes influence birth weight with a stronger effect for maternal genes, (c) specific allelic variants have been associated with weight at birth, (d) mutations in GCK and HNF1 are associated with low birth weight, (e) mutations in HNF4 are associated with high birth weight, and (f) a few quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 6, 10, and 11 have been uncovered from genome-wide linkage scans. None of the high risk alleles identified thus far have been studied for their potential contributions to GWG with or without control for the weight of the infant. The issue of the contribution of specific genes and variants to human variation in birth weight would greatly benefit from a number of genome-wide association studies with comprehensive panels of markers, particularly in cohorts with large sample size and substantial numbers of small- and large-for-gestational age infants. It will also be critical in the future to design studies that will make it possible to define the maternal and fetal alleles at key genes which associate with increased risk for GWG outside recommended ranges in the context of maternal dietary and physical activity habits. Developmental Programming Among the multitude of factors influencing GWG, early developmental programming may increase risk for GWG above recommended ranges. Developmental programming (physiological, metabolic or behavioral adaptation resulting from exposure or lack thereof to hormones, nutrients, stress and other agents at critical periods during embryonic or fetal development) suggests that exposures and experiences during sensitive developmental periods in utero, and possibly early postnatal life may encode the functions of organs or systems that become manifest as risk factors for disease later in life (Barker, 1998; Seckl, 1998). One example to illustrate how developmental programming may influence maternal GWG is the suggestion that developmental programming could influence the ability to respond to and cope with repeated exposure to stress. This could in turn, provide a mechanism by which some women may be at greater risk for excessive GWG. Animals and humans subjected to chronic and DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-19 repeated stress levels and exaggerated hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response to natural or experimental stressors (Sapolsky, 1995). Epidemiologic evidence suggests there may be a relationship between elevated glucocorticoid levels and physiologic changes consistent with metabolic syndrome, including increased adiposity (Pasquali et al, 2006; Barat et al., 2007). Hyperactivity of the HPA axis has been hypothesized to play a role in development of abdominal obesity and insulin resistance (Bjorntorp, 1993, 1996; Bjorntorp and Rosmond, 2000). A potential mechanism for HPA hyperactivity is through diminished feedback inhibition of pituitary activity resulting from down- regulation of glucocorticoid receptors in the brain (Vicennati and Pasquali, 2000). Over time HPA hyperactivity and excess glucocorticoid secretion can lead to both hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance with subsequent increased risk of type II diabetes (Vicennati and Pasquali, 2000). These observations suggest that GWG could be influenced by not only factors that arise in pregnancy, but also by in utero developmental events that may predispose the mother to HPA dysregulation. Even though the evidence for a role of developmental programming during fetal life on the risk of obesity and late-onset metabolic diseases is growing, the committee was unable to identify studies that directly examined the influences of programming on GWG in the mother. Consequences of high GWG to the child that may be related to developmental programming are discussed in Chapter 6. Epigenetics In addition to developmental programming, another line of evidence suggests that modifications in DNA and histone proteins could translate into phenotypic differences that often mimic those associated with DNA sequence variants. Such DNA and nucleoprotein alterations have been collectively referred to as \"epigenetic events\". Epigenetic events begin to occur early after fertilization, are typically stable, and influence gene expression. There is already compelling evidence to suggest that nutritional factors can entrain DNA methylation and modifications in histone proteins (Waterland and Jirtle, 2003); some of which occur at the embryonic stage in key tissues (Sinclair et al., 2007; Waterland et al., 2008). Such events are known to lead to the silencing (or switching off) of genes particularly when they occur in their promoter regions. Cytosine residue (in CpG islands) and histone (H3 and H4) methylation, acetylation or other chemical modifications occurring during early fetal life provide a mechanism, although it is not the only one, by which programming of the developing organism beyond the blueprint specified in the genomic DNA may occur. However, it is important to recognize that epigenetic events can occur throughout life and may thus account for some of the phenotypic variation observed among adults. In this regard, the observation that the pattern of DNA methylation in monozygotic twins diverges more as they become older is of great interest (Fraga et al., 2005). It reinforces the view of those who believe that considerable phenotypic differences can arise among individuals with the same genotype. Such phenotypic variations in physiology and behavior have been observed before in inbred rodent strains but no satisfactory explanations have been provided thus far for them. Future progress in understanding the role of programming and epigenetic factors on GWG will require increased attention not only to the role of DNA sequence variation but also to the potential influence of early programming and epigenetic events and their lasting impact on pregnant women. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-20 with physiological changes in a woman's basal energy expenditure and hormonal milieu that occur during pregnancy can influence her GWG and may predict both maternal and fetal outcomes. Pregravid BMI Epidemiological studies, based largely on self-reported data, suggest that GWG is influenced by maternal BMI and is an important determinant of both maternal and neonatal health. In the United States, Chu et al. (2009) assessed PRAMS data for GWG by prepregnancy BMI among 52,988 women delivering full-term singleton from 2004-2005 (Table 4-4). This analysis found that GWG decreased as BMI increased, however, even though obese women gained less than normal or overweight women; about one-fourth of them still gained 35 pounds or more. Using a multivariable regression model, they showed that maternal prepregnancy obesity was the strongest predictor of low GWG, followed by higher parity, African American or Hispanic racial identity, and higher maternal age. In Germany, Voigt et al. (2007) analyzed perinatal statistics from over 2.3 million singleton deliveries from 1995-2000. This analysis concluded that overall, relatively short and heavy women had lower GWGs than tall and thin women. Although pregravid BMI can predict GWG there are also metabolic changes in pregnancy, i.e. basal metabolic rate (BMR), total energy expenditure (TEE), and hormonal changes that are independent of BMI which can influence GWG.

Insulin, Leptin, and Hormonal Milieu DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN P COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-21 Basal Metabolic Rate The metabolic response to pregnancy varies widely among women. Prentice et al. (1989) reported on longitudinal changes from pre-conception through 36 weeks gestation in eight healthy well nourished women. The mean GWG at 38 weeks gestation was 14.4 \u00b1 4.1 kg. Lean body mass increased linearly to a mean of 6.7 + 1.6 kg by 36 weeks gestation. Measured BMR va ried from 8.6 to 35.4 percent above pregravid BMR, although some obese subjects showed significant decreases in BMR up to 24 weeks gestation ( r = 0.84). In pregnant women, the relative cost of exercise for 120 minutes was approximately 10 percent of total energy expenditure. The authors concluded from finding a small range for energy savings from either minor physical activity or thermogenesis along with high variability in BMR during pregnancy, that offering prescriptive energy intake recommendations would be impractical because it is impossible to know how an individual woman's metabolism will respond. Durnin (1991) reported on longitudinal changes in energy expenditure during pregnancy among Scottish and Dutch women. Among this cohort, an increase in BMR was not seen until 16 weeks gestation and was followed by a mean increase of 400 kcal/day over pregravid BMI. The total energy cost of pregnancy was estimated at 69,000 kcal. Adjusting for dietary energy intake (~22,000 kcal) the authors estimated that decreased physical activity or increased efficiency of work accounted for an additional savings of ~47,000 kcal. Similarly Forsum et al. (1985) found an increase in BMR throughout gestation in a study of Swedish women. Lawrence et al. (1985), studied how women in a developing country responded to increasing food intake during pregnancy. Pregnant women in the Gambia who followed their normal dietary pattern experienced energy sparing of 11,000 kcal with no increase in BMR above pregravid BMI until 30 weeks gestation. Further, the women showed a mean GWG of 6 kg with no increase in adipose tissue mass. When their baseline diet was supplemented with 723 kcal/day in additional food, BMR increased by approximately 1,000 kcal over pregravid BMI. Women whose diets were supplemented with additional food had a mean 8 kg increase in GWG and a 2 kg increase in fat mass. Food supplementation had no effect, however, on the energy cost of activity and did not result in increased birth weight when physical work was decreased. Goldberg et al. (1993) used the doubly labeled water method (International Dietary Energy Consulting Group, 1990) to assess BMR, energy intake, and body composition in 12 affluent women at pre-conception and at 6 week intervals from 6 through 36 weeks gestation. Estimated changes in BMR, total energy expenditure (TEE) and fat deposition were 112 + 104 MJ, 243 + 279 MJ, and 132 + 127 MJ, respectively. The mean total energy cost of pregnancy calc ulated from BMR, TEE, and energy deposited as fat was 418 \u00b1 348 MJ. The women's self-reported energy intake however was only 208 \u00b1 272 MJ, a significant underestimate of the calculated additional energy cost of pregnancy. Again, the variability in the individual biological response shown in this study supports the impracticality of prescriptive recommendations for energy intake during pregnancy. A similar prospective study by Butte et al. (2004) of measured energy expenditure in women by prepregnant BMI showed that women in the highest BMI group accumulated greater fat mass (8.4 kg) compared to those in the low BMI group (5.3 kg). The increase in fat mass accounted for most of the variance in total weight gain among BMI groups. In both the low and high BMI groups mean TEE decreased in the second trimester but increased in the third trimester. When adjusted for fat free mass (FFM), TEE decreased in all BMI groups toward the end of gestation. Using multiple regression analysis, the change in TEE throughout the course of gestation was WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-22 related to prepregnancy BMI and percent body fat as well as weight gain and increase in FFM. These variables accounted for 33 percent of the variance in 24 hour TEE, primarily from change in BMR. Physical activity accounted for very little net increase in TEE and actually decreased in all groups with advancing gestation. Hormonal Milieu Maternal pregravid insulin sensitivity may vary up to 2- to 3-fold, depending on factors such as obesity, level of fitness and genetic make-up. Over the course of pregnancy a 40-60 percent decrease in insulin sensitivity occurs, depending on pregravid metabolic status (Catalano et al., 1993; Catalano et al., 1999). For example, a 50 percent decrease in insulin sensitivity in both a thin athletic woman and an obese sedentary woman with type 2 diabetes may represent a 2-fold or greater quantitative change in insulin sensitivity between them by the end of gestation. In the last 12 weeks of pregnancy, when fetal weight increases on the average from 1.0 kg to 3.5 kg, decreased insulin sensitivity increases the availability of energy to support fetal growth (Hytten and Chamberlain, 1991). These changes in insulin sensitivity occur over a matter of months whereas in a non-pregnant individual they may occur over many years. Swinburn et al. (1991) in a longitudinal study (3.5 years) showed that, in Pima Indians, those that were insulin resistant gained less weight over time than insulin sensitive subjects (3.1 versus 7.6 kg, p = 0.0001). The percent change in weight per year was correlated with glucose utilization ( r = 0.34, p = 0.0001). Whether similar physiologic relationships also apply to decreased GWG in obese women is not known. Swinburn et al. (1991) may not have had sufficient power to account for the greater inter-individual variability that was observed. There is, however, preliminary data showing that at least in early pregnancy changes in maternal BMR and fat accretion are inversely related to the changes in insulin sensitivity in a small number of subjects (Catalano et al., 1998). Whether increased energy intake in obese insulin-resistant women during pregnancy has a greater effect on maternal and fetal fat accretion than in non-obese women remains to be determined. Cytokines Both leptin and adiponectin are two adipocytokines related to fat accretion that have been examined in pregnancy. Leptin is produced in relatively large quantities by the placenta and is transferred primarily into the maternal circulation (Hauguel-deMouzon et al., 2006). Maternal leptin concentrations increase by 12 weeks gestation and have a significant positive correlation with both maternal body fat and basal metabolic rate in both early and late gestation (Highman et al., 1998). Using a stepwise regression analysis, Kirwan et al. (2002) showed that leptin made a significant contribution to changes in insulin sensitivity during gestation. A possible role for leptin in maternal metabolic adaptations to pregnancy may be found in the relationship between circulating leptin and increased maternal fat oxidation (Okereke et al., 2004). Adiponectin is a unique circulating cytokine that is positively correlated with insulin sensitivity and negatively correlated with adiposity (Cnop et al., 2003). In contrast to leptin and other cytokines, adiponectin is made exclusively in the maternal and fetal compartments, and not in the placenta (Pinar et al., 2008). There is no transfer of leptin from mother to fetus or vice versa. Lower adiponectin concentrations have been reported in women with previous GDM (Winzer et al., 2004) and leptin was shown to decrease over the course of pregnancy in women DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-23 with GDM compared to women with normal glucose tolerance (Retnarkaran et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2004). In summary both leptin and adiponectin are correlated with various components of maternal metabolism such as energy expenditure and adiposity. However, there are no direct mechanistic effects relating to the changes in maternal weight gain described in human pregnancy. Indirectly these cytokines through their effects on maternal insulin sensitivity may represent markers of other mechanisms effecting gestational weight changes. Medical Factors Pre-Existing Morbidities The committee was unable to identify studies that directly examined pre-existing morbidities as determinants of GWG. However, in general the pre-conceptional health status of a woman is important for optimal pregnancy outcome. This is particularly true for chronic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. In women with inflammatory bowel disease, and in particular Crohn's disease, the level of disease activity during pregnancy is related to disease activity at conception. Fonager et al. (1998) reported a decrease in birth weight and increased preterm delivery in women with active Crohn's disease at conception. Similarly in women with lupus complicating pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes are improved if lupus has been quiescent for at least six months before conception (Cunningham et al., 2005). Hyperemesis Gravidarum Although as many as 70-85 percent of pregnant women will have nausea and occasional vomiting in pregnancy (Jewell and Young, 2003), this often resolves by the second trimester. There are usually no long-term sequelae and treatment is mostly symptomatic including avoidance of certain foods and small frequent meals. However, approximately 0.5-2.0 percent of pregnant women will develop hyperemesis gravidarum (ACOG, 2004). The most commonly cited criteria for hyperemesis gravidarum include: persistent vomiting unrelated to other medical conditions, ketonuria, and weight loss of 5 percent or greater of prepregnancy weight at < 16 weeks' gestation (Goodwin et al., 1992). Other associated findings include dehydration, ketonuria, and electrolyte imbalance. The underlying etiology of this disorder is not known with certainty but rapid increases in circulating human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and estrogen in early pregnancy have been associated with the condition (Furneaux et al., 2001; Goodwin, 2002). In mild cases of nausea and vomiting there appears to be no adverse effect on maternal weight gain or pregnancy outcome. However, among women with hyperemesis gravidarum there is evidence of decreased GWG and a higher risk of low birth weight. Gross et al. (1989) reported on 64 women with a diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum. In the women who lost > 5 percent of their prepregnancy body weight, total GWG was lower (9.6 \u00b1 2.4 versus 13.7 \u00b1 3.2 kg, p < 0.05), and fetal growth was compromised, i.e. smaller percent weight for gestational age (38 percentile versus 72 percentile, p < 0.025) and increased growth restriction (30 percent versus 6 percent, p < 0.01) compared to women with a similar diagnosis that lost < 5 percent of their prepregnancy weight. Vilming and Nesheim (2000) and Bailit (2005) also reported that women with hyperemesis gravidarum had overall lower GWG and birth weight in comparison with a control group. Evidence for long-term outcomes on infant growth was not found. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-24 Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are frequently encountered in young women of reproductive age. Anorexia is defined as body weight less than 85 percent of expected for age and height. The prevalence in women of reproductive age is between 0.5-1.0 percent. Whereas bulimia is defined as weight at the minimally normal range but where the individual employs binge eating and subsequent compensatory methods such as self-induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic medications to avoid appropriate weight gain. Bulimia occurs in 1-3 percent of young women. A dysfunctional perception of body weight and shape is common to both disorders (Wisner et al., 2007). Sollid et al. (2004) in a Danish register-based follow-up study reported the results of 302 women with eating disorders before pregnancy and who were delivered 504 children and were compared with 900 control subjects who were delivered 1,552 children. There was almost a two- fold increased risk of preterm delivery and SGA. (Unfortunately the investigators were not able to obtain any information on prepregnancy BMI or GWG. In a smaller study from Sweden, Kouba et al. (2005) reported that among 49 women with previously diagnosed eating disorders 22 percent had a relapse of their eating disorder in pregnancy. The women with either a past or current eating disorder were at significantly increased risk of hyperemesis, and delivered children with significantly lower birth weight and head circumference as compared with a control group. Although there were no significant differences in GWG between the groups, the anorectic women ( n = 24) gained less weight than women with previous history of eating disorders (10.4 \u00b1 3.9 versus 12.1 \u00b1 2.6 kg, p < 0.05). The authors speculated that potential causes for the decreased fetal growth in the women with a history of eating disorders include their inability to achieve the recommended weight gain of 11.5-16.0 kg during pregnancy. There was no significant difference in intake of folate, protein or total caloric intake between the two groups. Bulik et al. (2008) found among a cohort of 35,929 pregnant Norwegian women, that 35 reported broad anorexia nervosa, 304 bulimia nervosa, 1,812 binge eating disorder, and 36 e ating disorder n ot otherwise s pecified (EDNOS)-purging type in the six months before or during pr egnancy. Prepregnancy BMI was lower in anorexia, and higher in binge eating disorder than the referent group, and anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disordered mothers reported greater GWG. Bariatric Surgery Parallel to the trend of increasing prevalence of obesity in the U.S., is an increase in the number of bariatric surgeries performed as treatment. The reported total number of bariatric surgical procedures performed in the U.S. increased from approximately 13,365 in 1998 to approximately 72,177 in 2002 (Santry et al., 2005; Davis et al., 2006). Furthermore, most of the procedures were performed on women; 81 percent in 1998 and 84 percent in 2002. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published a Committee Opinion on Obesity and Pregnancy addressing the issue of bariatric surgery and pregnancy (ACOG, 2005). ACOG recommends that obese women who have undergone bariatric surgery receive the following counseling before and during pregnancy: Patients with adjustable gastric banding should be advised that they are at risk of becoming pregnant unexpectedly after weight loss following surgery. DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-25 All patients are advised to delay pregnancy for 12-18 months after surgery to avoid pregnancy during the rapid weight loss phase. Women with gastric banding should be monitored by their general surgeons during pregnancy because adjustments of the band may be necessary. Patients should be evaluated for nutritional deficiencies, including iron, B12, folate, vitamin D and calcium, and supplemented with vitamins as necessary. With respect to GWG, three studies reported a decrease in weight gain during a subsequent pregnancy in women who had bariatric surgery (Skull et al., 2004; Dixon et al., 2005; Ducarme et al., 2007). Nutritional complications during pregnancy, such as folate and B 12 deficiencies, are also associated with bariatric surgery (Gurewitsch et al., 1996). No prospective randomized trials of pregnancy outcome in obese women treated by bariatric surgery were identified. However, there have been reports using the patient as her own control i.e. a pregnancy outcome before bariatric surgery and a subsequent pregnancy outcome after having a bariatric procedure (Marceau et al., 2004; Skull et al., 2004; Dixon et al., 2005) or retrospective case controlled studies (Ducarme et al., 2007). Incidence of GDM and hypertensive disorders were found to be decreased in the studies of Skull et al. (2004), Dixon et al. (2005), and Ducarme et al. (2007). The effect of bariatric surgery on the risk of fetal macrosomia and birth weight are inconclusive. Marceau et al. (2004) and Ducarme et al. (2007) reported a decreased risk of macrosomia in women following bariatric surgery. In contrast, neither Dixon et al. (2005) nor Skull et al. (2004) reported a decrease in macrosomia. Care must be taken in the interpretation of these studies because of their retrospective nature and use of various definitions of outcome measures. Twins and Higher Order Pregnancy The presence of multiple fetuses in a pregnancy has an influence on total GWG. In comparison to singleton birth the additional components of the products of a twin gestation (fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid) account for up to two additional kilograms in GWG (See discussion in Chapter 3). The effects of GWG on maternal and child health outcomes for multiple births are discussed in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively. Psychological Factors Depression Several investigators have reported positive associations between GWG and depressive symptoms. Bodnar et al. (in press) followed a sample of 242 mostly well-educated white women through pregnancy and assessed clinical depression through structured interviews at 20, 30, and 36 weeks gestation. The study found that all women with GWG below the ranges recommended by IOM (1990) had an elevated prevalence of major depression, regardless of their pregravid BMI (Bodnar et al., in press). Hickey et al. (1995) conducted a prospective study of depressive symptoms at 24-26 weeks and inadequate GWG in a large cohort of low-income, non-obese black and white women. The authors reported that white women in the highest quartile of depressive symptom score were three times as likely as women in the lowest quartile to have weight gain below the ranges recommended by IOM (1990). No relationship was found, WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-26 however, between depression and low weight gain in black women (Hickey et al., 1995). In a cohort of over 4,000 Hispanic women, self-reported feelings of depression during the pregnancy were found to be negatively associated with GWG (Siega-Riz and Hobel, 1997). In a recent study, pregnant women who gained in excess of the ranges recommended by IOM (1990) were more likely to have high depressive symptoms than women who met the weight gain recommendations (Webb et al., 2009). Casanueva et al. (2000) used a case-control study to test for associations between maternal depressive symptoms and fat deposition among pregnant adolescents in Mexico City. Body weight and anthropometric measures of skinfold thickness were used to determine fat deposition beginning at 20 weeks gestation through four weeks postpartum. The results of this study indicated an association between depressive symptoms and excessive fat deposition in Mexican adolescents. In cross-sectional studies, high depressive symptoms have been linked with negative attitudes about GWG (Stevens-Simon et al., 1993; Dipietro et al., 2003). Women who are concerned before and during pregnancy about their weight gain have higher depressive scores in the week following delivery (Abraham et al., 2001). Cameron et al. (1996) studied a biracial sample of 132 women in mid-gestation and found that GWG had no association with depressive symptoms in the second trimester. Third-trimester weight was negatively correlated with depression score, but only among white women with low self-esteem. A positive association between GWG and depression score was found for white women with high self-esteem, whereas GWG had no effect on depression in black women (Cameron et al., 1996). Walker and Kim (2002) used data from a longitudinal study of postpartum weight patterns in low income women to test for relationships between depressive symptoms and GWG and birth weight. Regression analyses found that depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with GWG. Collectively, the majority of studies indicate that low and high GWG may be a marker of depression during pregnancy. Trends in depression among women of child-bearing age are shown in Chapter 2. Stress Among studies that evaluate stress, social support, or depression and its relationship to postpartum weight retention there is no consistent evidence in support of a relationship between stress and GWG or increased postpartum weight retention. The impact, however, of psychosocial factors such as stress on GWG and postpartum weight retention may be underestimated as a result of the limitations in measurement and data analysis in observational studies. An additional confounding factor is that stress can have different kinds of effects depending on how an individual responds. The influence of psychological stress as a factor in GWG and pregnancy outcome was examined in a controlled prospective study of a group of 60 women utilizing an urban prenatal clinic (Picone et al., 1982). Psychological stress was assessed using a social readjustment rating scale from the Holmes-Rahe life events questionnaire. This study found a correlation between higher stress scores and lower GWG, independent of nutrient or caloric intake. This finding suggests that stress did not affect food intake in these subjects, rather the utilization of calories and nutrients from the foods consumed to support pregnancy was impacted. A robust association between the appraisals of stress and sufficiency of coping resources and adequacy of GWG in crude or adjusted models was not identified. However, when evaluating the risk ratio differences observed between women who gained inadequate or excessive weight (relative to women who gained adequate weight), the former tended to have a stronger, albeit modest, link to perceived stress than the latter. This distinction is comparable to a pattern also DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-27 cited previously in another investigation (Brawarsky et al., 2005). In tha t study, women who reported high stress during pregnancy tended to gain weight below clinical guidelines in contrast to those who did not report significant prenatal stress. This relationship failed to emerge among those who gained weight in excess of clinical advice. This finding is also consistent with earlier work that typically reported higher stress in relation to insufficient GWG (Orr et al., 1996). Social Support There is inconclusive evidence for a role of social support as a determinant of GWG. In a prospective study of 806 low-income, non-obese pregnant women, Hickey et al. (1995) found that the levels of social support did not predict low GWG for either black or white women. Casanueva et al. (1994) reported on the impact of psychological support, given to a group of adolescents during pregnancy, on GWG. Adolescents who received additional psychological support by a psychotherapy team gained, on average, 2.8 kg more than adolescents who did not receive support. More recently, Olson and Strawderman (2003) found the effect of social support on GWG varied significantly by BMI group. Low social support among low, normal, and obese women was associated with significantly more weight gain than that of their counterparts with average or high social support. However, obese women who had low social support gained significantly less weight relative to those with average or high social support. Attitudes Toward Weight Gain or Weight Loss Several studies have examined the relationship between maternal attitude toward weight gain during pregnancy and actual GWG. Palmer et al. (1985) developed an 18-item scale measuring pregnant women's attitude toward their own weight gain and found among 29 white, middle- class women that positive attitude was significantly associated with higher actual weight gain. Steven-Simon et al. (1993) found, in a study of 99 pregnant adolescents, that weight gain was significantly related to 4 of 18 scale items but not the total attitude scale score. However, Copper et al. (1995) found in a sample of 1,000 black and white low-income women that the attitude score was not significantly related to GWG. Maternal attitude toward weight gain was found to be influenced by prepregnancy BMI; thin women tended to have positive attitudes and obese women tended to have negative attitudes about GWG (Copper et al., 1995). Taken together, the evidence is inconclusive regarding the influence of maternal attitude on actual GWG. For the majority of women, weight loss during pregnancy is discouraged. However, a small percentage (8.1) of women reported in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) that they attempted to lose weight during pregnancy (CDC, 1989; 1991). Another survey of women who reported being pregnant and also trying to lose weight indicated that prevalence of weight loss behavior during pregnancy occurred among those who reported drinking and smoking (12.7 percent), women in the first trimester of pregnancy (9.4 percent), those who were diabetic (9 percent), and those with very high BMIs (6.9 percent) (Cogswell et al., 1996). Cohen and Kim (2009) reviewed aggregated multiple year data between 1996 and 2003 from the BRFSS (1989) and found weight loss attempts during pregnancy were more frequent among women over 34 years of age (6.2 percent) and Hispanic women (13.1 percent). Carmichael et al. (2003) reported in a population-based case control study of 538 cased and 539 control infants that restricted food intake or fad dieting by the mother during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with significant risk for neural tube defect among both food restrictors (OR = 2.1 [95% CI: 1.1-4.1]) and dieters (OR = 5.8 [95% CI: 1.7-10]) compared to controls. Interestingly, WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-28 no significant increased risk for neural tube defect was detected for dieting behaviors during the three months prior to conception. Behavioral Factors The issue of energy balance is central relative to the evaluation of GWG, regardless of whether it is in gravid or pregravid women. Dietary Intake Dietary factors may influence GWG however, a significant difference in GWG from balanced energy/protein supplementation in normal weight women was not supported in a systematic review of 10 trials (Kramer and Kakuma, 2003). Two trials reviewed in Kramer and Kakuma (2003) among women who were obese (Campbell, 1983) or had high GWG (Campbell and MacGillivray, 1975) showed energy/protein restriction was associated with a significant reduction in weekly maternal weight gain (weighted mean difference of 255 [95% CI= -436.56 to -73.0] g/week). Several observational studies have also examined the relationship between prepregnancy BMI, caloric intake, and GWG. Bergmann et al. (1997) reported on data in 156 healthy German women. The authors defined maternal weight gain as \"net weight gain\", i.e. the weight gain of the mother from the end of the third trimester minus the measured weight in the first trimester, excluding the weight of the fetus and placenta. The authors defined high BMI as > 24. Net weight gain was related to both maternal pregravid BMI and energy intake. There was a decrease in net weight gain in the high BMI group (4.2 kg) as compared to the medium BMI group (6.2 kg) and low BMI group (5.9 kg). In the high BMI group, parity was a significant co-variable. The lower weight gain was confined to the multigravid women, whereas the primigravid high BMI group actually had greater net weight gain. These associations did not appreciably change when adjusted for energy intake, which did not vary during the course of pregnancy. Neither maternal BMI nor energy intake was related to birth weight. Olson and Strawderman (2003) used a proxy measure for energy intake by questioning women about changes in the amount of food eaten prior to and during pregnancy. They found in a clinic sample of 622 healthy pregnant women that consuming either \"much more\" or \"much less\" food during rather than prior to pregnancy was associated with greater (3.67 pounds; P < 0.001) and less (-3.16 pounds; P < 0.05) GWG, respectively, compared with maintaining similar levels of food intake. Their multivariable model found that women who ate \"much more\" during rather than before their pregnancy had an adjusted odds ratio of 2.35 for excessive GWG. Lagiou et al. (2004) found in a clinic sample of 224 pregnant women that increased GWG by the end of the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with higher total energy intake as well as a higher proportion of protein and lipids of animal origin and lower proportion of carbohydrates. More recently, Olafsdottir et al. (2006) reported on the relationship of dietary factors relating to GWG in 495 healthy Icelandic women using food frequency questionnaires. Optimal weight gain in normal weight women was defined as between 12-18 kg and for overweight women between 7-12 kg. Eleven percent of overweight women had inadequate weight gain ( 7 kg). Additionally, 55 percent of overweight women gained excessive weight (>12 kg) and 20 percent of normal weight women gained excessive weight (>18 kg). A \"suboptimal\" weight gain resulted in a mean birth weight of 3,591 + 447 g while excessive weight gain resulted in a mean weight of 3,872 + 471 g. DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-29 Analyses from the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Study (Deierlein et al., 2008) showed that compared to women consuming diets within the lowest quartile for energy density (defined as the number of calories/g of food consumed) during the second trimester, women consuming diets with energy density values in the third and highest quartiles gained a significant excess of over 1 kg in total GWG. Beyond general food intake, several studies have also examined consumption of different types of food as well as macronutrient and micronutrient intake. Steven-Simon and McAnarney (1992) showed in a study of adolescents that those who consumed fewer than three snacks a day had slower weight gains during pregnancy. Olson and Strawderman (2003) found women who consumed three or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day gained 1.81 pounds less than those who consumed fewer servings during pregnancy. Olafsdottir et al. (2006) found that among women in Iceland, the percentage of energy intake from various macronutrients is an important predictor of weight gain only among overweight women and late in pregnancy. Compared with women gaining suboptimal weight, the diet of overweight women gaining excessive weight had higher energy percentage from fat and lower energy percentage from carbohydrates. They also found that consumption of dairy products and sweets in late pregnancy was associated with a decreased risk of inadequate gain and an increased risk of excessive gain during pregnancy. In a small randomized clinical trial of a low-glycemic versus a high-glycemic diet, Clapp (2002) found that the women on the low-glycemic diet gained less weight during pregnancy (22.9 compared with 40.9 pounds). The mechanisms involved were thought to include changes in: daily digestible energy requirements (i.e. metabolic efficiency), substrate utilization (glucose oxidation versus lipid oxidation), and insulin resistance and sensitivity (Clapp, 2002). However, Deierlein et al. (2008) reported no statistical effect of glycemic load alone on total GWG or weight gain ratio. Their findings suggest that race/ethnicity may interact with glycemic processes, such that white women with glycemic load increases were more sensitive to increased weight gain during pregnancy; this was not true for black women Altogether several studies have demonstrated a relationship between energy intake and GWG. Additional evidence suggests that dietary intake may also influence GWG however the evidence is insufficient to draw a conclusion. Physical Activity The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) took the position in 2002 that, in the absence of either medical or obstetric complications, 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise a day on most, if not all, days was recommended for pregnant women (ACOG, 2002). The ACOG report emphasized that participation in a wide range of recreational activities appears to be safe for pregnant women. Participation in activities with a high potential for trauma to the woman or fetus, however, should be avoided. Published reviews on exercise and pregnancy concluded that the balance of evidence suggests a benefit of exercise during pregnancy, especially for maternal outcomes (Morris and Johnson, 2005; Gavard and Artal, 2008). Moderate exercise during a low risk pregnancy was found to be safe for both the mother and fetus and to improve overall maternal fitness and well- being as well as maternal and fetal outcomes (Morris and Johnson, 2005). The report of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (DHHS, 2008) concluded that: WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-30 a) Moderate-intensity leisure time physical activity is not associated with an increased risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, or early pregnancy loss; and b) Participation in vigorous activities has been associated with small reductions in birth weight compared to less active women (Hegaard et al., 2007; Leet and Flick, 2003) but not with gestational age at birth or birth weight (Evenson et al., 2002; Duncombe et al., 2006). Gavard and Artal (2008) concurred with the latter findings however a Cochrane Review (Kramer and McDonald, 2006) concluded that the evidence was insufficient to evaluate the risks or benefits of exercise in pregnant women for infant outcomes. Several studies have examined the effects of regular physical activity on GWG (Abrams et al., 2000; Siega-Riz et al., 2004). Based on theoretical energy calculation alone, it appears that regular physical activity has the potential to prevent excessive GWG. The main issue then becomes whether it can be shown to work in practice. A number of observational studies but few randomized controlled trials have been reported on this topic. A small number of reports have addressed the issue of the prevalence of physical activity behavior in pregnant women. A cross sectional survey of pregnant women found that about 48 percent reported some exercise participation during pregnancy (Hinton and Olson, 2001). The most common activities were walking, swimming and aerobics. In general, the proportion of exercising pregnant women declines across trimesters of pregnancy. In one study of 388 pregnant women, 41 percent were active before pregnancy (Ohlin and Rossner, 1994). By the third trimester, only 14 percent of the women continued to participate in aerobic exercise. Two meta-analyses and several reviews have concluded that the level of physical activity in pregnant women did not have an influence on GWG (Lokey et al., 1991; Sternfeld et al., 1995; Stevenson, 1997; Kramer and Kakuma, 2003; Morris and Johnson, 2005). However, the meta- analyses did not take into account a number of key factors, including the most critical one: the level of physical activity-related energy expenditure. If the energy cost of the exercise program is very low, it should not be surprising that its influences on GWG cannot be shown. Some observational studies suggest that maintaining an active lifestyle or adding physical activity to the normal daily schedule of the pregnant woman may attenuate GWG. Clapp and Little (1995) compared exercising women who became pregnant and who continued to exercise at least three times per week to a group of women who stopped exercising once they became pregnant. The rate of GWG and of subcutaneous fat accretion (determined by skinfold thickness) was similar between the two groups during the first and second trimesters but the exercising women gained significantly less body weight and skinfold thickness during the third trimester. On average, the pregnant women who continued to exercise gained about 3 kg less. These observations were from a Norwegian study of 467 pregnant women who answered a questionnaire on physical activity level in week 36 of their pregnancy (Haakstad et al., 2007). Women who exercised regularly had significantly lower weight gain than inactive women in the third trimester only. In a study of 96 obese women with GDM self-enrolled in either a diet ( n = 57) or an exercise plus diet ( n = 39) program during the last two months of pregnancy, the mean weight gain per week was less in the exercise plus diet group (0.1 \u00b1 0.4 kg versus 0.3 \u00b1 0.4 kg) (Artal et al., 2007). The exercise session consisted of walking on the treadmill or cycling in a semi-recumbent position once a week followed by unsupervised exercise at home for the remaining six days. The DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-31 exercise plus diet group exercised for 153 \u00b1 91 min per week. Complications, infant birth weight, and the proportion of cesarean deliveries were comparable between the two groups. Based on the limited available evidence, the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee concluded that \"unless there are medical reasons to the contrary, a pregnant woman can begin or continue a regular physical activity program throughout gestation, adjusting the frequency, intensity, and time as her condition warrants\" (DHHS, 2008). The committee added that \"in the absence of data, it is reasonable for women during pregnancy and the postpartum period to follow the moderate-intensity recommendations set for adults unless specific medical concerns warrant a reduction in activity\". It is commonly recognized however that adequately powered randomized, controlled intervention studies on the potential benefits and risks of regular physical activity at various dose levels in pregnant women are needed. Physical activity, such as work, spontaneous activity, fidgeting, and personal chores as well as exercise account for a widely variable fraction of total energy expenditure. In some, this may reach only about 15 percent of daily energy expenditure while in others it may be as high as 50 percent (Hill et al., 2004). Most recently, Lof et al. (2008) assessed the effects of maternal physical activity level (PAL) and BMI on GWG in 223 healthy Swedish women. Pregravid PAL was related to decreased weight gain in the third trimester, about 0.10 kg/week less in the high PAL than in the low or medium PAL groups. Maternal BMI was inversely associated with weight gain in the second trimester but there was a positive association between maternal BMI and GWG in the third trimester. However, maternal smoking, parity, education, age, pre-gravid PAL explained only four percent of the variance in maternal weight gain and PAL was not related to birth weight. In sum, several studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between the level of physical activity and GWG. Based on energetic fundamentals alone, maintaining a reasonable level of exercise-related energy expenditure during pregnancy should moderate GWG. Energy requirements based on PAL are provided in Appendix B. Substance Abuse Cigarette smoking Taken together, early studies examining associations between decreasing GWG and amount of reported smoking show inconclusive results. Rush (1974) found a strong relationship between amount of smoking and decreasing GWG ( p < 0.01) while Garn et al. (1979) found no association between smoking and non-smoking mothers and GWG. Several investigators examined whether smoking had a negative effect on caloric intake as a causative factor for higher incidence of SGA in smoking mothers. Haworth et al. (1980) found that women who smoked during pregnancy actually had higher mean caloric intakes with no difference in GWG; but a greater number of low birth weight infants than non-smokers. Similarly, Papoz et al. (1982) found higher mean caloric intake and lower birth weight in women who smoked during pregnancy. More recently, Furuno et al. (2004) found no significant difference in mean GWG between smoking and non-smoking mothers but did find a slightly increased (1.3-fold) risk for low GWG among smokers. Although there is limited evidence that cigarette smoking may be inversely associated with GWG there is a preponderance of evidence that supports an independent effect of smoking on birth weight (Muscati et al., 1988; Wolff et al., 1993; Adriananse et al., 1996). Seckler-Walker and Vacek (2003) examined the effect of smoking on birth weight independent of GWG and found that gains in infant birth weight among mothers who stopped smoking during pregnancy were not related to GWG, but rather to the independent effect of smoking on birth weight. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-32 Alcohol use Little information is available about effects of alcohol consumption on GWG. Wells et al. (2006) assessed biological, psychological and behavioral characteristics to determine associations with inadequate or excessive GWG. This analysis found no significant association between smoking and drinking and GWG outside the IOM (1990) guidelines. Little et al., (1986) found no difference in GWG between infrequent (< 7.5 g/day), occasional (7.5-15 g/day), and regular ( 15g/day) alcohol consumers during pregnancy. In a study of determinants of GWG in poor black adolescent mothers, Stevens-Simon and McAnarney (1992) found that alcohol use was more frequent among mothers who experienced rapid GWG. Alcohol, however, is a potent teratogen and its effects on pregnancy outcome are independent of GWG (Hanson et al., 1978; Little et al., 1986; Jacobsen et al., 1994; Bagheri et al., 1998). Thus, any impact of alcohol consumption on GWG is of little relevance compared to its teratogenic effects. Drug use Amphetamines are anorectic drugs and their use during pregnancy would be expected to result in low GWG. Smith et al. (2006) assessed a cohort of 1,618 pregnant women that included 84 methamphetamine users. Analysis of GWG in the methamphetamine exposed group showed that those who used the drug in the first two trimesters but ceased use by the third trimester gained significantly more weight than either women who used throughout pregnancy or non-exposed women, suggesting the anorexic effects of methamphetamine are limited to continuous use, and there may be a rebound in weight gain if the mother stops use. Nevertheless, this study found exposure to methamphetamines increased the incidence of SGA births 3.5 times over the non-exposed group. Graham et al. (1992) conducted a prospective study with 30 women who were social users of cocaine during the first trimester of pregnancy. No significant differences were found between the drug users and non-users for GWG, delivery complications, birth weight, and other adverse outcomes. Chronic use of cocaine, however, has been shown to be associated with adverse maternal and fetal consequences (Wagner et al., 1998; Ogunyemi and Hernandez-Loera, 2004). Unintended Pregnancy Evidence for an effect of unintended pregnancy on GWG appears to be conflicting. Hickey et al. (1997) found that mistimed or unplanned pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for insufficient GWG among black but not among white women. In a study by Siega-Riz and Hobel (1997), planned pregnancy was associated with a marginally statistically significant decreased risk for insufficient GWG, but only among the low and normal weight subjects in a Hispanic cohort. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experiences of Youth, Marsiglio and Mott (1988) found in a cohort of 6,015 primiparous women that not desiring a pregnancy was not a significant predictor of very low prenatal weight gain. Several large population-based surveys have not found an association between GWG and planned pregnancy (Kost et al., 1998; Wells et al., 2006). VULNERABLE POPULATIONS Seasonal Migrant Workers The actual number of migrant farm workers currently in the U.S. in not known, but estimates are that at least 3-5 million migrant and seasonal workers come to the U.S. each year (CDC, 1997). Further, approximately 16 percent of migrant workers are women. Data about GWG among migrant women in four states was obtained through the Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-33 System (PNSS). Analysis of the data collected showed that about 52 percent of migrant women gained less than the range recommended by IOM (1990) compared to 32 percent of non-migrant women. Mean weight gain was also lower for migrant women (22.9 pounds) compared to non- migrant women (29.7 pounds). However, even though migrant women had lower GWG than non-migrant women, the prevalence for adverse birth outcomes (low birth weight, very low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age) was similar for both groups (CDC, 1997). Similarly, Reed et al. (2005) found that migrant women had higher rates of pregnancy-related risk factors but lower rates of adverse birth outcomes compared to non-migrant women. Military The committee was unable to identify studies that specifically examined GWG among women in military service. Several studies found women in active-duty experience greater stress but less job control, as well as higher rates of depression, compared to a parity-matched control group of dependent military wives (Magann and Nolan, 1991; O'Boyle et al., 2005), but it is unclear how these factors might influence GWG. One study surveyed pregnant women with deployed partners (Haas and Pazdernik, 2006). Women whose partners were deployed showed a greater tendency to deliver a large infant and reported more stress and changed eating habits, compared to women whose partners were not deployed; however, the results were not statistically significant. No difference was seen in the gestational age at delivery, percentage with vaginal delivery, average number of children at home, self-reported stress, or reported GWG. Women Incarcerated During Pregnancy The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that women offenders account for about 16 percent of the total corrections population (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1999). Recent estimates show that the number of women under the jurisdiction of State or Federal prison authorities increased 1.2 percent from year-end 2007, reaching 115,779 (Available: http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/prisons.htm. Accessed April 13, 2009). Of women who are incarcerated, most are of child-bearing age and approximately 6 percent are pregnant (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1994; Safyer and Richmond, 1995). While there are no studies that have examined the direct effect of incarceration on GWG per se, several studies (Martin et al., 1997a, 1997b; Bell et al., 2004) have examined its effect on birth weight. Martin et al. (1997a) found that a higher number of pregnancy days spent incarcerated was found to be associated with higher infant birth weight. Furthermore, Martin et al. (1997b) also found that infant birth weights among women incarcerated during pregnancy were not significantly different from women never incarcerated; however, infant birth weights were significantly worse among women incarcerated at a time other than during pregnancy than among never-incarcerated women and women incarcerated during pregnancy, suggesting certain aspects of the prison environment, such as shelters and regular meals, may be protective particularly for high-risk pregnant women. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-34 FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Findings 1. There is a lack of evidence on societal/institutional (media, culture/acculturation, health services, policy), environmental (altitude, exposures to environmental toxicants, disasters), and neighborhood determinants (access to healthy foods, opportunities for physical activities) of GWG. a. Few of the studies reviewed considered the influence of the many possible determinants of GWG among women of different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups, or alternatively, adjusted for race/ethnicity or SES in their analyses. b. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the influences of psychological factors such as depression, stress, social support, or attitude toward GWG on actual GWG. c. There remains a lack of information to relate dietary intake or physical activity to GWG even though they are primary determinants of weight gain in non-pregnant individuals. 2. Married women are more likely to have appropriate GWG than unmarried women. Intimate partner violence is associated with insufficient GWG. There is a paucity of studies examining the influence of partner/family support on GWG. 3. GWG is generally higher among adolescents and lower among women > 35 years of age, although the relationship of GWG among these groups to birth outcomes, post-partum weight retention, and subsequent risk for overweight/obesity remains unclear. 4. There is a lack of evidence on GWG among vulnerable populations, specifically, seasonal migrant workers, women in military service, and women incarcerated during pregnancy. 5. The IOM (1990) GWG guidelines appear to influence what women believe to be appropriate weight gain during pregnancy, though their influence on actual GWG is less clear in part because many health professionals are providing no or inappropriate advice about weight gain during pregnancy. 6. There is growing evidence suggesting that specific fetal and maternal genes and alleles can influence GWG, though both parental genotypes appear to affect birth weight. The effect of developmental programming and epigenetic events on GWG is strongly suspected but direct evidence is still lacking. Leptin and adiponectin may represent markers of insulin sensitivity or other mechanisms affecting gestational weight changes. Research Recommendation Research Recommendation 4-1: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct studies in large and diverse populations of women to understand how dietary intake, physical activity, dieting practices, food insecurity and, more broadly, the social, cultural and environmental context affect GWG. DETERMINANTS OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 4-35 Areas for Additional Investigation The committee identified the following areas for further investigation to support its research recommendations. The research community should conduct studies on: social, cultural, and environmental contexts of GWG. Findings from these studies should help guide the development of implementation strategies for GWG recommendations; healthcare providers' knowledge, attitude, and behavior with respect to GWG recommendations. These studies should identify facilitators and barriers to adoption of GWG recommendations by healthcare providers in their clinical practice; partner and family influences on GWG; influences of genetic factors, epigenetic events, and developmental programming on GWG; how GWG affect birth outcomes, postpartum weight retention, and overweight and obesity in later life among adolescents and older women. Findings from these studies should be used to reevaluate the appropriateness of GWG recommendations for these women. determining whether maternal biomarkers such as leptin, adiponectin, and other markers of insulin sensitivity can be used to enhance clinical prediction of adverse birth outcomes and guide further interventions for women with GWG outside the recommended ranges. Data on relevant biomarkers should be made available through databases such as the Federal Human Nutrition Research and Information Management (HNRIM) System Database; and influences of psychological factors, such as depression, stress, social support, and attitude toward GWG on actual GWG. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or other appropriate federal agencies should: track racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in GWG and that the research community conduct studies on how GWG affect birth outcomes, postpartum weight retention, and overweight and obesity in later life among women of different racial-ethnic and socioeconomic groups; collect nationally representative data on dietary intake, physical activity, and food insecurity among prepregnant, pregnant and postpartum women, and report these data by prepregnancy body mass index (including all classes of obesity), age, racial/ethnic group, and socioeconomic status; and collect data on GWG among vulnerable populations.

As noted in Chapter 1 and discussed in detail in Chapter 2, there is an increased prevalence in the United States of women who are overweight or obese entering pregnancy, also putting them at greater risk for several of these same adverse pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, more women are becoming pregnant at an older age and are thus entering pregnancy with chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes that could contribute to increased morbidity during both the prenatal and postpartum periods. To review the evidence on outcomes related to gestational weight gain (GWG) within or outside the 1990 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned a comprehensive, systematic evidence-based review of the literature since the release of the IOM (1990) report Nutrition During Pregnancy. This review included evidence on the consequences of GWG for both the mother and infant (Viswananthan et al., 2008). The committee used this review as a foundation for discussion of the state of the science for GWG and maternal outcomes in this chapter as well as for infant outcomes in Chapter 6. It is important to note that research since 1990 has focused on the consequences of gains above the IOM (1990) recommendations\u2014to the exclusion of gains below those recommendations\u2014on maternal and infant outcomes. The reader is referred to IOM (1990) for a discussion of the consequences of gaining too little weight gain during pregnancy. The following briefly reviews the state of the science before the IOM (1990) report then summarizes findings from the recently published AHRQ evidence-based review on outcomes of gestational weight gain (GWG) (Viswanathan et al., 2008). These discussions also include articles published since the AHRQ report in which associations between GWG and maternal outcomes are examined (see Appendix F for summary data tables). To interpret the rating scales from the AHRQ report, the committee indicates how the articles were rated and how the strength of the evidence was determined. The methodological approach and system of rating articles used in the AHRQ review is provided in Appendix E. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK: CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE MOTHER The committee's conceptual framework (see Chapter 1) illustrates a model for maternal and child outcomes consequent to GWG outside the ranges recommended by the IOM (1990) report (Figure 5-1). There are numerous potential causal factors, including environmental factors, that can influence the determinants of GWG and its consequences and others that may affect those WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-2 consequences by other routes. These consequences, i.e. adverse health outcomes to the mother, can arise in the prenatal and/or postpartum periods. Among the well-studied prenatal maternal outcomes that result from excessive GWG are pregnancy-associated hypertension (including preeclampsia and eclampsia) and risk of complications in labor and delivery. In the postpartum period, weight retention can lead to higher weight status in subsequent pregnancies as well as weight retention and other long-term maternal health consequences such as increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately the literature in this area does not allow inference of causality because it is based solely on observational studies. FIGURE 5-1 Schematic summary of maternal consequences associated with gestational weight gain. CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE MOTH ER PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-3 CONSEQUENCES DURING PREGNANCY Gestational Diabetes and Impaired Glucose Tolerance Pregnancy is frequently accompanied by a pronounced physiological decrease in peripheral insulin sensitivity (reviewed in Chapter 3). Gestational diabetes, the development of abnormal glucose tolerance only during pregnancy, generally arises from the combination of decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta-cell dysfunction. It is well established that women who are obese when they enter pregnancy tend to develop a more pronounced insulin resistance and are at greater risk for GDM than are non-obese women (Dahlgren, 2006; Chu et al., 2007). The incidence of GDM has increased dramatically in recent decades (See Chapter 2). From 1989 to 2004 there was a relative increase in prevalence of GDM of 122 percent for the U.S. population as a whole; and 260 percent among African American women (Getahun et al., 2008). Most women with normal glucose tolerance develop elevated blood ketones with ketonuria at various times during pregnancy (Chez and Curcio, 1987). Pregnant women with diabetes, on the other hand, are more likely to develop sustained elevated blood ketones and ketonuria than women with normal glucose tolerance in pregnancy. Gin et al. (2006), who measured capillary blood ketones and beta-hydroxybutyrate in women with normal glucose tolerance (controls) and those with GDM three times a day between 25 and 37 weeks gestation, found that fasting ketonuria was strongly correlated with ketonemia in controls but not women with GDM. Maternal ketonuria or acetonuria during pregnancy is a concern because it can result in neonatal or childhood neurocognitive dysfunction (see discussion in Chapters 3 and 6). As described in the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008), the literature since 1990 includes 11 published articles that together provide weak evidence in support of an association between GWG and development of abnormal glucose metabolism (either GDM or impaired glucose tolerance). Four of the studies reported that GWG above the range recommended in the IOM (1990) report was positively associated with abnormal glucose tolerance (Edwards et al., 1996; Kieffer et al., 2001; Kabiru and Raynor, 2004; Saldana et al., 2006). Three studies reported that women whose GWG was below the recommended range had a higher likelihood of GDM (Thorsdottir et al., 2002; Brennand et al., 2005; Kieffer et al., 2006) and four studies found no significant association between GWG and glucose tolerance (Bianco et al., 1998; Murakami et al., 2005; Seghieri et al., 2005; Hackmon et al., 2007). All but one study (Saldana et al., 2006) were limited by the use of total GWG as the exposure variable rather than weight gain until the time of diagnosis. This is problematic because management of GDM includes dietary counseling and efforts to control weight gain. Catalano et al. (1993) reported that weight gain in women who developed GDM was less than in women with normal glucose tolerance primarily as a result of their greater pregravid weight. When GWG was assessed separately for early, mid- and late gestation in women with GDM, there was a significantly decreased rate of weight gain in overweight women with GDM, although only from 30 weeks gestation until delivery. There is biologic plausibility for an effect of GWG on the development of glucose tolerance: higher GWG could result in greater fat deposition, which could then influence insulin sensitivity. The body of evidence to date, however, is weak in support of such an association. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-4 Hypertensive Disorders Hypertensive include pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre- eclampsia, and eclampsia. The risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension is greater among women who enter pregnancy overweight or obese. Thadhani et al (1999) examined the relationship between pre-gravid BMI, elevated cholesterol, and the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy among 15,262 women. The age-adjusted relative risk for developing gestational hypertension was 1.7 and 2.2 for women with BMI values of 25-29.9 and > 30 kg/m2, r espectively, compared to women with BMI values < 21 kg/m2. Preeclampsia is about twice as prevalent among overweight and about three times as prevalent among obese women as it is among normal weight women (Sibai et al., 1997; Catalano et al., 2007). Furthermore, the severity of the disease increases as BMI increases (Bodnar et al., 2007). The IOM (1990) report described the relationship between GWG and hypertensive conditions as being unclear because of limited and inclusive data. Since that report was published, 12 studies were examined in the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008). Out of five studies (two rated fair and the rest rated poor) that examined the outcome of pregnancy- induced hypertension (Edwards et al., 1996; Bianco et al., 1998; Thorsdottir et al., 2002; Brennand et al., 2005; Jensen et al., 2005), an association between higher GWG and pregnancy- induced hypertension was found in only two of them (Thorsdottir et al., 2002; Jensen et al., 2005). The studies, however, differed in control for confounding. Thorsdottir et al. (2002) adjusted for age, parity, height, and gestational age. Jensen et al (2005) adjusted for 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) result, maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, gestational age (continuous variables), parity, smoking, and ethnic background. As a result, the relationship between increased GWG and onset of hypertension continues to remain unclear. The outcome of preeclampsia has been examined in a total of 10 studies (Edwards et al., 1996; Ogunyemi et al., DeVader et al., 2007; Kiel et al., 2007), of which seven were rated fair and the rest were rated of poor quality. Overall, an association between higher total GWG and higher risk of pre-eclampsia was found in six of these studies (Edwards et al., 1996; Ogunyemi et al., 1998; et al., 2007; Kiel et al., 2007). Lower total weight gains were found to be protective in four studies (Brennand et al., 2005; Cedergren, 2006; DeVader et al., 2007; Kiel et al., 2007). Those studies that did not find an association for high total GWG (Thorsdottir et al., 2002; Kabiru and Raynor, 2004; Murakami et al., 2005; Wataba et al., 2006) were primarily conducted in women who were not overweight or obese (two were conducted in Japan). Two studies not included in the AHRQ review using birth certificate data from the state of Missouri (Kiel et al., 2007 and DeVader et al., 2007), showed similar results, namely that GWG above the recommended range leads to higher risk of preeclampsia among overweight women (Langford et al., 2008). These studies were also limited by methodological problems associated with the use of total weight gain as the exposure as opposed to a weight gain before the diagnosis of preeclampsia. There was also a lack of a consistent definition for preeclampsia across these studies, which makes it difficult to compare them. Preeclampsia is a condition noted for a decrease in the normal (50-60 percent) expansion in maternal intravascular (plasma) volume. The condition may also affect weight gain in early gestation. In addition, increased vascular permeability and decreased plasma oncotic pressure, caused by preeclampsia, can lead to increased edema and excessive weight gain in late gestation. Hence placental dysfunction in early gestation may effect both early and late weight gain\u2014albeit CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE MOTH ER PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-5 in opposite directions. These physiologic parameters preclude the use of total weight as a measure of GWG in preeclampsia. Other Quality of Life Measures As noted in Chapter 4, the influence of psychosocial status on GWG has been examined in several studies. However, there was no evidence available about possible effects of GWG on a woman's mental health during pregnancy and there was no information in the IOM (1990) report related to other measures of quality of life. There are eight studies covered in AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) on other antepartum outcomes. Topics include a composite outcome for discomfort in general (Rodriguez et al., 2001), physical energy and fatigue (Tulman et al., 1998), stretch marks (Madlon-Kay, 1993; Atwal et al., 2006), and Bird-Baker, 2004; Ko, 2006), and hyperemesis (Dodds et al., 2006). Three of these studies were rated as fair (Tulman et al., 1998; Rodriguez et al., 2001; Ko, 2006) and five as Dodds et al., 2006). Overall, there was no association between higher GWG and the outcomes of interest except for the two studies in which stretch marks were examined (Madlon-Kay, 1993; Atwal et al., 2006). This association was weak because of the small sample size, study design (one was a cross-sectional study), and the lack of adjustment for confounding factors. In the one study in which hyperemesis was examined, women who gained a total of < 7 kg had an increased likelihood of more antenatal admissions for this outcome (Dodds et al., 2006). For this outcome in particular, GWG was not a causal factor but was more likely the result of having had hyperemesis during the pregnancy. In summary, evidence for an association between GWG and pregnancy complications such as GDM and gestational hypertensive disorders is inconclusive because of inconsistent results and methodological flaws. The evidence for the outcome of mental health during pregnancy is understudied. CONSEQUENCES AT DELIVERY In IOM (1990), the link between GWG and complications during labor and delivery was viewed as a consequence of delivering a large-for-gestational age (LGA) infant. This report concluded that the contribution of GWG to these outcomes was quite small. Since then, the literature has grown and the outcomes related to delivery have been subdivided so as to understand the process of labor more fully. Induction of Labor In the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) five studies were reviewed related to an association between GWG and induction of labor (Ekblad and 2005; Graves et al., 2006; DeVader et al., 2007.) The strength of the evidence from these studies was rated weak for an association between high GWG and labor induction or failure of labor induction. A statistically significant increase in the outcomes associated with high GWG was found in all of the studies. Comparisons across studies however were not meaningful because of differences in the definition of high GWG and a lack of control for confounding factors. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-6 Length of Labor T hree studies in the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) examined associations between GWG and length of labor (Ekblad and Grenman, 1992; Johnson et al., 1992; Purfield and Morin, 1995). The evidence was rated weak for an association between higher GWG and longer duration of labor. Two of the three studies found a significant increase in the length of labor with higher weight gains, but both lacked control for confounding factors (Ekblad and Grenman, 1992; Purfield and Morin, 1995). Mode of Delivery The association between GWG and mode of delivery has been examined in many studies. A total of 21 studies reviewed in the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) examined this association using GWG as a continuous or categorical variable unrelated to the IOM (1990) guidelines (Ekbald and Grenman, 1992; Johnson et al., et al., 1998; Young and Woodmansee, 2002; Joseph and Raynor, 2004; Brennand et al., 2005; Jensen et al., 2005; Murakami et al., 2005; Rosenberg et al., 2005; Cedergren, 2006; Graves et al., Wataba et 2007; Kiel et al., 2007; Sherrard et al., 2007). Overall, these studies provided moderate evidence of an association between high GWG and cesarean delivery; only four studies failed to find an association (Bianco et al., 1998; Brennand et al., 2005; Murakami et al., 2005; Graves et al., 2006). An important factor to consider in this literature is the route of previous delivery for multiparous women. Only half of the studies reviewed adjusted for this and, among those that did, five also adjusted for co-morbidities that could also have contributed to the route of delivery (e.g. GDM and preeclampsia) (Witter et al., 1995; Shepard et al., 1998; Joseph et al., 2003; Rosenberg et al., 2005; Sherrard et al., 2007). Higher weight gains were associated with instrumental deliveries in three (Purfield and Morin, 1995; Kabiru and Raynor, 2004; Cedergren, 2006) in two others (Ekblad and Grenman, 1992; DeVader et al., 2007). When GWG was categorized according to the ranges recommended in the IOM (1990) report, the body of research provided moderate evidence that weight gain above the recommended ranges was associated with cesarean delivery among normal- and underweight women. In contrast, the evidence among obese and morbidly obese women was rated as weak (Parker and Abrams, 1992; Edwards et al., 1996; Bianco et al., 2005; DeVader et al., 2007; Kiel et al., 2007). There was a consistent observation (noted in 10 studies) that women who were overweight or obese before pregnancy were at higher risk of cesarean delivery compared to women who entered pregnancy at a lower BMI (Johnson et al., 1992; Witter et al., 1995; Shepard et al., 1998; Joseph et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2004; Murakami et al., 2005; Rosenberg et al., 2005; Graves et al., 2006; Jain et al., 2007; Sherrard et al., 2007). Maternal Mortality Both the IOM (1990) report and the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) concluded that there was no information on the relationship between GWG and maternal mortality. From a theoretical perspective, if GWG above recommended ranges is associated with LGA infants and shoulder dystocia in settings that do not allow for immediate cesarean delivery or attendance by a trained clinician, the mother could die during childbirth. In such an event, the immediate cause CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE MOTH ER PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-7 of death would be attributed to the size of the infant and associated l abor and delivery complications. This impedes the study of consequences of GWG on maternal mortality. In summary, current evidence supports a strong association between GWG above recommended ranges and increased risk of cesarean delivery. There is no evidence, however, to support an association of GWG with maternal mortality in countries where women have ready access to obstetric care. POSTPARTUM CONSEQUENCES Lactation IOM (1990) reported only one study that examined the relationship between GWG and milk quality and quantity (Butte et al., 1984). There was no relationship between GWG and these outcomes in this study. The AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) includes four studies on the association of GWG, categorized according to the recommendations of IOM (1990), with lactation performance (Rasmussen et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003; Hilson et al., 2006; Baker et al., 2007). These studies provide evidence rated moderate that low weight gain is associated with decreased initiation of breastfeeding, and weak for any association between GWG and duration of exclusive or any breastfeeding. Three of the studies reviewed showed that obese women had a shorter duration of breastfeeding (both exclusive and any breastfeeding) regardless of GWG (Rasmussen et al., 2002; Hilson et al., 2006; Baker et al., 2007). Subsequently, Manios et al. (2008), in a cross-sectional study done in Greece, found results similar to those in the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008). This study found that women with higher prepregnancy BMI were less likely to initiate breastfeeding and that GWG had no effect on either initiation or duration of breastfeeding. Postpartum Weight Retention A woman's weight immediately after delivery of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid is termed her postpartum weight. In the subsequent days to weeks, the increase in the woman's extracellular and extravascular water that occurred during pregnancy is lost and her plasma volume returns to prepregnancy values. The amount of weight that remains then minus her pregravid weight is termed postpartum weight retention. It reflects the increased breast tissue being used for lactation as well as any remaining fat mass that was gained during pregnancy. IOM (1990) stated that women with GWG well beyond the recommended ranges are more likely to retain weight postpartum and are at increased risk for subsequent obesity. The emphasis of the IOM (1990) guidelines, however, was on infant outcomes rather than maternal postpartum weight retention in an effort to optimize birth weight. The AHRQ review only included studies that directly examined associations between GWG and postpartum weight retention and did not include those that used parity or childbearing as a proxy for GWG. The report only found two studies that examined differences in the amount of fat retained in the postpartum period for GWG according to IOM (1990) categories (Butte et al., 2003; Lederman et al., 1997). Butte et al. (2003) examined a convenience sample of non- smoking women aged 18-40 from Houston (17 underweight, 34 normal weight, 12 overweigh/obese). Body composition was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before and after pregnancy and weight was obtained before pregnancy, during pregnancy, WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-8 and after pregnancy. Results showed that maternal fat retention was significantly higher among women who gained above (5.3 kg) compared to those who gained within (2.3 kg) or below (-0.5 kg) the IOM (1990) guidelines. Lederman et al. (1997) studied 196 non-smoking women aged 18-36 years, recruited from 3 prenatal clinics in New York City. Women who gained below the IOM (1990) recommendations had the lowest fat gain from 14 to 37 weeks of gestation compared to those with an intermediate and those with the highest fat gain. In addition the study found that, among obese women who gained within the IOM (1990) guidelines, the amount of body fat change (-0.6 kg) was significantly lower than among women in the other BMI groups who also gained within the recommendations (6.0 for underweight, 3.8 for normal, and 2.8 kg for overweight women). Unfortunately no test of significance was conducted. These data suggest, however, that higher GWG results in higher maternal fat gains, although the evidence for this is weak because of the limited number of studies and small sample sizes. The AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) separated the studies on postpartum weight retention into three categories according to the time postpartum when weight retention was assessed: short-term, less than 11 weeks; intermediate, 3 months to 3 years, and long-term, greater than 3 years. Within the short-term ( 11 weeks) studies, there was weak evidence for a relationship between GWG as a continuous variable and postpartum weight retention (Muscati et al., 1996). However, when GWG was categorized according to IOM (1990), there was a moderate, consistent relationship. Four studies showed that GWG exceeding the IOM (1990) guidelines was associated with higher postpartum weight retention (Stevens-Simon and McAnarney, 1992; Scholl et al., 1995; Luke et al., 1996; Walker et al., 2004). This observation was consistent for women irrespective of age. In the intermediate-term (3 months to 3 years), one study rated good (Harris et al., 1999), three studies rated fair (Ohlin and Rossner, 1990; Soltani and Fraser, 2000; Walker et al., 2004), and one study rated poor (Parham et al., 1990) showed moderate evidence for a relationship between GWG above recommended ranges and greater postpartum weight retention. The strength of the evidence was the same for subjects who gained above the IOM (1990) prepregnancy guidelines as for those who stayed within the guidelines, based on five studies rated fair (Scholl et al., 1995; Walker, 1996; Rooney and Schauberger, 2002; Olson et al., 2003; Amorim et al., 2007) and one study rated poor (Keppel and Taffel, 1993). Thus, overall, higher GWG is associated with greater postpartum weight retention measured at 3 to 36 months postpartum. The authors noted, however, that the data should be interpreted cautiously because of a lack of consistent adjustment for covariates such as nutrition and exercise. In interpreting these data, it is important to note that the relationship between GWG and postpartum weight retention depends not only on dietary intake and physical exercise, but also on breastfeeding behavior. In the only available study that considered prepregnancy BMI, GWG, and breastfeeding simultaneously, Baker et al. (2008) showed that women from the Danish National Birth Cohort with reasonable weight gains (e.g. ~12 kg) and exclusively breastfed for 6 months as currently recommended would have no weight retention at 6 months postpartum. For racial/ethnic groups, only one study was available. Keppel and Taffel (1993) used a nationally representative database to show that black women retained more weight than white women regardless of GWG. In the long-term (> 3 years), the evidence is less conclusive for a relationship between GWG and postpartum weight retention. One study rated good, Callaway et al. (2007) found a weak association between GWG and weight of the mother 21 years after the pregnancy, while in CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE MOTH ER PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-9 another study rated fair, Linne et al. (2003) found that women who became overweight after 15 years had higher GWG in the index pregnancy compared to women who remained within a normal weight range (although no adjustment was made for confounding). In the latter study, the authors also concluded that women who began pregnancy at a higher BMI tended to stay on the same weight trajectory later in life (Linne et al., 2004). There was moderate evidence in support of a relationship between gaining above the IOM (1990) guidelines and greater postpartum weight retention based on findings from three studies rated as fair (Rooney and Schauberger, 2002; Rooney et al., 2005; Amorim et al., 2007); however the amount of weight retained was small. Studies by Gunderson (2004) and Rosenberg et al. (2003), although not included in the AHRQ review, provide information that is consistent with its conclusions. The work of Nohr et al. (2008) also largely corroborates these earlier findings and strengthens the evidence for an association between GWG and postpartum weight retention in the intermediate period. Nohr et al. (2008) gathered data from 60,892 women with term pregnancies in the Danish National Birth Cohort. They linked these data to birth and hospital-discharge registers. After adjustment for multiple confounding factors, they reported that women who gained 16-19 kg or 20 kg were at 2.3- and 6.2-fold higher odds of retaining 5 kg at 6 months postpartum than women who gained only 10-15 kg. The study results were attenuated for the measurements obtained at 18 months postpartum, which was only based on approximately one-half of the original study cohort. A major concern with postpartum weight retention is that a woman may move into a higher BMI category than she was in before pregnancy. Being in this higher category is then associated with a greater risk of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes in a subsequent pregnancy. Scholl et al. (1995) calculated that adolescent women (12-29 years old) had a 2.8- fold higher risk of becoming overweight at 6 months postpartum if their rate of weight gain during pregnancy was > 0.68 kg per week than women with lower gains. Gunderson et al. (2000) observed a similar magnitude of effect in adults when she calculated the risk of becoming overweight at the start of the second pregnancy with weight gains above the IOM (1990) recommendations in the first. Nohr et al. (2008) also showed that with GWG between 16-19 kg, 12 to 14 percent of women with pregravid BMIs > 18.5 kg/m2 move up one category of weight status at 6 months postpartum and that this increases to 25 percent with weight gains > 20 kg. Overall the evidence suggests that low GWG is moderately associated with initiation of breastfeeding and that there is a strong association between higher GWG and postpartum weight retention (3 months to 3 years). The outcome of mental health is understudied and worthy of exploration. Postpartum Depression There were no data on the relationship of GWG and postpartum depression in the IOM (1990) report. The AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) does not include data on this relationship. The committee was unable to identify new data on this possible relationship. LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES The IOM (1990) report did not address long-term maternal outcomes of GWG. Excess postpartum weight retention could exacerbate these problems (see discussion above) and contribute to the development of chronic conditions that include diabetes, hypertension, and other cardiovascular risk factors (Arendas et al., 2008). WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-10 Type 2 Diabetes/Metabolic Disorders The committee was unable to identify published studies that examined the possible association between GWG and the development of metabolic disorders later in a woman's life. Such an association is biologically plausible because of the link between GWG and postpartum weight retention. Gunderson et al. (2008) showed that childbearing was associated with increased visceral fat postpartum, but their study did not include data on GWG. Berg and Scherer (2005) reviewed evidence on the role of adipose tissue in systemic inflammation and determined that the distribution of fat is important as well as the amount. Visceral fat in obese subjects was shown to be more strongly associated with insulin resistance than visceral fat in lean subjects.. Lim et al. (2007) identified a relationship between abnormal glucose tolerance at one year post- partum and increased visceral fat in women who had GDM that was independent of maternal age and BMI. Cardiovascular Disorders The committee was also unable to identify any published studies that examined a direct association between GWG and the development of cardiovascular disorders later on in life. However, obesity, preeclampsia, or toxemia of pregnancy is linked to long-term sequelae that include cardiovascular disease (Bellamy et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008). Other Adverse Health Outcomes Mental Health The topic of mental health of the mother is not addressed in the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008). Two small studies (Jenkin and Tiggemann, 1997; Walker, 1997) provide weak evidence regarding the connection between post-partum weight retention up to one year post- delivery and self-esteem/depression. These studies did not control for prepregnancy BMI. Cancer There is weak evidence for an association of GWG with risk of breast cancer. One retrospective cohort study of 2,089 Finnish women showed a positive relationship between weight gain in the upper tertile (> 15 kg) and post-menopausal breast cancer risk, after adjustment for prepregnancy BMI (RR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.03-2.53) (Kinnunen et al., 2004). In a nested case-control study of 65 cases of breast cancer in this cohort, the BMI at the time of diagnosis did not change the findings. Although there was a relationship between increased weight gain and an increased risk of post-menopausal breast cancer in this cohort, in another population of Finnish women weight gain of > 16 kg during pregnancy and increased BMI during adult life was associated with a reduced risk of pre-menopausal breast cancer (Hilakivi- Clarke et al., 2005). Overall there is insufficient evidence to link GWG to long-term health consequences of the mother as a result of the lack of studies in this area. CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE MOTH ER PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-11 CONCLUDING REMARKS There is a general lack of research that relates GWG to maternal outcomes beyond the first year postpartum other than for postpartum weight retention and subsequent obesity. This is understandable because most of the outcomes that are of the greatest interest, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and depression take longer to study because they occur later in the woman's life. It is well established however that obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cholelithiasis, coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, stroke, and certain cancers) (Must et al., 1992; Troiano et al., 1996; Allison et al., 1999; Calle et al., 2003; Gregg et al., 2005). Furthermore, for subsequent pregnancies, maternal overweight and obesity are associated with higher rates of cesarean delivery, GDM, preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension as well as postpartum anemia (Bodnar et al., 2004). Overall, the consequences for the mother of GWG above recommended ranges appear to be well-substantiated for outcomes such as cesarean delivery and postpartum weight retention. The studies that have examined glucose abnormalities and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have been methodologically flawed and thus do not provide sufficient evidence to support or refute a possible association. For GWG below recommended ranges, the only outcome for which there is any substantial evidence is initiation of breastfeeding. There are no available studies of a relationship between low GWG and increased maternal mortality among American women. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Findings 1. The literature related to GWG and maternal outcomes does not allow inference of causality since it is based solely on observational studies. 2. Evidence for an association between GWG and pregnancy complications such as glucose abnormalities and gestational hypertension disorders is inconclusive and problematic due to methodological flaws and that the outcome of mental health during pregnancy is understudied. 3. There is a strong association between higher GWG and increased risk of cesarean delivery. 4. There is no research on the effect of GWG on maternal mortality from which they could make any conclusions. 5. Low GWG is moderately associated with failure to initiate breastfeeding. 6. There is a strong association between higher GWG and postpartum weight retention in the immediate postpartum period (three months to three years). 7. The outcome of mental health is understudied. 8. There is insufficient evidence to link GWG to long-term health consequences of the mother due to the lack of studies in this area. 9. Maternal prepregnancy weight status is an important independent predictor of maternal short and long term outcomes. Recommendations for Action and Research Action Recommendation 5-1: The committee recommends that appropriate federal, state and local agencies as well as health care providers inform women of the importance of WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 5-12 conceiving at a normal BMI and that all those who provide health care or related services to women of childbearing age include preconceptional counseling in their care. Research Recommendation 5-1: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to researchers to conduct observational and experimental studies on the association between GWG and (a) glucose abnormalities and gestational hypertensive disorders that take into account the temporality of the diagnosis of the outcome, and (b) the development of glucose intolerance, hypertension and other CVD risk factors as well as mental health and cancer later in a woman's life. Research Recommendation 5-2: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct studies that (a) explore mechanisms, including epigenetic mechanisms, that underlie effects of GWG on maternal and child outcomes and (b) address the extent to which optimal GWG differs not only by maternal prepregnancy BMI but also by other factors such as age (especially among adolescents), parity, racial/ethnic group, socioeconomic status, co-morbidities, and maternal/paternal/fetal genotype. Areas for Additional Investigation The committee identified the following areas for further investigation to aid in future revisions of GWG recommendations. The research community should conduct studies on: Associations between gestational weight gain and maternal mortality; Effects of GWG on maternal mental status during pregnancy, in the postpartum period and in long-term. The causal nature of how gestational weight gain leads to short and long term maternal outcomes.

PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 16 Consequences of Gestational Weight Gain for the Child The authors of the report, Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990) emphasized short-term outcomes in developing guidelines for recommended gestational weight gain (GWG) ranges. This resulted from a lack of data on long-term outcomes and the fact that the research community was only beginning to understand the importance of the intrauterine environment for long-term health. In the interim, the literature on the topic has expanded, and more information is now available on neonatal as well as long-term consequences of both inadequate and excessive GWG during pregnancy. Only by knowing the magnitude of causal relationships can one say with confidence that recommending a certain amount of GWG will result in altered frequency of adverse child health outcomes. The limited experimental data from randomized controlled trials in humans, however, impedes efforts to determine how much of any observed association is causal. It is possible that associations of GWG with outcomes do not result from GWG itself, but rather to underlying factors that influence both weight gain and the outcomes (e.g. maternal diet composition or physical activity level). In particular, it is important to determine whether these relationships are independent of prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) or if they differ by prepregnancy BMI. This is because observational studies are often limited by mixing effects of confounding factors with the predictor of real interest. Although reverse causality is less of a problem in cohort than in cross-sectional studies, confounding is not readily controlled in any observational study. Only with large, well-designed and carefully controlled randomized studies can causal relationships be inferred with a high degree of confidence. Otherwise, inferences must be made using the best data available in consideration of plausible biologic mechanisms, confounding and other aspects of the study methodology, and the patterns of results. The following reviews the current evidence and strives to quantify, wherever possible, causal relationships between GWG and childhood outcomes. GENERAL CONCEPTS Causal Concepts The committee generated a general conceptual causal model of determinants (see Chapter 1) for maternal and child outcomes that may result from excessive or inadequate GWG (Figure 6- 1). This model fits well with two paradigms that offer useful conceptual frameworks for considering long-term effects on the offspring. One, termed the life course approach to chronic disease, invokes two axes (Kuh and Ben-Shlomo, 2004). The first is time. Factors may act in the pre-conceptional through the prenatal period, into infancy, childhood, and beyond to determine WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-2 risk of chronic disease. The second is hierarchical: these factors can range from the social/built/natural environment (macro) through behavior, physiology, and genetics (micro) (See Chapter 4). Factors interact with each other over the life course, with different determinants being more or less important at different life stages. The other paradigm, called developmental origins of health and disease, focuses primarily on the prenatal and early postnatal periods, because they are the periods of most rapid somatic growth and organ development (Gillman, 2005; Sinclair et al., 2007; Hanson and Gluckman, 2008). Both of these frameworks invoke the concept of programming, which refers to perturbations or events that occur at early, plastic, and perhaps critical phases of development that can have long-lasting, sometimes irreversible, health consequences. The period of plasticity may vary for different organs and systems (Gluckman and Hanson, 2006). The model predicts that adult risk factors can only partially modify the trajectories of health and disease patterns established in earlier life (Barker et al., 2002; Ben-Shlomo and Kuh, 2002; McMillen and Robinson, 2005; Sullivan et al., 2008). FIGURE 6-1 Schematic summary of neonatal, infant, and child consequences of GWG. CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-3 Developmental programming, including the possible role of epigenetics as potential determinants of GWG, is discussed in Chapter 4. In this chapter, the role of developmental programming as a mechanism for some of the effects of GWG on postnatal outcomes is discussed. Many animal models have demonstrated that altering the environment in utero can have lifelong consequences. Perturbations of the maternal diet during pregnancy (typically by severe energy or protein restriction; administering hormones such as glucocorticoids; mechanical means, such as ligation of the uterine artery; or inducing anemia or hypoxia) have postnatal consequences on a number of metabolic and behavioral traits. Effects are inducible in rodents and in mammals, including non-human primates. Inasmuch as humans differ from other animal species in duration of pregnancy, placentation, and other important factors, the importance of the findings from animal studies lies not in the specific interventions but rather in the general principle that altering the supply of nutrients, hormones, and oxygen to the growing embryo and fetus or exposing them to stressors and toxicants can have long-term effects. Much of this animal research has focused on obesity-related outcomes such as adiposity, fat distribution, sarcopenia, insulin sensitivity, glucose intolerance, and blood pressure. These are leading causes of morbidity\u2014and ultimately, mortality\u2014in the U.S. and, as discussed below, GWG appears to be related to offspring obesity. The ways in which GWG could influence a number of child health outcomes through developmental programming is also discussed below. Until recently, most of the research in animal models has concentrated on the long-term effects of interventions that cause offspring to be born small, typically small-for-gestational age (SGA) rather than early. Such work has been a good companion to a series of epidemiologic observations made within the last two decades that lower birth weight, apparently resulting from both reduced fetal growth and reduced length of gestation, is associated with higher risks of central obesity, insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. These associations are potentiated by rapid weight gain in childhood (Bhargava et al., 2004; Barker et al., 2005). It is important to note, however, that in recent years researchers have recognized that higher birth weight is also associated with later obesity and its consequences. Given that greater GWG is associated with increased weight at birth (reviewed below) and that total GWG and excessive gain\u2014which are based on total GWG and prepregnancy BMI\u2014appear to be rising over time (see Chapter 2), these observations regarding higher birth weights raise questions about the long-term adverse effects of higher weight gains in pregnancy. Accompanying these observations are newer animal experiments that involve \"overnutrition\" of the mother during pregnancy, which are also discussed briefly below. In addition, it is critical to recognize that effects of GWG, or indeed any factor that alters the in utero environment, may have long-term effects on the offspring without any alterations of fetal growth or length of gestation. Thus the most important epidemiologic evidence for long- term effects of GWG does not depend on birth weight, gestational age or birth weight-for- gestational-age as exposures or outcomes, but rather provides data on the direct associations of GWG with various health outcomes in the offspring. With these distinctions in mind, the committee considered \"fetal growth\" outcomes, including small-for-gestational age (SGA) and large-for-gestational age (LGA), and preterm birth as short-term outcomes. These measures have demonstrable and substantial associations with neonatal morbidity and mortality. Other short-term outcomes include stillbirth and birth defects. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-4 In contrast, neonatal body composition is included in the discussion of long-term outcomes because of the hypothesis (still unproven, however) that relative amounts of adiposity and lean mass\u2014and their physiologic consequences\u2014in fetal and neonatal life are important in setting long-term cardio-metabolic trajectories. It also bears noting that this report focuses primarily on GWG, rather than prepregnancy BMI. Nevertheless, because the two factors are closely linked, one must account for confounding and effect modification by BMI in addressing offspring effects of GWG. Also it is possible that factors in infancy or childhood (e.g., growth in stature, adiposity, and infant feeding) could mediate effects of GWG on long-term child health. Potential Mechanisms Linking Gestational Weight Gain to Long-Term Offspring Health The existence of plausible biological mechanisms is one criterion for establishing causal relationships between GWG and child health outcomes. The following discussion focuses primarily on potential mechanisms linking GWG to offspring obesity and its consequences. Gestational weight gain is clearly about weight, so it is appropriate to address weight-related outcomes. Also most of the emerging evidence on long-term outcomes is based on these endpoints. The epidemiologic evidence for effects of GWG on other important child health outcomes are addressed later this chapter. Although the following discussion focuses primarily on long-term child outcomes, similar mechanisms may also underlie associations of GWG with fetal growth. One issue that hampers inferences regarding fetal growth is that it is usually characterized by (gestational-age-specific) weight at birth, with less consideration of trajectory of weight from conception, body length or body composition (see Chapters 3 and 4 for a review of existing studies that address these issues). In contrast to the prenatal period, serial measurement of length/height and weight is common, even though data on body composition are relatively scarce. Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance during pregnancy may mediate effects of GWG on long-term child outcomes. Weight gain in pregnancy is partly a gain in adiposity, which is accompanied by a state of relative insulin resistance starting in mid-pregnancy, among other metabolic alterations (Reece et al., 1994; Williams, 2003; Catalano et al., 2006; King, 2006; Hwang et al., 2007) (also see Chapter 3). This is an adaptive response, as it allows more efficient transfer of fuels across the placenta to the growing fetus (King, 2006). In overweight and obese pregnant women, these changes are magnified. For example, insulin resistance is more severe than in normal weight women, substantially raising the risk of impaired glucose tolerance and frank gestational diabetes (GDM). In pregnant women who have hyperglycemia, the fetus also experiences hyperglycemia, as glucose freely crosses the placenta. In a sequence that Freinkel et al. (1986) termed \"fuel- mediated teratogenesis\" nearly 30 years ago, fetal hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperinsulinemia, leading to increased adiposity in the fetus. This increase is reflected in larger size at birth, which translates to higher rates of LGA and lower rates of SGA newborns (see discussion below and Chapter 3). Presumably through programming mechanisms, the increased fetal adiposity also results in increased adiposity in the growing child. Other fuels besides glucose may also be involved. Increased fetal production of anabolic hormones and growth factors in combination with the increased levels of glucose, lipids, and amino acids that occurs in GDM result in fetal macrosomia and increase the risk for neonatal complications (Catalano et al., 2003). Crowther et al. (2005) and Pirc et al. (2007) showed that CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-5 diet and insulin therapy along with blood glucose monitoring in pregnant women with mild GDM could lower plasma insulin and leptin (but not glucose) concentrations in cord blood as well as major adverse birth outcomes. This intervention more than halved the risk of macrosomia (birth weight > 4,500 g) (Crowther et al., 2005). This physiologic milieu may also increase the risk for long-term complications, particularly obesity. But long-term follow-up of children from this and similar randomized trials is necessary to determine if treatment of GDM or impaired glucose intolerance during pregnancy can reduce adiposity and related physiology. Results from observational studies, however, suggest this possibility. Among 5-7 year-old children in two American health plans, Hillier et al. (2007) showed that risk of high weight-for-age was lower among those whose mothers had been treated for GDM than those who had not been treated. The weight status of the \"treated\" offspring was similar to those whose mothers had normal glucose tolerance. The Freinkel hypothesis is supported by animal experiments, such as those of van Assche and colleagues (1979) and more recently Plagemann and colleagues (1998), who have pharmacologically induced GDM in rats. They observe fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, as hypothesized, as well as changes in the hypothalamus that give rise to hyperphagia, overweight, and impaired glucose tolerance in the offspring as they mature. Another way to induce offspring metabolic derangement in rats is through over-feeding the pregnant dam. Samuelsson et al. (2008) found that maternal diet-induced obesity resulted in increased adult adiposity and evidence of cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction compared to the offspring of lean dams. Earlier work by Dorner et al. (1988) and Diaz and Taylor (1998) showed that a period of overfeeding or GDM in the pregnant dam during a developmentally sensitive period in gestation could change the metabolic phenotype of the immediate offspring that would then persist over two succeeding generations. In their review of animal studies, Aerts and Van Assche (2003) demonstrate that these intergenerational physiologic effects are maternally transmitted, most likely through epigenetic processes. Seemingly paradoxically, in animal experiments it is also possible to produce offspring insulin resistance, features of the metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, including GDM, by reducing energy or macronutrient intake of the mother during pregnancy. This situation can also result in intergenerational amplification of obesity and its consequences. For example, glucose metabolism is altered in the grand-offspring of female rats who had been protein restricted during pregnancy and lactation (Benyshek et al., 2006). Overall, animal experiments show that offspring obesity and related metabolic sequelae can result from maternal over- or underfeeding during pregnancy, from experimental manipulation like pharmacologic induction of GDM, or from mechanical means like uterine artery ligation. Epigenetic modifications likely explain many of these phenomena (Simmons, 2007). A human counterpart to the animal experimental work is epidemiologic studies showing that higher birth weight is related to later obesity and type 2 diabetes, while lower birth weight is associated with central obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and indeed, type 2 diabetes as well (Gillman, 2005). In other words, a U-shape relationship exists between birth weight and obesity-related health outcomes. The extent to which these observations have relevance for GWG guidelines is still unclear. Few animal studies directly assess the influence of GWG on short- or long-term offspring outcomes. Animal experimentalists typically do not measure weight gain during pregnancy, and it is not clear whether appropriate animal models exist to study GWG and obesity-related outcomes in the offspring. Neither is it clear that models of either diet-induced obesity or GDM WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-6 are instructive for assessing effects of GWG. Similarly, hum an population studies that rely on birth weight or its components, duration of gestation, and size at birth as predictors of later outcomes (e.g., Hofman et al., 2004; Hovi et al., 2007) do not directly assess GWG. Further, intervention studies to treat GDM do not in themselves provide evidence for making recommendations for appropriate GWG. Only randomized trials that alter weight gain during pregnancy can address that goal directly. Recently Wolff and colleagues (2008) analyzed results from 50 participants in a randomized controlled trial of reducing weight gain among obese pregnant women. The intervention was successful in restricting GWG: mean weight gain in the intervention group was 6.6 kg (\u00b1 5.5 kg) v. 13.3 kg (\u00b1 7.5 kg) in the control group a mean difference of 6.7 kg (95% CI: 2.6-10.8 [ p = 0.002]). Insulin and leptin concentrations were also reduced, although glucose values were hardly altered. Overall this small trial, along with other data from experimental animals and human subjects, raises the possibility that moderating GWG among obese pregnant women may reduce the risk of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance during gestation and, in turn, childhood obesity, but larger and longer-term studies are needed to address this question directly. EFFECTS ON NEONATAL MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY Although there is a substantial literature on prepregnancy BMI and neonatal morbidity and mortality, the literature on GWG in relation to these outcomes remains more limited, with the exception of its influence on fetal growth (Cedergren, 2006; Kiel et al., 2007). Infant mortality is strongly associated with maternal prepregnancy BMI as are a number of other clinically important outcomes, including stillbirth and preterm birth (Figure 6-2). Given that GWG, which is lower on average for heavier women, differs in relation to prepregnancy BMI, studies that examine GWG without stratifying by prepregnancy are subject to (prepregnancy BMI and GWG, and prepregnancy BMI and health outcome), as seen in Figure 6-2, are sufficiently strong that studies of GWG and neonatal outcomes that fail to account for prepregnancy BMI are of limited value in addressing the independent effects of GWG.

CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-7 Stillbirth I nadequate or excessive GWG has the potential to affect fetal viability in later pregnancy, specifically risk of stillbirth (defined as pregnancy loss after 20 weeks' gestation). Both Naeye (1979) and NCHS (1986) showed that women with low prepregnancy BMI tended to have elevated risk of fetal or perinatal mortality (a combination of stillbirth and neonatal mortality) when combined with low GWG, but women with elevated prepregnancy BMI experienced increased risk of adverse outcomes when combined with excessive GWG. In an analysis from the California Child Health and Development Studies of the School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Tavris and Read (1982) found a strong inverse association between total GWG and fetal death but it was eliminated by restriction to births of greater then 35 weeks' gestation. Thus, the association was an artifact of using cumulative weight gain as the predictor, strongly related to duration of gestation with stillbirths of notably shorter gestational duration than live births. A case-control study of stillbirths in Sweden reported a strong positive association between prepregnancy BMI and stillbirth, with odds ratios approaching 3.0 for obese women, but the authors reported no effect of GWG measured in either early or late pregnancy among term births (Stephansson et al., 2001). The large size of the study (649 cases and 690 controls) is notable as well as the ability to consider an array of covariates, but the results for total GWG were not presented in the publication. In summary, the research on GWG and stillbirth remains quite lim ited in quantity and quality. In addition to considering prepregnancy BMI, there is a need to avoid the error of comparing total GWG in pregnancies resulting in stillbirths with those resulting in live births because of the time in pregnancy when stillbirth is likely to occur. Although early studies suggested adverse effects of low GWG among women with low prepregnancy BMI and also of high GWG among women with elevated prepregnancy BMI, more detailed studies have not been done to corroborate or refute this pattern. Recent, better studies largely do not support an association between GWG and stillbirth. Birth Defects The authors of the IOM (1990) report found no studies of GWG associations with birth defects and recognized that the etiologic period for congenital defects is so early in pregnancy that the issue of weight gain was not likely to be relevant. Although there is a growing literature on prepregnancy BMI and congenital defects which suggests that there is an increased risk of birth defects with increasing BMI (Watkins et al., 2003; Anderson et al., 2005; Villamor et al., 2008), only one recent study addressed GWG in relation to birth defects directly. Infants born to mothers who gained less than 5 kg or less than 10 kg during pregnancy were at increased risk of neural tube defects (Shaw, 2001). In addition, one report indicated that dieting to lose weight during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (Carmichael et al., 2003). Although there are several pathways by which GWG and birth defects may be related, including a shared influence of diet on both high and low weight gain related to an abnormally developing fetus, a direct causal effect of GWG on risk of birth defects is precluded by the timing of these events during gestation. Infant Mortality Infant mortality is obviously of great clinical and public health importance and is often used as a summary indicator of a population's reproductive health status. Concern with fetal growth WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-8 and preterm birth as health outcomes is based largely on their known relationships with mortality (as well as morbidity). As a result, studies that directly address mortality as the outcome are of particular relevance and can help to interpret the patterns seen for the studies of intermediate outcomes such as preterm birth or growth restriction. Only limited research exists in which an association between GWG and infant mortality is assessed. Perinatal mortality was examined in only one study (NCHS, 1986) noted in the IOM (1990) report. Recently, Chen et al. (2009) examined maternal prepregnancy BMI and GWG in the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) and considered 4,265 infant deaths and 7,293 controls. Among underweight and normal-weight women, low GWG was associated with a marked increase in infant mortality, with relative risks on the order of 3-4 compared to those with the highest GWG. Among overweight and obese women, there were more modest effects of GWG, but both lower and higher GWG were associated with approximately 2-fold increases in risk of infant mortality. In all cases, the patterns were stronger for neonatal deaths (in the first 30 days of life) than for postneonatal deaths (those occurring after one month but before the completion of one year). As seen in Table 6-1 within BMI strata, the relative risk for neonatal death was 3.6 for the lowest weight gain group among underweight women, 3.1 among normal weight women, 2.0 among overweight women, and 1.2 among obese women, showing a diminishing effect of low GWG with increasing BMI. At high GWG, the relative risks for neonatal mortality for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese women were 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8, respectively, which showed the exact opposite tendency. Here excessive GWG was more strongly associated with neonatal death with increasing BMI. Maternal age at delivery did not affect neonatal mortality. After adjusting for gestational age at delivery, no association was found between teenage pregnancy and neonatal mortality. The same general pattern was seen for post neonatal deaths; but was less pronounced (Table 6-1). More studies of infant mortality are needed, but the evidence from Chen et al. (2009) warrants serious consideration not only because of the importance of the outcome but also because of the implications for the more voluminous literature on fetal growth and preterm birth. Although this study did not link GWG to those intermediate outcomes and the intermediate outcomes to mortality, the strength of the patterns and their parallels with studies of fetal growth add credibility to the presumption that a causal chain from GWG to adverse birth outcomes to death is operative. Based on a limited volume of research, but in one well done study, the evidence for a link to infant mortality can be considered moderate.

(2009). Fetal Growth The relationship of GWG to fetal growth was considered in some detail in the IOM (1990) report. Much of the literature on consequences of fetal size fails to separate preterm delivery from fetal growth restriction, which is problematic for the purposes of this report. As noted in IOM (1990) and by others, smaller size at birth is associated with increased fetal and infant mortality, cerebral palsy, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, polycythemia and birth asphyxia, persistent deficits in size, and persistent deficits in neurocognitive performance (Pryor et al., 1995; Goldenberg et al., 1998). Health consequences of small size at birth tend to follow a dose- response relationship with elevated relative risks at the lowest weights. Large size causes delivery complications, including shoulder dystocia and other forms of birth injury, as well as cesarean delivery, maternal death, and fistulae (IOM, 1990). Birth weight combines duration of gestation with rate of fetal growth. Infants on a given growth trajectory who are born earlier will weigh less than infants on the same growth trajectory who are born later. To isolate fetal growth, studies often use SGA and LGA, which compare the infant's weight to the distribution of birth weight of all infants in the same week of gestation. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-10 Most commonly, those infants in the lowest and highest 10th percentiles are classified as SGA and LGA, respectively, but some use the more extreme values of the 5th percentile or two standard deviations or more below or above the mean. The cutoff points for those percentiles may be specific to gender, race/ethnicity, and/or parity in addition to week of gestation. There is some controversy about the use of racial/ethnic-specific norms, in particular because their biological meaning is in doubt. Black infants in the U.S. have a markedly different weight distribution than non-black infants (of varying race/ethnicity). Identification of deviations from group-specific norms is a useful means of predicting mortality; although separate group-specific norms could be interpreted as acceptance of differences in birth outcome by race/ethnicity as absolute. Such differences are not absolute, however, because health disparities are strongly influenced by social and behavioral factors. The term intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is generally applied to births that are designated as a lower weight than would have been attained had the pregnancy been a \"normal\" one. Obviously the definition of \"normal\" or \"expected\" is problematic because it is not known what would have happened had conditions been different\u2014 only what did happen. Thus results may not be comparable across studies when different indices are used. At the time of the IOM (1990) report, the evidence for an effect of GWG on fetal growth was viewed as \"quite convincing.\" Increased GWG was related to increased birth weight, and the report noted that the strength of that relationship varied as a function of prepregnancy BMI. The lower the prepregnancy BMI, the stronger the association between increased GWG and increased birth weight. Among obese women, the association between increased GWG and increased birth weight was questionable. The patterns of influence of GWG on fetal growth were evident both for mean birth weight and for the tails of the distribution, usually described as IUGR or macrosomia (variably defined as > 90th percentile of birth weight for gestational age or > 4,000 grams). In addition to the consistent observational data that linked inadequate GWG, especially in underweight and normal weight women, with increased risk for SGA, and the evidence that linked excessive weight gain, especially in overweight and obese women, with increased risk of LGA and its sequelae, there is some evidence from randomized trials in women that is important. A series of early randomized trials of dietary supplements, carefully reviewed by Susser (1991), provides very little support for the argument that increased energy or protein intake during pregnancy enhances fetal growth in general. Only for women who were near starvation was the evidence linking improved nutrition to GWG to fetal growth supportive of a causal relationship. For other groups of pregnant women, there was no benefit and some indication of possible harm from ingesting supplements with high protein concentrations. In contrast, results from a Cochrane systematic review suggested a consistent benefit of supplementation in reducing risk of SGA, though this does not necessarily mean that such benefits were mediated by GWG (Kramer and Kakuma, 2003). Recent randomized trials have focused directly on the impact of limiting GWG to determine whether this results in short-term metabolic effects or improved clinical outcomes. Polley et al. (2002) randomized normal weight and overweight women (~ 30 in each class and arm of the trial) to assess the impact of a multifaceted program designed to maintain GWG within recommended guidelines. The intervention yielded benefits in preventing excessive GWG only among normal weight women. Women whose GWG was moderated had infants that weighed 93 g less on average than controls. Fewer of the treated number developed GDM or had cesarean deliveries. CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-11 In summary, the issue of whether the association between GWG and fetal growth is causal cannot be answered with certainty based on the available evidence. Observational data provide replicated indications of a strong association between GWG and increased risk of SGA, especially in underweight and normal-weight women, and between higher GWG and increased risk of LGA, particularly among overweight and obese women. Randomized trials are either only indirectly applicable (because they are from less-relevant populations and time periods) or are too small to provide strong evidence. Biological considerations also need to be taken into account in judging the likelihood that associations from observational studies are causal. There are several possible explanations for the associations between GWG and fetal growth that have been reported: GWG is causally related to fetal growth, both GWG and fetal growth are independently affected by maternal diet and/or physical activity, and both GWG and fetal growth have shared genetic or other intrinsic biological determinants. If the non-causal explanations are correct, then manipulating GWG will not affect fetal growth directly. However, if the same behavioral changes that produce a more optimal GWG also happen to result in a more optimal fetal growth, then there would be a benefit realized. If there is a shared, intrinsic biological basis for a link between GWG and fetal growth, genetic or otherwise, modification of GWG would not affect fetal growth. In the absence of clear evidence on the causal pathway, the committee presumes that the relationship between GWG and fetal growth was causal in an effort to ensure that the guidelines are protective of the health of the fetus and infant. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) evidence-based review on outcomes of GWG (Viswanathan et al., 2008) provides a thorough summary of the literature on GWG and birth outcomes. That report included studies published between 1990 and 2007, so that it supplements the IOM (1990) report; and the committee expanded on the AHRQ review by considering studies published subsequently (see Chapter 5 and Appendix F). The committee did not exhaustively review the studies from before 1990 given the thorough work of the IOM (1990) committee. Earlier studies are mentioned only when the information they provide affects the overall conclusions. The AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) considered 25 studies of variable quality that addressed GWG and birth weight as a continuous measure. Every one of those studies demonstrated an association between higher GWG and higher infant birth weight. Although there was substantial variability in magnitude of effect across studies, in general differences were on the order of 300 g in birth weight from lowest to highest GWG categories. Among the stronger studies, the AHRQ review found that for each 1 kg increase in GWG, birth weight rose 16.7-22.6 g. Fewer studies considered weight gain by trimester, and they tended to show a lower increase in birth weight per unit increase in GWG in the third than in the first or second trimester. A smaller but still sizable number of studies (13) examined the relationship of GWG to risk of low birth weight (LBW, defined as < 2,500 g). These studies showed that risk of LBW diminishes as GWG increases, particularly as total gain exceeds 25-30 pounds. Although the magnitude of association varied substantially across studies, in general the highest GWG category had roughly half the risk of a LBW infant compared to the lowest GWG category. At the other end of the birth weight spectrum, 12 studies considered infant macrosomia, defined as birth weight > 4,000 or > 4,500 grams. Recognizing the variability in definitions of macrosomia and GWG categories, the committee found that the studies showed a consistent trend for increased risk of macrosomia with increasing GWG. Relative risks were 2-3 for macrosomia in the highest compared to the lowest GWG category. These results consistently indicate that the WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-12 relationship of GWG to birth weight applies across the full range of weights and is not limited to the low or high end of the distribution. However, because birth weight is a combination of fetal growth and length of gestation, studies that separate these two components are more informative. The AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) also considered studies of SGA that did not stratify by prepregnancy BMI and identified 15 of them that showed a consistent pattern of diminishing risk of SGA with increasing GWG. It is difficult to provide quantitative estimates of the magnitude of this effect given variable study methods and results, but as for LBW, relative risks on the order of 2-3 across extreme GWG categories are typical. The six studies that stratified by prepregnancy BMI similarly found lower GWG was associated with increased risk of SGA births. While methods and results were again variable, the studies did not strongly suggest that prepregnancy BMI modified the relationship between GWG and SGA, in contrast to the interpretation in the IOM (1990) report. In the 10 studies in which GWG and LGA were considered, there was reasonably consistent support for a positive association. For each 1 kg increment in GWG, the relative risk of LGA increased by approximately a factor of 1.1, and comparing the highest to lowest categories of GWG yielded relative risks on the order of 2. The studies that stratified by prepregnancy BMI did not show notable differences in the GWG-LGA association across BMI categories, with only a modest tendency towards a stronger association among women with lower prepregnancy BMI. Three additional studies that addressed GWG and birth weight appeared after the period covered by the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008). Lof et al. (2008), whose focus was on the role of physical activity in relation to GWG and pregnancy outcome, noted that GWG during weeks 12-33 (unadjusted for prepregnancy BMI) was modestly correlated with increased birth weight, r = 0.13 (P = 0.05), stronger than the relationship for GWG during weeks 12-25 or 25-33 alone. Segal et al. (2008) found similar results in a study of obesity and family history of diabetes in relation to pregnancy outcome, with an adjusted correlation coefficient of 0.19 (P = 0.09) between weight gain before the oral glucose tolerance test and birth weight, accounting for prepregnancy BMI in the analysis. Nohr et al. (2008) conducted the most informative analysis of the independent effects of prepregnancy BMI and GWG among over 60,000 births from the Danish National Birth Cohort. The authors considered the relationship of GWG with SGA and LGA as well as the interaction of prepregnancy BMI and GWG in relation to birth weight. They report statistically significant but generally modest indications of an interaction between prepregnancy BMI and GWG with the exception of a stronger association of low GWG with SGA among underweight women. Subsequent analyses of this data (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Nohr) revealed that the relative risk of SGA associated with lower (< 10 kg) versus medium GWG (10-15 kg) among underweight women was 2.1, while it was 1.7 for normal weight women, 1.6 for overweight women, and 1.3 for obese women. The increased risk of LGA associated with very high GWG ( 20 kg) versus medium GWG (10-15 kg) was 3.7 for underweight women, 2.6 for normal weight women, 2.0 for overweight women, and 1.8 for obese women, again suggesting that the effect of GWG is dampened with increasing prepregnancy BMI. This analysis is an important contribution to quantifying the magnitude of effect of GWG on birth weight, consistent with the large body of previous studies and demonstrating an overall shift of less SGA and more LGA (and higher mean birth weight) with increasing GWG (see Appendix G, Part I). Dietz et al. (in press) provided analyses from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) in which they considered estimated associations between GWG and delivery CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-13 of a SGA infant using three definitions of SGA: > two standard deviations below the mean birth weight for gestational age, a customized measure, < 10th percentile of expected birth weight for gestational age; and < 10th percentile of birth weight for gestational age using a population-based reference. Population-based information about 104,980 singleton term births in 2000-2005 from 29 states participating in PRAMS provided the basis of the analysis. Risk of LGA births or births > 4,500 g yielded clear and similar findings; with increasing weight gain, there was a markedly increased risk of LGA births, present among all BMI groups, but most pronounced on a relative scale among the women with the lowest BMI. The magnitudes of association were striking, with more than a 10-fold gradient in risk from lowest to highest weight gain categories for underweight women, and a 3- to 4-fold gradient in risk for women in the other BMI categories (Table 6-2). In summary, the evidence that GWG is related to birth weight-for-gestational age is quite strong and the magnitude of that association is large, with relative risks of SGA with low GWG on the order of 2-3. It appears that the entire birth weight distribution is shifted upward with increased GWG, reducing the risk of SGA and increasing the risk of LGA as the mean birth weight rises. The evidence that this pattern is enhanced among women with low prepregnancy BMI is moderately strong as well. The IOM (1990) report suggested consideration of a different relationship between GWG and fetal growth among young mothers. As they noted, however, it was unclear whether this pattern was reflective of a different causal process, and the subsequent literature has not strengthened the support for differential effects by maternal age group. Only limited research is available on the potential for different effects of GWG on fetal growth by ethnicity, smoking status, or other maternal attributes, and the results that are summarized in the AHRQ review are inconsistent. There is moderate support for a stronger effect of GWG that occurs during the first or second trimester on birth weight-for-gain than there is for third trimester GWG (Viswanathan et al., 2008).

Although defined dichotomously, risks of death and morbidity are a direct function of the degree of prematurity, with births at the margins, 33-36 weeks' gestation, most common and at modestly increased risk of health problems. In contrast, earlier births, < 33 weeks' gestation, are rarer events but at much greater risk. The spectrum of health consequences of preterm birth includes acute respiratory, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal disorders, and long-term deficits in neurobehavioral development (IOM, 2007) and possibly adverse cardiometabolic outcomes (Hofman et al., 2004; Hovi et al., 2007). An early delivery may well reflect the better alternative as compared to an intrauterine death, whether resulting from clinical intervention (an increasingly common \"cause\" of preterm birth) or natural processes. Nonetheless, the high and growing frequency of preterm birth in the U.S. makes this a critical endpoint to consider in relation to GWG. At the time of the IOM (1990) report, the volume and quality of literature on preterm birth was quite limited. Several studies suggested that low GWG was associated with increased risk of preterm birth, but as they demonstrated, much of that may have resulted from the simple error of failing to recognize that the shortened period of pregnancy (i.e., preterm birth) limits the duration of time over which weight can be gained. Comparing term and preterm births on total weight gain is meaningless for that reason. Data generated on behalf of this committee (information contributed to the committee in consultation with: Herring [see Appendix G, Part II] and Stein [see Appendix G, Part III]) provided some of the first information on GWG and preterm birth to consider prepregnancy BMI, which is predictive of both preterm birth (higher risk with lower BMI) and GWG (higher GWG with lower BMI). The results of that effort suggested little effect of rate of net weight gain (the only proper measure to compare pregnancies of varying duration) on risk of preterm birth. The AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) included a detailed summary of the findings of 12 more recent studies that considered the relationship of rate of GWG to preterm birth. Using rate of weight gain rather than total amount gained takes into account the truncated period of pregnancy\u2014and thus truncated opportunity to gain weight\u2014for women who give birth before term. There was a consistently increased risk of preterm birth in both the lowest and highest GWG categories. It is difficult to summarize the quantitative impact because the studies used varying definitions of high and low rates of weight gain and different analytic methods to characterize the relationship with preterm birth. In studies that provided relative risks comparing higher and lower GWG to the middle range of GWG, the relative risks were on the order of 1.5- 2.5 for both the higher and lower GWG groups, with greater consistency for the influence of lower GWG on preterm birth. A number of these studies examined effect modification by prepregnancy BMI (Siega-Riz et al., 1999; Dietz et al., 2006; Nohr et al., 2007), and those reports were consistent in finding a stronger effect of a lower rate of GWG on preterm delivery among underweight women. As prepregnancy BMI increased, the magnitude of increased risk associated with a lower rate of GWG diminished. There was some evidence that the increased risk of preterm birth associated with a higher rate of GWG was greater with increasing BMI, so that the optimal GWG shifted downward with higher prepregnancy BMI. Four studies applied the IOM (1990) guidelines to define adequacy of GWG, and all of these CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-15 reported increased risk of preterm birth associated with inadequate GWG among underweight and normal-weight women. Some studies considered the clinical presentation of preterm birth (Siega-Riz et al., 1996; Spinillo et al., 1998; Nohr et al., 2007), and some considered severity of prematurity (Dietz et al., 2006; Stotland et al., 2006) in their analyses. Though limited in quantity, the results of these studies do not provide a clear suggestion that the association between GWG and preterm birth differs by clinical presentation or severity. More recently, Rudra et al. (2008) considered preterm birth subtypes in relation to prepregnancy BMI and GWG. They reported that greater GWG during gestational weeks 18-22 was weakly associated with lower risk of spontaneous preterm birth and higher risk of medically indicated preterm birth, with some variation in these patterns in relation to prepregnancy BMI. Biological Plausibility The pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm delivery has not been clearly elucidated but may involve five or more primary pathogenic mechanisms: activation of the maternal or fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, amniochorionic-decidual or systemic inflammation, uteroplacental thrombosis and intrauterine vascular lesions, pathologic distention of the myometrium, and cervical insufficiency (IOM, 2007). The committee found no studies that directly linked GWG to activation of the maternal or fetal HPA axis; however, several animal studies have linked periconceptional undernutrition to accelerated maturation of fetal HPA axis resulting in preterm delivery (Bloomfield et al., 2003; Bloomfield et al., 2004; Kumarasamy et al., 2005). With respect to amniochorionic-decidual or systemic inflammation, the committee also found no direct link to GWG. However, it is plausible that maternal undernutrition may increase the risk of preterm delivery by suppressing immune functions or increasing oxidative stress. Macro- or micronutrient deficiencies can adversely affect maternal immune functions. For example, iron-deficiency anemia can alter the proliferation of T- and B-cells, reduce the killing activity of phagocytes and neutrophils, and lower bactericidal and natural killer cell activity, thereby increasing maternal susceptibility to infections (Allen, 2001). Furthermore, protein and/or micronutrient deficiencies may impair cellular antioxidant capacities because proteins provide amino acids needed for synthesis of antioxidant defense enzymes, such as glutathione and albumin (reactive oxygen species scavengers), and many micronutrients themselves are antioxidants. Increase in reactive oxygen species, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein and F2-isoprostanes (lipid peroxidation products), may inflammation, vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, vascular apoptosis and endothelial cell dysfunction (Luo et al., 2006), which may also activate the pathway to preterm delivery involving uteroplacental thrombosis and intrauterine vascular lesions. The committee cannot establish a causal relationship between GWG and preterm delivery based on available evidence. Although there are intriguing data linking macro- and/or micronutrient deficiencies to accelerated maturation of fetal HPA axis and altered immune functions and/or increased oxidative stress that suggest biological plausibility, important questions regarding timing, threshold, content, and interactions remain unanswered. These uncertainties about a direct causal relationship between GWG and preterm delivery guided the committee's approach to decision analysis in Chapter 7, which weighed the trade-offs of GWG with and without taking into account preterm delivery as an outcome. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-16 In summary, there is strong evidence for a U-shaped association be tween lower GWG and preterm birth among normal weight and underweight women, and moderate evidence for an association of higher GWG and preterm birth. The magnitude of the association is fairly strong, with relative risks on the order of two, but difficult to summarize because of variability in the definitions of higher and lower rates of weight gain. In addition, as noted in the chapter introduction, the lack of strong biological plausibility between GWG and preterm birth calls into question the causal relationship between the two. There is no empirical basis for suggesting modifiers of this relationship other than prepregnancy BMI, for which the data are clear in showing that associations of low GWG with preterm birth are stronger among underweight women. LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES The IOM (1990) report recommendations for GWG were focused largely on avoiding inadequate weight gain and thus the short-term consequences of low fetal growth and prematurity (see Chapter 1). Since its publication, the emergence of epidemic obesity in the American population has raised the possibility that excessive GWG may also be harmful. A small number of studies now address the associations of GWG with adiposity at birth and with markers of childhood obesity and its cardiometabolic sequelae. Neonatal Body Composition As reviewed above, GWG is directly associated with fetal growth as measured by birth weight for gestational age. For outcomes related to long-term adiposity, however, it is important to measure not only weight (and length) at birth, but also body composition. Catalano and colleagues performed a series of studies relating maternal characteristics to neonatal body composition measured by total body electrical conductivity, a method no longer in use. One set of studies compared infants who were born at term to overweight/obese women (pregravid BMI > 25 kg/m2; n = 76) with those born to lean/average weight women ( n = 144) (Sewell et al., 2006). As expected, GWG was higher among lean/average (mean 15.2 kg) than overweight/obese (13.8 kg) women. Among the overweight/obese women, stepwise regression analyses that included pregravid weight as a covariate revealed that the higher the GWG, the higher the newborn fat mass. The authors did not report the correlation among the lean women, presumably because the associated p-value exceeded 0.05. In another study, however, which combined diabetic and non-diabetic pregnant women (total n = 415), Catalano and Ehrenberg (2006) found that GWG was directly associated with birth weight, including both lean and fat mass. These results are consistent with those of Udal et al. (1978), who found a direct association between GWG and sum of eight neonatal skinfold measurements among 109 non-diabetic mothers who delivered term infants, an association that was independent of prepregnancy weight, gestational age, smoking and family history of diabetes. The findings of these studies raise the possibility that higher GWG may lead to long-lasting adiposity in the offspring. Studies that link GWG with body composition from birth onwards in populations from developed countries would be quite informative but are presently unavailable. Infant Weight Gain Rapid weight gain during infancy is associated with obesity later in life (Baird et al., 2005; Monteiro and Victoria, 2005; Gillman, 2008). It is unclear whether this pattern is particularly an CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-17 issue among infants who are born SGA (Ong and Loos, 2006; Taveras et al., 2009). Therefore, infant weight gain may serve as a surrogate, or intermediate marker, of later adiposity. Although it may be more feasible to obtain intermediate markers than ultimate health outcomes, they are rarely perfect surrogates and are sometimes misleading. Therefore, one should view any associations of GWG with surrogate outcomes\u2014even in randomized trials\u2014with caution, and only as suggestive of effects on actual health outcomes. Also, this line of evidence would be strengthened by studies with serial measures of body composition, not just weight (with or without length) from birth onwards. Only one study was identified that addressed GWG and infant weight gain, and it was not the primary goal of the study. Ong et al. (2000) conducted a prospective study of 848 term infants born in the UK who had weight measured at birth and at two and five years of age. The 30.7 percent of children who gained more than 0.67 weight standard deviations in the first two years of life had more adiposity at age five than the other children, but they also had been lighter, shorter, and thinner at birth. The mothers of these children were not more likely to have had a higher prepregnancy BMI or to have gained more weight during pregnancy. Breastfeeding Initiation and Maintenance Breastfeeding Outcomes Breastfeeding is an important outcome to study not only because it may be associated with reduced obesity, and is therefore an intermediate like infant weight gain, but also because it predicts other health outcomes such as reduced otitis media and gastrointestinal illness and better cognition. Observational studies (see Chapter 5) have documented a relationship between excessive weight gain during pregnancy and poor breastfeeding outcomes. Long-term Effects on Obesity Despite the importance of this issue, high-quality studies that link GWG with obesity and related health outcomes in childhood are only beginning to be published. The AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) identified only one cohort study that examined childhood obesity in relation to weight gain according to the IOM (1990) guidelines. Oken et al. (2007) analyzed data from Project Viva, a prospective study of predominantly non-low-income pregnant women and their children in Massachusetts (Table 6-3). Among the sample of 1,044 mothers included in this analysis, 51 percent gained excessive, 35 percent adequate, and 14 percent inadequate weight during pregnancy. Compared with inadequate GWG, adequate and excessive gains were associated with odds ratios of 3.77 (95% CI: 1.38, 10.27) and 4.35 (1.69, 11.24), respectively, at 3 years of age (BMI > 95th percentile versus < 50th percentile) in analyses adjusted for key covariates. In addition, the authors found higher BMI z-score, sum of triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses, and blood pressure for 5-kg increment in total GWG. The AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008) found three other studies that assessed total GWG and childhood adiposity. One of these studies (Ong et al., 2000) examined weight gain from birth to two years as an outcome, as was discussed earlier. Sowan and Stember (2000) examined outcomes through 14 months of age. In their fully adjusted model, each 5-pound increment in total weight gain was associated with an odds ratio of 0.8 for obesity defined as BMI > 84th percentile within the study population ( n = 630). Inferences from this study are WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-18 uncertain for a number of reasons. Li et al. (2007) empirically derived three weight-gain trajectories through childhood. Gestational weight gain was a predictor of the \"early-onset\" trajectory (which was defined as \"children with an early-onset of overweight that persisted throughout childhood\") total weight gain of at least 45 pounds (versus 25-35 pounds) was associated with an increased risk of 1.7 for being in the early-onset rather than the normal trajectory class in an analysis adjusted for maternal BMI and other factors. Since the publication of the AHRQ review (Viswanathan et al., 2008), Wrotniak et al. (2008) studied approximately 10,000 seven-year-old term-born offspring of participants in the 1950s- 1960s Collaborative Perinatal Project (see Table 6-3). Not surprisingly, mean maternal BMI (21.9 kg/m2), total weight gain (9.5 kg), and birth weight (3.23 kg), and the proportions of women with excessive gain (11 percent) and children with obesity (defined as BMI > 95th percentile\u20145.7 percent) were lower than in current cohorts. Both total weight gain and excessive weight gain were associated with child obesity. For example, compared with adequate gain, excessive gain was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.06) for BMI 95th versus < 95th percentile). The association appeared stronger for women who entered pregnancy underweight (BMI < 19.8 kg/m2) than for heavier mothers. In another recent study, Moreira et al. (2007) found that total weight gain was directly associated with childhood overweight defined by the International Obesity Task Force standards (Cole et al., 2000) (see Table 6-3). Compared with weight gains < 9 kg, gains 16 kg were associated with an adjusted odds ratio for overweight of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.01-1.61). Among nearly 12,000 participants in the Growing Up Today Study, Oken et al. (2008) found a strong, nearly linear association between total GWG and obesity (BMI >95th versus < 85th percentile) at 9-14 years of age after adjusting for maternal BMI and other covariates (see Figure 6-3 and Table 6-3). Overall, each 5-lb increment in GWG was associated with an odds ratio of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06-1.13) for obesity. Expressing GWG in terms of recommended weight gain ranges (IOM, 1990), the authors found that, compared to adequate weight gain, the odds ratio for excessive gain was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.19-1.70). Inadequate gain was not clearly associated with lower risk of obesity. The authors did not find that maternal BMI modified associations of GWG with adolescent obesity, although\u2014if anything\u2014the association was weaker among underweight mothers, in contrast to the findings of Wrotniak et al. (2008).

All estimates are adjusted for maternal age, race/ethnicity, marital status, household income, paternal education, child sex, gestation length, age, and Tanner stage at outcome assessment.

Other studies have not demonstrated associations between GWG and adiposity-related measures in the offspring. Some of these were suggestive but small (Gale et al., 2007), while others were sufficiently large but did not focus on GWG as a main study exposure or adequately control for confounding factors (Fisch et al., 1975; Maffeis, 1994; Whitaker, 2004). Overall, evidence to date is suggestive but not conclusive that GWG outside the ranges recommended by IOM (1990) is associated with higher BMI in the offspring. Evidence for effect modification by maternal BMI is scant. No data are available to address the timing of weight gain during pregnancy. Most of the studies rely on child's BMI as the only outcome, but direct measures of adiposity and cardio-metabolic status would strengthen evidence. Only one study to date has reported on blood pressure as an outcome (Oken et al., 2007), although a recent report suggests that higher amounts of weight gain are associated with increase in left ventricular mass from birth to six months (Geelhoed et al., 2008). The National Children's Study will offer an opportunity to address many of these limitations. Now in early recruitment, this is a cohort study of parents and children from the prenatal (or, in a subset, preconceptional) period through 20 years of age. The sample, to include 100,000 children, is meant to be representative of the US population. This sample will be large enough to assess effect modification by race/ethnicity and other characteristics as well as maternal BMI, and to address timing of weight gain during pregnancy. Child outcomes will include direct measures of adiposity and cardio-metabolic risk factors from birth onwards in addition to length/height and weight. Statistical modeling will allow adjustment for many potential confounding variables. CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-21 Nevertheless, as discussed in the chapter opening, even strong observational studies that have valid exposure and outcome measures, large sample sizes, and appropriate control for confounding cannot fully address the question of causality. Randomized controlled trials that are designed to modify GWG and include follow-up of the children would provide the most compelling evidence for or against intensive clinical or public health efforts to curb excessive weight gain. Other Outcomes Neurodevelopment The effect of alterations in fuel metabolism during pregnancy resulting from intended or unintended weight loss, fasting, or poorly controlled diabetes include ketonemia and/or ketonuria, and consequences from those conditions for the neurocognitive development of the infant (see Chapter 3). The committee reviewed the evidence for long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of ketonemia/ketonuria in pregnancy (See Appendix G). As a result of the association between lower GWG and SGA (see discussion above) one indirect way to evaluate the impact of GWG on neurodevelopment is by assessing associations of term and preterm SGA with neurodevelopmental outcomes. Long term neurodevelopment in term SGA Only observational prospective studies and review articles were identified that evaluate long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in term SGA infants. With the exception of one study conducted in China, all were conducted in industrialized nations including the U.S. (Goldenberg et al., 1996; Nelson et al., 1997). Of 18 studies identified, six examined neurodevelopmental outcomes during infancy/childhood (Watt and Strongman, 1985; Nelson et al., 1997; Sommerfelt et al., al., 2002; Geva et al., 2006; Wiles et al., 2006), nine during adolescence (Westwood et al., 1983; Paz et al. 1995; Pryor et al., 1995; Goldenberg et al., 1996; Strauss, Paz et O'Keefe et al., Indredavik et al., 2004; Peng et al., 2005; Kulseng et al., 2006) and two during adulthood (Viggedal et al., 2004; Wiles et al., 2005). A study from a Finnish cohort found that SGA children performed worse at school than gestational age-matched controls at 10 years of age (Hollo et al., 2002). Another cohort of children in Norway found a slightly lower mean intelligence quotient (IQ) at five years of age associated with SGA. However, in this study parental factors were more strongly related with IQ than SGA (Sommerfelt et al., 2000). In studies of development related to SGA results have been mixed. Nelson et al. (1997) found that SGA was not associated with the Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) and Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence score at one year of age. In contrast, they found that SGA was associated with a lower Bayley Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) among black males but not among females or white male and female infants. Watt and Strongman (1985) documented that SGA was inversely associated with MDI developmental scores at 4 months, whereas Goldenberg et al. (1996) found an inverse relationship between SGA and IQ at 5.5 years of age. Wiles et al. (2006) did not find a relationship between low birth weight and behavioral problems at 6.8 years of age. An effect size analysis was conducted based on cognitive measures. Of the 18 studies reviewed, 12 reported cognitive scores by SGA status. Of these, two reported lower Bayley scores (Watt and Strongman, 1985; Nelson et al., 1997) and 10 reported lower IQ measures WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-22 (Westwood et al., Pryor et al., 1995; Goldenberg et al., 1996; Sommerfelt et al., 2001; Hollo et al., 2002; Viggedal et al., 2004; Peng et al., 2005; Kulseng et al., 2006) associated with term-SGA status, although these differences were not always statistically significant. Among infants, the Bayley score difference associated with SGA ranged from 4-7 points (Watt and Strongman, 1985; Nelson et al., 1997). Among children (Goldenberg et al., 1996; Sommerfelt et al., 2000; Hollo et al., 2002), IQ differentials were 4-5 points. Among adolescents (Westwood et al., 1983; Paz et al. 1995; Pryor et al., 1995; Paz et al., 2001; Peng et al., 2005; Kulseng et al., 2006) the corresponding range was 2-12 points. The upper range limit was derived from a study conducted in China that did not control for socioeconomic and other potential confounding factors (Peng et al., 2005). The only study among adults that reported IQ documented a relatively large 19-point IQ differential (based on scores' median instead of average) associated with term-SGA infants. However, it also failed to account for confounding factors (Viggedal et al., 2004). Overall, studies consistently reported small cognitive differentials associated with being born at term and SGA. The meaning of these small differentials is unclear as in all studies average scores among individuals born SGA fell within the normal IQ range. Although there was a large body of evidence, associations between SGA and longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes among term newborns were inconsistent, especially among adolescents. Among studies that supported this association, major methodological shortcomings (which included substantial attrition rates, lack of standard definitions of SGA across studies, not properly accounting for key confounders [such as socioeconomic status and parental cognitive functioning as well as asphyxia at birth], and lack of testing for effect modification by environmental factors) limit their interpretation. The committee's evaluation of the evidence concurs with previous reviews (Grantham-McGregor, 1995; Goldenberg et al., 1998) that SGA is associated with minimal neurologic dysfunction (e.g., poor school performance) and is not associated with major handicaps, such as cerebral palsy, unless accompanied by asphyxia at birth and that, as a whole, the studies were not designed to identify the influence of SGA, independent of socioeconomic factors, on lower IQs associated with SGA. Long-term neurodevelopment in preterm SGA In preterm SGA infants, the majority of longitudinal studies reviewed focused on extremely premature (Feldman and Eidelman, 2006; Kono et al., 2007; Paavonen et al., 2007; Leonard et al., 2008) or very low birth weight (VLBW) (Litt et al., 1995; Hack et al., 2003; Kilbride et al., 2008a, 2008b) infants. Among 14 studies in children, 11 found that SGA was associated with cognitive and/or neurodevelopment impairments, although this relationship may be modified by degree of postnatal catch-up growth and maternal-child interactions (Casey et al., 2006; Feldman and Eidelman, 2006). In general, the effect size was proportional to the severity of prematurity (Calame et al., 1983; Feldman and Eidelman, 2006; Kono et al., 2007). The two studies conducted among adolescents found an association of VLBW with IQ (Hille et al., 2007) and breathing-related seep disorders (Paavonen et al., 2007). Among adults, VLBW was associated with emotional instability (Strang-Karlsson et al., 2008b) and SGA with lower head circumference among individuals who did not fully catch-up in their head circumference growth during their first 12 months of life. An effect size analysis was conducted based on cognitive measures. Of 19 studies reviewed, 13 reported cognitive scores by SGA status; and of these one reported a lower Bayley score (Feldman and Eidelman, 2006), and 12 reported lower IQ measures (Escalona, 1982; Calame et CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 1997; Kilbride et al., 2004; Litt et al., 2005; Casey et al., 2006; Hille et al., 2007; Kono et al., 2007) associated with preterm SGA status, although these differences were not always statistically significant. Among 2-year old children, one study found an 8-point difference in the Bayley Mental Development Index score (Feldman and Eidelman, 2006). In contrast, a study conducted among 3.5-year-old children found no differences in IQ scores associated with preterm SGA (Escalona, 1982). Among the rest of studies with children (Calame et al., 1983; Silva et al., 1984; et 1997; Kilbride et al., 2004; Litt et al., 2005; Casey et al., 2006; Kono et al., 2007), IQ differentials were 2-11 points. The only study among adults that reported IQ, documented a 2- point differential associated with VLBW. Overall, the cognitive differentials appear to be relatively stronger among individuals born SGA preterm (mean \u00b1 std. dev: 6.5 \u00b1 3.8 IQ points, n = 11 studies) than among those born SGA term (5.3 \u00b1 3.0, n = 9 studies IQ points). However, as with term SGA, the meaning of these still relatively small differentials is unclear because in the vast majority of studies, the average scores for individuals born preterm SGA fell within the normal IQ range. The overwhelming majority of studies reviewed support an association between preterm SGA and lower neurodevelopment in the longer term. Consistent with the studies on term SGA, many of the studies on preterm SGA did not properly control for key perinatal (e.g., asphyxia), socio-economic, parental, and home environment confounders (e.g., maternal-child interactions). In addition, although some studies included term births as reference groups (Calame et al., 1983; Silva et al., 1984; Holwerda-Kuipers, et et al., 2008a, 2008b), others used preterm subgroups as comparison groups (McCarton et al., 1996; Hutton et al., 1997; Casey et al., 2006; Kono et al., 2007). Thus, the effect size or the proportion of the variance in neurodevelopmental outcomes that can be attributed to being born premature per se or to the combination of prematurity and SGA still needs to be determined taking into account these study design limitations. In summary, as was the case with infant mortality, one must link GWG to being born preterm or small- or large-for-gestational age and, from there, to neurodevelopmental outcomes. This sequence is biologically plausible and it is possible that it is causal, but the evidence to establish causality is not available. Apgar score Apgar score (see Glossary in Appendix A) assessments are usually conducted one and five minutes after birth and scores can range from 0 to 10. They are not adequate predictors of longer term morbidity and mortality although very low scores (0-3) associated with low birth weight do predict neonatal mortality. Apgar scores in term infants, even at five minutes do not correlate well with neurological outcomes (ACOG, 2006). The AHRQ review (Viswanthan et al., 2008) identified five studies in which the influence of GWG on newborn's Apgar score was examined (Stevens-Simon and McAnarney, 1992; Nixon et al., 1998; Cedergren et al., 2006, Stotland et al., 2006, Wataba et al., 2006). These studies provide only modest evidence that excessive GWG is associated with low Apgar score, and one study suggested that low GWG in nulliparous women also predicts low Apgar score. Childhood cognition No published studies directly examine the link between GWG and neurocognitive development in infants and children. As discussed in Chapter 3, however, weight loss or failure to gain during pregnancy due to dietary caloric insufficiency may possibly induce maternal hormonal and metabolic responses that may have subsequent consequences for the WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-24 intellectual development of the child. Because of the obligatory weight gain in maternal tissues (uterus, breast, blood) and the fetal-placental unit, a weight gain less than ~7.5-8.5 kg would likely result in mobilization of maternal adipose tissue and possibly lean body mass. No studies have addressed the gestational metabolic milieu or offspring outcomes of the pregnant woman who experiences weight loss. Studies do exist, however, on the associations of ketonemia or ketonuria, which can occur among pregnant women subjected to short-term fasting (see Chapter 3), on cognition in offspring. Some, but not all, of these studies have found an association between biomarkers of maternal metabolic fuel alterations and child intellectual development (Stehbens et al., 1977; Rizzo et al. 1991; Silverman et al. 1991). In contrast, Persson et al., (1984) and Naeye and Chez (1981) did not find any association of maternal acetonuria, weight loss or low GWG with psychomotor development and IQ in children (see Chapter 3). In summary, although no studies specifically address the impact of very low GWG or weight loss on child intellectual development, some evidence suggests that biomarkers of short- term negative energy balance during pregnancy may be related to the child's intellectual development. These associations may be limited to women with diabetes during pregnancy. Allergy/Asthma Preterm birth is a risk factor for childhood asthma, often as a result of suboptimal lung function and resulting neonatal respiratory morbidity (Dombkowski et al., 2008). Inasmuch as GWG has, in turn, been associated with risk of preterm birth, the committee considered the plausibility that GWG may also be a risk factor for childhood asthma. In a case-control study of 262 African-American 4-9-year-old children receiving care at a hospital-based clinic, Oliveti et al. (1996) used maternal self-report and child medical records to examine pre- and perinatal risk factors for asthma, defined by physician diagnosis in addition to wheezing or coughing that required asthma medication. Among children with asthma, 24.6 percent were born preterm compared to 13.7 percent of controls. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that odds of prevalent asthma were 3.42 (95% CI: 1.72-6.79) times higher among women who gained less (versus more) than 20 total pounds during pregnancy. However, the authors neither adjusted for prepregnancy BMI nor examined the BMI-GWG interaction. Gestational weight gain may be associated with an increased risk for asthma in offspring through alteration of the developing fetal immune system. Willwerth et al. (2006) found that both inadequate and excessive GWG were associated with increased cord blood mononuclear cell proliferative responses to stimulation (OR = 2.3 and 2.6, respectively), compared to controls with adequate GWG. In this study, however, maternal smoking (OR = 18) was the major determinant of the response. Cancer Whether associations exist between GWG, birth weight, and risk for childhood cancers is not clear, however, there are a few studies that have examined the possibility. Childhood leukemia There may be an indirect relationship between GWG and childhood leukemia because of the established relationship between higher GWG and macrosomia (see discussion above). A recent meta-analysis (Hjalgrim et al., 2003) estimated that the odds for acute lymphoblastic childhood leukemia (ALL) were higher (OR = 1.26 [95% CI: 1.17-1.37]) for infants with birth weight over 4,000 g compared to those under 4,000 g. Although not statistically significant, results were of similar magnitude for acute myelogenous leukemia CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-25 (AML). McLaughlin et al. (2006) examined the association between pre gnancy outcomes and leukemia diagnosed before 10 years of age registered in the state of New York. Information on prepregnancy weight (BMI not generally available) and GWG was obtained from birth certificates. Multivariate regression analyses, adjusted for prepregnancy weight, showed that total GWG greater than 14 kg conferred an increased risk for ALL (OR = .31 [95% CI: 1.07, 1.60]). No interaction of GWG with maternal weight was found and there was no association of GWG with AML. The authors speculated that higher GWG could result in higher fetal exposure to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) which in turn may increase the risk of childhood ALL. Breast cancer Almost two decades ago, Trichopoulos (1990) hypothesized that breast cancer originates from alterations in the prenatal endocrine milieu, in particular higher estrogen levels. Although longitudinal studies are unavailable, observational studies showing direct associations between birth weight and breast cancer provide some support for an association (Michels et al., 1996; Vatten et al., 2002; Ahlgren et al., 2007). Therefore, it is of interest to examine determinants of hormone levels in the maternal-placental-fetal unit. Lagiou et al. (2006) examined the association between GWG and maternal sex hormones at 16 and 27 weeks of gestation. After adjusting for prepregnancy BMI and other covariates no associations were found between GWG and maternal estradiol, estriol or prolactin levels. However, among women with high GWG, there was an association between lower levels of maternal progesterone and of sex hormone binding globulin (-0.7 percent [95% CI -1.5, 0.0] at 16 weeks and -1.2 percent [95% CI -2.0, -0.4] at 27 weeks, respectively, for every 1 kg increment in GWG. In addition, one study directly addressed the association of GWG with incident breast cancer. Analyzing data from the Finnish Cancer Registry, Kinnunen et al. (2004) found that mothers in the upper tertile of GWG (> 15 kg) had a 1.62-fold higher breast cancer risk than mothers who gained within the recommended range (11-15 kg), after adjusting for parity, mother's age at menarche, at first birth, and at index pregnancy, and prepregnancy BMI. Together these findings provide some support for the hypothesis that excessive weight gain in pregnancy could lead to elevated breast cancer risk in the offspring. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder It is possible that maternal body fat reserves and GWG can influence fetal central nervous pathways that ultimately result in behavioral disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) because the human brain rapidly develops during gestation and the early postnatal period. Only one study (Rodriguez et al., 2008) was identified that examined associations of early pregnancy BMI and GWG with ADHD. Within three cohorts of 7-12-year-old Scandinavian children, teachers rated the children's inattention and hyperactivity symptoms with standard questionnaires. About 8.5 percent of children were classified as having ADHD symptoms. A large majority of women (86.4 percent) had a normal prepregnancy BMI and adequate GWG (mean gestational age = 39.6 \u00b1 1.6 weeks; and mean birth weight = 3.6 \u00b1 0.5 kg). Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that among women with a high prepregnancy BMI, GWG (weekly gain in 100-g increments) was associated with increased odds of child ADHD (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.44). Among lean women, those who experienced weight loss during pregnancy also had higher odds for child ADHD than their counterparts who did not lose weight during gestation (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.07-2.15). The mechanisms for these effects are unknown, although the authors speculated on the possibility of neurotoxin transfer from maternal adipose tissue to the developing fetal brain. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-26 CONCLUDING REMARKS A ssessing the impact of GWG on child outcomes requires both a short- and long-term outlook. Strong observational evidence links GWG directly with fetal growth, so that higher weight gain predicts LGA and lower weight gain predicts SGA, both themselves markers of neonatal morbidity. The literature on preterm birth is more ambiguous because of a less- extensive body of epidemiologic evidence, a nonlinear relationship between GWG and preterm birth, and uncertainty about biologic mechanisms. Even the proper measurement of GWG to take into account the shortened time period of pregnancy is subject to some uncertainty. The U- shaped association of GWG with preterm birth is harder to interpret than the monotonic dose- response gradient with birth weight for gestational age, post-partum weight retention, and childhood obesity. It may reflect distinct causal processes on the low and the high end of GWG. Among the most important long-term child outcomes are obesity and its sequelae, chiefly cardio-metabolic consequences and neurodevelopmental disorders. Observational evidence is growing that GWG predicts childhood adiposity after adjusting for key factors including prepregnancy BMI, although some older studies do not show this association. The evidence for neurodevelopmental outcomes is dependent on inferences from intermediate endpoints of fetal size and duration of gestation. Randomized trials are especially important because to date there is no appropriate animal experimental model for GWG, thus reducing one of the criteria\u2014biological plausibility\u2014that epidemiologists often use to support causal inference. Nevertheless, as reviewed in this chapter, pathways involving insulin resistance and fetal hyperglycemia may underlie associations of GWG with subsequent obesity in the offspring. At the other end of the spectrum, reduced GWG is associated with lower fetal growth and preterm birth, themselves associated with later central obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. Very little current evidence, however, suggests that inadequate or low GWG predicts obesity-related outcomes in children. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Findings 1. Causal inferences relating GWG to childhood outcomes are tenuous as a result of the paucity of experimental studies. 2. Epidemiologic support for an association between gestational weight gain and stillbirth is weak; there are few methodologically sound studies. 3. Many epidemiologic studies are consistent in showing a linear, direct relationship between GWG and birth weight for gestational age. Thus, lower GWG predicts SGA, and higher GWG predicts LGA. Despite a limited number of randomized controlled trials, biological plausibility from animal models is strong. Relative risks appear higher among women with lower prepregnancy BMI. 4. The evidence for a relationship between GWG and preterm birth, or continuous gestational age is weaker than evidence for fetal growth, and biological plausibility is weak. Most studies show associations between lower GWG and preterm birth among underweight, and to a lesser extent, normal weight women. Higher GWG among all BMI categories may also be associated with preterm birth. Evidence is insufficient on associations with spontaneous versus induced preterm birth. CONSEQUENCES OF GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN FOR THE CHIL D PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-27 5. A small number of studies show that GWG is directly associa ted with fat mass in the newborn period. Insufficient evidence is available on associations between GWG and adiposity in infancy. 6. A small number of relatively large and recent epidemiologic studies show that higher GWG is associated with childhood obesity as measured by BMI. Although biological plausibility is strong, evidence is insufficient to address effect modification by maternal BMI. Only one study has examined blood pressure as an outcome (finding associations in the same direction as BMI) and none has evaluated fat mass or other cardiometabolic consequences of adiposity. 7. Lower GWG may be associated with risk of childhood asthma, chiefly through complications of preterm birth although evidence is limited. 8. Higher GWG may be associated with ALL, breast cancer, and ADHD. Data are limited. 9. Concern exists that metabolic consequences of weight loss during pregnancy may be associated with poorer childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes. Data are limited but raise the possibility that ketonemia among diabetic women could lead to suboptimal neurologic development. Recommendation for Research Research Recommendation 6-1: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct observational and experimental studies to assess the impact of variation in GWG on a range of child outcomes, including duration of gestation, weight and body composition at birth, and neurodevelopment, obesity and related outcomes, and asthma later in childhood. Areas for Additional Investigation The committee identified the following areas for further investigation to support its research recommendations. The research community should conduct studies on: Child outcomes related to GWG to provide support for causal inference. Randomized trials and a combination of observational epidemiology and animal models may be a more attainable benchmark to enhance certainty regarding causal links between GWG and infant outcomes; Statistical models that follow sound theoretical frameworks and clearly distinguish among confounding, mediating, and moderating (effect modifying) variables. Statistical models based on path analysis such as structural equation modeling may be able to improve interpretation of complex data; and Preventing excessive weight gain with all of the attributes listed above for observational studies. Even relatively small studies that can evaluate intermediate endpoints, if not the clinically important outcomes, would make a significant contribution. Furthermore, future research on GWG and child outcomes should: Not assume linear relationships between GWG and offspring obesity, but should look for U- or J-shaped associations as well; WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 6-28 Determine whether the pattern of maternal weight gain matters for short- or long-term child outcomes, e.g., whether weight gain earlier in pregnancy is more harmful than later gain; and Determine whether critical or sensitive periods of adiposity accretion exist in pregnant women, and if so when weight gain is an adequate measure to capture those periods.

P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 17 Determining Optimal Weight Gain INTRODUCTION In this chapter, the approach used by the committee for arriving at its recommendations for revision of the current guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy is discussed. First, a brief discussion of the principles used by the committee to develop a strategy for making its recommendations is presented. The strategy is then described in some detail, along with the results of applying this approach. Finally, the committee's recommendations are detailed and discussed. As was the case for the report, Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990), the committee used a conceptual framework to organize the evidence for a causal relationship between gestational weight gain (GWG) and both short- and long-term outcomes. The frequency and severity of these outcomes were considered. In particular, although a possible trade-off between maternal and child health was recognized in the Institute of Medicine report (IOM, 1990) as being a consequence of changing the weight gain guidelines, evaluation of that trade-off was not possible with the data then available. The committee made evaluating this trade-off a central element of its process to develop new guidelines, while recognizing that although the available data have increased, they are still less than fully adequate for this purpose. In making its recommendations, the committee sought to recognize unintended consequences and to develop guidelines that are both feasible and potentially achievable. It is important to note that these guidelines are intended for use among women in the United States. They may be applicable to women in other developed countries, however, they are not intended for use in areas of the world where women are substantially shorter or thinner than American women or where adequate obstetric services are unavailable. STRATEGIC APPROACH FOR DEVELOPING RECOMMENDATIONS The committee identified a set of consequences for the short- or long-term health of the mother and the child that are potentially causally related to GWG. These consequences included those evaluated in a systematic review of outcomes of maternal weight gain prepared for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (Viswanathan et al., 2008) as well as others based on data from the literature outside the time window considered in that report. To develop estimates of both the risk of these outcomes and their frequency in the population, the committee used data available in the published literature and also commissioned additional analyses (see below). The committee considered several of potential outcomes associated with GWG and compared their incidence, long-term sequelae, and baseline risk (additional information about these outcomes appears in Appendix G). Postpartum weight retention, cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia emerged from this process as being the most important maternal health outcomes. The committee WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-2 removed preeclampsia from consideration because of the lack of sufficient evidence that GWG was a cause of preeclampsia and not just a reflection of the disease process in this condition. The committee also removed GDM from consideration because of the lack of sufficient evidence that GWG was a cause of this condition. Postpartum weight retention and, in particular, unscheduled primary cesarean delivery were retained for further consideration. Measures of size at birth (e.g. small-for-gestational age [SGA] and large-for-gestational age [LGA]), preterm birth and childhood obesity emerged from this process as being the most important infant health outcomes. The committee recognized that both SGA and LGA, when defined as < 10th percentile and > 90th percentile of weight-for-gestational age, respectively, represent a mix of individuals who are appropriately or inappropriately small or large. In addition, the committee recognized that being SGA was likely to be associated with deleterious outcomes for the infant but not the mother, while being LGA was likely to be associated with consequences for both the infant and the mother (e.g., cesarean delivery). The committee addressed this mix of outcomes in the approach used to develop its recommendations (see below). Previous Approaches for Developing Weight Gain Recommendations Many approaches have been and are currently being used for making recommendations for how much weight women should gain during pregnancy. At one extreme is the advice from the National Center for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom that women should not be weighed at all during pregnancy \"as it may produce unnecessary anxiety with no added benefit\" with the exception being \"pregnant women in whom nutrition is of concern\" (National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2008). In the United States, the 1970 report Maternal Nutrition and the Course of Pregnancy (NRC, 1970) recommended a single target, and average gain of 10.9 kg (24 pounds), with a range of 9.1-11.3 kg (20-25 pounds). This target was based on the amount of weight that healthy women gain when meeting the physiologic needs of pregnancy (e.g., the products of conception, expansion of plasma volume, red cell mass and maternal fat stores). Still another approach has been used in Chile. Since 1987, maternal weight gain recommendations for the Chilean population have been based on a single target, but instead of an absolute amount of weight, a proportion (120 percent) of the woman's \"standard weight\" for her height is used (Rosso, 1985; Mardones and Rosso, 2005). This results in a recommendation for a higher gain in underweight women and a lower gain in heavier women, with an upper limit of 7 kg for women with prepregnant weights over 120 percent of the standard (Figure 7-1). The objective of this recommendation is to increase birth weight among underweight women, and it is considered successful in having done so (Mardones and Rosso, 2005). The IOM (1990) report also recommended higher gains for underweight women and lower gains (but at least 6.8 kg) for heavier women. The desired outcome was expressed as specific target ranges for each of 3 prepregnant body mass index (BMI) groups. The rationale for this approach was to achieve the birth weight (3-4 kg) associated with \"a favorable pregnancy outcome\" in all prepregnant BMI groups while avoiding the birth of infants with weight > 4 kg because of \"the possible risks to the mother and infant of complicated labor and delivery\" (IOM, 1990). DETERMINING OPTIMAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-3 F IGURE 7-1 Graphic showing weight increase for pregnant women NOTE: A = underweight; B = normal weight; C = overweight; D = obese SOURCE: A weight gain chart for pregnant women designed in Chile, Mardones F. and P. Rosso. Copyright \u00a9 2005, Maternal and Child Nutrition. Reproduced with permission of Blackwell Publishing Ltd. In constructing their recommendations, both the Chilean investigators (Mardones and Rosso, 2005) and the IOM (1990) committee explicitly recognized the trade-off between raising the birth weight of infants born to underweight women and increasing the risk of high birth weight in some infants as well as obesity and other undesirable outcomes in their mothers. In fact, the IOM (1990) committee recommended that a formal decision analysis be undertaken \"in which probabilities and utilities (values) are assigned to each potential outcome\" so as to assist in balancing the risks and benefits of any recommendation. Since the publication of the IOM (1990) report, several groups of investigators have offered their own approaches for determining the optimal GWG. All of the studies of this type identified by the committee are discussed below. It is noteworthy that, with one exception (Nohr et al., 2008), maternal and infant outcomes beyond the immediate neonatal period were not included in these investigations. In each of these investigations, the researchers studied GWG as a categorical, not a continuous, variable, and each group defined the categories differently. Bracero and Byrne (1998) used data from 20,971 pregnant women and their singleton infants who were delivered at a single hospital in New York City (1987-1993). They identified the GWG at which the proportion of women who had infants with any one of 11 adverse perinatal outcomes was minimal. This list included outcomes not generally associated with GWG. Adverse maternal outcomes were not considered. In general, they found that this point was at a higher GWG than recommended in the IOM (1990) report. Therefore, they recommended gains of 16.3-18.1 kg WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED 7-4 11.8-13.6 kg (26-30 pounds) for underweight, normal weight and overweight or obese women categorized by the cutoff points in the IOM (1990) report, respectively. Cedergren (2007) conducted a population-based cohort study (1994-2004) that included the data from 298,648 Swedish women obtained from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry. She calculated the risk of a variety of pregnancy outcomes by maternal prepregnant BMI category. She did this \"to estimate weight gain limits that were associated with a significantly decreased risk of the most clinically dangerous situations for the mother and the infant.\" It is important to note that her selection of adverse outcomes \"was not based primarily on possible correlations with weight gain or maternal BMI\" (Cedergren, 2007). In addition to SGA and LGA, her analysis included six maternal and seven fetal outcomes that were unweighted for either their frequency or severity. Preeclampsia was included, but not GDM. With this approach, Cedergren (2007) found that the optimal GWG was lower than that recommended in the IOM (1990) report in all categories, especially for overweight or obese women. In three studies that used population-based cohorts from Missouri, DeVader et al. (2007) studied 94,696 normal weight women (1999-2001), Langford et al. (2008) studied 34,143 overweight women (1990-2004), and Kiel et al. (2007) studied 120,251 obese women (1990- 2001) who delivered full-term, singleton infants. These three groups of investigators calculated the risk of pregnancy outcomes that are routinely collected on all birth certificates according to reported GWG. DeVader et al. (2007) and Langford et al. (2008) assessed the risk of these outcomes according to whether the women had gained < 11.4 kg (25 pounds), 11.4-15.9 kg (25- 35 pounds) or > 15.9 kg (> 35 pounds). Both groups found that the primary hazard of gaining less than the IOM (1990) report recommendation was delivering an SGA or low birth weight (< 2500 g) infant (Langford et al., 2008 only); gaining in excess of the recommendation was associated with an increased risk of several adverse outcomes, including preeclampsia, cesarean delivery and delivery of an LGA or macrosomic infant (Langford et al., 2008 only). After balancing these risks, DeVader and her colleagues (2007) concluded that the \"ideal\" gestational weight gain for their population of normal weight women was 11.4-15.5 kg (25-34 pounds). Langford and her colleagues (2008) found that overweight women \"should gain within the current recommendations (15-25 lbs)\" and that \"there may be additional benefit of gaining below the recommendations, specifically in the 6-14 lbs range.\" The number of obese women in their sample was large enough so that Kiel et al. (2007) were able to distinguish among obesity classes I, II, and III. They found that the risk of delivering an SGA infant continued to decrease with increasing degrees of maternal obesity and was minimal among women who gained < 6.8 kg (15 pounds) during pregnancy. In addition, although the pattern of increasing risk of preeclampsia, cesarean delivery and LGA birth with increasing GWG was the same across the obesity classes, Kiel et al. (2007) found that the point at which the risk of these outcomes considered as a group was minimal differed for each obesity class. This minimal risk corresponded to GWG of 4.5-15.5 kg (10-25 pounds), and 0-4.1 kg (0-9 pounds) for obesity class I and obesity classes II and III, respectively. In all of these studies of women from Missouri, the authors chose to consider outcomes that have been related to GWG (although the validity of using preeclampsia is open to question, see Chapter 5). As was the case for Cedergren's analysis (2007), these investigators did not consider the frequency or severity of these events and the outcomes of pregnancy were restricted to those at delivery. In the most recent of the research reports in which authors have tried to identify optimal GWG, Nohr and colleagues (2008) used data from the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996-DETERMINING OPTIMAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-5 2002). This study included 60,892 women with term pregnancies. Data on weight before pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy and postpartum weight were obtained during telephone interviews of the mother and outcome data were obtained from birth and hospital discharge registries. Nohr et al. (2008) calculated the risks of a variety of maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with prepregnant BMI and GWG and their interaction. For those with a strong independent association with GWG and little possibility of reverse causality (unscheduled primary cesarean delivery, SGA, LGA, and postpartum weight retention 5 kg), they calculated the absolute risk of these outcomes for women in each of the four major categories of prepregnant BMI. Although the trade-off between reducing the risk of SGA and increasing the risk of cesarean delivery was evident in these data as it was in those from Sweden (Cedergren, 2007) and Missouri (Devader et al., 2007; Kiel et al., 2007; Langford et al., 2008), what is unique in this presentation is the inclusion of postpartum weight retention. Nohr et al. (2008) showed a dramatic increase in postpartum weight retention 5 kg with increasing GWG in all categories of prepregnant BMI. Nohr and her colleagues (2008) calculated the proportion of women who had changed from one BMI category to another at six months postpartum according to their GWG. In this analysis, only 0.4 percent of underweight women had become overweight at the highest GWG ( 20 kg) studied. Thus, they concluded that high GWG was \"probably not disadvantageous for either underweight women or their infants\" (Nohr et al., 2008). For normal weight, overweight and obese women, however, the tradeoff between SGA and these other outcomes particularly postpartum weight retention, occurred at lower GWG values: 16-19 kg, 10-15 kg and <10 kg, respectively (Nohr et al., 2008). As was the case for the other studies, Nohr et al. did not weight their outcomes by their frequency or severity; however, it is clear that the authors sought the point of minimum risk of SGA and postpartum weight retention 5 kg in their decision making. Although the analytic approaches used by these research groups have many similarities, their conclusions about optimal weight gain varied widely (Table 7-1). This was particularly striking for underweight and normal weight women, but was also present for overweight women. The differences in conclusions may have resulted from the different mix of outcomes that were considered. The report of Nohr and coworkers (2008) was the only one to exclude preeclampsia and include postpartum weight retention. Cedergren (2007) included a number of outcomes of pregnancy that lack a clear association with GWG. None of these reports included the development of obesity during childhood as an outcome or provided information about the consequences of variation in GWG among women in the racial and ethnic subgroups common in the American population or among women who are young or short\u2014groups that were explicitly considered in the IOM (1990) report. As noted above, none of these analyses was weighted (at least explicitly) by the severity or frequency of the adverse outcomes considered and the categories of GWG were constructed separately by each group of investigators.

DETERMINING OPTIMAL WEIGHT GAIN P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-7 APPROACH USED BY THE COMMITTEE IN DEVELOPING ITS R ECOMMENDATIONS To address these conflicts and gaps within the available literature, the committee commissioned several additional analyses that informed its decision making (Table 7-2) (see Appendix G). Dr. Ellen Nohr provided two sets of analyses from the Danish National Birth Cohort. She expanded her published analyses (Nohr et al., 2008) to provide information on an additional lower and an additional higher category of GWG and replicated her published analyses for obese class I women separately from obese class II and III women. She conducted analogous new analyses of several important subgroups of the population of pregnant women, namely primiparous, short, and young women as well as smokers (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Nohr [see Appendix G, Part I]). Dr. Amy Herring analyzed the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) to explore the association between GWG and outcomes important to the committee separately for white and black women. She also linked it to its 1991 follow- up to examine the association between GWG and postpartum weight r etention in this sample. She was unable to examine the long- term weight status of infants born L GA because access to the data could not be obtained in a timely manner (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Herring [see Appendix G, Part II]). Dr. Cheryl Stein analyzed adverse outcomes associated with GWG stratified by racial/ethnic group in the subsample of births during 1995-2003 in New York City for which prepregnant BMI was available (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Stein [see Appendix G, Part III]). In addition, the committee commissioned a quantitative analysis of risk trade-offs between maternal and child health outcomes associated with GWG by Dr. James Hammitt (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Hammitt [see Appendix G, Part IV]). The committee relied on both standard criteria for evaluating the quality of research studies (such as those provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004) as well as its expert judgment when evaluating the evidence. It used evidence from the published scientific literature as well as the analyses it commissioned. In the development of its recommendations, the committee evaluated the overall quality of the evidence as well as the balance between benefits and risks. The committee relied on the highest level of evidence (randomized controlled trials, and experimental studies in women and animal models). However, few such experimental studies were available in the literature relevant to the committee's task. In addition, the committee used data from the general population in those instances in which data on minority populations were unavailable.

CONSTRUCTION OF GUIDELINES FOR GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN Prepregnant BMI Category After the publication of the IOM (1990) report, the World Health Organization (WHO) held a consultation that developed a categorization of BMI values for adults based on different cutoff DETERMINING OPTIMAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-9 points (WHO, 1995). The WHO cutoff points were subsequently endorsed by the National Institutes of Health (NHLBI, 1998). These categories have been widely adopted in the United States and internationally and, if used in formulating recommendations for GWG, would provide opportunities for a consistent message to women and health care providers about weight status for all groups of adults, including women of childbearing age. For these reasons, the committee adopted the WHO BMI categories for its recommendations. Evidence from the scientific literature is remarkably clear that prepregnant BMI is an independent predictor of many adverse outcomes of pregnancy (see Chapter 5). These data provide ample justification for the choice made in the IOM (1990) report to construct weight gain guidelines according to prepregnant BMI. That approach has been retained in the current document. Special Populations Women of Short Stature The IOM (1990) report guidelines recommended that women of short stature (< 157 cm) should gain at the lower end of the range for their prepregnant BMI. The committee was unable to identify evidence sufficient to continue to support a modification of GWG guidelines for women of short stature (Vishwanathan et al., 2008). The limited data available to the committee indicated that women of short stature had an increased risk of emergency cesarean delivery but that this risk was not modified by GWG; they did not have an increased risk of having an SGA or LGA infant or of excessive postpartum weight retention compared to taller women (Appendix G). No information was available with which to evaluate whether a modification of guidelines might be necessary for very short (<150 cm) women. Adolescents Evidence to continue to support a modification of the GWG guidelines for adolescents (females < 20 years old) was also insufficient (Vishwanathan et al., 2008) (see Chapter 4). For adolescents < 18 years old, the WHO BMI cutoff points for overweight and obesity often do not correspond to the 85th and 95th percentiles, respectively, of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) pediatric growth charts that used to assess growth in these girls [Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/growthcharts/set2/chart%2016.pdf (accessed December 3, 2008)]. The younger the girl, the more likely it is that she will reach the 85th or 95th percentile of the growth charts at a lower BMI value than the corresponding WHO cutoff points. Thus, if the adult cutoff points are used to determine the prepregnant BMI category of younger adolescents, some of them will be categorized as being in a lighter group. As a result, the GWG recommendation would be higher than would be the case if the pediatric growth charts were used to categorize them. The committee determined that this was a tolerable risk for two reasons. First, research has shown that young teens often need to gain more than adult women to have an infant of the same size (Scholl, 2008). Second, it would be difficult to implement a recommendation in obstetric practices to use pediatric growth charts to categorize the prepregnant BMI of these girls. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-10 Women with Multiple Fetuses The evidence base for women carrying multiple fetuses remains, as it was in 1990, limited. In that report (IOM, 1990), women carrying twins were encouraged to gain 16-20.5 kg (35-45 pounds) without respect to their prepregnancy BMI category. However, recent data suggest that the weight gain of women with twins who have good outcomes varies with prepregnancy BMI (see Chapter 3) as is clearly the case for women with singleton fetuses. Unfortunately, the committee was unable to conduct the same kind of analysis for women with twins as it did for women with singletons because the necessary data are unavailable. Therefore, the committee offers provisional guidelines, which are based specifically on the work of Luke and Hediger (Appendix C) and are corroborated by the work of others (Chapter 4). Unfortunately, these data sources do not provide sufficient information to develop provisional guidelines for underweight women. The provisional guidelines are: normal weight women should gain 17-25 kg (37-54 pounds), overweight women, 14-23 kg (31-50 pounds) and obese women, 11-19 kg (25-42 pounds) at term. These provisional guidelines reflect the interquartile (25th - 75th percentiles) range among women who delivered their twins, who weighted 2,500 g on average, at 37-42 weeks of gestation. Racial/Ethnic Group The descriptive observational data cited in Chapter 4 suggested that inadequate GWG was more common in some racial/ethnic groups. However, only Dr. Stein's analysis of data from New York City in 1995-2003 and Dr. Herring's analysis of the nationally representative data from the NMIHS in 1988-1991 provided insight into whether a woman's racial or ethnic group modified the relationship between GWG and the various outcomes of interest. The predominant finding from these analyses was that racial/ethnic group did not modify the association between GWG and these outcomes. As a result the committee concluded that, although confirmatory research is needed, its recommendations should be generally applicable to the various racial or ethnic groups that make up the U.S. population. Obesity Classes II and III Although a record-high number of American women of childbearing age have BMI values in obesity classes II and III, the evidence identified and reviewed by the committee was insufficient to develop more specific recommendations for GWG among these women. Parity It has long been known that primiparous women have smaller infants than multiparous women (as reviewed in Chapter 4) and they also gain more weight. The analyses by Nohr (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Nohr [see Appendix G, Part I]). show that primiparous women must gain more weight during pregnancy than multiparous women to have equally low risk of having an SGA birth, but primiparous women are similar to multiparous women in their likelihood of retaining 5 kg at 6 months postpartum in every category of prepregnant BMI. This means that the tradeoff between lowering the risk having an SGA infant and increasing the risk of retaining an excessive amount of weight postpartum occurs at a different GWG value for primiparous and multiparous women. This is a novel finding that warrants additional study. DETERMINING OPTIMAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-11 Smokers It has also long been known that smokers have smaller infants than non-smokers. Analyses prepared by Nohr (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Nohr [see Appendix G]) show that smokers who gain more weight, as expected, have larger infants, but they also retain more weight postpartum. For example, among normal weight multiparous women, smokers would have to gain at least 16-19 kg instead of 5-9 kg to have a 10 percent risk of having an SGA infant. If they were to gain in this higher range, their risk of retaining 5 kg at 6 months postpartum would becomes over 20 percent instead of being about 5 percent. Thus, the w eight gain trade-off to prevent an SGA birth is particularly unfavorable for smokers, which is perhaps because (as reviewed in Chapter 4) at least some of the effect of smoking on birth weight is independent of GWG. As a result, additional GWG may fail to increase birth weight but, nonetheless, still increase postpartum weight retention. This unfavorable trade-off is best resolved by smoking cessation. DEVELOPMENT OF RECOMMENDED WEIGHT-GAIN RANGES Guidelines for Gestational Weight Gain As was the case for the current guidelines for GWG, the committee chose to formulate the new guidelines with a range for each category of prepregnant BMI. This range reflects the imprecision of the estimates on which these recommendations are based, the reality that good outcomes are achieved with a range of weight gains and the many additional factors that may need to be considered when making a recommendation for an individual woman. To develop these ranges (Table 7-3), the committee proceeded as follows. Based on the available published literature (Appendix E and F) as well as the reports of its consultants (Appendix G), the committee ascertained the GWG value or range of GWG values associated with lowest prevalence of the outcomes of greatest interest (namely, cesarean delivery, postpartum weight retention, preterm birth, small- or large-for gestational age birth and childhood obesity). When weighting the trade-off among these outcomes, the committee considered, within each category of prepregnant BMI (a) the incidence or prevalence of each of these outcomes, (b) whether the outcomes were permanent (e.g. neurocognitive deficits) or potentially modifiable (e.g. postpartum weight retention) and (c) the quality of the available data. The committee compared the resulting ranges with those developed in the quantitative risk analysis conducted by its consultant, Dr. Hammitt. Finally, the committee considered how its recommendations might be accepted and used by clinicians and women.The committee intends these guidelines be used in concert with good clinical judgment as well as a discussion between the woman and her prenatal care provider about diet and exercise. If a woman's GWG is not within the proposed guidelines, prenatal care providers should consider other relevant clinical evidence as well as both the adequacy and consistency of fetal growth and any available information on the nature of excess (e.g. fat or edema) or inadequate GWG before suggesting that the woman modify her pattern of weight gain. The safety of intentional weight loss during pregnancy among obese women has not been determined. Thus, priority should be given to addressing weight loss issues preconceptionally or between pregnancies, not during pregnancy. In constructing these guidelines, the committee recognized that they fall within the category of personalized medicine. Use of these guidelines will require standardized assessment procedures to inform clinical judgment as well as support of ancillary services (e.g. counseling WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-12 on nutrition and physical activity) or other interventions that might be deemed necessary to achieve them. Thus, the committee recognizes that full implementation of these guidelines may entail additional medical expenses. The committee did not attempt to estimate the magnitude of these potential additional medical expenses. TABLE 7-3 New Recommendations for Total and Rate of Weight Gain during Pregnancy, by Prepregnancy BMI Total Weight Gain Rates of Weight Gain * 2nd and 3rd Trimester Prepregnancy BMI R ange in kg Range in lbs Mean (range) in kg/week Mean (range) in 0.5-2 kg (1.1- 4.4 lbs) weig ht gain in the first trimester (based on Siega et al., 1994; Abrams et al., 1995; Carmichael et al., 1997) DETERMINING OPTIMAL WEIGHT GAIN P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-13 Rate of Weight Gain Pregnant women typically gain ~1-2 kg in the first trimester. According to the new recommended GWG values, normal weight women should gain ~0.4 kg per week in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Underweight women should gain slightly more (~0.5 kg per week) and overweight women slightly less (~0.3 kg per week) than this amount (Table 7-3). Obese women should gain about ~0.2 kg per week (Table 7-3). These guidelines were constructed based on the assumption that GWG is linear during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The IOM (1990) report made a series of recommendations about how to implement its guidelines in the context of caring for an individual patient. As they remain appropriate, the committee endorses the key elements of these recommendations. These key elements are: 1. Before conception, use consistent and reliable procedures to measure and record the woman's weight and height without shoes in the medical record. 2. Determine the woman's prepregnancy BMI. 3. Measure the woman's height without shoes and weight in light clothing at the first prenatal visit carefully by procedures that have been rigorously standardized at the site of prenatal care and use consistent, reliable procedures to measure weight at each subsequent visit. 4. Estimate the woman's gestational age from the onset of her last menstruation or from an early ultrasound examination. 5. At the initial comprehensive prenatal examination, set a weight gain goal together with the pregnant woman that is based on her prepregnant BMI and other relevant considerations, and explain to her why weight gain is important. 6. Monitor the woman's prenatal course to identify any abnormal pattern of gain that may indicate a need to intervene, displaying the results graphically for the woman (see Chapter 8, Figures 8-1 through 8-4). When abnormal gain appears to be real, rather than a result of an error in measurement or recording, try to determine the cause and then develop and implement corrective actions jointly with the woman. DISCUSSION OF THE NEW GUIDELINES These new guidelines differ from those issued in 1990 in two important ways. First, they are based on a different set of cutoff points for prepregnant BMI. Compared to the new cutoff points used in the 1990 guidelines, using the WHO guidelines reduces the proportion of the population in the underweight and obese groups, as these groups are based on more extreme BMI values, and raises the proportion of the population in the normal weight and overweight groups, as these groups are based on wider ranges of BMI values. Second, these new guidelines include a specific, relatively narrow range of recommend gain for obese women. This recommendation reflects the data available to the committee, the preponderance of which cover women in obesity class I (BMI 30.0-34.9 kg/m2) rather than obesity classes II and III. As noted in Chapter 2, in the last two decades more American women of childbearing age have prepregnant BMI values in obesity classes II and III. Unfortunately, only two studies provide data on women in these obesity classes (Kiel et al. 2007; information contributed to the committee in consultation with Nohr [see Appendix G]) and few of the women WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY P REPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-14 studied gained < 5 kg. It is possible, based on the data collected in these investigations, that weight gains < 5 kg may be associated with a more favorable trade-off among outcomes than higher gains. However, the committee's review showed insufficient evidence to recommend gains this low and thus it was concerned about the potential for doing harm that is associated with fetal growth restriction and ketonemia (see Chapters 3 and 6). Ketonemia can occur with the accelerated starvation that is characteristic of pregnancy and may be more frequent with low weight gains. The committee recognized that women in obesity classes II and III may, without intervention, gain little during pregnancy and manage their pattern of dietary intake so as to avoid ketonemia and other problems. However, there is no evidence to determine whether a guideline for very low weight gain during pregnancy among women in obesity classes II and III would be managed well enough by these women and their care providers to avoid ketonemia. Although there is ample justification for continuing to structure the new guidelines according to maternal prepregnancy BMI, this approach is not without limitations. Maternal height, for example, has long been known to be a determinant of birth weight among women with a narrower range of prepregnancy weight (40-80 kg) than commonly observed today (Tanner and Thomson, 1970). In addition, height appears to be a stronger predictor of GWG than prepregnancy BMI (Straube et al., 2008). However, the research necessary to show that height or another attribute might be a superior alternative to prepregnancy BMI for constructing guidelines for subgroups of pregnant women has not been conducted. The committee based its guidelines, in part, on the presumption that the extensive, consistent observational data that link GWG to fetal growth, as measured by SGA and LGA, as well as those that link GWG to postpartum weight retention are causal. The committee recognizes, however, that the simple model in which increased caloric intake increases maternal weight and maternal weight, in turn, increases fetal weight, is likely to be more complex\u2014and may even be incorrect. The limited results from randomized trials among undernourished women provide indications of this pathway in some cases (Susser, 1991). The results from more recent but very small randomized trials designed to control excess weight gain (see Chapter 8) provide suggestive support for this pathway. Although there are possible non-causal explanations linking GWG to fetal growth, including diet composition, affecting both GWG and fetal growth independently, or shared genetic determinants of GWG and fetal growth, none of these alternatives has been proven valid. Therefore, the committee determined that it would be prudent to consider the evidence linking inadequate GWG, especially in underweight and normal weight women, with increased risk of SGA; and the evidence linking excessive GWG, especially in overweight and obese women, with increased risk of LGA and its consequences in developing these guidelines. As additional experimental data are generated to confirm or refute a causal interpretation of the evidence linking GWG and fetal growth, this reasoning may need to be revised. In contrast, the likelihood that the link from increased caloric intake to increased GWG and, in turn, from increased GWG to increased postpartum weight retention is causal seems more certain. However, postpartum weight retention reflects not only GWG, but also maternal actions postpartum, including but not limited to changes in dietary intake and physical activity associated with new motherhood as well as breastfeeding behavior (Baker et al., 2008). It is noteworthy that these guidelines are structured as the ranges associated with good outcomes for both mother and infant. For example, women who are more concerned with postpartum weight retention than with the birth of a small baby, can choose to gain at the lower instead of the higher end of the range for their prepregnancy BMI category. DETERMINING OPTIMAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-15 As American women of childbearing age have become heavier, the trade-off between maternal and child health created by variation in GWG has become more difficult to reconcile than it was when prevention of SGA births was paramount and there was relatively low risk of excessive weight retention postpartum and childhood obesity with additional GWG. The effort made by the committee to project the short- and long-term consequences of GWG for both mothers and their children so as to reconcile the trade-offs between them is a unique feature of the process used to develop these new guidelines. For this purpose, the committee used data from the NMIHS (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Herring [see Appendix G, Part II]) to provide estimates for the probability infant mortality and data from the Danish National Birth Cohort (Nohr et al., 2008) to provide estimates for the probability of postpartum weight retention related to GWG within each category of prepregnant BMI. Dr. Hammitt linked the data on postpartum weight retention to estimates of morbidity and mortality associated with additional maternal weight. Similarly, data from the Growing Up Today Study (Oken et al., 2008) and supporting studies (see Chapter 6) were used to provide estimates of the risk of childhood obesity at ages 9-14 years related to additional GWG. The committee chose these three outcomes because they are quantitatively important and their consequences could be estimated with available data. Dr. Hammitt used the literature currently available to calculate quality adjustments for each outcome, which resulted in quality- adjusted life- years (QALY) for c omparison across outcomes (information contributed to the committee in consultation with Hammitt [see Appendix G, Part IV]). In broad terms, the results of this quantitative risk analysis by Dr. Hammitt provided support for the GWG guidelines that the committee developed from published and commissioned research. Although it was possible to develop this quantitative analysis of risk trade-offs, the data needed to support a more complete and persuasive analysis were unavailable. In particular, information is needed on associations between GWG and longer-term maternal outcomes, such as postpartum weight retention and later reproductive function and health as well as child health outcomes, such as fetal growth restriction, child neurocognitive outcomes and obesity. Such data would include not only the frequencies of outcomes but also the utilities associated with each to calculate appropriate quality adjustments. Overall, these guidelines are remarkably similar to those included in the IOM (1990) report. The research that has appeared since their publication as well as the committee's commissioned analyses support the robustness of the prior recommendations. It remains true that, within a given prepregnancy BMI category, healthy women can deliver healthy infants at a relatively wide range of weight gain values. Unfortunately, an already large and increasing proportion of the population is gaining outside of the prior recommendations (see Chapter 2) and this is also likely to be case with these new guidelines. As a result, it is time to focus attention on helping women to adhere to these guidelines. If research on adherence is conducted with experimental designs of adequate statistical power, such studies could finally provide causal evidence of gaining within these new guidelines results in superior outcomes of pregnancy for both mother and infant. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-16 FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE'S A NALYSES Findings The committee found that: 1. The WHO cutoff points have been widely adopted for categorizing BMI among non- pregnant adults and should be used for categorizing prepregnancy BMI as well; the committee also found that these categories are also acceptable to use for categorizing the prepregnancy BMI of adolescents. 2. Evidence from the scientific literature is remarkably clear that prepregnant BMI is an independent predictor of many adverse outcomes of pregnancy. As a result, women should enter pregnancy with a BMI in the normal weight category. 3. Although a record-high number of American women of childbearing age have BMI values in obesity classes II and III, available evidence is insufficient to develop more specific recommendations for GWG among these women. 4. There are only limited data available to link GWG to health outcomes of mothers and children that occur after the neonatal period. 5. There is insufficient evidence to continue to support a modification of GWG guidelines for African-American women, women of short stature or adolescents younger than 16 years of age. 6. There is insufficient data with which to establish how much more weight women carrying multiple fetuses should gain beyond that recommended for women carrying singleton fetuses. 7. The committee reaffirms the clinical recommendations in IOM (1990) for implementation of these guidelines. 8. There is insufficient evidence to reject the possibility that racial/ethnic group modifies the association between GWG and important maternal and child health outcomes. Recommendation for Action Action Recommendation 7-1: The committee recommends that federal agencies, private voluntary organizations, and medical and public health organizations adopt these new guidelines for GWG and publicize them to their members and also to women of childbearing age. Recommendation for Research Research Recommendation 7-1: To permit the development of improved recommendations for GWG in the future, the committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to (a) conduct studies to assess utilities (values) associated with short- and long-term health outcomes associated with GWG for both mother and child and (b) include these values in studies that employ decision analytic frameworks to estimate optimal GWG according to category of maternal prepregnancy BMI and other subgroups. DETERMINING OPTIMAL WEIGHT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 7-17 Additional Recommendation for Research A dditional Research Recommendation 7-1: The committee recommends that the National Institutes of Health and other relevant agencies should provide support to researchers to conduct studies among women carrying multiple fetuses that link GWG to relevant health outcomes among both mothers and their infants.

The committee also reviewed the interventions that had been conducted to improve GWG in response to the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 1990) guidelines and considered the guidance that these interventions might provide for implementation of these revised guidelines. Although proposing a complete implementation and evaluation plan is beyond the scope of the committee's work, this chapter provides a framework from which such a plan can be developed. Current Context for Childbearing and Gestational Weight Gain Women who are having children today are substantially heavier than at any time in the past (see Chapter 2). Over half of their pregnancies are unwanted or mistimed (IOM, 1995). These facts highlight the difficulties that women face in achieving one of our primary recommendations, namely that they should conceive at a weight within the normal range of BMI values. It is beyond the committee's scope of work to consider how to achieve this objective. Nonetheless, it is important for women to do so and for the government as well as private voluntary organizations to assist them. The same factors that have caused women of childbearing age to be heavier than in the past challenge them to meet the previous (IOM, 1990) as well and these new guidelines for GWG. Some of the trends that are of concern include an increase in consumption of foods with low nutrient density. This has special implications for pregnancy and lactation, which require modest increases in energy but greater increases in vitamin and mineral intake. In addition, national data (see Chapter 2) indicates that a high proportion of women of childbearing age fail to meet current guidelines for physical activity. Improvement in these statistics could contribute toward helping women enter pregnancy at a healthy weight as well as to meet the proposed guidelines for GWG. These new guidelines should also be considered in the context of data on women's reported GWG. Compared to data assembled from the studies reviewed by the committee, in which information was available for relatively large samples of women, the mean gains of underweight women are within the new guidelines (Table 8-1). This is less often the case for normal weight women, where the mean gain in some samples is at or above the upper limit of the new guidelines. This indicates that a substantial proportion of normal weight women would exceed desired GWG ranges according to the new guidelines. The mean GWG values for overweight and obese women exceed the upper end of the new guidelines by several kilograms.

These data provide a strong reason to assume that interventions will be needed to assist women, particularly those who are overweight or obese at the time of conception, in meeting the new GWG guidelines. Although the committee recognizes that developing graphical representations to assist caregivers and their clients in conveying the importance of appropriate weight gain during pregnancy is important, the type of expertise represented on the committee as well as the commitment of time and resources limited the extent to which it could develop such material into a format that could be readily disseminated. These data provide a strong reason to assume that interventions will be needed to assist women, particularly those who are overweight or obese at the time of conception, in meeting the new GWG guidelines. The review of interventions that were conducted based on Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990) (see below) provide a preview of the challenges that will be faced in implementing the new guidelines in this report. Data from observational studies have been consistent in showing an association between gaining within the IOM (1990) guidelines and having a lower risk of adverse outcomes (Carmichael et al., 1997; Abrams et al., 2000; Langford et al., 2008; Olson, 2008), This does not mean, however, that women who gain outside the guidelines will have a bad outcome (Parker and Abrams, 1992). This is because many factors other than GWG are related to the short- and long-term outcomes of pregnancy. Nonetheless, monitoring GWG is useful for identifying women who might benefit from intervention (Parker and Abrams, 1992), and some interventions have been beneficial (see below). FIGURE 8-1 Comparison of weight gain by BMI category between data reported in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), 2002-2003, and weight gain as recommended in the new guidelines. WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 8-4 REVIEW OF INTERVENTION STRATEGIES The report Nutrition During Pregnancy (IOM, 1990) made specific suggestions to improve the utility and success of its guidelines. These included providing guidance on measurement of GWG as well as on counseling of pregnant women. In particular, it was recommended that women and their care providers \"set a weight gain goal together\" early in pregnancy and that women's progress toward that goal should be monitored regularly. Two additional publications from the Committee on Nutritional Status During Pregnancy and Lactation also provided guidance on how to achieve the weight gain guidelines. Nutrition Services in Perinatal Care (IOM, 1992b) called for integrating \"basic, patient-centered, individualized nutrition care\" into the medical care of every woman beginning before conception and continuing until the end of the breastfeeding period. Nutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation: An Implementation Guide (IOM, 1992a) called for a dietary assessment of pregnant women early in gestation with a referral to a dietitian if needed. Such services are not uniformly available today and may not be covered by medical insurance plans. As noted in Chapter 7, the committee endorses these recommendations as they have only become more important as childbearing women have become heavier. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recently made similar recommendations for nutrition counseling specifically for obese women (ACOG, 2005). Only limited information is available to determine what advice women have been given about GWG since the publication of the IOM (1990) guidelines. In the two studies that have been conducted (see Chapter 4), both Cogswell et al. (1999) and Stotland et al. (2005) reported that a high proportion of women were either given no advice on how much weight to gain during pregnancy or were advised to gain outside of the recommended range for their prepregnant BMI value. These investigators called for greater effort to educate health care providers about the IOM (1990) guidelines. This issue has also been considered from the physician's perspective. Power et al. (2006) reported that the majority of the 900 obstetrician-gynecologists who responded to a mailed questionnaire used BMI to screen for obesity and counseled their patients about weight control, diet and physical activity. Taken together, these studies suggest that there is a discrepancy between what physicians say they are doing and what women say they are receiving. As a result, there is room for improvement in the process of advising women about GWG. Status of Interventions to Meet the IOM (1990) Guidelines The IOM (1990) report called for testing the recommended ranges of GWG against outcomes as well as the effectiveness of specific interventions that are used to improve weight gain. To date, only a limited number of investigators have developed interventions to help women gain within the guidelines (reviewed in Olson, 2008). Few studies are available to provide guidance on helping women gain more weight during pregnancy. In their review, Kramer and Kakuma (2003) found that advice to increase energy and protein intake was successful in achieving those goals but not in increasing GWG. Balanced energy and protein intake were associated with very small (21 g/week) increases in GWG. In contrast, high-protein supplements were not associated with an increase in GWG. Kramer and Kakuma (2003) also reviewed studies of energy/protein restriction in overweight women or those with high GWG. They found that this approach was associated with reduced weekly weight gain. The most recent studies have been focused on various ways to help women APPROACHES TO ACHIEVING RECOMMENDED GESTATIONAL WEIG HT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 8-5 to limit their weight gain during pregnancy. None of the four trials that have been conducted in North American populations was completely successful in helping women to limit GWG and adhere to the IOM (1990) guidelines. Gray-Donald et al. (2000) used a pre-post design and included 107 women in the control and 112 women in the intervention groups. This study of Cree women from Quebec showed that the subjects were obese before conception and at high risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus. They were \"offered regular, individual diet counseling, physical activity sessions and other activities related to nutrition.\" The intervention had only a \"minor impact\" on the subjects' diets and no effect on GWG, plasma glucose concentration, birth weight, the rate of cesarean delivery or postpartum weight. Olson and her coworkers (2004) also used a pre-post design in their study of normal- and overweight white women from rural community in New York. The intervention included monitoring of weight gain by health care providers and patient education by mail. Overall, there was no difference between the control ( n = 381) and intervention ( n = 179) groups in GWG or postpartum weight retention at one year. Among the low-income women in the sample, however, those in the intervention group gained less than those in the control group. Polley et al. (2002) randomized 120 normal or overweight women recruited from a hospital clinic that served low-income women to a stepped-care behavioral intervention or usual care. This intervention was successful in reducing the proportion of normal weight but not overweight women who exceeded the IOM (1990) guidelines for GWG. It did not, however, affect weight retention measured at eight weeks postpartum. In the most recent report, Asbee et al. (2009) randomized women to receive either an organized, consistent program of intensive dietary and lifestyle counseling or routine prenatal care. Among the 100 women who completed the trial, those randomized to the intervention group gained less weight during pregnancy (29 pounds) than those randomized to routine care (36 pounds), but they were not more successful in adhering to the recommended guidelines. In contrast, women in two of the three studies that have been conducted in Scandinavian populations were successful in reducing GWG. The exception was the pilot study in Finland by Kinnunen et al. (2007), in which primiparous pregnant women were recruited from six public health clinics. Most of these women had a normal prepregnant body mass index (BMI). The 49 women in the intervention group received five individual counseling sessions on diet and leisure- time physical activity; the 56 controls received usual care. Although the intervention improved various aspects of the subjects' diets, it did not prevent excessive GWG. In Sweden, Claesson et al. (2008) offered 160 pregnant women additional visits with a midwife that were designed to motivate them to change their behavior and obtain information relevant to their needs. Those who attended the program were also invited to an aqua aerobic class once or twice a week that was specially designed for obese women. The 208 obese pregnant women in the control group received usual care. Compared to the control group, women in the intervention group gained 2.6 kg less weight during pregnancy and 2.8 kg less between early pregnancy and the postnatal check-up. There were no differences between the groups in type of delivery or infant weight at birth. In Denmark, Wolff et al. (2008) randomized 50 obese pregnant women to receive 10 one- hour dietary consultations that were designed to help them restrict their GWG to 6-7 kilograms or usual care. The women in the intervention group were successful in limiting both their energy intake and their gestational weight gain compared to those in the control group. The studies in Sweden (Claesson et al., 2008) and Denmark (Wolff et al., 2008) demonstrate that it is possible to motivate obese pregnant women to limit their weight gain during pregnancy to 6-7 kilograms. Achieving this goal required a substantial investment in individual dietary or WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 8-6 motivational counseling and, in Sweden, also the provision of specially desi gned aqua aerobics classes. However, some measure of individualized attention was provided in all of the studies\u2014 but not all of them were successful. Only normal weight and/or overweight women were enrolled in three of the studies (Polley et al., 2002; Olson et al., 2004; Kinnunen et al., 2007). None of these studies was uniformly successful. Only obese women were enrolled in the other three studies (Gray et al., 2000; Claesson et al., 2008; Wolff et al., 2008); two of these were successful. The individualized attention that characterized the successful interventions would be expensive to duplicate on a wide scale. However, the significant improvement in serum insulin concentrations seen in the study of obese Danish women by Wolff and her coworkers (2008) might provide adequate justification for this expenditure. It is noteworthy that none of these trials had sufficient statistical power to establish that those whose weight gain stayed within the IOM guidelines or reached the investigators' target had better obstetric outcomes than those who did not. In contrast, there is evidence that these interventions helped some of the subjects reduce postpartum weight retention (Olson, 2004; Kinnunen et al., 2007; Claesson et al., 2008). For the first time, these new guidelines provide a specific weight-gain range for obese women. This specificity should assist researchers in developing targeted interventions to determine how best to help women to gain within this range as well as to evaluate whether those who do gain appropriately have better short- and long-term outcomes for themselves and their infants than those who do not. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES The committee worked from the perspective that the reproductive cycle begins before conception and continues through the first year postpartum. Opportunities to influence maternal weight status are available through the entire cycle. Although it is beyond the scope of this report to consider the evidence associated with timing, duration or strength of specific strategies or interventions, the committee offers a basic framework for possible approaches to the implementation guidelines, with a particular focus on consumer education and strategies to assist practitioners and public health programs. A basic goal of this framework is to help women improve the quality of their dietary intake and increase their physical activity to be able to meet these new guidelines. These behavioral changes will need to be supported by both individualized care and community-level actions to alter the physical and social environments that influence dietary behaviors. A comprehensive review of the evidence associated with such actions, and guidelines for their use, will require future analyses, as was done in the report Nutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation: An Implementation Guide (IOM, 1992). Conceiving at a Normal BMI Value To meet the recommendations of this report fully, two different challenges must be met. First, a higher proportion of American women should conceive at a weight within the range of normal BMI values. Meeting this first challenge requires preconceptional counseling and, for many women some weight loss. Such counseling may need to include additional contraceptive services (ACOG, 2005) to assist women in planning the timing of their pregnancies. Such counseling also may need to include services directed toward helping women to improve the quality of their diets (Gardiner et al., 2008) and increase their physical activity. This is because only a small proportion of women who are planning a pregnancy\u2014and even fewer of those who APPROACHES TO ACHIEVING RECOMMENDED GESTATIONAL WEIG HT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 8-7 are not planning a pregnancy but become pregnant nonetheless\u2014comply with re commendations for optimal nutrition and lifestyle (Inskip et al., 2009). Preconception counseling is an integral part of the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Johnson et al., 2006) that are designed to enable women to enter pregnancy in optimal health, avoid adverse health outcomes associated with childbearing and reduce disparities in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Practical guidelines for preconceptional care are provided in Nutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation: An Implementation Guide (IOM, 1992a). It is noteworthy that few intervention studies have evaluated ways to improve the nutritional choices of women of childbearing age (McFadden and King, 2008), so this is an area in which further investigation is necessary. There is, however, evidence that preconceptional counseling improves women's knowledge about pregnancy-related risk factors as well as their behaviors to mitigate risks (Elsinga et al., 2008). In addition, there is also evidence that pre- and interconceptional counseling will improve attitudes and behavior about nutrition and physical activity in response to a behavioral intervention (Hillemeier et al., 2008). Women with the highest BMI values may even require bariatric surgery to achieve a better weight before conception. Recent systematic reviews suggest women who undergo such surgery have better pregnancy outcomes than women who remain obese (reviewed in Maggard et al., 2008; Guelinckx et al., 2009). Gaining Weight During Pregnancy Within the New Guidelines Second, a higher proportion of American women should limit their weight gain during pregnancy to the range specified in these guidelines for their prepregnant BMI. Meeting this second challenge requires a different set of services . The first step in assisting women to gain within these guidelines is letting them know that they exist, which will require educating their healthcare providers as well as the women themselves. Government agencies, those who provide healthcare to pregnant women or those who are planning pregnancies as well as private voluntary organizations could provide this education as well as medical societies that have adopted these guidelines as their standard of care. Women who know about the guidelines and have developed a weight gain goal with their care provider may need additional assistance to achieve their goal. Individualized attention is called for in the IOM (1990) guidelines and was an element in all of the recent interventions that have been successful in helping women to gain within their target range. As noted above, however, not every intervention with individualized attention was successful, so additional services clearly are needed. The IOM report, Nutrition Services in Perinatal Care (1992b) calls for \"basic, patient-centered individualized nutritional care\" to be integrated into the primary care of every woman, beginning before conception and continuing throughout the period of breastfeeding. Guidelines on providing such care are provided in Nutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation: An Implementation Guide (IOM, 1992a). The increase in prevalence of obesity that has occurred since 1990 suggests that this recommendation has only become more important. In offering women individualized attention, a number of kinds of services could be considered. As noted in Chapter 7, health care providers should chart women's weight gain and share the results with them so that they become aware of their progress toward their weight-gain goal. To assist healthcare providers in doing this, the committee has prepared charts (see Figures 8-2 through 8-5) that could be used as a basis for this discussion with the pregnant woman and could also be included in her medical record. These charts reflect the fact that some weight gain WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 8-8 usually occurs in the first trimester and that weight gain is close to linear in the second and third trimesters (see Chapter 7 for the rates used in preparing these charts). The range around the target line in the second and third trimesters reflects the final width of the target range. In presenting these graphics, the committee emphasizes that graphical formats should be carefully and empirically tested before adoption to insure that the final product effectively communicates the intended messages to women about GWG. These charts are meant to be used as part of the assessment of the progress of pregnancy and a woman's weight gain, looking beyond the gain from one visit to the next and toward the overall pattern of weight gain. This is because the pattern of GWG, like that of total GWG, is highly variable even among women with good outcomes of pregnancy (Carmichael et al., 1997). Carmichael et al. (1997) have recommended that women should be evaluated for modifiable factors (e.g. lack of money to buy food, stress, infection, medical problems, etc.) that might be causing them to have excessively high or low gains before any corrective action is recommended; the committee endorses this approach. 02468101214161820 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 Duration of Pregnancy (wk)Weight Gain (kg) FIGURE 8-2 Recommended weight gain by week of pregnancy for underweight (BMI: < 18.5 kg/m2) women (dashed lines represent range of weight gain).

NOTE: First trimester gains were determined using three sources (Siega-Riz et al., 1994; Abrams et al., 1995; Carmichael et al., 1997). In addition, women should be provided with advice about both diet and physical activity (ACOG, 2002). This may require referral to a dietitian as well as other appropriately qualified individuals, such as those who specialize in helping women to increase their physical activity. These services may need to continue into the postpartum period to give women the maximum support to return to their prepregnant weight within the first year and, thus, to have a better chance of returning to a normal BMI value at the time of a subsequent conception. Individualized nutrition services for pregnant women can be provided by a dietitian, as recommended in Nutrition Services in Perinatal Care (IOM, 1992b). Individualized dietary advice is also available for pregnant women on the internet [see, for example, MyPyramid.gov (http://mypyramid.gov/mypyramidmoms/index.html. Accessed February 18, 2009)]. Individualized assessment of physical activity patterns and recommendations for improvement can be provided by a woman's health care provider or by trained practitioners in many health clubs and community-based exercise facilities. General advice on increasing physical activity is available on the internet [see, for example, MyPyramid.gov (http://mypyramid.gov/pyramid/physical_activity_tips.html. Accessed February 18, 2009)] as is advice specifically designed for pregnant women (http://www.acog.org/publications/patient_education/bp045.cfm. Accessed February 18, 2009). According to ACOG (2002), in the absence of either medical or obstetric complications, 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise a day on most, if not all, days of the week is recommended for pregnant women. Participation in a wide range of recreational activities appears to be safe for pregnant women, including pregnant women with diabetes (Kitzmiller et al., 2008). The recent report of the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (DHHS, 2008) also offered support for physical activity during pregnancy. Based on the limited number of studies available, this group concluded that \"unless there are medical reasons to the contrary, a pregnant woman can begin or continue a regular physical activity program throughout gestation, adjusting the frequency, intensity and time as her condition warrants.\" This committee added that \"in the APPROACHES TO ACHIEVING RECOMMENDED GESTATIONAL WEIG HT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 8-11 absence of data, it is reasonable for women during pregnancy and the postpartum period to follow the moderate-intensity recommendations set for adults unless specific medical concerns warrant a reduction in activity.\" However, it is recognized that adequately powered randomized, controlled intervention studies on the potential benefits and risks of regular physical activity at various doses in pregnant women are urgently needed. Individualized attention is likely to be necessary but not sufficient to enable most women to gain within the new guidelines. For example, pregnant or postpartum women will have difficulty following advice to increase their physical activity by walking unless there is a safe place to walk in their community. Similarly, pregnant or postpartum women will have difficulty following advice to improve the quality of their diets unless healthy foods are available at local markets at prices they can afford. Only limited information is available on the link between community factors and GWG, but it suggests characteristics of neighborhoods influence women's ability to gain weight appropriately during pregnancy (Laraia et al., 2007). The behavior changes that will be required for the majority of pregnant women to gain within the guidelines are difficult and complex. As noted in the report Promoting Health: Intervention Strategies from Social and Behavioral Sciences (IOM, 2000), \"It is unreasonable to expect that people will change their behavior easily when so many forces in the social, cultural, and physical environment conspire against such change.\" As a result, these factors must also be addressed if women are to succeed in gaining within these guidelines. For example, hospital-based obstetric programs could link to community facilities with exercise programs for pregnant or postpartum women. The family, and especially the partner, can have a strong influence on maternal behaviors during pregnancy. Yet, at present, their influence on GWG is understudied and underutilized. Further research on these kinds of multilevel, ecological determinants of GWG (see Chapter 4) is needed to guide the development of comprehensive and effective implementation strategies to achieve these guidelines. Special attention should be given to low-income and minority women, who are at risk of being overweight or obese at the time of conception, consuming diets of lower nutritional value, and of performing less recreational physical activity. The low health literacy levels that characterize this group also represent a major barrier for understanding and acting upon health recommendations (IOM, 2004). The use of culturally appropriate channels and approaches to convey this information at both the individual and population level is essential (Huff and Kline, 1999; Glanz et al., 2002). Approaches considered should range from social marketing (Siegel and Lotenberg, 2007) to improving the cultural skills of the health care providers (Haughton and George, 2008), who will convey the GWG recommendation at an individual level. The community has a particularly important role to play in fostering appropriate GWG in low-income women. CONCLUDING REMARKS Although the guidelines developed as part of this committee process are not dramatically different from those published previously (IOM, 1990), fully implementing them would represent a radical change in the care women of childbearing age. In particular, the committee recognizes that full implementation of these guidelines would mean: Offering preconceptional services, such as counseling on diet and physical activity as well as access to contraception, to all overweight or obese women to help them reach a WEIGHT GAIN DURING PREGNANCY PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 8-12 healthy weight before conceiving. This may reduce their obstetric risk and normalize infant birth weight as well as improve their long-term health. Offering services, such as counseling on diet and physical activity, to all pregnant women to help them achieve the guidelines on GWG contained in this report. This may also reduce their obstetric risk, reduce postpartum weight retention, improve their long-term health, normalize infant birth weight and offer an additional tool to help reduce childhood obesity. Offering services, such as counseling on diet and physical activity, to all postpartum women. This may help them to eliminate postpartum weight retention and, thus, to be able to conceive again at a healthy weight as well as improve their long-term health. The increase in overweight and obesity among American women of childbearing age and failure of most pregnant women to gain within the IOM (1990) guidelines alone justify this radical change in care as women clearly require assistance to achieve the recommendations in this report in the current environment. However, the reduction in future health problems among both women and their children that could possibly be achieved by meeting the guidelines in this report provide additional justification for the committee's recommendations. These new guidelines are based on observational data, which consistently show that women who gained within the IOM (1990) guidelines experienced better outcomes of pregnancy than those who did not (see Chapters 5 and 6). Nonetheless, these new guidelines require validation from experimental studies. To be useful, however, such validation through intervention studies must have adequate statistical power not only to determine if a given intervention helps women to gain within the recommended range but also to determine if doing so improves their outcomes. In the future, it will be important to reexamine the trade-offs between women and their children in pregnancy outcomes related to prepregnancy BMI as well as GWG, and also to be able to estimate the cost-effectiveness of interventions designed to help women meet these recommendations. FINDING AND RECOMMENDATIONS Finding The committee found that: 1. Existing research is inadequate to establish the characteristics of interventions that work reliably to assist women in meeting the 1990 guidelines for GWG or to avoid postpartum weight retention. Recommendations for Action Action Recommendation 8-1: The committee recommends that appropriate federal, state and local agencies as well as health care providers inform women of the importance of conceiving at a normal BMI and that all those who provide health care or related services to women of childbearing age include preconceptional counseling in their care . Action Recommendation 8-2: To assist women to gain within the guidelines, the committee recommends that those who provide prenatal care to women should offer them counseling, APPROACHES TO ACHIEVING RECOMMENDED GESTATIONAL WEIG HT GAIN PREPUBLICATION COPY: UNCORRECTED PROOFS 8-13 such as guidance on dietary intake and physical activity, that is tailored to their life circumstances. Recommendation for Research Research Recommendation 8-1: The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services provide funding for research to aid providers and communities in assisting women to meet these guidelines, especially low-income and minority women. The committee also recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services provide funding for research to examine the cost-effectiveness (in terms of maternal and offspring outcomes) of interventions designed to assist women in meeting these guidelines.
