Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Acad-emy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone is president of the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engi-neers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineer-ing programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. Wm. A. Wulf is president of the National Academy of Engineering. The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sci- ences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in theexamination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its con- gressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its owninitiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg is president of the Institute of Medicine. The National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy's purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government.Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the gov-ernment, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities.

All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlixImproving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions represents the intersection of two key developments now taking place in health care. One is the increasing attention to improving the qualityof health care in ways that take account of patients' preferences and valuesalong with scientific findings about effective care. The second importantdevelopment comes from scientific research that enables us to better under-stand and treat mental and substance-use conditions. New technologies suchas neuroimaging and genomics, for example, enable us to observe the brainin action and examine the interplay of genetic and environmental factors inmental and substance-use illnesses. These advances are potentially valuableto the more than 10 percent of the U.S. population receiving health care formental and substance-use conditions; the many millions more who need butdo not receive such care; and their families and friends, employers, teachers,and policy makers who encounter the effects of these illnesses in their per-sonal lives, in the workplace, in schools, and in society at large. This report puts forth an agenda for capitalizing on these two develop- ments. Using the quality improvement framework contained in the prede-cessor Institute of Medicine report Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century, it calls for action from clinicians, health care organizations, purchasers, health plans, quality oversight organizations,researchers, public policy makers, and others to ensure that individuals withmental and substance-use health conditions receive the care that they needto recover. Importantly, the report's recommendations are not directed solelyto clinicians and organizations that specialize in the delivery of health carefor mental and substance-use conditions. As the report notes, the link be-ForewordCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This is especially true with respect to chronicillnesses, which now are the leading cause of illness, disability, and death inthe United States. As the committee that conducted this study concluded,improving our nation's general health and the quality problems of our gen-eral health care system depends upon equally attending to the quality prob-lems in health care for mental and substance-use conditions. The committeecalls on primary care providers, other specialty health care providers, andall components of our general health care system to attend to the mental andsubstance-use health care needs of those they serve. Dealing equally with health care for mental, substance-use, and general health conditions requires a fundamental change in how we as a society andhealth care system think about and respond to these problems and illnesses.Mental and substance-use problems and illnesses should not be viewed asseparate from and unrelated to overall health and general health care. Build-ing on this integrated concept, this report offers valuable guidance on howall can help to achieve higher-quality health care for people with mental orsubstance-use problems and illnesses. To this end, the Institute of Medicinewill itself seek to incorporate attention to issues in health care for mentaland substance-use problems and illnesses into its program of general healthstudies.

The committee was pleased to be asked to address this breadth of issues. Despite the frequent co-occurrence of mentaland substance-use conditions, studies and reports that address both are un-usual, as are those that cut across both the public and private sectors. Weare grateful to our sponsors for having the vision to recognize the need forthis study. Although the committee at times found the different histories,vocabularies, and other characteristics of these groups of illnesses and deliv-ery systems challenging, we also acknowledged the unique strengths thateach brought to the study, respected each others' positions, and reachedconsensus on issues that have traditionally been characterized by great dis-harmony. Having expertise in both mental and substance-use health careand the perspectives of the public and private sectors at the table was essen-tial to the committee's efforts to craft a strategic agenda for improving thequality of health care for mental and substance-use conditions for all. Thecommittee hopes that joint mental and substance-use studies and public-private partnership initiatives will become routine. Although the focus of this study was on solving the problems of health care for mental and substance-use conditions\u2014some of which are more com-plex than those associated with general health care\u2014the committee alsorecognized its strengths .

All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlxii PREFACE tions has led the way in promoting patient-centered care (a key quality aim set forth in the Quality Chasm report) in a number of ways: through the strong voice of consumers, their families, and consumer advocacy organiza-tions in shaping mental health care; the long-standing use of peer supportprograms in facilitating recovery from substance-use illnesses; and researchon how to enable decision making in the face of cognitive impairment. More-over, the commitment and strength of the workforce delivering health carefor mental and substance-use conditions are remarkable. This workforcehas persevered in the face of limited attention to mental and substance-useillnesses by health professions schools, constrained resources at care deliv-ery sites, stigma and discrimination, and an inadequate overall infrastruc-ture to support the delivery of high-quality treatment services. This reportidentifies what it will take to build the needed infrastructure and fully sup-port the workforce in delivering quality care. This report also identifies gaps in our knowledge of how to effectively prevent and treat mental and substance-use illnesses. While science has de-veloped a strong armamentarium of effective psychosocial therapies andmedications for treating mental and substance-use problems and illnesses,research is still needed to identify how best to meet the special needs ofchildren; older adults; individuals who are members of cultural or ethnicminorities; and those with complex and co-occurring mental, substance-use,and general health care illnesses. Moreover, translational research is neededto determine how to apply existing knowledge in usual settings of care. The agenda and road map the committee has outlined for building the infrastructure needed to improve the quality of health care for mental andsubstance-use conditions is comprehensive, demanding, and critically im-portant. It is our hope that the government agencies, purchasers, healthplans, health care organizations, and other public- and private-sector lead-ers called upon to act on these recommendations will do so quickly so thatwe, our loved ones, friends, coworkers\u2014indeed all Americans\u2014can receivethe high quality care for mental and substance-use conditions that is crucialto overall good health.

These conditions are theleading cause of combined disability and death among womenand the second highest among men. Effective treatments exist and continually improve. However, as with general health care, deficiencies in care delivery preventmany from receiving appropriate treatments. That situation hasserious consequences\u2014for people who have the conditions; fortheir loved ones; for the workplace; for the education, welfare,and justice systems; and for the nation as a whole. A previous Institute of Medicine report, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century (IOM, 2001), put forth a strategy for improving health care overall\u2014a strategythat has attained considerable traction in the United States andother countries. However, health care for mental and substance-use conditions has a number of distinctive characteristics, such asthe greater use of coercion into treatment, separate care deliverysystems, a less developed quality measurement infrastructure, anda differently structured marketplace. These and other differencesraised questions about whether the Quality Chasm approach is applicable to health care for mental and substance-use conditionsand, if so, how it should be applied.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html2 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS This new report examines those differences, finds that the Quality Chasm framework can be applied to health care for mental and substance-use conditions, and describes a multifaceted andcomprehensive strategy for doing so and thereby ensuring that: Individual patient preferences, needs, and values prevail in the face of residual stigma, discrimination, and coercion intotreatment. The necessary infrastructure exists to produce scientific evi- dence more quickly and promote its application in patient care. Multiple providers' care of the same patient is coordinated. Emerging information technology related to health care ben- efits people with mental or substance-use problems and illnesses. The health care workforce has the education, training, and capacity to deliver high-quality care for mental and substance-useconditions. Government programs, employers, and other group pur- chasers of health care for mental and substance-use conditionsuse their dollars in ways that support the delivery of high-qualitycare. Research funds are used to support studies that have direct clinical and policy relevance and that are focused on discoveringand testing therapeutic advances. The strategy addresses issues pertaining to health care for both mental and substance-use conditions and the essential roleof health care for both conditions in improving overall healthand health care. In so doing, it details the actions required toachieve those ends\u2014actions required of clinicians; health careorganizations; health plans; purchasers; state, local, and federalgovernments; and all parties involved in health care for mentaland substance-use conditions. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS USE HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL OR SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Each year, more than 33 million Americans use health care services for their mental problems and illnesses 1 or conditions resulting from their use 1Whenever possible, this report uses the words \"problems\" and illnesses,\" as opposed to \"disorders,\" for reasons explained in the full report.

About 28 million Americans aged 18 or older (13 percent of this popula-tion) received mental health treatment in an inpatient or outpatient settingin 2003 2 (SAMHSA, 2004a), and more than 6 percent of American children and adolescents aged 5-17 had contact with a mental health professionalin a 12-month period according to the 1998-1999 National Health Inter-view survey (Simpson et al., 2004). The rates are higher still for adoles-cents and working-age adults: 5 million (20.6 percent) of those aged 12-17received treatment or counseling for emotional or behavioral problems in2003 (SAMHSA, 2004a), and a nearly identical proportion (20.1 percent)of those aged 18-54 received treatment for mental and/or substance-use(M/SU) 3 problems and illnesses in 2001-2003 (Kessler et al., 2005). More than 3 million (1.4 percent) of those aged 12 or older reported receivingsome kind of treatment during 2003 for a problem related to alcohol ordrug use (SAMHSA, 2004a). Millions more reported that they needed treat-ment for M/SU conditions but did not receive it (Mechanic and Bilder,2004; SAMHSA, 2004a; Wu et al., 2003). From 2001 to 2003, only 40.5percent of those aged 18-54 who met a specific definition of severe mentalillness received any treatment (Kessler et al., 2005). And, in contrast withthe more than 3 million Americans aged 12 or older who received treat-ment during 2003 for a problem related to alcohol or drug use, more thansix times that number (9.1 percent of this age group) reported abusing orbeing physiologically dependent on alcohol; illicit drugs, such as mari-juana, heroin, hallucinogens, or stimulants; prescription drugs usedfor nonmedical purposes; or a combination of these (SAMHSA, 2004a). We know these people, and we know why they contact health care providers for M/SU treatment. We do so ourselves\u2014for our own M/SUproblems and illnesses and for those of our parents, our children, ourspouses, our loved ones. We know about these conditions from other fam-ily members and from our neighbors, friends, teachers, and coworkers\u2014and from the homeless people we pass on the street. What we can see forourselves\u2014our teenager's friend battling anorexia, our friend's spouse witha drinking problem, our own family member recovering from depression,or our child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\u2014is re-flected daily in the first-person accounts of public figures about their ownM/SU illnesses and recovery. We hear of newswoman Jane Pauley's treat-ment for and recovery from bipolar illness; astronaut Buzz Aldrin's recov-ery from alcoholism and depression; former First Lady Betty Ford's recoveryfrom alcoholism; actress Drew Barrymore's recovery from depression, 2This figure does not include treatment solely for substance use. 3Throughout this report, the committee uses the acronym M/SU to refer to \"mental and/or substance use.\"Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html4 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS alcoholism, and other substance-use problems; former National Football League running back Earl Campbell's recovery from panic and anxietydisorder; \"60 Minutes\" host Mike interviewer Larry recovery from depression; country music singerCharlie Pride's recovery from bipolar illness and alcoholism; Hall of CNN Ted from bipolar illness; Nobel prize-winning mathematician andeconomist John Nash's recovery from schizophrenia; and many other suchcases. As articulated in the 1999 surgeon general's report on mental health(Anthony, 1993 cited in DHHS, 1999:98): a person with mental illness can recover even though the illness is not \"cured\". . . . [Recovery] is a way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and con- tributing life even with the limitations caused by illness. TREATMENT CAN BE EFFECTIVE M/SU problems and illnesses occur with a wide array of diagnoses and varied severity. Many people with these conditions require only a short-term intervention to help them cope successfully with a less severe M/SUproblem, such as anxiety or distress caused by loss of a loved one, loss of a job, or some other life-changing event; to help them change their unhealthybehaviors, such as heavy drinking or drug experimentation; or to preventtheir condition from worsening. People with mental illnesses\u2014such as se-vere anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, or a physiologicdependence on alcohol or some other drug\u2014require treatments of longerduration. Sometimes the illnesses become chronic, as is the case with suchdiseases as diabetes, asthma, and heart disease. Regardless of the nature oftheir conditions, what all people with M/SU problems and illnesses have incommon is the hope that when they seek help for their condition, they willreceive care that enables them either to eliminate it or to manage it success-fully so that they can live happy, productive, and satisfying lives\u2014care thatenables them to recover. Research on the interplay among genetic, environmental, biologic, and psychosocial factors in brain function and M/SU illnesses provides themeans to accomplish that goal. The results of research to date have re-vealed our lifelong ability to influence the structure and functioning of ourbrains through manipulation of environmental and behavioral factors (ourbrains' \"plasticity\") and have enabled the development of improved psy-chotherapies (\"talk\" therapies), drug therapies, and psychosocial services.Effective mental health interventions range from the use of specific medica-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Those and other mental health interventions havebeen demonstrated to be cost-effective. Similarly, advances in understanding the behavioral and social factors that lead to substance use and dependence, in identifying key neuropath-ways and chemical changes that generate the cravings characteristic ofdependence, and in developing means to block these cravings have resultedin a spectrum of evidence-based pharmacologic and psychosocial treat-ments for people who have problems with or are dependent on sub-stances\u2014treatments that produce results similar to or better than thoseobtained with treatments for other chronic illnesses (McLellan et al., 2000).New medications, such as buprenorphine, are effective in reducing opioiduse (Johnson et al., 2000) and can be prescribed routinely in physicians'offices. Naltrexone and acamprosate show efficacy in treating alcoholdependence (Kranzler and Van Kirk, 2001; O'Malley et al., 2003). Theefficacy of nonpharmacologic treatments for drug dependence\u2014such ascognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement treatment, andcontingency management\u2014has been demonstrated (Higgins and Petry,1999). Also effective are 12-step mutual-support groups, such as Alcohol-ics Anonymous, particularly as an adjunct to treatment and as a form oflong-term aftercare (Emrick et al., 1993; Tonigan et al., 2003; etal., 2003). Brief advice from a physician and office-based counseling inter-ventions can reduce the use of alcohol in problem drinkers (Fleming et al.,1997; Ockene et al., 1999). As a result of these and other advances, pa-tients who remain in treatment for use of alcohol, opioids, or cocaine areless likely to relapse or resume their harmful substance use (Gossop et al.,1999; Miller and Wilbourne, 2002; Miller et al., 2001; Prendergast et al.,2002). Overall, research is increasingly demonstrating that care for M/SUproblems and illnesses is both effective (it works) and cost-effective (it is agood value). QUALITY PROBLEMS HINDER EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND RECOVERY As in the case of general health care, despite what is known about effective care for M/SU conditions, numerous studies have documented adiscrepancy between M/SU care that is known to be effective and care thatis actually delivered. A review of studies published from 1992 through2000 assessing the quality of care for many different M/SU illnesses (in-cluding alcohol withdrawal, bipolar disorder, depression, panic disorder,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html6 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS psychosis, schizophrenia, and substance use) found that only 27 percent of the studies reported adequate rates of adherence to established clinicalpractice guidelines (Bauer, 2002). Later studies have continued to docu-ment departures from evidence-based practice guidelines for illnesses asvaried as ADHD (Rushton et al., 2004), anxiety disorders (Stein et al.,2004), comorbid mental and substance-use illnesses (Watkins et al., 2001),depression in adults (Simon et al., 2001) and children (Richardson et al.,2004), opioid dependence (D'Aunno and Pollack, 2002), and schizophre-nia (Buchanan et al., 2002). In a landmark study of the quality of a widevariety of health care received by U.S. citizens, people with alcohol depen-dence were found to receive care consistent with scientific knowledge onlyabout 10.5 percent of the time (McGlynn et al., 2003). Poor care has serious consequences for the people seeking treatment, especially the most severely ill. One review of the charts of 31 randomlyselected patients in a state psychiatric hospital detected 2,194 medicationerrors during the patients' collective 1,448 inpatient days. Of those errors,58 percent were judged to have the potential to cause severe harm (Grassoet al., 2003). The use of seclusion and restraints in inpatient mental healthfacilities is estimated to cause 150 deaths in the United States each year(SAMHSA, 2004b). Moreover, a continuing failure of the health care sys-tem in some cases to provide any treatment for M/SU illness has been documented (Kessler et al., 2005), even when people are receiving othertypes of health care and have financial and geographic access to treatment(Jaycox et al., 2003; SAMHSA, 2004a; Watkins et al., 2001). Diagnosticfailures and failures to treat can be lethal; M/SU illnesses are leading riskfactors for suicide (Maris, 2002). DEFICIENCIES IN CARE HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE NATION In addition to the personal consequences of ineffective, unsafe, or no treatment for M/SU illnesses, consequences are felt directly in the work-place; in the education, welfare, and justice systems; and in the nation'seconomy as a whole. Together, unipolar major depression and drug andalcohol use and dependence are the leading cause of death and disabilityamong American women and the second highest among men (behind heartdisease) (Michaud et al., 2001). M/SU problems and illnesses also co-occurwith a substantial number of general medical illnesses, such as heart dis-ease and cancer (Katon, 2003; Mertens et al., 2003), and adversely affectthe results of treatment for these conditions. About one-fifth of patientshospitalized for a heart attack, for example, suffer from major depression,and evidence from multiple studies makes clear that post-heart attack de-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Evidence is mounting that M/SU problems and illnesses result in a considerable burden on the workplace and cost to employers owing toabsenteeism, \"presenteeism\" (attending work with symptoms that impairperformance), days of disability, and \"critical incidents,\" such as on-the-jobaccidents (Burton et al., 2004; Goetzel et al., 2002; Kessler et al., 2001). M/SU problems and illnesses lead to poor educational achievement by children (Green and Goldwyn, 2002; Weinfield et al., 1999; Zeanah et al.,2003), which itself breeds emotional and behavioral problems. Childrenwith poor school achievement are at risk for delinquent and antisocialbehavior (Yoshikawa, 1995) and for dropping out of school and rapid,repeated adolescent pregnancies (Linares et al., 1991). M/SU problems and illnesses also shape the nation's child welfare sys- tem. Almost 48 percent of a nationally representative sample of childrenaged 2-14 who were investigated by child welfare services in 1999-2000had a clinically significant need for mental health care (Burns et al., 2004).Because of limitations of insurance for mental health care, some familiesresort to placing their severely mentally ill children in the child welfaresystem, even though the children are not neglected or abused, to securemental health services otherwise unavailable (GAO, 2003); parents whotake this step must sometimes give up custody of their children (Gilibertiand Schulzinger, 2000). Similarly, children who are not guilty of any offense are often placed in local juvenile justice systems or incarcerated for the same purpose. TheU.S. Government Accountability Office counted about 9,000 children whoentered state and local juvenile justice systems under those circumstancesin 2001 but estimated that the number of such children was likely to behigher (GAO, 2003). The emotional toll on the children is high. Some 48percent of facilities that hold youths awaiting community mental healthservices report suicide attempts among them (U.S. House of Representa-tives, 2004). The proportion of adult U.S. residents incarcerated has been increasing annually\u2014from a rate of 601 persons in custody per 100,000 U.S. resi-dents in 1995 to 715 per 100,000 in 2003. In the middle of 2003, thenation's prisons and jails held 2,078,570 persons\u2014one in every 140 resi-dents (Harrison and Karberg, 2004). The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statisticsestimates that about 16 percent of all persons in jails and prisons reporteither having a mental disorder or staying overnight in a psychiatric facility(Mumola, 1999). Overall, the costs of providing no or ineffective treat-ment\u2014as well as the costs of treatment\u2014impose a sizable burden on thenation.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The quality problems of overall health care received substantial attention among the health care community and the public atlarge as a result of two previous Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports: To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (IOM, 2000) and Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century (IOM, 2001). The Quality Chasm report also garnered consensus around a frame- work and strategies for achieving substantial improvements in quality. Theframework identifies six aims for high-quality health care (see Box S-1)and 10 rules for redesigning the nation's health care system (see Box S-2). Crossing the Quality Chasm 's framework and recommendations have attracted the attention of many health care leaders, including those address-ing health care for mental and substance-use conditions. As a result, theAnnie E. Casey Foundation, the CIGNA Foundation, the National Instituteon Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute on Drug Abuse,The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Substance Abuse and MentalHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA) in the U.S. Department of BOX S-1 The Six Aims of High-Quality Health Care Safe \u2014avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them.

All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUMMARY 9 BOX S-2 The Quality Chasm's Ten Rules to Guide the Redesign of Health Care 1. Care based on continuous healing relationships. Patients should receive care whenever they need it and in many forms, not just face-to-face visits. Thisrule implies that the health care system should be responsive at all times (24 hours a day, every day) and that access to care should be provided over the Internet, by telephone, and by other means in addition to face-to-face visits. 2. Customization based on patient needs and values. The system of care should be designed to meet the most common types of needs but have the capa-bility to respond to individual patient choices and preferences. 3. The patient as the source of control. Patients should be given the neces- sary information and the opportunity to exercise the degree of control they choose over health care decisions that affect them. The health system should be able to accommodate differences in patient preferences and encourage shared decisionmaking. 4. Shared knowledge and the free flow of information. Patients should have unfettered access to their own medical information and to clinical knowledge. Cli- nicians and patients should communicate effectively and share information. 5. Evidence-based decision making. Patients should receive care based on the best available scientific knowledge. Care should not vary illogically from clini- cian to clinician or from place to place. 6. Safety as a system property. Patients should be safe from injury caused by the care system. Reducing risk and ensuring safety require greater attention tosystems that help prevent and mitigate errors. 7. The need for transparency. The health care system should make informa- tion available to patients and their families that allows them to make informed decisions when selecting a health plan, hospital, or clinical practice, or choosing among alternative treatments. This should include information describing the sys-tem's performance on safety, evidence-based practice, and patient satisfaction. 8. Anticipation of needs. The health system should anticipate patient needs, rather than simply reacting to events. 9. Continuous decrease in waste. The health system should not waste re- sources or patient time. 10. Cooperation among clinicians. Clinicians and institutions should actively collaborate and communicate to ensure an appropriate exchange of information and coordination of care.

The IOM is to explore the implications of that conclusion for the field of mental healthand addictive disorders, and identify the barriers and facilitators to achiev- ing significant improvements along all six of these dimensions. The com- mittee will examine both environmental factors such as payment, benefitscoverage and regulatory issues, as well as health care organization and delivery issues. Based on a review of the evidence, the committee will develop an \"agenda for change.\" To respond to this charge, IOM convened the Committee on Crossing the Quality Chasm: Adaptation to Mental Health and Addictive Disorders.This report presents the committee's analysis of the issues and of how thedistinctive features of M/SU health care should be addressed in qualityimprovement initiatives. THE QUALITY CHASM STRATEGY IS APPLICABLE TO HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Despite the quality problems shared with health care generally, M/SU health care is distinctive in significant ways. Those distinctive features in-clude the greater stigma attached to M/SU diagnoses; more frequent coer-cion of patients into treatment, especially for substance-use problems andconditions; a less developed infrastructure for measuring and improvingthe quality of care; the need for a greater number of linkages among themultiple clinicians, organizations, and systems providing care to patientswith M/SU conditions; less widespread use of information technology; amore educationally diverse workforce; and a differently structured market-place for the purchase of M/SU health care. Despite these and other differences, the committee found that M/SU health care and general health care share many characteristics. Moreover,evidence of a link between M/SU illnesses and general health (and healthcare) is very strong, especially with respect to chronic illnesses and injury(Katon, 2003; Kroenke, 2003). The committee concludes that improvingthe nation's general health and resolving the quality problems of the over- all health care system will require attending equally to the quality problemsof M/SU health care. Accordingly, the committee offers two overarchingrecommendations.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUMMARY 11 Overarching Recommendation 1. Health care for general, mental, and substance-use problems and illnesses must be delivered with an under-standing of the inherent interactions between the mind/brain and therest of the body. With respect to the quality of M/SU health care, the committee's analy- sis shows that the recommendations set forth in Crossing the Quality Chasm for the redesign of health care are as applicable to M/SU as to general health care. Because of its distinctive features, however, the appli-cation of those aims, rules, and redesign strategies to M/SU health caremust be specially tailored. Overarching Recommendation 2. The aims, rules, and strategies for redesign set forth in Crossing the Quality Chasm should be applied throughout M/SU health care on a day-to-day operational basis, buttailored to reflect the characteristics that distinguish care for theseproblems and illnesses from general health care. To implement this overarching recommendation and achieve success in quality improvement, the committee proposes that the agenda for changeembodied in recommendations 3.1 through 9.2 below be undertaken byclinicians; organizations; health plans; purchasers; state, local, and federalgovernments; and all other parties involved in M/SU health care. Foremost, consumers of health care for M/SU conditions face a num- ber of obstacles to patient-centered care that generally are not encounteredby consumers of general health care. As mentioned above, the shame,stigma, and discrimination still experienced by some consumers of M/SUservices can prevent them from seeking care (Peter D. Hart Research Asso-ciates Inc., 1998; SAMHSA, 2004a) and inappropriately nourish doubtsabout their competence to make decisions on their own behalf (Bergeson,2004; Leibfried, 2004; Markowitz, 1998; Wright et al., 2000). Moreover,insurance coverage for M/SU treatment is more limited than that for gen-eral health care, so it is more difficult to obtain and continue the careneeded. Finally, more M/SU than general health care patients are coercedinto treatment and subject to questions about whether they should be al-lowed to make decisions about their care. To address those issues, thecommittee makes two recommendations: 4 Recommendation 3-1. To promote patient-centered care, all partiesinvolved in health care for mental or substance-use conditions should 4The committee's recommendations for improving the quality of M/SU health care are numbered according to the chapter of the main report in which they appear; for example, recommendation 3-1 is the first recommendation in Chapter 3.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Clinicians and organizations providing M/SU treatment services should:-Incorporate informed, patient-centered decision making throughout their practices, including active patient participa-tion in the design and revision of patient treatment and recov-ery plans, the use of psychiatric advance directives, and (forchildren) informed family decision making. To ensure informeddecision making, information on the availability and effective-ness of M/SU treatment options should be provided. -Adopt recovery-oriented and illness self-management practices that support patient preferences for treatment (including medications),peer support, and other elements of the wellness recovery plan. -Maintain effective, formal linkages with community resources to support patient illness self-management and recovery. Organizations providing M/SU treatment should also: -Have in place policies that implement informed, patient- centered participation and decision making in treatment, ill-ness self-management, and recovery plans. -Involve patients and their families in the design, administra- tion, and delivery of treatment and recovery services. Accrediting bodies should adopt accreditation standards that re- quire the implementation of these practices. Health plans and direct payers of M/SU treatment services should: -For persons with chronic mental illnesses or substance-use de- pendence, pay for peer support and illness self-managementprograms that meet evidence-based standards. -Provide consumers with comparative information on the quality of care provided by practitioners and organizations, and use thisinformation themselves when making their purchasing decisions. -Remove barriers to and restrictions on effective and appropri- ate treatment that may be created by copayments, service ex-clusions, benefit limits, and other coverage policies. Recommendation 3-2. Coercion should be avoided whenever possible. When coercion is legally authorized, patient-centered care is still appli-cable and should be undertaken by: Making the policies and practices used for determining danger- ousness and decision-making capacity transparent to patients andtheir caregivers.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUMMARY 13 Obtaining the best available comparative information on safety, effectiveness, and availability of care and providers, and usingthat information to guide treatment decisions. Maximizing patient decision making and involvement in the se- lection of treatments and providers. The infrastructure needed to measure, analyze, publicly report, and im- prove the quality of M/SU health care is less well developed than that forgeneral health care. As a result, there has been less measurement and im-provement of M/SU health care than of general health care (AHRQ, 2003;Garnick et al., 2002). A related issue is that methods used to disseminateevidence-based practice to providers have not always been evidence-basedthemselves. To build a stronger infrastructure to support the delivery ofhigh-quality care, the committee recommends a five-part strategy: (1) morecoordination in filling gaps in the evidence base; (2) a stronger, more coordi-nated, and evidence-based approach to disseminating evidence to clinicians;(3) improved diagnosis and assessment strategies; (4) a stronger infrastruc-ture for measuring and reporting the quality of M/SU health care; and (5)support for quality improvement practices at the sites of M/SU health care. Recommendation 4-1. To better build and disseminate the evidence base, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) shouldstrengthen, coordinate, and consolidate the synthesis and dissemina-tion of evidence on effective M/SU treatments and services by theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; the Na-tional Institute of Mental Health; the National Institute on Drug Abuse;the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; the NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development; the Agency forHealthcare Research and Quality; the Department of Justice; the De-partment of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Defense; the Depart-ment of Education; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; theCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services; the and Families; states; professional associations; andother private-sector entities. To implement this recommendation, DHHS should charge or create one or more entities to: Describe and categorize available M/SU preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions (including screening, diagnostic, andsymptom-monitoring tools), and develop individual procedurecodes and definitions for these interventions and tools for theiruse in administrative datasets approved under the Health Insur-ance Portability and Accountability Act.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html14 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Assemble the scientific evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions, including their use in varied age and ethnicgroups; use a well-established approach to rate the strength ofthis evidence, and categorize the interventions accordingly; andrecommend or endorse guidelines for the use of the evidence-based interventions for specific M/SU problems and illnesses. Substantially expand efforts to attain widespread adoption of evidence-based practices through the use of evidence-based ap-proaches to knowledge dissemination and uptake. Dissemina-tion strategies should always include entities that are commonlyviewed as knowledge experts by general health care providersand makers of public policy, including the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, the Agency for Healthcare Researchand Quality, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,the Office of Minority Health, and professional associations andhealth care organizations. Recommendation 4-2. Clinicians and organizations providing M/SU services should: Increase their use of valid and reliable patient questionnaires or other patient-assessment instruments that are feasible for routineuse to assess the progress and outcomes of treatment systemati-cally and reliably. Use measures of the processes and outcomes of care to continu- ously improve the quality of the care provided. Recommendation 4-3. To measure quality better, DHHS, in partner- ship with the private sector, should charge and financially support anentity similar to the National Quality Forum to convene governmentregulators, accrediting organizations, consumer representatives, pro-viders, and purchasers exercising leadership in quality-based purchas-ing for the purpose of reaching consensus on and implementing a com-mon, continuously improving set of M/SU health care quality measuresfor providers, organizations, and systems of care. Participants in thisconsortium should commit to: Requiring the reporting and submission of the quality measures to a performance measure repository or repositories. Requiring validation of the measures for accuracy and adherence to specifications. Ensuring the analysis and display of measurement results in for- mats understandable by multiple audiences, including consumers,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Establishing models for the use of the measures for benchmarking and quality improvement purposes at sites of care delivery. Performing continuing review of the measures' effectiveness in improving care. Recommendation 4-4. To increase quality improvement capacity, DHHS, in collaboration with other government agencies, states, phil-anthropic organizations, and professional associations, should createor charge one or more entities as national or regional resources to test,disseminate knowledge about, and provide technical assistance andleadership on quality improvement practices for M/SU health care inpublic- and private-sector settings. Recommendation 4-5. Public and private sponsors of research on M/SU and general health care should include the following in theirresearch funding priorities: Development of reliable screening, diagnostic, and monitoring instruments that can validly assess response to treatment and thatare practicable for routine use. These instruments should includea set of M/SU \"vital signs\": a brief set of indicators\u2014measurableat the patient level and suitable for screening and early identifica-tion of problems and illnesses and for repeated administrationduring and following treatment\u2014to monitor symptoms and func-tional status. The indicators should be accompanied by a speci-fied standardized approach for routine collection and reporting aspart of regular health care. Instruments should be age- and culture-appropriate. Refinement and improvement of these instruments, procedures for categorizing M/SU interventions, and methods for providingpublic information on the effectiveness of those interventions. Development of strategies to reduce the administrative burden of quality monitoring systems and to increase their effectiveness inimproving quality. In numerous and complex ways, M/SU care is separated both structur- ally and functionally from other components of the health care system.Not only is M/SU care separated from general health care, but health careservices for mental and substance-use conditions are separated from eachother despite these conditions' high rate of co-occurrence. In addition,people with severe M/SU illnesses often must receive care from separateCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html16 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS public programs. These disconnected care-delivery arrangements require multiple provider \"handoffs\" of patients for different services and the trans-mission of information to and joint planning by all these providers, organi-zations, and agencies if coordination is to occur. The situation is exacer-bated by special legal and organizational prohibitions on sharing M/SUinformation. To address this situation, the committee makes the followingrecommendations: Recommendation 5-1. To make collaboration and coordination of pa- tients' M/SU health care services the norm, providers of the servicesshould establish clinically effective linkages within their own organiza-tions and between providers of mental health and substance-use treat-ment. The necessary communications and interactions should take placewith the patient's knowledge and consent and be fostered by: Routine sharing of information on patients' problems and phar- macologic and nonpharmacologic treatments among providers ofM/SU treatment. Valid, age-appropriate screening of patients for comorbid mental, substance-use, and general medical problems in these clinical set-tings and reliable monitoring of their progress. Recommendation 5-2. To facilitate the delivery of coordinated care by primary care, mental health, and substance-use treatment providers,government agencies, purchasers, health plans, and accreditation orga-nizations should implement policies and incentives to continually in-crease collaboration among these providers to achieve evidence-basedscreening and care of their patients with general, mental, and/orsubstance-use health conditions. The following specific measures shouldbe undertaken to carry out this recommendation: Primary care and specialty M/SU health care providers should transition along a continuum of evidence-based coordinationmodels from (1) formal agreements among mental, substance-use,and primary health care providers; to (2) case management ofmental, substance-use, and primary health care; to (3) collocationof mental, substance-use, and primary health care services; andthen to (4) delivery of mental, substance-use, and primary healthcare through clinically integrated practices of primary and M/SUcare providers. Organizations should adopt models to which theycan most easily transition from their current structure, that bestmeet the needs of their patient populations, and that ensureaccountability.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUMMARY 17 DHHS should fund demonstration programs to offer incentives for the transition of multiple primary care and M/SU practicesalong this continuum of coordination models. Purchasers should modify policies and practices that preclude paying for evidence-based screening, treatment, and coordinationof M/SU care and require (with patients' knowledge and consent)all health care organizations with which they contract to ensureappropriate sharing of clinical information essential for coordina-tion of care with other providers treating their patients. Organizations that accredit mental, substance-use, or primary health care organizations should use accrediting practices thatassess, for all providers, the use of evidence-based approaches tocoordinating mental, substance-use, and primary health care. Federal and state governments should revise laws, regulations, and administrative practices that create inappropriate barriers tothe communication of information between providers of healthcare for mental and substance-use conditions and between thoseproviders and providers of general care. Recommendation 5-3. To ensure the health of persons for whom they are responsible, M/SU providers should: Coordinate their services with those of other human services and education agencies, such as schools, housing and vocational reha-bilitation agencies, and providers of services for older adults. Establish referral arrangements for needed services. Providers of services to high-risk populations\u2014such as child welfare agencies, criminal and juvenile justice agencies, and long-term carefacilities for older adults\u2014should use valid, age-appropriate, and cul-turally appropriate techniques to screen all entrants into their systemsto detect M/SU problems and illnesses. Recommendation 5-4. To provide leadership in coordination, DHHS should create a high-level, continuing entity reporting directly to thesecretary to improve collaboration and coordination across its mental,substance-use, and general health care agencies, including the Sub-stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; the Agencyfor Healthcare Research and Quality; the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention; and the Administration for Children, Youth, and Fami-lies. DHHS also should implement performance measures to monitorits progress toward achieving internal interagency collaboration andpublicly report its performance on these measures annually. State gov-ernments should create analogous linkages across state agencies.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html18 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Health care providers' ability to obtain information on a patient's health, health care, and potential treatments quickly and to share this in-formation in a timely manner with other providers caring for the patient isessential to effective and coordinated care. To that end, major public- andprivate-sector collaborations are under way to develop the essential com-ponents of a National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII). How-ever, M/SU health care currently is not well addressed by NHII initiatives,nor are NHII initiatives well incorporated into other public-sector infor-mation technology efforts for M/SU health care. M/SU health care also lagsbehind general health care in its use of information technology. To realizethe potential of the NHII for consumers of M/SU health care, the commit-tee makes the following recommendations: Recommendation 6-1. To realize the benefits of the emerging National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) for consumers of M/SUhealth care services, the secretaries of DHHS and the Department ofVeterans Affairs should charge the Office of the National Coordinatorof Health Information Technology and the Substance Abuse and Men-tal Health Services Administration to jointly develop and implement aplan for ensuring that the various components of the emerging NHII\u2014including data and privacy standards, electronic health records, andcommunity and regional health networks\u2014address M/SU health careas fully as general health care. As part of this strategy: DHHS should create and support a continuing mechanism to engage M/SU health care stakeholders in the public and privatesectors in developing consensus-based recommendations for thedata elements, standards, and processes needed to address uniqueaspects of information management related to M/SU health care.These recommendations should be provided to the appropriatestandards-setting entities and initiatives working with the Officeof the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology. Federal grants and contracts for the development of components of the NHII should require and use as a criterion for makingawards the involvement and inclusion of M/SU health care. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration should increase its work with public and private stakeholders tosupport the building of information infrastructure components thataddress M/SU health care and coordinate these information initia-tives with the NHII. Policies and information technology infrastructure should be used to create linkages (consistent with all privacy requirements) amongpatient records and other data sources pertaining to M/SU ser-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Recommendation 6-2. Public- and private-sector individuals, including organizational leaders in M/SU health care, should become involved in,and provide for staff involvement in, major national committees andinitiatives working to set health care data and information technologystandards to ensure that the unique needs of M/SU health care aredesigned into these initiatives at their earliest stages. Recommendation 6-3. National associations of purchasers\u2014such as the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors,the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors,the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, the NationalAssociation of County Behavioral Health Directors, the AmericanManaged Behavioral Healthcare Association, and the national BlueCross and Blue Shield Association\u2014should decrease the burden of vari-able reporting and billing requirements by standardizing requirementsat the national, state, and local levels. Recommendation 6-4. Federal and state governments, public- and private-sector purchasers of M/SU health care, and private foundationsshould encourage the widespread adoption of electronic health records,computer-based clinical decision-support systems, computerized pro-vider order entry, and other forms of information technology for M/SUcare by: Offering financial incentives to individual M/SU clinicians and organizations for investments in information technology neededto participate fully in the emerging NHII. Providing capital and other incentives for the development of virtual networks to give individual and small-group providersstandard access to software, clinical and population data andhealth records, and billing and clinical decision-support systems. Providing financial support for continuing technical assistance, training, and information technology maintenance. Including in purchasing decisions an assessment of the use of information technology by clinicians and health care organiza-tions for clinical decision support, electronic health records, andother quality improvement applications. A much greater variety of providers is licensed to diagnose and treat M/SU illnesses than is the case for general medical conditions. Physicians,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html20 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS certain advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants are generally licensed to diagnose and treat general health conditions. By contrast, clini-cians licensed to diagnose and treat M/SU conditions include psychologists,psychiatrists, other specialty or primary care physicians, social workers,psychiatric nurses, marriage and family therapists, addiction therapists,and a variety of counselors (such as school counselors, pastoral counselors,guidance counselors, and drug and alcohol counselors). These various typesof clinicians are likely to have differing education, training, and therapeu-tic approaches. As a result, the M/SU workforce is not uniformly equippedwith respect to the knowledge and skills needed to provide high-qualityservices. This situation is compounded by other deficiencies in educationthat exist across all types of clinicians, as well as long-standing problems inachieving cultural diversity in the workforce and an adequate supply ofclinicians for all geographic areas. These problems have persisted despiterecurring, short-lived initiatives to address them. The committee recom-mends a long-term, sustained commitment to developing the M/SU work-force by following a model that provides sustained attention to the nation'sphysician and nursing workforce. Recommendation 7-1. To ensure sustained attention to the develop- ment of a stronger M/SU health care workforce, Congress should au-thorize and appropriate funds to create and maintain a Council on theMental and Substance-Use Health Care Workforce as a public-privatepartnership. Recognizing that the quality of M/SU services is depen-dent upon a highly competent professional workforce, the councilshould develop and implement a comprehensive plan for strengtheningthe quality and capacity of the workforce to improve the quality ofM/SU services substantially by: Identifying the specific clinical competencies that all M/SU pro- fessionals must possess to be licensed or certified and the compe-tencies that must be maintained over time. Developing national standards for the credentialing and licensure of M/SU providers to eliminate differences in the standards nowused by the states. Such standards should be based on core com-petencies and should be included in curriculums and educationprograms across all the M/SU disciplines. Proposing programs to be funded by government and the private sector to address and resolve such long-standing M/SU workforceissues as diversity, cultural relevance, faculty development, andcontinuing shortages of the well-trained clinicians and consumerproviders needed to work with children and the elderly; and pro-grams for training competent clinician administrators.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUMMARY 21 Providing a continuing assessment of M/SU workforce trends, issues, and financing policies. Measuring the extent to which the plan's objectives have been met and reporting annually to the nation on the status of theM/SU workforce. Soliciting technical assistance from public-private partnerships to facilitate the work of the council and the efforts of educationaland accreditation bodies to implement its recommendations. Recommendation 7-2. Licensing boards, accrediting bodies, and pur- chasers should incorporate the competencies and national standardsestablished by the Council on the Mental and Substance-Use HealthCare Workforce in discharging their regulatory and contracting re-sponsibilities. Recommendation 7-3. The federal government should support the de- velopment of M/SU faculty leaders in health professions schools, suchas schools of nursing and medicine, and in schools and programs thateducate M/SU professionals, such as psychologists and social workers.The aim should be to narrow the gaps among what is known throughresearch, what is taught, and what is done by those who provide M/SUservices. Recommendation 7-4. To facilitate the development and implementa- tion of core competencies across all M/SU disciplines, institutions ofhigher education should place much greater emphasis on interdiscipli-nary didactic and experiential learning and should bring together fac-ulty and trainees from their various education programs. The ease with which several of the above recommendations can be carried out depends on how accommodating the marketplace is to theirimplementation. The M/SU health care marketplace is distinguished fromthe general health care marketplace in several ways, including the domi-nance of government (state and local) purchasers, the frequent purchase ofinsurance for M/SU health care separately from that for other health care(the use of \"carve-out\" arrangements), the tendency of the private insur-ance marketplace to avoid covering or to offer more limited coverage topersons with M/SU illnesses, and government purchasers' greater use ofdirect provision and purchase of care rather than insurance arrangements.Attending to those differences is essential if the marketplace is to promotequality improvement in M/SU health care. The committee recommendsfour ways of strengthening the marketplace to that end.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Health care purchasers that offer enrollees a choice of health plans should evaluate and select one or more availabletools for use in reducing selection-related incentives to limit the cover-age and quality of M/SU health care. Risk adjustment, payer \"carve-outs,\" risk-sharing or mixed-payment contracts, and benefit stan-dardization across the health plans offered can partially addressselection-related incentives. Congress and state legislatures should im-prove coverage by enacting a form of benefit standardization known asparity for coverage of M/SU treatment. Recommendation 8-2. State government procurement processes should be reoriented so that the greatest weight is given to the quality of careto be provided by vendors. Recommendation 8-3. Government and private purchasers should use M/SU health care quality measures (including measures of the coordi-nation of health care for mental, substance-use, and general healthconditions) in procurement and accountability processes. Recommendation 8-4. State and local governments should reduce the emphasis on the grant-based systems of financing that currentlydominate public M/SU treatment systems and should increase theuse of funding mechanisms that link some funds to measures ofquality. Finally, despite how much is known about ways to improve the quality of M/SU health care, knowledge gaps remain. In particular, there has beenmuch less research to identify how to make treatments effective when givenin usual settings of care and in the presence of common confounding prob-lems (such as comorbid conditions and social stressors) than research todetermine the efficacy of specific treatments under rigorously controlledconditions. In addition, there are many gaps in knowledge about effectivetreatment, especially for children and adolescents, and there is a paucity ofinformation about the most effective ways to ensure the consistent applica-tion of research findings in routine clinical practice. To fill these knowl-edge gaps, the committee recommends the formulation of a coordinatedresearch agenda for quality improvement in M/SU health care and the useof more-diverse research approaches. Recommendation 9-1. The secretary of DHHS should provide leader- ship, strategic development support, and additional funding for researchand demonstrations aimed at improving the quality of M/SU health care.This initiative should coordinate the existing quality improvement re-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Together, mental and substance-use illnesses are theleading cause of combined death and disability for women of allages and for men aged 15-44, and the second highest for all men.When appropriately treated, individuals with these conditionscan recover and lead satisfying and productive lives. Conversely,when treatment is not provided or is of poor quality, these conditionscan have serious consequences for individuals, their loved ones,their workplaces, and the nation as a whole. 1In this report, whenever possible, we use the phrasing \"substance-use problems and ill- nesses\" rather than the terms \"addiction\" or substance \"abuse.\" We do not use the term \"addiction\" because some consider it pejorative; because it is not a formal diagnostic term;and because many of the conditions, problems, and policies discussed in this report pertain to people with much less severe alcohol and other drug-use conditions. We chose not to use the term substance \"abuse,\" both because it is diagnostically imprecise in the context of thisreport and because outside of strict diagnostic nomenclature, it too can be considered pejora- tive. We instead use the phrases \"substance-use illnesses \" when discussing the diagnostic family of alcohol and other drug-use illnesses and \"substance-use problems \" when discussing the problems associated with the unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs. Nonetheless, these words appear in some places in the report because they are used so often in the literature, and it is not always possible to interpret the meaning of the word \"abuse.\"Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html30 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Although science continues to advance our knowledge about the etiology of mental and substance-use problems and illnessesand how to treat them effectively, health care for these conditions\u2014like general health care\u2014frequently is not delivered in ways thatare consistent with science, ways that enable improvement andrecovery. Moreover, care is sometimes unsafe; more often, it isnot delivered at all. This gap between what can and should beand what exists is so large that, as with general health care, itconstitutes a \"chasm\" as defined in the 2001 Institute of Medicinereport, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century. Using that report as its template, this report puts forth an agenda for improving the quality of health care formental and substance-use conditions. MORE THAN 33 MILLION AMERICANS ANNUALLY RECEIVE CARE Each year more than 33 million Americans use mental health services or services to treat their problems and illnesses 2 resulting from alcohol, inappropriate use of prescription medications, or illegal drugs. Approxi-mately 28 million Americans aged 18 or older (13 percent of this popu-lation) received mental health treatment in an inpatient or outpatient set-ting in 2003 3 (SAMHSA, 2004a), and more than 6 percent of American children and adolescents aged 5-17 had contact with a mental health pro-fessional in a 2-month period according to the 1998-1999 National HealthInterview Survey (Simpson et al., 2004). The rates are higher still for ado-lescents: 20.6 percent of those aged 12-17 (5 million youths) receivedtreatment or counseling for emotional or behavioral problems in 2003(SAMHSA, 2004a); in addition, more than 3 million Americans aged 12 orolder (1.4 percent of this group) reported receiving some kind of treatmentduring 2003 for a problem related to alcohol or other drug use (SAMHSA, 2Whenever possible, this report uses the words \"problems\" and \"illnesses\" (as opposed to \"disorders\") because \"disorder,\" as defined in the American Psychiatric Association's Diag- nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), refers to \"a clinically sig- nificant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of sufferingdeath, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom\" (emphasis added) (American Psychi- atric Association, 2000:xxxi). The committee's use of the word \"problem\" acknowledges that not everyone with a need for mental health care has such significant impairment that itqualifies as a \"disorder.\" Nonetheless, the word \"disorder\" appears often in this report be- cause it is used so frequently in the literature. 3This figure does not include treatment solely for substance use.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlTHE QUALITY CHASM IN MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE HEALTH CARE 31 2004a). Combining mental and substance-use problems and illnesses, more than 20 percent of U.S. adults aged 18-54 received care for these conditionsduring a 12-month period between 2001 and 2003 (Kessler et al., 2005).Millions more reported that they needed treatment for their mental and/orsubstance-use (M/SU) 4 problems or illnesses but did not receive it (Mechanic and Bilder, 2004; SAMHSA, 2004a; Wu et al., 2003). Fewerthan half of adults aged 18-54 who met a definition of severe mental illnessreceived treatment for the condition during a 12-month period between2001 and 2003 (Kessler et al., 2005). And in contrast to the more than 3million Americans aged 12 or older who received treatment during 2003for a problem related to alcohol or other drug use, more than six times thatnumber (approximately 21.6 million, or 9.1 percent of this age group)reported abusing or being physiologically dependent upon alcohol; illicitdrugs such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, or stimulants;prescription drugs used for nonmedical purposes; or a combination of these(SAMHSA, 2004a). Many individuals using services to address their mental or substance- use problems require only a short-term intervention to address their condi-tion (Bernstein et al., 2005; Fleming et al., 1997; Ockene et al., 1999). Theymay be experiencing, for example, anxiety or other distress over the loss ofa loved one or a job or some other life-changing event. They may beengaging in occasional heavy drinking or be teenagers experimenting withdrugs. These and other less severe problems that many individuals encoun-ter at some point in their lives are not considered mental illnesses or drugdependence but are occasions during which an individual might need assis-tance to cope with a stressful situation, change unhealthy behaviors, andprevent the condition from worsening. Mental illnesses and substance de-pendence, in contrast, involve significantly more distress, disability, chro-nicity, and physical risk and interfere with performing routine activitiessuch as working, attending school, or participating fully in relationships. Individuals with M/SU problems and illnesses represent a wide range of diagnoses, severity of illness, and disability. What they all have in common,however, is the hope that when they seek help for their condition, they willreceive care that is safe, effective, and of good overall quality. They expectthat such care will enable them either to recover completely from an acutemental or substance-use illness or manage the illness successfully so theycan live happy, productive, and satisfying lives. As articulated in the 1999Surgeon General's report on mental health (Anthony, 1993 as cited inDHHS, 1999:98): 4Throughout this report we use the acronym M/SU to refer to \"mental and/or substance use.\"Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html32 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS . . . a person with mental illness can recover even though the illness is not \"cured\". . . . [Recovery] is a way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and con- tributing life even with the limitations caused by illness. Although a conceptual model of recovery from chronic M/SU illnesses is not yet fully developed (Onken et al., 2004), recovery as articulated in theSurgeon General's report has been an accepted concept in use for over acentury for individuals with alcohol-use problems and illnesses (White,1998). More recently, recovery has become a widely accepted goal not justof mental health care (NAMI, 2005; New Freedom Commission on MentalHealth, 2003), but of treatment for all individuals with M/SU problems andillnesses. CONTINUING ADVANCES IN CARE AND TREATMENT ENABLE RECOVERY The U.S. Surgeon General, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),the Institute of Medicine (IOM), and many others (DHHS, 1999; IOM,1997) continue to document ongoing advances in our understanding ofM/SU problems and illnesses. These advances include the development ofefficacious psychotherapies, drug therapies, and psychosocial services, aswell as strategies for delivering these treatments effectively. Disseminationof information on brain functioning\u2014the interplay of genetic, environmen-tal, biological, and psychosocial factors in brain function and M/SU ill-nesses; our ability throughout our lives to influence the structure and func-tioning of our brains through environmental and behavioral factors (ourbrains' \"plasticity\"); and improved treatments\u2014has helped educate con-sumers, 5 the health care community, and the public at large about M/SU problems and illnesses and the effectiveness of care for these conditions.Now that NIH has made translation of bench science to clinical applica-tions a high priority in its strategic plans for the coming years (NIMH,2005; Zerhouni, 2003), society is poised to reap even greater returns fromdevelopments in such basic science fields as genetics, proteomics, neuro- 5The committee notes that many different words are used to refer to individuals who are in need of or receive M/SU health care, including \"patient,\" \"client,\" \"consumer,\" \"survivor,\" \"recipient,\" \"beneficiary,\" and others. The committee respects the different perspectives rep-resented by proponents of each of these terms. For convenience, we use the terms \"patients,\" \"consumers,\" and \"clients\" interchangeably in this report because of their widespread use by the public at large and within general and specialty health care systems. The use of thesewords is not intended to exclude the families of adults who, with the consent of the individual patient, can play an essential therapeutic role. With respect to children and adolescents, we always intend these words to include families and other informal caregivers.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The past decade also has seen rapid growth in the science of evaluating the costs and effectiveness of health interventions. These approaches in-creasingly demonstrate that care for many M/SU problems and illnesses canbe both effective (i.e., it can work) and cost-effective (i.e., it can represent agood value). Recent studies have used these approaches to evaluate a vari-ety of mental health interventions, ranging from use of a specific medica-tion (clozapine) in populations with schizophrenia (Essock et al., 2000;Rosenheck et al., 1999), to using specific models for treating depression inprimary care (Pirraglia et al., 2004), to providing supported housing forhomeless persons with mental illness (Rosenheck et al., 2003). These andother mental health interventions have been found to be as or more cost-effective than many treatments currently provided in general medical prac-tice. Consistent with these findings, more than half of adults who receivedtreatment for mental health problems in 2003 reported that their treatmentimproved their ability to manage daily activities \"a great deal\" or \"a lot\"(SAMHSA, 2004a). A large body of research shows likewise that treatment for alcohol and other drug problems and illnesses is effective. Many people who entertreatment decrease their substance use and have fewer problems (Finneyand Moos, 1991; McLellan et al., 2000; Miller et al., 2001). Recent yearshave seen many scientific advances in understanding the behavioral andsocial factors that lead to substance use and dependence, in identifying keyneuropathways and chemical changes that create the cravings characteristicof alcohol or drug dependence, and in developing mechanisms to blockthese effects. These advances have resulted in a spectrum of evidence-basedpharmacological and psychosocial treatments for individuals who misuseor are dependent on substances\u2014treatments that produce results similar toor better than those obtained with treatments for other chronic illnesses(McLellan et al., 2000). New medications, such as buprenorphine, areeffective in significantly reducing opioid use (Johnson et al., 2000). Incontrast to the first medication for opiate dependence (methadone),buprenorphine can be prescribed routinely in physicians' offices. Naltrexoneand acamprosate also show efficacy in treating alcohol dependence(Kranzler and Van Kirk, 2001; O'Malley et al., 2003) and may be moreacceptable to patients than disulfiram, the first medication approved fortreating that condition. 6 Nonpharmacological treatments for drug dependence, such as cogni- tive behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement treatment, have also 6Disulfiram produces a very uncomfortable physiological reaction in the individual when alcohol is consumed, and does not reduce craving.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html34 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS demonstrated efficacy. Twelve-step mutual support groups such as Alco- holics Anonymous are effective as well, particularly as an adjunct to treat-ment and as a form of long-term aftercare (Emrick et al., 1993; Tonigan etal., 2003; Weisner et al., 2003). Contingency management, a treatmentmodality that employs positive reinforcement for desired behaviors andwithholding of reinforcement or punitive measures for undesired behaviorshas shown efficacy for treatment of the use of alcohol, cocaine, and otherpsychostimulants (Higgins and Petry, 1999). Brief advice from a physicianand office-based alcohol counseling interventions have been shown to re-duce episodes of binge drinking as well as alcohol use in problem drinkers(Fleming et al., 1997; Ockene et al., 1999). Organizing care to address co-occurring conditions, such as by integrating alcohol and drug treatmentwith medical services (Weisner et al., 2001) and combining substance-useand mental health services, also optimizes outcomes (Moggi et al., 1999), aswell as cost (Parthasarathy et al., 2003). The latter approach is particularlyeffective for adolescents, in whom co-occurring substance-use and mentalhealth problems are very common (Clark et al., 1997; Sterling and Weisner,2005). As a result of these advances, patients who enter and remain intreatment for use of alcohol, opioids, or cocaine are less likely to relapse orresume use (Gossop et al., 1999; Miller and Wilbourne, 2002; Prendergastet al., 2002). Additional good news is found in recent studies showing some im- provements in access to and receipt of care. Over the past decade, althoughthe prevalence of M/SU problems and illnesses has remained the same, agreater proportion of adults aged 18-54 with these conditions has receivedtreatment (Kessler et al., 2005). This has been especially true of those withthe most severe mental illnesses (Kessler et al., 2005; Mechanic and Bilder,2004). The rate of treatment for depression appears to have more thantripled between 1987 and 1997 (Olfson et al., 2002), and improvementshave been seen in access to care and treatment for children (Glied andCuellar, 2003). On the other hand, the same reports showing improved access to care for people with the most severe mental illnesses show declining access forthose with less severe mental illnesses (Mechanic and Bilder, 2004) andethnic minorities (Kessler et al., 2005), and many people who need treat-ment for M/SU illnesses still do not receive it (Kessler et al., 2005;Mechanic and Bilder, 2004; SAMHSA, 2004a). Moreover, M/SU healthcare, like general health care, is frequently delivered in ways that are notconsistent with scientific evidence. Sometimes care also is unsafe. Whenuntreated or poorly treated, M/SU problems and illnesses can have seriousconsequences for the afflicted individuals, their loved ones, and society asa whole.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A reviewof all peer-reviewed studies published from 1992 through 2000 assessingthe quality of care for many different M/SU clinical conditions (includingalcohol withdrawal, bipolar illness, depression, panic disorder, psychosis,schizophrenia, and substance abuse) found that only 27 percent of thestudies reported adequate rates of adherence to established clinical practiceguidelines (Bauer, 2002). Subsequent studies have continued to documentclinicians' departures from evidence-based practice guidelines for condi-tions as varied as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Rushtonet al., 2004), anxiety disorders (Stein et al., 2004), comorbid mental andsubstance-use illnesses (Watkins et al., 2001), depression in adults (Simonet al., 2001a) and children (Richardson et al., 2004), opioid dependence(D'Aunno and Pollack, 2002), and schizophrenia (Buchanan et al., 2002).In a landmark study of the quality of a wide variety of health care receivedby U.S. citizens, individuals with alcohol dependence were found to receivecare consistent with scientific knowledge only about 10.5 percent of thetime (McGlynn et al., 2003). In other clinical care situations, the absence of clinical practice guide- lines further contributes to worrisome variation in the care individualsreceive. One 1999-2000 study of the care received by children and adoles-cents at residential treatment centers in four states found that 42.9 percentwere receiving antipsychotic medications without having any history of orcurrent psychosis and were thus receiving such medications for \"off-label\"purposes (Rawal et al., 2004). Seclusion and restraints continue to be usedin inpatient mental health facilities despite their resulting in substantialpsychological and physical harm to patients (GAO, 1999), including anestimated 150 deaths in the United States annually (SAMHSA, 2004b), anddespite a Cochrane Collaboration finding that \"few other forms of treat-ment which are applied to patients with various psychiatric diagnoses areso lacking in basic information about their proper use and efficacy\" (Sailasand Fenton, 2005). Moreover, recent studies reaffirm that the health care system some- times fails to provide any treatment for M/SU illnesses (Kessler et al., 2005; Mechanic and Bilder, 2004), even when afflicted individuals are receivingother types of health care and have financial and geographic access to care.A 1997-1998 national survey found that among persons with probable co-occurring M/SU conditions who received treatment for one condition, fewerthan a third (28.6 percent) received treatment for the other (Watkins et al.,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html36 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS 2001). A later longitudinal study of 1,088 youths in residential or outpa- tient treatment for drug use showed that although 67 percent reportedhaving severe mental health problems upon admission, only 24 percentreported receiving mental health services within the 3 months followingtheir admission (Jaycox et al., 2003). The 2003 National Survey on DrugUse and Health documents similar failure to treat adults (SAMHSA, 2004a).And despite the very frequent co-occurrence of M/SU and general healthcare problems and illnesses, coordination among providers of M/SU careand the other sectors of care delivery is highly inadequate (New FreedomCommission on Mental Health, 2003). Departures from known standards of care, variations in care in the absence of care standards, failure to treat M/SU problems and illnesses, andlack of coordination are of concern for many reasons. While they may oftenrepresent ineffective care, there is evidence that they can also threatenpatient safety. In addition to the substantial psychological and physicalharm to patients caused by the use of seclusion and restraints noted above,injuries from drug errors are common. A retrospective, multidisciplinaryreview of the charts of 31 randomly selected patients in a state psychiatrichospital discharged during a 4 1/2-month study period detected 2,194 cation errors during these patients' collective 1,448 inpatient days.7 Of these errors, 19 percent were rated as having the potential to cause minorharm, 23 percent the potential to cause moderate harm, and 58 percent thepotential to cause severe harm (Grasso et al., 2003). Moreover, becauseM/SU illnesses are leading risk factors for suicide (Maris, 2002), failures todiagnose and treat them effectively can be lethal. The receipt of ineffective and unsafe care by large numbers of people with M/SU illnesses is of particular concern because some of the unique features ofthese illnesses\u2014such as the symptoms of major depression or schizophrenia\u2014and their treatments could render patients less able to detect and avoid errorsand more vulnerable to the consequences of errors that occur. The residualstigma attached to some M/SU illnesses also may make individuals with thesediagnoses less willing to report errors and adverse events, and less likely to bebelieved when they do so. Most significant, the delivery of ineffective or unsafecare, or the failure to deliver any care, has serious consequences for individuals,their loved ones, and the nation as a whole. 7These medication error rates are consistent with rates reported in studies involving general medical hospitals, but the distribution of the types of errors is markedly different: a much higher proportion of the errors (66 percent) occurred during the administration of a medica- tion as opposed to its prescription, transcription, or dispensing. The authors note that at thetime the study was conducted, medication administration was performed by medical techni- cians, as opposed to licensed nurses\u2014a practice discontinued after the study (Grasso et al., 2003).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Using the metric of disability-adjusted life years(DALYs), representing the combined effect of years of life lost to prematuredeath and years of life lived with a disability, the study assessed fatal andnonfatal health outcomes and objectively calculated the relative burden ofmajor diseases and injuries. The results documented for the first time theprofound effect of M/SU illnesses on death and disability worldwide and inthe United States. In developed regions of the world, unipolar major depres-sion was the second leading cause of death and disability (next to heartdisease) for all ages, 8 and the leading cause for individuals aged 15-44. Alcohol use ranked highest for males aged 15-44 and fifth across all ages.Alcohol use also was an underlying factor in a substantial portion of trafficaccidents (which were ranked fourth for all ages and sexes and second onlyto alcohol for males aged 15-44). Schizophrenia and bipolar disorderranked thirteenth and fifteenth for all ages in developed regions. Other druguse ranked twenty-second. In developed regions of the world and incountries with established market economies such as the United States,when all neuropsychiatric conditions were combined, they were responsiblefor more death and disability than any other category of health conditions,outranking cardiovascular diseases; cancers; and a combined category ofcommunicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional illnesses (Murray andLopez, 1996). The major causes of DALYs differ somewhat for the United States, but M/SU illnesses remain prominent. In 1996, unipolar major depression wassecond only to ischemic heart disease for American women as the cause ofDALYs. For men, traffic accidents ranked second; alcohol abuse and de-pendence ranked fifth; and depression and drug use ranked tenth and elev-enth, respectively. Combined, unipolar major depression, drug use, andalcohol abuse and dependence are the leading cause of death and disabilityfor American women and the second highest for men (behind heart disease)(Michaud et al., 2001). If mental illness diagnoses other than unipolarmajor depression were included, the DALYs would be even higher. Moreover, mental or substance-use problems and illnesses seldom oc- cur in isolation; approximately 15-43 percent of the time they co-occur 8Predominantly because of the disability (rather than mortality) it produces.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

M/SU illnesses significantly compromise thetreatment outcomes for general health conditions, increase the use and costof general health care (Katon, 2003), and have adverse consequences forworkplace productivity and costs (as discussed below). Mental illness alsois a major risk factor for the development of adverse health behaviors suchas smoking, overeating, and a sedentary lifestyle (Katon, 2003). Great Cost to the Nation The disabilities and other adverse effects resulting from M/SU illnesses impose a sizable cost on the nation (Frank and McGuire, 2000). Consideringhealth care spending alone, M/SU problems and illnesses represent the fifthmost expensive category of health care conditions 10 in the United States among individuals not residing in nursing homes or other institutions (Thorpeet al., 2004). Direct spending 11 for M/SU health care by all health care purchasers in the United States totaled an estimated $104 billion in 2001 (82percent for mental and 18 percent for substance-use illnesses), representing7.6 percent of all health care spending (Mark et al., 2005). Additional costsattributable to M/SU illnesses (e.g., secondary health problems, loss of pro-ductivity in the workplace, and social problems requiring the involvement ofthe welfare and criminal and juvenile justice systems) are even higher. Na-tionally, the estimated direct and indirect costs for alcohol-related illnesses,injuries, and other consequences, excluding those associated with the use ofother drugs, were estimated at $185 billion in 1998. More than 70 percent ofthese costs were due to lost productivity resulting from alcohol-related illnessand premature death (NIAAA, 2000). These direct and indirect costs affectemployers, the child welfare system, the juvenile and criminal justice systems,education systems, and other sectors of society. 9Among some treatment groups, rates of co-occurrence can be even higher. Among those with a nonalcohol drug-use disorder who sought treatment for that disorder, for example, 60.3 percent had at least one independent mood disorder, and 55.2 percent had a comorbid alcohol-use disorder (Grant et al., 2004a). 10Next to heart disease, trauma, cancer, and lung diseases. 11Includes only spending for health care in which M/SU illnesses are listed as the primary illness being treated. Thus, for example, costs of treating cirrhosis secondary to alcohol de-pendence are not captured; nor, for example, are other health problems brought on by sub- stance use if the substance-use illness is not being treated, and other indirect costs of these illnesses, such as costs to the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Also not captured is carethat is coded as another illness (e.g., back pain).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlTHE QUALITY CHASM IN MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE HEALTH CARE 39 Decreased Productivity in the Workplace Evidence is mounting that M/SU illnesses result in a considerable burden on the workplace and cost to employers due to absenteeism, \"presenteeism\"(i.e., attending work with symptoms that impair performance), days ofdisability, and \"critical incidents\" such as significant task failures and acci-dents. All cause a decrease in workplace productivity. Depression is themost frequently studied M/SU illness with respect to the workplace becauseit is highly prevalent among working-age adults and associated with sub-stantial work impairment (Burton et al., 2004; Kessler et al., 2001a; Stewartet al., 2003); however, substance dependence and generalized anxiety disor-ders also are very common and associated with high levels of work impair-ment (Kessler et al., 2001a). As part of a 2001-2002 national survey of American workers designed to better understand the relationship between health and productivity, in-terviews were conducted to determine the effect of depression on workerproductivity. \"Lost productive time\" (LPT) was measured by summingemployee self-reports of the hours per week absent from work for health-related reasons and hours of health-related reduced performance on work-days. Workers with depression reported significantly more total health-related LPT than workers without depression\u2014on average, a loss of 5.6hours per week compared with 1.5 hours per week for those without de-pression. Fully 81 percent of LPT was attributable not to absenteeism, butto reduced performance while at work\u2014the component of reduced perfor-mance often invisible to employers because it is not captured in routineadministrative data as are absenteeism, use of leave, and disability (Stewartet al., 2003). Indeed, there is evidence that improving care for depressioncan increase worker productivity and decrease absenteeism (Rost et al.,2004). The accuracy of retrospective data self-reported by individuals with depression has been questioned (because the symptoms of depression maypredispose individuals to appraise their productivity negatively). Yet whenworker performance is measured by other valid and reliable means (Kessleret al., 2004), major depression continues to be associated with poor workperformance more consistently than is the case for other high-prevalenceconditions (allergies, arthritis, back pain, headaches, high blood pressure,and asthma) (Wang et al., 2004). Decreased Achievement by Children in School Emotional and behavioral problems of children and the M/SU prob- lems and illnesses of their parents also are important predictors of poorschool outcomes. Risk factors for early school failure include maternalCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Several M/SU-relatedrisk factors, including parental trauma, maternal depression, maternal alco-holism, and other substance-use problems and illnesses also are associatedwith disorganized attachment behaviors in infants (i.e., insecure and incon-sistent patterns of attachment to key caregivers) (Ainsworth and Eichberg,1992; Carlson et al., 1989; Green and Goldwyn, O'Connor et al.,1987; Teti et al., 1995; van Ijzendoorn et al., 1999). Those behaviors inturn lead to lower IQ and poorer school performance (van Izjendoorn andvan Vliet-Vissers, 1988; Zeanah et al., 2003). Children of untreated de-pressed mothers, for example, have significantly more behavior and school achievement problems than children of nondepressed mothers (Greenberget al., 1999; Gross et al., 1995; Sinclair and Murray, 1998). Children whoexperience trauma also have higher rates of school problems than childrenwho are not maltreated, including lower IQ scores, lower test scores inmath and English, less social acceptance as perceived by the child, increasedabsence from class, and more grade repetitions (Eckenrode et al., 1995;Wodarski et al., 1990). Although risk factors often associated with substance-use problems and illnesses (such as poor maternal nutrition, health, and prenatal care)make it difficult to attribute school problems solely to in utero drug expo-sure, it is clear that maternal substance-use problems and illnesses arestrongly associated with adverse effects on children's cognitive, physical,and social development. Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancyis associated with intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight,which affect later cognitive and social development (Streissguth et al.,1994). Children exposed to alcohol in utero also have been found to havebehavioral and social difficulties, such as trouble cooperating and payingattention and problems with impulsivity (Spohr et al., 1994). Findings ofstudies of prenatal exposure to other drugs, such as cocaine, heroin, andamphetamines, suggest that such exposure results in lower general intelli-gence and impairs school functioning (Eriksson de Graaff, 1994; van Baar et al., 1994). Other studies have foundthat although prenatal exposure to cocaine does not affect intellectualability or academic achievement, it does affect the ability to sustain atten-tion (Richardson et al., 1996). These risks that place children on a dangerous trajectory toward school failure are compounded by the fact that academic failure itself breeds emo-tional and behavioral problems. Repeating a grade in school is associatedwith several specific behavioral problems and illnesses, such as ADHD,obsessive-compulsive disorder and other specific anxiety disorders, and ma-jor depressive disorder (Velez et al., 1989). Grade retention also predictsCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This is not a minor problem. According to one national study, 7.6percent of children repeat kindergarten or first grade (Byrd and Weitzman,1994). Children who are unable to achieve mastery on standard measures ofschool achievement also are at risk for delinquent and antisocial behavior(Yoshikawa, 1995), and children with early reading difficulties have increasedrates of conduct problems up to the age of 16 (Fergusson et al., 1997). Increased Burden on the Child Welfare System The nation's child welfare system also is greatly affected by the high prevalence of and disability associated with M/SU illnesses. Foremost, chil-dren who are reported to and investigated by the child welfare system formaltreatment typically have experienced a number of known risk factorsfor the development of emotional and behavioral problems, including abuse,neglect, poverty, parental substance-use problems and illnesses, and domes-tic violence. As a result, almost half (47.9 percent) of a nationally represen-tative, random sample of children aged 2-14 who were investigated bychild welfare services in 1999-2000 had a clinically significant need formental health care (Burns et al., 2004). In addition, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that, because of limitations on insurance coverage, some familiesresort to placing their children (most often adolescents with severe mentalillness) in the child welfare system even though the family is not neglectfulor abusive of the child. Because the child welfare system often is able tosecure mental health services otherwise unavailable to them, parents use thesystem for this purpose even though they are placing their children insystems not designed to care for children who have not been abused orneglected (GAO, 2003). Doing so sometimes requires parents to give uplegal custody of their children and place them in an out-of-home residentialor foster care setting (Giliberti and Schulzinger, 2000). In Virginia, forexample, a 2004 study of the use of the state's foster care program formental health services found that 2,008 children in foster care as of June 1,2004\u2014approximately 1 of every 4 children in the system at that time\u2014were there either because their parents wanted them to have mental healthcare not fully covered by their insurance or because the family did not haveaccess to any insurance (Jenkins, 2004). Finally, the stresses involved with child protective services investigation and judicial decision making, and for those who are placed in foster carethe stress of removal from home, also constitute risk factors for maladap-tive outcomes, including emotional, social, behavioral, and psychiatric prob-lems warranting mental health treatment (Landsverk, 2005).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html42 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Demands on the Juvenile and Criminal Justice Systems Juvenile justice Between 60 and 75 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have a diagnosable mental disorder (Otto et al., 1992; Teplin et al.,2002; Wierson et al., 1992), and it is conservatively estimated, although theevidence is less clear, that approximately 20 percent have a severe mentalillness (Cocozza and Skowyra, 2000; Grisso, 2004). Many youths in thejuvenile justice system with mental illness also have a co-occurring substance-use problem or illness. Although the research on this issue is limited, a recentstudy of juvenile detainees in Cook County, Illinois, found that nearly 30percent of females and more than 20 percent of males with substance-usedisorders had major mental disorders as well (Abram et al., 2003). Moreover, like youths who are not abused or neglected but are placed in child welfare solely to obtain mental health services, many children whoare not guilty of any offence are placed in local juvenile justice systems andincarcerated solely to obtain such services not otherwise available. Althoughno formal counting and tracking of such children takes place, juvenilejustice officials in 33 counties in the 17 states with the largest populationsof children under age 18 estimated that approximately 9,000 such childrenentered their systems under these circumstances in 2001; county estimatesranged from 0 to 1,750, with a median of 140. Nationwide the number ofchildren placed in juvenile justice systems is likely to be higher; 11 statesreported to GAO that they could not provide estimates even though theywere aware that such placements occur (GAO, 2003). In a subsequent 2003 survey of all (698) secure juvenile detention facili- ties in the United States, 12 two-thirds of such facilities reported holding youths (prior to, after, or absent any pending adjudication) because they were await-ing community mental health services. In addition, s eventy-one facilities in 33 states reported holding youths with mental problems or illnesses who hadcharges against them. As one detention facility administrator explained, \"Weare receiving juveniles that five years ago would have been in an inpatientmental health facility. . .we have had a number of juveniles who should nomore be in our institution than I should be able to fly\" (U.S. House ofRepresentatives, 2004:8). A majority of detention facilities reported holdingchildren under age 13; 117 reported holding children aged 10 and under; and1 facility reported holding a 7-year-old child. Moreover, 27 percent of facili-ties holding children awaiting services rated the mental health treatment intheir facility as \"poor,\" \"very poor,\" or \"none.\" The emotional toll on thesechildren is high. Fully 48 percent of facilities that hold juveniles waiting forcommunity mental health services report suicide attempts among these youths(U.S. House of Representatives, 2004). 12Response rate = 75 percent.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Although a rigorous epidemiological study of the prev-alence of M/SU illnesses in correctional settings has not taken place, 14 the U.S. Bureau of Justice estimates that approximately 16 percent of all per-sons in jails and state prisons report either having a mental disorder orstaying overnight in a psychiatric facility, as do 7 percent of those in federalprisons (Ditton, 1999). Substance-use problems and illnesses play a largerrole in incarceration. Approximately two-thirds of incarcerated individualswere under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of their offense, andnearly 60 percent of all state prisoners report using substances other thanalcohol in the month prior to offending (Mumola, 1999). Moreover, in anaverage year, approximately one-third of new admissions to prisons resultfrom parole violations, nearly 16 percent of which are drug-related (Hugheset al., 2001). Because prisons and jails are legally required to provide medical treat- ment to inmates with medical needs (Haney and Specter, 2003; Metzner,2002), approximately 95 percent of state correctional facilities report pro-viding some form of mental health treatment to prisoners. The treatmentprovided includes screening for mental illness at intake (78 percent), assess-ing psychiatric problems (79 percent), delivering round-the-clock mentalhealth care (63 percent), providing therapy or counseling (84 percent),prescribing psychotropic medications (83 percent), and providing reentryassistance (72 percent). On average, 1 in 8 prisoners in state prisons isengaged in structured counseling, and 1 in 10 is receiving psychotropicmedication (Beck and Maruschak, 2001). The majority of jails also reportproviding some type of mental health treatment\u2014most often screening atintake (78 percent), followed by psychotropic medication (66 percent), 24-hour care (47 percent), routine therapy or counseling (46 percent), andpsychiatric evaluation (38 percent) (Stephan, 2001). Yet on average, mentalhealth services are being provided at a level that is roughly half the esti-mated need (Wolff, 2004). Although substance-use problems and illnesses play a larger role in incarceration than do mental illnesses, they receive less treatment (Wolff, 13The majority (66 percent) of these were in state or federal prisons, the remainder in local jails. 14A more rigorous study of the prevalence of M/SU illnesses in correctional settings, mod- eled on the prevalence studies of the general population in the United States (Kessler et al., 2001) and the correctional and general population in the United Kingdom (ONS, 1998), has been called for (Wolff, 2004).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html44 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS 2004). One study found that roughly one in four state prisoners received any treatment for substance-use problems, with a higher percentage (40percent) receiving such treatment if they reported drug use at the time oftheir offense. The most common treatment received was self-help group/peer counseling (Mumola, 1999). Similarly, although substance-use treat-ment or other programs, such as education or self-help, were provided bythe majority of jails (73 percent) in 1998, only 20 percent of convicted jailinmates who were actively involved with drugs prior to their admission tojail had participated in substance-use treatment or program subsequent totheir incarceration. Treatment (i.e., detoxification units, group/individualcounseling, and residential programs) was provided by approximately 43percent of jail facilities. Nearly two-thirds of jails reported providing accessto drug or alcohol education or self-help groups (Wilson, 2000). How These Adverse Consequences Can Be Mitigated The delivery of effective treatment for M/SU problems and illnesses could mitigate many of the serious individual and societal consequencesdiscussed above. Findings of observational studies and some controlledtrials indicate that effective treatment for depression, for example, canresult in improved productivity in the workplace, and this might substan-tially offset the cost of the treatment (Goetzel et al., 2002; Simon et al.,2001b; Wang et al., 2003). Treatment for this and other M/SU illnesses alsomight help ameliorate the adverse effects of emotional or behavioral prob-lems and illnesses on children's educational achievement, as well as reducethe burden on the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. At a minimum,provision of effective treatment ensures that funds spent for treatment willnot be wasted. A CHARGE TO CROSS THE QUALITY CHASM The high prevalence and adverse consequences of M/SU problems and illnesses, the availability of many efficacious treatments, and the wide-spread delivery of poor-quality care are increasingly being recognized byconsumers, purchasers, care providers, and policy makers. Similar concernsabout the safety, ineffectiveness, and poor quality of U.S. health care over-all have previously received substantial attention among the health carecommunity, the lay press, and the public at large as a result of two IOMreports\u2014 To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (IOM, 2000) and Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Cen- tury (IOM, 2001). These reports have played a key role in focusing national attention on problems in the quality of the nation's health care, whilegarnering consensus on strategies for achieving significant quality improve-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Both reports underscore that the vast majority of problems in the quality of health care are not the result of poorly motivated, uncaring, orunintelligent health care personnel but instead result from numerous barri-ers to high-quality health care imposed by the delivery systems in whichclinicians work. Some of these barriers occur at the level of the patient'sinteraction with the clinician (e.g., not having sufficient time during thepatient visit to talk with the clinician); some at the level of interactionsamong different clinicians serving the patient (e.g., poor communication,collaboration, and coordination of care); some within the organization inwhich care is delivered (e.g., poor decision support for clinicians); and somein the environment external to the delivery of care (e.g., the arenas ofpolicy, payment, and regulation) (Berwick, 2002). Crossing the Quality Chasm speaks to all of these barriers to quality health care 15 and has gained considerable traction in the health care com- munity since its publication. As the subject of more than 50 peer-reviewedarticles in the medical literature and hundreds of lay publications and cov-erage in other media, it has attracted the attention of many health careleaders. In the M/SU sector, the American College of Mental Health Ad-ministration (ACMHA), for example, focused on the report at its 2002summit meeting of leaders from public and private behavioral health caresystems. Summit meeting participants reached strong consensus that theQuality Chasm framework is immediately relevant and applicable to the concerns of behavioral health systems of care and policy. Attendees alsoendorsed the IOM paradigm as a strategic planning blueprint for the rede-sign of the behavioral health care system. However, because the Quality Chasm report did not separately address the unique characteristics of health care for mental and substance-use conditions (e.g., the use of coercion intotreatment; the delivery of care through non-health care sectors, such asschools), attendees also agreed on the need to develop a strategy for apply-ing the framework and recommendations of the Quality Chasm to address the unique characteristics of M/SU health care (ACMHA, undated). 15 Crossing the Quality Chasm identifies four different levels for intervening in the delivery of health care: (1) the experience of patients; (2) the functioning of small units of care delivery (\"microsystems\"), such as surgical teams or nursing units; (3) the functioning of organiza- tions that house the microsystems; and (4) the environment of policy, payment, regulation,accreditation, and similar external factors that shape the context in which health care organi- zations deliver care. Whereas To Err Is Human speaks mainly to the fourth level, Crossing the Quality Chasm addresses primarily the first and second levels\u2014how the experiences of patients and the work of microsystems of care, such as health care teams, nursing units, or individual health care workers delivering care to patients, should be changed (Berwick, 2002). Both of these reports direct less attention to the third level above\u2014the organizations thathouse the microsystems.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html46 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS As a result of ACMHA leadership, there was a convergence of support from many sectors for adapting the Quality Chasm framework to M/SU health care. With support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the CIGNAFoundation, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, theNational Institute on Drug Abuse, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,SAMHSA within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, andthe Veterans Health Administration of the U.S. Department of VeteransAffairs, the IOM was given the following charge: Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century identified six dimensions in which the United States health system func- tions at far lower levels than it should (i.e., safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency and equity) and concluded that the current health care system in is in need of fundamental change. The IOM is to explore the implications of that conclusion for the field of mentalhealth and addictive disorders, and identify the barriers and facilitators to achieving significant improvements along all six of these dimensions. The committee will examine both environmental factors such as payment, ben-efits coverage and regulatory issues, as well as health care organization and delivery issues. Based on a review of the evidence, the committee will develop an \"agenda for change.\" To carry out this charge, in 2004 the IOM convened a multidisciplinary committee of experts in mental, substance-use, and general health care;public- and private-sector M/SU care; geriatrics; informatics; and systems engineering (see AppendixA for the biographical sketches of committee members). This report is theresult of their efforts. As the committee's charge and expertise indicate, the scope of this study was large, encompassing both public and private sectors, childrenand adults, and health care for mental and substance-use problems andillnesses. In particular, addressing health care for both mental andsubstance-use conditions in a single report was challenging; major public-and private-sector initiatives and reports have nearly always addressed onlyone or the other (DHHS, 1999; New Freedom Commission on MentalHealth, 2003). Nonetheless, the committee found this dual focus to beappropriate and invaluable to its analysis of the evidence and formulationof policy recommendations, given the interconnected nature of these condi-tions and the resulting need for coordinated policy and care delivery. Indeed,the committee believes that in future initiatives to improve the quality ofM/SU health care, expertise in health care for both mental and substance-use conditions should always be at the table.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlTHE QUALITY CHASM IN MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE HEALTH CARE 47 SCOPE OF THE STUDY At the beginning of its deliberations, the committee identified several issues that it decided should be excluded from this study to best focus itsefforts. The special considerations involved in delivering care in rural areasconsistent with the Quality Chasm recommendations are addressed in a separate IOM report (IOM, 2005), and thus are not addressed here. Simi-larly, a separate study on emergency care was under way at the same timeas this study. Readers are directed to the reports of the IOM Committee onthe Future of Emergency Care in the U.S. Health System, which will includediscussion of the impact of M/SU illnesses on emergency departments andthe quality of M/SU health care these facilities provide. Moreover, althoughtouched on briefly in this report, difficulties in achieving diversity in thehealth care workforce and addressing disparities in health care likewisehave been the subject two recent IOM reports (IOM, 2003, 2004). Also,because of the committee's expansive charge, it was not able to attend tothe unique issues related to dementia and the mental health care needs ofolder adults in long-term care facilities; the committee calls attention to theneed for further study and resources focused on this population. Finally,Crossing the Quality Chasm sets forth a \"patient-centered, treatment- focused\" approach to improving individual health care, as opposed to a \"population-centered, prevention-focused\" approach to improving public health. The committee recognizes that much work is needed to apply publichealth interventions to M/SU problems and illnesses and briefly touches ona few of these issues in this report. However, resource limitations and thescope of the committee's charge and expertise made it infeasible to addressmore fully this very important aspect of improving M/SU health care. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT In carrying out its charge, the committee focused on those characteris- tics of M/SU health care that distinguish it from non-M/SU health care(what is referred to throughout this report as \"general\" health care). Thesecharacteristics are briefly described in Chapter 2, along with the Quality Chasm framework. The report then examines how the Quality Chasm framework can be applied to achieve high-quality M/SU care, focusing firston patient-centered care (Chapter 3) and then on safe and effective care(Chapter 4). Approaches to implementing the Quality Chasm rule of coor- dinating health care across general, mental, and substance-use health condi-tions are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 mirrors the original Quality Chasm report by addressing the application of information technology to facilitate changes needed to improve the quality of care. This report alsoparallels the Quality Chasm report by reviewing in a separate chapterCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

New approaches to purchasingM/SU health care to create incentives for these changes are discussed inChapter 8. Finally, Chapter 9 identifies areas in need of additional research.Appendix A contains further discussion of the Quality Chasm aims and rules and the organization of this report. The report also contains overarching recommendations (in Chapter 2) as well as more specific recommendations for quality improvement. Theselatter recommendations, organized topically in Chapters 3-9, are collectedand grouped according to the entities charged with their implementation ina series of tables at the end of Chapter 9.

However, health care for mental and/or substance-use (M/SU) conditions in the United States historically has beenmore separated from general health care relative to other specialties.In addition, there are some significant differences between M/SUand general health care, including the implications of a mental orsubstance-use diagnosis for patient decision making; the morecommon use of coerced treatment; greater variation in the typesof providers licensed to diagnose and treat M/SU illnesses; theneed for linkages with a greater number of health, social, andpublic welfare systems; a less developed quality measurementinfrastructure; less widespread adoption of information technology;and a differently structured marketplace for consumers and purchasersof M/SU health care. In analyzing these differences, the state of M/SU health care, and the Quality Chasm framework for health care quality im- provement, the committee finds that: M/SU health care\u2014like general health care\u2014is often ineffective, not patient-centered, untimely, inefficient, inequitable, and at timesunsafe. It, too, requires fundamental redesign. Mental, substance-use, and general illnesses are highly interrelated, especially with respect to chronicity.

The Quality Chasm recommendations for the redesign of health care are as applicable to M/SU health care as they are togeneral health care. AIMS AND RULES FOR REDESIGNING HEALTH CARE Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001:6) proposes the following statement of purpose for the U.S. health care system: ...to continually reduce the burden of illness, injury, and disability, and to improve the health and functioning of the people of the United States. To help achieve this purpose, the Quality Chasm report identifies six di- mensions in which the U.S. health care system functions at far lower levelsthan it could and should, and translates these dimensions into national aimsto guide the quality improvement efforts of all health care organizations,professional groups, public and private purchasers, and individual clini-cians (see Box 2-1). To further assist quality improvement efforts, the Quality Chasm re- port specifies an accompanying set of ten rules to guide the redesign ofhealth care so as to accomplish the six quality aims (see Box 2-2). BOX 2-1 The Six Aims of High-Quality Health Care Safe \u2014avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them. Effective \u2014providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit.

Care based on continuous healing relationships. Patients should receive care whenever they need it and in many forms, not just face-to-face visits. This rule implies that the health care system should be responsive at all times (24 hours a day, every day) and that access to care should be provided over the Internet, bytelephone, and by other means in addition to face-to-face visits. 2. Customization based on patient needs and values. The system of care should be designed to meet the most common types of needs but have the capa- bility to respond to individual patient choices and preferences. 3. The patient as the source of control. Patients should be given the neces- sary information and the opportunity to exercise the degree of control they choose over health care decisions that affect them. The health system should be able toaccommodate differences in patient preferences and encourage shared decision making. 4. Shared knowledge and the free flow of information. Patients should have unfettered access to their own medical information and to clinical knowledge. Cli- nicians and patients should communicate effectively and share information. 5. Evidence-based decision making. Patients should receive care based on the best available scientific knowledge. Care should not vary illogically from clini-cian to clinician or from place to place. 6. Safety as a system property. Patients should be safe from injury caused by the care system. Reducing risk and ensuring safety require greater attention to systems that help prevent and mitigate errors. 7. The need for transparency. The health care system should make informa- tion available to patients and their families that allows them to make informed decisions when selecting a health plan, hospital, or clinical practice, or choosingamong alternative treatments. This should include information describing the sys- tem's performance on safety, evidence-based practice, and patient satisfaction. 8. Anticipation of needs. The health system should anticipate patient needs, rather than simply reacting to events. 9. Continuous decrease in waste. The health system should not waste re- sources or patient time. 10. Cooperation among clinicians. Clinicians and institutions should actively collaborate and communicate to ensure an appropriate exchange of information and coordination of care.

This health careredesign must include adopting new ways of delivering care; making effec-tive use of information technologies; managing the clinical knowledge andskills of the workforce; developing effective teams and coordinating careacross patient conditions, services, and settings; improving how health carequality is measured; and adopting payment methods that create incentivesfor and reward good quality\u2014all of which require attention to how work-ers are educated and deployed. Such changes have implications for all fourlevels of the health care system: (1) the interactions between patients andtheir individual clinicians; (2) the functioning of small units of care delivery(\"microsystems\"), such as interdisciplinary teams or staff located on inpa-tient units; (3) the functioning of organizations that house the microsystems;and (4) the environment of policy, payment, regulation, accreditation, andsimilar external factors that shape the environment in which health careorganizations deliver care (Berwick, 2002). In many ways, the delivery of health care for mental and/or substance- use (M/SU) problems and illnesses in the United States has evolved so thatthese four levels of the system operate very differently from the way theyfunction in general health care. Therefore, focused examination and somespecialized efforts will be required to apply the Quality Chasm rules and achieve significant improvements on all six quality aims in the M/SU domain. DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL/SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Greater Separation from Other Components of the Health Care System M/SU health care differs from other specialty and nonspecialty health care in many ways. One of these is its greater degree of separation, bothstructurally and functionally, from other components of the health caresystem. This separation is historical in origin. Because of poor understand-ing of the biological aspects of M/SU illnesses and the lack of any medicaltreatments, care for individuals with these illnesses initially was viewed as asocial rather than a medical problem. Specific therapies for mental illnesseswere rarely mentioned in the medical literature before 1800. Sick individu-als were often treated by ministers and women, rather than by doctors(Grob, 1994). Substance-use \"disorders\" similarly were viewed as manifes-tations of intellectual weakness or moral inferiority. In the early nineteenthcentury, for example, when alcoholism was beginning to be understood asa disease, \"drunkards, along with unwed mothers, and those suffering fromvenereal disease, were routinely denied admission to America's earliest hos-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Even when alcohol and other substance-use illnesses began to berecognized as biological diseases, medical treatment initially had little tooffer, and most recovery assistance came from \"mutual support\" societiesthat were not part of health care (White, 1998). Although understanding of the biological aspects of these illnesses and effective treatments has since greatly improved, the greater separation ofM/SU health care from the rest of the system persists. This is manifested inpart by society's continuing reliance on public-sector delivery systems andfunding for M/SU care (Hogan, 1999; Mark et al., 2005); the resultingexistence of a separate administration for these illnesses within federal (theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA])and state governments; frequent calls for the integration of health careservices for mental and substance-use conditions with each other and withprimary health care (Bazelon Center for Mental Health 2000; Minkoff, the of M/SU health care by public- and private-sectorpurchasers. The separate purchasing of M/SU health care in most individu-als' health insurance plans is known as \"carving out\" these services(Grazier and Eselius, 1999). \"Carved-out\" M/SU health care plans can beprovided by companies separate from the main insurer or by subsidiaries ofthe primary insurer. Mental health care is even more separated from gen-eral health care for children and adolescents; they frequently receive mentalhealth care through their schools, not through their primary health careprovider (Burns et al., 1995; Kessler et al., 2001). Some of these separations can have salutary effects, for example, by fostering recognition of and support for specialized knowledge of M/SUproblems and illnesses and treatment expertise, and attenuating problemsrelated to the adverse selection of individuals with M/SU illnesses in insur-ance plans. Moreover, some M/SU health care organizations involve indi-viduals recovering from M/SU illnesses in the administration and deliveryof services, providing a strong source of recovery support for others withthese illnesses. At the same time, however, separation of those with M/SUproblems and illnesses from the mainstream population might nurture theresidual stigma and discrimination faced by some of these individuals(Corrigan et al., 2001, 2002; Kolodziej and Johnson, 1996). It can alsopose obstacles to the coordination of M/SU health care services with eachother and with general health care (IOM, 1997). Individuals needing theseservices often must interact with separate delivery systems to receive healthcare for general, mental, and substance-use conditions. These multiple de-livery arrangements frequently have unreliable or nonexistent linkages witheach other, creating opportunities for discontinuity of care. Chapter 5 ad-dresses in greater detail these separation issues and the resulting need forCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Additional Differences Beyond the structural and functional separation discussed above, there are many other ways in which M/SU health care is distinctive. These differ-ences, briefly summarized in Table 2-1 and in the text that follows, canhave significant implications for efforts to apply the Quality Chasm aims and rules and are discussed more fully in succeeding chapters. Consumer Role Consumers of M/SU health care face a number of obstacles not gener- ally encountered by consumers of general health care. Shame, stigma, anddiscrimination still experienced by some consumers of M/SU services mayprevent them from seeking care (Peter D. Hart Research Associates, Inc.,2001; SAMHSA, 2004) and nourish both their own and providers' doubtsabout their competence to make decisions on their own behalf (Bergeson,2004; Leibfried, 2004; Markowitz, 1998; Wright et al., 2000). These atti-tudes create obstacles to consumers' exercising the control of which theyare capable over health care decisions that affect them and to their manag-ing their illnesses effectively. Moreover, coerced treatment, which is com-mon in substance-use health care and also seen (though less frequently) inmental health care for those with more severe mental illnesses, raises thequestion of how patients subjected to such treatment can make decisionsabout their care. As the locus of most M/SU treatment has shifted to thecommunity, new mechanisms for pressuring or compelling individuals withthese illnesses to undergo treatment have evolved, including coercion fromthe criminal justice and welfare systems, schools, and workplaces (Monahanet al., 2003, 2005; Sterling et al., 2004; Weisner et al., 2002). At the same time, the long-standing history of individuals in recovery from substance-use illnesses helping to teach others about their illness andrecovery strategies and supporting them in the recovery process is an ad-vantage that consumers of substance-use health care services have whenattempting to make informed health care choices and manage their ill-nesses. Mental health care is following in these footsteps; peer supportprograms are an emerging component of public-sector mental health ser-vices. Evidence shows that seeing or visualizing those similar to oneselfsuccessfully performing activities typically increases one's belief in one'sown ability to perform those activities successfully (Bandura, 1997) andfacilitates successful management of one's own chronic illness (Lorig et al.,2001) (see Chapter 3).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Expectations are rising for consumer decision makingin the purchase of health care and selection of treatments. Coercion into treatment is rare. The role of consumers in managing their chronic illnesses has only recentlybeen emphasized. Laboratory and physical exam findings, biological tests, imaging technolo-gies, and other objective methods are frequently available to supplementthe patient history and patient reports of symp- toms used in making adiagnosis and monitoring care. The majority of physicians practice in groups of three or more. Care for multiple acute, chronic, and severe ill- nesses is delivered through the same health plan.TABLE 2-1 Differences Between General Health Care and Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions Type of Care Mental/Substance-Use Attribute General Health Care Health Care Consumer role in treatment Diagnostic methods Mode of clinician practice Care delivery arrangementsResidual stigma persists, especially for substance-useillnesses. Decision-making ability often is not anticipated or sup-ported and often is chal- lenged. Coercion is common (espe- cially for substance-use treatment). There is a long history of peer support/mutual support groups/recovering consumersas providers of alcohol and other drug treatment services. There has recently been amovement to do the same in mental health care. Diagnosis relies more on results of interview tools and the patient history and in-volves more professional interpretation, with resulting greater variation in diagnosis. Psychiatrists more often practice in solo or two- clinician practices. Children's mental health care is often secured through schools and the welfare andjuvenile justice systems. Care for M/SU illnesses is often provided by a separate health plan.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

When consumers are covered by a separate managed be-havioral health care plan, determination of the need for an M/SU specialist is madeby the group purchaser, and the consumer is generally expected to receive care fromsuch a specialist rather than from a primary care pro- vider. Receiving M/SU healthcare from the primary care provider is not well sup- ported. EAPs play a significant role in detection, referral, and treatment. Leadership is predominantly from the public sector. Less consensus exists on core measures across the publicand private sectors. Fewer established clinical databases exist. Quality measurement and improvement mechanisms are less well developed. The situation is similar to that for general health care, but with a larger number of state laws and regulationsrestricting the sharing of information.TABLE 2-1 continued Type of Care Mental/Substance-Use Attribute General Health Care Health Care Care for all types of ill- nesses is available throughprivate-sector programs.

Consensus exists on some core quality measures andspecifications across the public and private sectors. Well-established clinical administrative databases exist.

The use of electronic health records, decision support, and other infor- mation technology (IT)applications is growing. Only physicians and certain advanced practice nurses generally are li- censed to diagnose andtreat. Private insurance and Medicare dominate purchasing. Care is typically covered by insurance. Copayments are lower, and more visits/days of care arecovered. Non-M/SU specialty care is purchased under thesame contract as primary care.IT is less well developed and less commonly used for clini- cal care support. A more diverse workforce is licensed to diagnose and treat, including psychologists, psychiatrists, other physi-cians, social workers, psychi- atric nurses, marriage and family therapists, addictiontherapists, and a variety of counselors with different education and certificationrequirements. State and local governments (including Medicaid) domi- nate purchasing. Insurance provides less cover- age. Copayments are higher, and fewer visits/days of care and therapies are covered. M/SU insurance coverage is purchased separately(\"carved out\") from general health care.TABLE 2-1 continued Type of Care Mental/Substance-Use Attribute General Health Care Health Care Diagnostic Methods Compared with general health care, relatively few laboratory, imaging, or other physical findings can be used to diagnose mental illnesses or sub-stance dependence. 1 Accurate diagnosis instead relies primarily on clinical 1Substance use, but not dependence, can be detected by laboratory tests.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

As a result, individualswith the same symptoms presenting to different mental health clinicians canreceive very different diagnoses (Eaton et al., 2000; Kramer et al., 2000;Lefever et al., 2003; Lewczyk et al., 2003; McClellan, 2005; Mojtabai,2002). In children, diagnoses may have an even greater range of variabilitybecause clinicians are greatly dependent upon parents' perceptions of thenature of the presenting problem. Subjectivity in diagnosis is also manifestin the different diagnoses received by individuals who are members ofethnic minorities (Bell and Mehta, 1980, 1981; Mukherjee et al., 1983).Criteria for accurately diagnosing M/SU problems and illnesses are found inthe American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , now in its revised fourth edition (DSM-IV-TR). How- ever, adherence to these guidelines is not uniform (Rushton et al., 2004),nor is training on the appropriate use of this manual required for profes-sional credentialing. Mode of Clinician Practice A substantial proportion of mental health clinicians report that \"indi- vidual practice\" is either their primary or secondary 2 employment setting (Duffy et al., 2004) (see Table 2-2). Among primary care and specialist physicians who are self-employed or employees of physician-owned medical groups,3 psychiatrists are most likely to work in solo practices or small groups. Fully 85 percent practice ingroups of one to three clinicians, compared with 53 percent of physiciansoverall, 54.9 percent of pediatricians, and 62.7 percent of internists(Cunningham, 2004). Individual practice may be an impediment to the delivery of high- quality M/SU health care for multiple reasons. As described in Chapter 6,the size of health care provider organizations is related to the uptake ofinformation technologies. Use of electronic health records, for example, istypically found in larger health care organizations (Brailer and Terasawa,2003). Moreover, as articulated in Crossing the Quality Chasm , \"Today, 2Many mental health practitioners work in multiple settings. For example, 60 percent of full-time psychiatrists reported working in two or more settings in 1998, as did 50 percent of psychologists in 2002, 20 percent of full-time counselors, and 29 percent of marriage /familytherapists. Rates were higher for part-time counselors (Duffy et al., 2004). 3Residents and employees of hospitals, universities, medical schools, government, and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are excluded.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

No unaided human being can read, recall, and act effec-tively on the volume of clinically relevant scientific literature\" (IOM,2001:25). Clinicians in solo practice must assume all the burden of investi-gating, analyzing, purchasing, and maintaining decision support technolo-gies, which can be prohibitively expensive when there is no economy ofscale to be achieved. Need to Navigate a Greater Number of Care Delivery Arrangements As discussed above, the ways in which M/SU and other health care providers are separated are more numerous and complex than is the casefor other health care generally. Not only is M/SU care separated fromgeneral health care, but health care services for mental and substance-useconditions are separated from each other despite the high rate of co-occurrence of these conditions. Also distinctive are the location of servicesneeded by individuals with more severe mental and substance-use illnessesin public-sector programs apart from private-sector health care, and reli-ance on the education, child welfare, and juvenile and criminal justicesystems to deliver M/SU services for many children and adults. These dis-connected care delivery arrangements necessitate numerous patient interac-tions with different providers, organizations, and government agencies.They also require multiple provider \"handoffs\" of patients for differentservices, and the transmittal of information to and joint planning by allthese providers, organizations, and agencies if coordination is to occur. Yeteffective structures and processes to ensure coordination of care acrossclinicians and organizations are not in place. This situation is exacerbatedby the widespread failure of general medical, mental health, and substance-TABLE 2-2 Percentage of Clinically Trained Specialty Mental Health Personnel Reporting Solo Practice as Their Primary or Secondary Place of Employment Percentage Reporting Solo Practice Primary Secondary Reporting Discipline Employment Employment YearPsychiatry 37.0 18.0 1998 Psychology 38.0 28.0 2002Social work 2000 Counseling 15.1 21.6 2002 Marriage/family therapy 34.9 28.5 2000 SOURCE: Duffy et al., 2004.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

These issues are discussed more fully in Chapter 5. Quality Measurement Infrastructure The infrastructure required to measure, analyze, publicly report on, and improve the quality of M/SU health care is less well developed than thatfor general health care. As a result, less measurement of the safety, effective-ness, and timeliness of M/SU health care has taken place (AHRQ, 2003;Garnick et al., 2002) (see Chapter 4). This situation exists for severalreasons. For example, multiple organizations and initiatives have put forthdifferent core measurement sets and different approaches to identifyingaspects of M/SU health care delivery to be measured. This problem is due inpart to the fact that conceptualizing a framework for M/SU health care ismore complex than is the case for general health care. The larger number ofdisciplines licensed to diagnose and treat M/SU problems and illnesses canrequire the involvement of a greater number of stakeholder groups in aconsensus process. Further, as noted above, consumers have been moreactive in shaping the delivery of M/SU health care than that of generalhealth care, again with implications for the numbers and diversity of stake-holders involved in a consensus process. Moreover, although general healthcare is delivered in both the private and public sectors, M/SU health care inthe public sector serves a population with a clinical profile much differentfrom that of those treated in the private sector\u2014more often those withsevere and chronic illnesses. Measures that may be meaningful to private-sector stakeholders may be less useful to those in the public sector, and viceversa. The separation of M/SU and general health care also has sometimes created confusion about which entity is accountable for the quality of carethat can be delivered through multiple arrangements (primary or specialtycare, a general or a \"carved out\" health plan, school-based programs, etc.).For example, measures of M/SU quality required of comprehensive managedcare organizations seeking accreditation are often not required of managedbehavioral health organizations (MBHOs) seeking accreditation from thesame organization. 4 Moreover, to produce many performance measures, data about the patient's entire illness\u2014from detection to ongoing treatment\u2014isrequired. When M/SU patients are served by arrangements such as carved-out managed behavioral health plans or employee assistance programs sepa-rate from their general health care plan or from each other, difficulties in 4Personal communication, Philip Renner, MBA, Assistant Vice President for Quality Mea- surement, National Committee for Quality Assurance, March 22, 2005.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Information Sharing and Technology The need to share patient information across providers so that care can be coordinated is widely acknowledged as necessary to effective and appro-priate care. This need was acknowledged most recently in regulations gov-erning the privacy of individually identifiable health information under theauthority of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPAA) of 1996. Under HIPAA regulations, the routine sharing of infor-mation for treatment, payment, or health care operations is permissiblewithout requiring patient consent. These regulations have provided someconsistency with respect to the sharing of information on general healthconditions and care, but much less so for M/SU health care. HIPAA itself requires that regulations promulgated to implement its pri- vacy provisions not supersede any more stringent provisions of state law per-taining to patient privacy. Each of the 50 states (and the District of Columbia)has a number of statutes that specifically govern aspects of mental healthrecords. Many of these statutes and regulations are more stringent than theHIPAA requirements, and the variation among them is great (see Appendix B).Moreover, separate federal laws govern the release of information pertaining toan individual's treatment for alcohol or drug use. These federal laws are alsosuperseded by state laws, which are more stringent. The preamble to theHIPAA privacy regulations recognizes the constraints of substance-use confi-dentiality laws and states that wherever one is more protective of privacy thanthe other, the more restrictive should govern. This means that clinicians provid-ing treatment to the many individuals with co-occurring mental, substance-use,and general health problems and illnesses need to comply with multiple regula-tions and laws governing the release of information, as well as policies pre-scribed by the organization or organizations under whose auspices they pro-vide care. This situation inhibits or at least confounds communications betweenM/SU and general health care providers. The need for an appropriate balancebetween privacy concerns and sharing of clinically relevant information amongproviders is addressed in Chapters 5 and 6. Finally, while use of electronic health records, decision support, and other information technology applications is growing in general healthcare, their use in M/SU health care is more limited. Greater Diversity of Types of Providers Although the diagnosis and treatment of general health conditions are typically limited to physicians, certain advanced practice nurses, and phy-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In addition to havingdiffering education, training, and therapeutic approaches, these cliniciansmay not be educated in clinical practice guidelines for evidence-based care,receive training in their use, understand them, or be motivated to applythem (Manderscheid et al., 2001). As a result, some clinicians may be morecommitted to \"schools\" of practice than to evidence-based eclecticism(Jackim, 2003). Also, differences in educational curriculums make it diffi-cult to credential providers in the large number of therapies in current use. Differences in the Marketplace State and local governments play a larger role in purchasing and deliv- ering M/SU health care compared with general health care (Hogan, 1999).In 2001, Medicaid (a state-administered program) and other state and localgovernment programs together paid for 52 percent of all M/SU health carein the United States, with Medicaid, the largest payer, representing morethan a quarter of all spending on mental health care (Mark et al., 2005).Medicaid funds pay primarily for mental health care; the major source offunds for substance-use health care is federal block grants to states, whichstates use to purchase or provide services directly. Moreover, M/SU spend-ing accounts for approximately 30 percent of all state and local spending(excluding Medicaid) for health care but represents only 4 percent of healthcare spending in the private sector. Between 1991 and 2001, annual spend-ing by private insurers for substance-use treatment did not keep pace withinflation and declined in real dollars. In 1991, private insurers paid for 24percent of all substance-use health care; in 2001 they paid for 13 percent(Mark et al., 2005). In general health care, payers are more often privateinsurers or the Medicare program. The greater financial attention to M/SU health care in the public sector has several ramifications. First, because of the larger role of state and localgovernments, there is greater variability in how M/SU health care can beaccessed and how providers are selected and reimbursed, as well as in thereporting requirements associated with the various local and state pro-grams. Second, the greater visibility and financial consequences of M/SU 5Dentists, chiropractors, and podiatrists also are licensed to treat, but typi- cally within proscribed domains.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Moreover, although access to M/SU health care for some individuals has improved over the past decade (Kessler et al., 2005; Mechanic andBilder, 2004), there are still unique obstacles to accessing these services.Insurers continue to impose greater limits on M/SU health care coverage byrequiring higher copayments and deductibles, limiting benefits (Bureau ofLabor Statistics, 2003), and excluding coverage altogether if an injuredindividual was under the influence of alcohol or some other drug (Cimons,2004). These cost and insurance issues are a leading reason reported byconsumers for not receiving needed M/SU treatment (SAMHSA, 2004). Further, individuals with substance-use illnesses themselves may im- pede their access to care in the marketplace. Individuals with substance-useproblems and illnesses who do not experience recovery on their own typi-cally do not seek treatment until their condition becomes so severe that theymust do so, or they are compelled by workplace problems, criminal of-fenses, and the like (Weisner and Schmidt, 2001). In a 2001 national surveyof individuals in recovery from alcohol or other drug illnesses and theirfamilies, 60 percent reported that denial of \"addiction\" or refusal to admitthe severity of the problem was the greatest barrier to their recovery. Em-barrassment or shame was the second most frequently cited obstacle (PeterD. Hart Research Associates, Inc., 2001). This is unfortunate because,as noted in Chapter 1, evidence shows that interventions delivered to pa-tients with substance-use problems and illnesses can reduce substance use(Bernstein et al., 2005; Fleming et al., 1997). APPLYING THE QUALITY CHASM APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS More detailed analyses of the above issues are presented in the follow- ing chapters. As a result of these analyses, the committee made an overallfinding and formulated an overarching recommendation concerning therelationship between M/SU and general health care. In addition, the com-mittee made two overall findings and formulated a second overarchingrecommendation pertaining to the feasibility of applying the Quality Chasm framework to M/SU health care. Relationship between M/SU and General Health Care In conducting its work, the committee, like many expert panels before it, was confronted by the \"destructive,\" \"artificial, centuries old separationCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Since that report was released, evidence for the effects of mental and substance-use problemsand illnesses on each other and on general health and health care continuesto accumulate (Bush et al., 2005; Katon, 2003; Kroenke, 2003). Depressionand anxiety disorders are strongly associated with somatic symptoms, suchas headache, fatigue, dizziness, and pain, that are the leading cause ofoutpatient medical visits and often medically unexplained (Kroenke, 2003).Similarly, substance-use problems and illnesses contribute to the misdiag-nosis, difficult management, and poor outcomes associated with many ofthe most pervasive medical illnesses in this country, such as chronic pain,sleep disorders, breast cancer, hypertension, diabetes, pneumonia, andasthma (Howard et al., 2004; Rehm et al., 2003; Saitz et al., 1997). A sub-stantial portion of individuals with chronic physical illnesses also have acomorbid M/SU problem or illness. A nationally representative survey ofAmericans found that among respondents with the four most commonchronic general illnesses (hypertension, arthritis, asthma, and ulcers), theloss of whole or partial work days was confined largely to those to thosewho had a co-occurring mental condition (Kessler et al., 2003). Examining in detail the effect of just one type of mental illness (depres- sion) on one general health care condition (heart attack), a recent Agencyfor Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence Report/TechnologyAssessment found that approximately one in five patients hospitalized for aheart attack suffers from major depression, and that the evidence is \"strik-ingly consistent\" that post-heart attack depression significantly increasesone's risk of death from heart-related or other causes. Patients with depres-sion are about three times more likely to die from a future heart attack orother heart problem. Fully 60-70 percent of individuals who become de-pressed when hospitalized for a heart attack continue to suffer from depres-sion for 1-4 or more months after discharge, and during the first yearfollowing a heart attack, those with major depression can experience adelay in returning to work, worse quality of life, and worse physical andpsychological health (Bush et al., 2005:5). Overall Finding. Mental, substance-use, and general illnesses are highly interrelated, especially with respect to chronic illness andinjury. Improving care delivery and health outcomes for any oneof the three depends upon improving care delivery and outcomesfor the others. Overarching Recommendation 1.

Applicability of the Quality Chasm Framework As a result of its analyses (contained in the succeeding chapters), the committee made the following two overall findings: Overall Finding. M/SU health care\u2014like general health care\u2014is often ineffective, not patient-centered, untimely, inefficient, inequitable,and at times unsafe. It, too, requires fundamental redesign. Overall Finding. The Quality Chasm recommendations for the redesign of health care are as applicable to M/SU health care asthey are to general health care. In light of the above findings, the committee makes the following rec- ommendation: Overarching Recommendation 2. The aims, rules, and strategies for redesign set forth in Crossing the Quality Chasm should be applied throughout M/SU health care on a day-to-day operational basis, buttailored to reflect the characteristics that distinguish care for theseproblems and illnesses from general health care.

Thefailure of many to understand the biological and medical natureof drug dependence creates additional stigma for those individualswhose alcohol or other drug use has progressed to physiologicaldependence. Moreover, coerced treatment, common in substance-use health care though less so in mental health care, raises thequestion of how all patients with M/SU illnesses can be the sourceof control for their treatment decisions. However, there is great diversity in the decision-making abilities of individuals with M/SU illnesses\u2014just as there is in the generalpopulation. Even when care is coerced, patients can and shouldhave a voice in the options available within their care plan. Activelysupporting these patients' decision making at the point of caredelivery can preserve respect for patient preferences, needs, andvalues and improve patient outcomes. The committee recommendsspecific actions that all clinicians, organizations, accrediting bodies,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html78 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS health plans, and purchasers involved in M/SU health care should take to ensure patient-centered care for individuals with M/SUproblems and illnesses. It further recommends actions to preservepatient-centered care when coercion into treatment is unavoidable. RULES TO HELP ACHIEVE PATIENT-CENTERED CARE Crossing the Quality Chasm defines \"patient-centered care\" as care that is \"respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensur[es] that patient values guide all clinical decisions\"(emphasis added) (IOM, 2001:40). A number of the rules for redesigninghealth care set forth in the Quality Chasm report (see Box 2-2 in Chapter 2) relate to achieving patient-centered care (see Box 3-1). The aim of patient-centered care and its associated rules emphasize (1) clinical care that is based on individual patient preferences, needs, values,and decision making; and (2) patient access to and receipt of informationthat permits well-informed health care decisions. Yet consumers of all typesof health care face substantial barriers to making such decisions. These BOX 3-1 Rules for Patient-Centered Care Customization based on patient needs and values. The system of care should be designed to meet the most common types of needs but have the capability to respond to individual patient choices and preferences. The patient as the source of control. Patients should be given the necessary information and the opportunity to exercise the degree of control they choose overhealth care decisions that affect them. The health system should be able to ac- commodate differences in patient preferences and encourage shared decision making. Shared knowledge and the free flow of information. Patients should have un- fettered access to their own medical information and to clinical knowledge. Clini-cians and patients should communicate effectively and share information. The need for transparency. The health care system should make available to patients and their families information that allows them to make informed deci- sions when selecting a health plan, hospital, or clinical practice, or choosing among alternative treatments. This should include information describing the sys-tem's performance on safety, evidence-based practice, and patient satisfaction. Anticipation of needs. The health system should anticipate patient needs, rather than simply reacting to events. SOURCE: IOM, 2001:8.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES 79 barriers include inadequate comparative information and poorly structured mechanisms to enable meaningful choices of plans, providers, and treat-ments 1; poor general and health literacy (IOM, 2004a); a tension that can sometimes occur between consumer-directed and evidence-based care (IOM,2001); and providers' lack of understanding of cultural differences. When one is diagnosed with a mental and/or substance-use (M/SU) illness (and sometimes an M/SU problem), additional obstacles to decisionmaking arise from the lingering stigma attached to some of these illnessesand from the practice of coerced treatment. The effects of this stigma andcoercion (especially as they relate to perceptions of patients as having im-paired decision-making abilities and posing a danger) are complex and havesubstantial ramifications for the delivery of patient-centered care. Theseissues and related evidence are presented in the following four sections ofthis chapter, which address, respectively: Effects of stigma and discrimination in impairing patient decision making, patient-centered care, and patient outcomes. Understanding theseeffects points to actions that can counteract stigma and discrimination. Two stereotypes that uniquely stigmatize individuals with M/SU problems and illnesses\u2014impaired decision making and dangerousness\u2014aswell as additional stigmatizing misperceptions about drug dependence. Coercion into treatment that results from concerns about impaired decision making and dangerousness. Actions clinicians, organizations, insurance plans, and governments (federal, state and local) can take to combat stigma and discrimination andsupport patient-centered care. The committee's recommendations for achieving patient-centered M/SU care are presented in the final section. HOW STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION IMPEDE PATIENT-CENTERED CARE \"Stigma\" is defined as the negative labeling and stereotyping of a group of individuals that is based on some observable trait they share and that 1Some consumer information needs and choices pertain to the patient's role as a consumer in the health care marketplace, that is, as a purchaser of health insurance and chooser of bothhealth plan and individual providers. Other information needs and choices relate to consum- ers' role within the patient-health care provider treatment relationship, one that involves selecting among different treatments and being active partners in the management of theirillness and recovery. This chapter addresses the individual's role as patient within the treat- ment relationship; the patient's role as informed consumer and purchaser in the health care marketplace is discussed in Chapter 8.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html80 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS leads to discrimination against them by individuals or society at large (Corrigan and Penn, 1999; Link and Phelan, 2001). \"Stigma\" refers to thenegative attitudes toward members of a group; \"discrimination\" refers tothe behaviors that result from these attitudes. Within a stigmatized group, different personal, social, and economic resources shape the lives and personal power of individual group membersand produce substantial variation in the extent to which any given memberpersonally experiences the effects of stigma (Link and Phelan, 2001). Nev-ertheless, American society as a whole\u2014like that of most if not all coun-tries\u2014has for centuries stigmatized individuals with M/SU illnesses anddiscriminated against them socially, in employment, and in their efforts tosecure such necessities of life as housing (Farina, 1998; Join Together,2003; SAMHSA, 2000). Although understanding of the causes of mentalillnesses has improved among the general population over the past 50 years,stigma continues (Hall et al., 2003; Pescosolido et al., undated) to varyingdegrees for individuals with different M/SU illnesses. In general, substance-use illnesses are more stigmatized than mental illnesses, and some mentalillnesses (e.g., schizophrenia) more than others (e.g., major depression)(Mann and Himelein, 2004; Martin et al., 2000). Two negative stereotypes in particular stigmatize individuals with M/SU illnesses and affect their ability to receive patient-centered care: (1)misperceptions about the extent to which individuals with various M/SUillnesses are capable of making decisions about their treatment, and (2)erroneous beliefs about the extent to which these individuals pose a dangerto themselves or others (Martin et al., 2000). 2 Individuals who have devel- oped physiological drug dependence may also suffer from the erroneousstereotype that their drug cravings and compulsion to continue using drugsin the face of serious adverse consequences are solely a matter of weakmoral character or lack of willpower (SAMHSA, 2000). This failure tounderstand the biological mechanisms and consequences of drug depen-dence interferes with these individuals' ability to participate in and receivecare that may be most effective in treating their chronic condition. Evidence pertaining to the above stereotypes is presented in the next section. In this section, we examine three ways in which these stereotypesthreaten the receipt of patient-centered care: (1) by lessening patients'ability to participate in the management of their illness and achievedesired treatment outcomes; (2) by encouraging pessimistic and non-therapeutic attitudes and behaviors among clinicians, making them less 2Individuals with mental illnesses also historically have been stereotyped as possessing a number of other negative attributes, such as lack of interpersonal skills; the display of alienat- ing behaviors; and among the seriously mentally ill, unattractive appearance (Farina, 1998; Martin et al., 2000).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES 81 likely to foster and support patients' self-management efforts; and (3) by promoting discriminatory public policies that create barriers to patient-centered care and recovery. All three of these effects of stereotyping cancontribute to poorer health outcomes (Link and Phelan, 2001). Under-standing them can point to ways of remedying them and thereby promot-ing patient-centered care. Adverse Effects on Patients' Ability to Manage Their Care and Achieve Desired Health Outcomes As noted below, the adverse effects of stigma lead down a pathway to diminished health outcomes. The steps along this pathway are depicted inFigure 3.1 and described below. 3Evidence suggests that actual experiences with social rejection are likely to be a more powerful influence than the expectation of rejection (Wright et al., 2000).Diminished Self-Esteem Stigma influences not just how individuals with M/SU illnesses are perceived by others, but also how they perceive themselves (Farina, 1998;Link and Phelan, 2001; Wahl, 1999; Wright et al., 2000). Individuals witha mental illness who have greater concerns about or experiences with stig-matization 3 have lower self-esteem (Link et al., 2001; Wright et al., 2000), perform more poorly on tasks (Farina, 1998), and have weaker social andleisure relationships and interactions (Perlick et al., 2001), all of which areassociated with a greater risk of relapse or no remission (Cronkite et al.,1998; Sherbourne et al., 1995). Among individuals with mental healthproblems, stigma also is associated with not taking prescribed medications(Sirey et al., 2001) and is a significant reason why some individuals donot seek treatment (SAMHSA, 2004b). Moreover, stigma leads to self-deprecation and compromised feelings of mastery over life circumstances(Wright et al., 2000), and thereby diminishes beliefs and expectations re-garding self-determination and the ability to make decisions on one's ownbehalf. In short, diminished self-esteem correlates with decreased belief in\"self-efficacy\" (Markowitz, 1998).Stigma Self-Esteem Self-Efficacy Ability to Manage Chronic Illness Health Outcomes/Recovery FIGURE 3-1 The stigma pathway to diminished health outcomes.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Self-efficacy beliefs touch every aspect of peoples' lives\u2014whether they thinkproductively, self-defeatedly, pessimistically, or optimistically; how wellthey motivate themselves and persevere in the face of adversity; their vul-nerability to stress and depression; the life choices they make; the courses ofaction they pursue; how much effort they will make in pursuing a course ofaction; and their emotional reactions to the course of events. Self-efficacyalso is a critical determinant of how well knowledge and skills are obtained(Pajares, 2002) and an excellent predictor of behavior. Unless people be-lieve they can produce desired events through their actions, they have littleincentive to act. Self-efficacy beliefs are constructed from four main sourcesof information: personal experience of mastery; vicarious experiencethrough others with capability, strength, and vulnerabilities (Bandura, 1997b). There is evidence that self-efficacy is key to individuals' successful self- management of a variety of chronic illnesses and achievement of resultingimprovements in health outcomes (Lorig and Holman, 2003; Lorig et al.,2001; Shoor and Lorig, 2002), as well as an important component ofrecovery from substance use (Samet et al., 1996). Self-efficacy is among themost powerful predictors of favorable posttreatment outcomes amongtreated alcohol patients (Project MATCH Research Group, 1998). It is alsotheorized to be a common mechanism in the effectiveness of psychosocialtreatments for a variety of mental illnesses (Bandura, 1997a; Mueser et al.,2002). Impaired Illness Self-Management Illness self-management encompasses the day-to-day tasks an individual carries out to live successfully with chronic illness(es). Experts in the studyof effective illness self-management interventions identify five core skillsneeded by patients: problem solving, decision making, resource utilization,formation of an effective patient-provider relationship, and taking action.These five skills are necessary to manage the effects of illness in three areas:medical or behavioral health practices, social and interpersonal role func-tioning, and emotional management (Lorig and Holman, 2003). These skillspertain, for example, to monitoring illness symptoms; using medicationsappropriately; practicing behaviors conducive to good health in such areasas nutrition, sleep, and exercise; employing stress reduction practices andmanaging negative emotions; using community resources appropriately;communicating effectively with health care providers; and practicing health-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Self-management support programs for a variety of chronic illnesses, including heart disease, lungdisease, stroke, and arthritis, have been shown to reduce pain and disabil-ity, lessen fatigue, decrease needed visits to physicians and emergency rooms,and increase self-reported energy and health. These improvements in healthoutcomes are strongly associated with increased self-efficacy (Bodenheimeret al., 2002a; Lorig and Holman, 2003; Lorig et al., 2001). 4 Components of illness self-management for individuals with chronic mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar illness (i.e., psycho-education, behavioral practices to support taking medications appropriately,relapse prevention, and teaching of coping skills and actions to alleviatesymptoms) also have been developed, tested, and found effective in address-ing many of the behaviors necessary for patient recovery (Mueser et al.,2002). A standardized approach for illness self-management has been devel-oped and empirically validated by Stanford University (Stanford UniversitySchool of Medicine, 2005). Illness self-management also is included as one ofthe six essential components of the Chronic Care Model (Bodenheimer et al.,2002b), which is discussed in Chapter 5 and is achieving improved healthoutcomes for a variety of physical and mental illnesses. Weakened Patient Activation and Self-Determination Self-efficacy and self-management also are related to \"patient activation\" and \"patient self-determination.\" \"Patient activation\"refers to the constellation of skills, knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors neces-sary for an individual to manage a chronic illness successfully (Von Korff etal., 1997). An \"activated\" patient also is one of the key elements of theChronic Care Model (Bodenheimer et al., 2002a). Self-determination theoryis concerned with individuals' innate inner resources for personality devel-opment and behavioral regulation and how these resources are influencedby social contexts so as to affect human motivation (Ryan and Deci,2000). Research in this area has established the central importance to self-determination of three innate psychological needs: self-perceived compe-tence (self-efficacy, discussed above), autonomy, and relatedness. This re-search also has shown that people must perceive themselves as competent 4A recent analysis of self-management education programs (Warsi et al., 2004) found a small to moderate effect on outcomes for some clinical conditions (diabetes and hypertension) but no significant consistent benefit for asthma programs. This same analysis noted widevariation in the methodologies used and inconsistent reporting of measures of self-efficacy in these programs. Experts caution that many programs calling themselves self-management programs do not teach all the core skills involved and fail to address the necessary scope ofissues (Lorig and Holman, 2003).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Whether one is discussing patient self-management, self-activation, or self-determination, the underlying theme is the same: patients' behaviorswill be determined by how meaningful a given problem is to them and howcapable of resolving the problem they perceive themselves to be. As de-scribed above, stigma can adversely affect individuals' self-efficacy beliefs,their ability to manage their M/SU illness, and thereby their recovery. Clini-cians, through their clinical expertise and close relationship with their pa-tients, should be vehicles for increasing their clients' beliefs in their self-efficacy. However, not all providers foster their patients' self-efficacy beliefsand support patient decision making\u2014the second way in which stigmaobstructs patient-centered care. Stigma Affects Clinician Attitudes and Behaviors Because of their scientific knowledge and special relationship with their patients, clinicians have a singular opportunity through their attitudes andpractices to promote patient self-esteem, self-efficacy, decision making abouttreatment, illness self-management practices, and recovery. While manyhealth care professionals exemplify these positive attitudes and relatedpractices in their treatment relationships with their patients, some do not.Testimony to the committee from consumer groups (Bergeson, 2004;Leibfried, 2004) revealed that poor provider support for patients' decisionmaking and illness self-management and pessimistic beliefs about their abili-ties were serious obstacles to their decision making and recovery. As articu-lated by one speaker (Bergeson, 2004): We believe that the majority of physicians and other health care providers must fundamentally change their approach toward their patients, an ap- proach revealed through the use of that \"special voice.\" Sadly, far too many professionals have a manner of speaking to us as if we are slightlystupid children. It's that voice that reminds us that we aren't really partners in care with our health care providers. No matter that we may know more aboutthe latest efficacy data on specific medications than our doctors; no mat- ter that we may be following rTMS and vagus nerve studies as treatment options and our nurses haven't even heard of them; no matter that wemay be aware of the outcomes of CBT [cognitive behavioral therapy] with bipolar patients, and our talk therapist\u2014who is most frequently a social worker\u2014isn't schooled in the fundamentals of CBT. It's that voice that reminds us that health care providers still think of themselves as taking care of us, instead of working with us. It's the voice of learned helplessness.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES 85 Such negative and discouraging attitudes and practices are a serious problem. Experts in self-efficacy research note that it is usually easier toweaken self-efficacy beliefs through negative appraisals than to strengthenthem through positive comments (Pajares, 2002). With respect to treatment for substance dependence, some providers hold the stereotypical view discussed above that fails to understand thebiological aspects of dependence and regards the illness simply as a matterof failed willpower or weak character. As a result, a treatment provider orprogram may not offer or support a patient's choice to use medications,such as methadone, to treat the illness. Nontherapeutic clinician attitudes and behaviors may have several sources. First, health care providers, through general societal acculturation,initially can be expected to hold the same attitudes and beliefs about indi-viduals with M/SU illnesses as society at large unless they have had substan-tial prior contact with such individuals (Corrigan et al., 2001; Kolodziejand Johnson, 1996) and/or been assimilated into a different culture thatcounteracts this misinformation. However, the clinical settings in whichsome graduate mental health students receive their training provide pre-dominantly inpatient as opposed to outpatient care. Graduate education ofmedical residents, for example, has been slow to shift training away frominpatient settings (Hoge et al., 2002). Clinical training in inpatient settings,as opposed to the ambulatory settings in which most individuals receivetreatment, provides experience with patients with mental illnesses duringtheir most acutely ill phase and may thus reinforce a view of those withsuch illnesses as being more disabled than is the case. Moreover, mostacademic education and training programs for clinicians focus on the cog- nitive domain of learning, along with some skill development. Few pro- grams have content or instructional strategies targeting the affective or attitudinal domain of learning. Thus it should not be a surprise that clini-cians' attitudes may mirror those of society at large and be unchanged bytheir education (Stuart et al., 2004). Also, as discussed in Chapter 7, education of the general health care workforce has addressed substance-use illnesses inadequately. To the ex-tent that health care providers do not understand and have knowledge ofalcohol and drug dependence as distinct diseases, their treatment of theseillnesses will be ineffective. Unfortunately, evidence presented in Chapter 4indicates that such poor understanding and limited knowledge may bewidespread. In one study, treatment of alcohol problems and illnesses na-tionally ranked the lowest on measures of health care quality for a widevariety of illnesses (McGlynn et al., 2003). Moreover, the terminology used by society to refer to M/SU health care is different from that used in general health care and may foster stigmatiz-ing beliefs. For example, \"mental illness\" often is used as a singular nounCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html86 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS instead of the plural \"mental illnesses.\" Research indicates that some people attach different levels of stigma to different mental illnesses, based in parton the extent to which a given illness is perceived as treatable (Mann andHimelein, 2004). Consistent with this attitude, surveys of the public show areluctance to label an individual as \"mentally ill,\" but a greater willingnessto use more-specific mental health labels, such as \"schizophrenia,\" \"majordepression,\" or \"alcohol dependence\" (Link et al., 1999). A one-size-fits-alllabel of \"mental illness\" could foster a perception that all mental illnesseshave equal consequences, disabilities, and handicaps, and perhaps contrib-ute to stereotyping. In contrast, we no longer typically refer to individualsas having \"cancer\" as if it is a single disease; rather, we more often (andmore accurately) refer to them as having leukemia, breast cancer, mela-noma, lung cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, etc. A parallel can also bedrawn with references to HIV, measles, tuberculosis, and so on instead ofsimply \"infectious disease.\" In addition, some terminology and phrasing used in M/SU health care is different from that commonly used in general health care and may encour-age clinicians' nontherapeutic attitudes. For example, the terms mental\"disorders\" (as in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor- ders [DSM]) and emotional \"disturbances\" 5 are used to describe mental illnesses, problems, and symptoms. In general health care, the terms \"disor-ders,\" \"disordered\" and \"disturbance\" are used less frequently. The Inter-national Classification of Diseases (ICD), the coding system used in theUnited States and worldwide for the collection and analysis of health caredata, generally uses the terminology \"diseases,\" \"conditions,\" \"symptoms,\"\"problems,\" and \"complaints\" for most health conditions but, like theDSM, typically refers to mental illnesses and conditions as \"disorders\"(AMA, 2001). Calling mental and emotional problems and illnesses \"disor-ders\" and \"disturbances\" disinclines those so labeled and those applyingthe labels to think of individuals thus afflicted as having an illness, a condi-tion, symptoms, or perhaps a \"problem\" that is amenable to short-termintervention. Rather, these labels could contribute to a perception thatmental illnesses and problems should be viewed differently from most gen-eral health care illnesses, symptoms, and problems. Moreover, the phrasing \"serious and persistent,\" used in some federal laws to refer to a subset of mental illnesses, has no counterpart in generalmedical care, which describes general illnesses with similar consequences as\"severe\" and \"chronic.\" The word \"serious,\" for example, is not used ingeneral health care terminology such as that in the ICD (e.g., it is not 5The term \"serious emotional disturbance\" is found in multiple federal statutes and regula- tions (e.g., the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA], Public Law 101-476) and has thus pervaded the vocabulary of mental health care for children.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES 87 common to talk about \"serious\" cancers). The term \"persistent\" could connote a lack of belief in the ability to improve and recover. A less pejora-tive and clinically more meaningful way to categorize individuals withmental illnesses that are accompanied by chronic functional limitationsmight be to refer to them as having mild, moderate, or severe disabilityassociated with a mental illness symptom or diagnosis, rather than referringto them as \"seriously\" mentally ill. The use of the word \"abuse\" as opposed to substance \"use\" or \"depen- dence\" also has been identified as pejorative. It implies that alcohol or otherdrug dependence connotes a \"willful commission of an abhorrent (wrongand sinful) act\" and misstates the nature of alcohol or drug use and depen-dence (White, undated:4). Recognizing the power of terminology to contribute to stigma, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA)National Treatment Plan Initiative for improving substance abuse healthcare called for a language audit to identify problems inherent in the termi-nology used in the field and in public discussions, and for the developmentof a nonstigmatizing taxonomy to describe alcoholism, drug \"addiction,\"and available treatments and services (SAMHSA, 2000). A similar processcould be beneficial in reducing stigmatizing language used throughout themental health field. Finally, major factors in clinicians' beliefs and behaviors may be no- tions of M/SU patients' inability to make decisions competently and diffi-culties encountered when individuals are coerced into treatment\u2014a com-mon occurrence for those entering treatment for substance use. Evidence onboth of these factors is discussed later in this chapter. Relationship Between Stigma and Discriminatory Policies The discrimination that results from stigma can be direct from person to person, such as that described above, or may involve an individual in aposition of authority denying employment, housing, or a social relation-ship to an individual who is a member of a stigmatized group. Morestructurally imbedded societal discrimination can also occur, as whentreatment settings are located in more disadvantaged neighborhoods orwhen society decides to expend fewer resources on a stigmatized group(Corrigan and Watson, 2003; Link and Phelan, 2001). Thus, the effects ofstigma extend beyond the attitudes and practices of individual membersof the public, patients, and clinicians to influence public policy as well\u2014the third way in which stigma obstructs patient-centered care. The mostvisible manifestation of this level of discrimination is the more limitedinsurance coverage of M/SU health care compared with general healthcare. Such discrimination is also seen in public policies that impose addi-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Discrimination in Health Insurance Coverage Coverage of mental health care Despite federal and state laws aimed at encouraging equal coverage of mental health and other health benefitsoffered by employers, 6 the National Compensation Survey of private em- ployers, conducted in 2000 by the Department of Labor, documented thatinpatient and outpatient mental health care is less often covered in em-ployee health benefit plans than is general health care. Approximately 7percent of employees with medical care benefits do not have inpatient oroutpatient mental health care included in their benefit package. Of the 93percent of employees with mental health benefits, 85 and 93 percent aresubject to limitations on inpatient and outpatient mental health benefits,respectively, that are more restrictive than those on general medical ben-efits. The most common difference is more restrictions on inpatient days ofcare and outpatient visits, experienced by 76 and 72 percent of employees,respectively. Higher copayments or coinsurance for inpatient and outpa-tient care are also experienced by 16 and 50 percent, respectively (Bureauof Labor Statistics, 2003). 7 Results of a 2002 survey of public employers indicate that limitations on inpatient and outpatient days of care may have increased over the pastfew years, while cost sharing has declined (Barry et al., 2003). In 2003,27 percent of workers in public and private firms with three or moreworkers were restricted to 20 or fewer outpatient visits per year, and 37percent were restricted to 21-30 inpatient days per year. An additional13 percent were limited to 20 or fewer inpatient days per year (Claxton etal., 2003). These benefit limits most often are reached by individuals withsome of the most severe mental illness diagnoses, including depression,bipolar illness, and psychoses. Moreover, some state laws narrowly definemental illness to include only specific diagnoses, such as schizophrenia, 6The Mental Health Parity Act, passed by Congress in 1996, prohibited annual or lifetime dollar limits on coverage in firms with 50 or more employees unless equal limits were placed on nonmental health care. However, the law did not prohibit other types of benefit coveragedisparities, such as different copayment requirements and limits on outpatient visits or inpa- tient days. Also, although 34 states have enacted some form of parity legislation, these laws vary greatly in the population covered, types of limitations prohibited, and excluded diag-noses (Barry et al., 2003). 7The Medicare program similarly requires a 50 percent copayment for visits to a psychia- trist, in contrast to a 20 percent copayment for visits for other illnesses.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

There is also evidence that benefit limits are reached more often by children than adults (Peele et al., 1999). In addition, some specific diag-noses that are common in childhood, such as autism, attention deficit hy-peractivity disorder (ADHD), and conduct disorders, are excluded fromcoverage under certain private health benefit plans (Peck and Scheffler,2002; Peele et al., 2002). In other cases, benefits are constructed in waysthat prevent effective treatment for some childhood conditions (Peck andScheffler, 2002). The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that such limitations on insurance coverage contribute to the phenomenon wherebysome families resort to placing their children (most often adolescents withsevere mental illness) in the child welfare or juvenile justice system eventhough the family is not neglectful or abusive of the child, and the child hascommitted no criminal or delinquent act. Because the child welfare andjuvenile justice systems often have ways of paying for mental health ser-vices, they are used by parents for this purpose even though they were notdesigned to care for children who have not been abused or neglected orcommitted a criminal or delinquent act (GAO, 2003). Doing so sometimesrequires parents to give up legal custody of their children and place them inan out-of-home residential or foster care setting (Giliberti and Schulzinger,2000). In 2001, 19 states and 30 counties estimated that 12,700 children intheir jurisdictions were placed in the child welfare or juvenile justice systemfor the purpose of receiving mental health services. Because there is nosystematic tracking of these children, the extent to which this phenomenonoccurs nationally is unknown; however, GAO states that it is likely higherthan the numbers reported by this limited number of states (GAO, 2003).In Virginia alone, for example, 2,008 children\u2014approximately 1 of every 4children in Virginia's foster care system as of June 1, 2004\u2014were thereeither because mental health care was not fully covered by the parents'insurance or because the family did not have access to any insurance(Jenkins, 2004). Coverage of substance-use health care Individuals with substance-use ill- nesses face even greater discrimination in insurance coverage than thosewith mental illnesses. Fewer employer-sponsored health plans coversubstance-use treatment than cover either general or mental health care.Only 84 and 85 percent of employers providing medical care benefits,respectively, have coverage for outpatient drug or alcohol rehabilitation,compared with 100 percent who have coverage for general hospital andphysician office visits and 93 percent who have coverage for inpatient andoutpatient mental health care. When coverage for substance-use illnesses isCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For example, some policies provide foronly two lifetime episodes of treatment for substance-use problems or ill-nesses. 8 Although as of 2000, 41 states and the District of Columbia either explicitly included substance-use treatment within the scope of their men-tal health benefit laws or had separate statutes addressing substance-usetreatment coverage, 13 of these state laws covered only treatment for alco-holism, as opposed to treatment for other drug use (GAO, 2000). Moreover, private insurers sometimes deny insurance claims for the care of an injury sustained by an individual if he or she was intoxicated orunder the influence of any narcotic at the time of the injury. A late 1998review of insurance statutes in all 50 states found that 38 states and theDistrict of Columbia allowed policies that denied health insurance coveragefor injuries due to alcohol use (Rivara et al., 2000). Representative data donot exist on the extent to which insurance plans exercise these provisions.However, provider perceptions that this may occur and result in denial ofreimbursement discourage emergency departments and trauma centers fromscreening for alcohol use (Cimons, 2004)\u2014this despite the strong associa-tions between alcohol use and trauma and the effectiveness of screening andbrief interventions in reducing substance use (D'Onofrio and Degutis, 2002;Gentilello et al., 2005; Moyer et al., 2002). Insurance discrimination is not limited to private-sector insurance pro- grams. The traditional Medicare indemnity program (the fee-for-serviceprogram in which the great majority of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled)covers mental health and substance-use care. However the outpatient ben-efit requires relatively high cost sharing (50 percent), except for medicationmanagement (20 percent copayment). Other Discriminatory Public Policies Restrictions on access to student loans for some drug offenses Because federal student loan programs can help pay for higher education, they canplay an important part in helping individuals realize their plans for recov-ery from substance-use illnesses. However, the 1998 Amendments to theHigher Education Act of 1965 added a provision 9 that makes an individual convicted (in the criminal as opposed to juvenile justice system) of thepossession or sale of a controlled substance ineligible to receive any federalgrant, loan, or work assistance funding for higher education.

These restrictions are placed on anindividual in addition to the sentence imposed by the criminal justice sys-tem. Eligibility can be reinstated subsequent to satisfactory completion ofan approved drug rehabilitation program (which is defined liberally butmust include at least two unannounced drug tests). This law does notinclude alcohol-related convictions, such as multiple drunk-driving convic-tions or manslaughter as a result of drunk driving. Nor does it prohibitstudent loans for individuals convicted of non-drug-related violent crimes,such as assault, rape, or murder. Potential lifetime ban on receipt of food stamps or welfare for felony drug conviction Under section 115 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (often referred to as the \"WelfareReform Act\"), individuals convicted of a state or federal felony offense ofpossession, use, or sale of drugs (i.e., controlled substances, not alcohol)are subject to a ban on receiving federal cash assistance (Temporary Assis- tance for Needy Families [TANF] or \"welfare\") and food stamps, even ifthey serve the full term of their sentence, unless the state in which theyreside has passed legislation opting out of or mitigating this restriction. 10,11 Moreover, although a convicted individual cannot be included in the calculation of household size for TANF benefits or food stamps, his or herincome and resources are included in calculating eligibility for foodstamps. 12 Including the ineligible person's income in determining food stamp benefits penalizes the entire household, which is thereby eligible for lessassistance each month. This and the TANF provisions diminish the re-sources available to convicted individuals living in poverty to change theirlife circumstances in ways that are important to achieving recovery.

EVIDENCE COUNTERS STEREOTYPES OF IMPAIRED DECISION MAKING AND DANGEROUSNESS Two Harmful Stereotypes: Incompetent Decision Making and Dangerousness The 1996 General Social Survey of the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of Americans documented the extent to which Americans believe individu-als with M/SU illnesses are incompetent to make decisions and are a dangerto themselves or others (Pescosolido et al., 1999): More than a third (36 percent) of Americans believed that indi- viduals with major depression are \"not very able\" or \"not able at all\" tomake decisions about their treatment; 74 percent believed this to be true forindividuals with schizophrenia. A minority (6.8 percent) further believedthat an individual with a mental health \"problem\" not severe enough to beconsidered a mental illness also is not very able or not able at all to maketreatment decisions. The public perceived those with drug problems as least competent in decision making. About half (51 percent) believed individuals with alcoholdependence are not very able or not able at all to make decisions about theirtreatment; 72.1 percent believed this of individuals with cocaine dependence. The belief that individuals with major depression are \"very likely\" to do something violent to others was held by 9.2 percent; 12.8 percentbelieved this of individuals with schizophrenia. The percentages were higherfor individuals with dependence on alcohol (17.5 percent) and cocaine (42percent). As the public's perception of the seriousness of an individual's condition increased, so, too, did the belief in that individual's dangerous-ness, while belief in the person's competence to make decisions decreased. Significantly, the proportion of Americans who associated mental illness with \"violent or dangerous behavior\" in 1996 was nearly doublethat found in the 1950 General Social Survey (Pescosolido et al., undated). Such beliefs are inconsistent with the evidence (discussed below) that a clear majority of individuals with mental illnesses (including those withsevere illnesses such as schizophrenia) and substance-use illnesses are ableto make treatment and other life decisions, and do not represent a danger tothemselves or others. Stereotypes of incompetent decision making and dan-gerousness are refuted by strong evidence showing great diversity in theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Variable proportions of \"normal\"research subjects have been found to have deficits in decision making.Many situations (e.g., stress, serious illness, pain, or, more commonly, poorjudgment) can undermine mentally healthy people's decision-making ca-pacity. Moreover, individuals with M/SU illnesses are a minor source of theacts of violence committed in society; most acts of violence are committedby individuals who traditionally would not be considered mentally ill. Evidence on Decision-Making Capacity 13 Conceptual Framework The process of determining the decision-making capacity of any indi- vidual (whether with or without an M/SU illness) can be conceptualized asinvolving three interrelated sets of factors: (1) the individual's innate abili-ties at a point in time to understand, appreciate, reason, and communicatepreferences; (2) the risks and benefits inherent in the specific decision to bemade; and (3) the knowledge and biases of the person making the judgmentabout the capacity of the individual in question. The influence of each ofthese factors on decision-making capability is discussed below. Ability to understand, appreciate, reason, and communicate preferences Analyses and reviews of the legal and ethics literature over many years haveidentified several abilities as integral to the concept of \"competence\"(Appelbaum and Grisso, Beauchamp, Roth et al., 1977). The abilities to understand, ap-preciate, reason, and communicate one's preferences are those most oftenaccepted as salient in the clinical setting, cited in major policy recommenda-tions, and used in clinical reports on competence (American Psychiatric Asso-ciation, 1998; Appelbaum and Grisso, 1995; Berg et al., 1996; NationalBioethics Advisory Commission, 1998). The model based on these four abili-ties was developed, operationalized, and tested over the past two decades 13Much of the evidence and discussion in this section is from three papers commissioned by the committee: \"Impact of Mental Illness and Substance-Related Disorders on Decision- Making Capacity and Its Implications for Patient-Centered Mental Health Care Delivery\" byScott Kim, MD, PhD, Department of Psychiatry and the Program for Improving Health Care Decisions, University of Michigan Medical School; \"Capacity to Consent to or Refuse Treat- ment and/or Research: Theoretical Considerations\" by Elyn R.

This model is the basisfor three generations of instruments (Appelbaum et al., 1999; Grisso et al.,1995, 1997) employed in studies of decision making involving persons withgeneral medical illness (heart disease) (Grisso and Appelbaum, 1995; Grissoet al., 1995), schizophrenia (Carpenter et al., 2000; Grisso and Appelbaum,1995; Grisso et al., 1997), major depression (Appelbaum et al., 1999; Grissoand Appelbaum, 1995), HIV (Moser et al., 2002), and Alzheimer's disease(Kim et al., 2001) disease. 14 In this model: Understanding refers to an individual's ability to comprehend rele- vant facts. The individual need not be able to apply, believe, or ac- knowledge that the facts pertain to him or herself. For instance, onemight be able to explain that doctors are recommending a specific course of treatment and clearly articulate their rationale, and yet refuse to believe that this rationale applies to one's own case (Appel-baum et al., 1982). The concept of understanding thus has a fairly narrow meaning. Appreciation is the ability to apply the facts of a situation to oneself. Reasoning refers to the formal aspects of decision making, such as the ability to compare, make judgments about probability, and think about the consequences of potential actions (Grisso and Appelbaum,1998). It does not refer to the reasonableness of the content of a belief; rather, the focus is on the process of arriving at a decision. Evidencing a choice is a minimal, necessary requirement. When these functional abilities are fully intact, the person's decision- making capability is not in question (Meisel, 1998). When these functionalabilities are obviously absent (for example, when a patient is in a catatonicstate and unable even to express a preference), the determination of in-capacity also is straightforward. The determination is more difficult whendecision-making abilities fall somewhere in between. For example, as dis-cussed below, multiple studies using various methodologies have shownthat persons with schizophrenia have impairments in the abilities neededfor informed consent (Grisso and Appelbaum, 1995; Grisso et al., 1997;Grossman and Summers, 1980). Given such impairment, how do we decidewhether individuals are competent to decide for themselves? Two other setsof factors have been identified as influencing the competency determination 14Although this is the most widely cited model, it is not without its critics (Charland, 1998; Kapp and Mossman, 1996; Saks, 1999; Slobogin, 1996) since what is being attempted is measurement of a fairly abstract and (at least in part) socially constructed concept. Also, while this terminology is that used most frequently, there is some variability in the way these terms are interpreted (Saks and Jeste, 2004).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES 95 process: the risk context, and the knowledge and characteristics of those making the judgment about decision-making capacity. Contextual risk-benefit factors It is widely accepted that decision-making capacity should be measured separately for different types of decisions, ratherthan inferring a uniform ability or inability to make all decisions on the basis of a specific diagnosis or a generic cognitive screening test (Grisso andAppelbaum, 1998). Thus there are many types of decision-making competen-cies, such as competence to give informed consent to research, to give in-formed consent to medical treatment, to make a will, and to manage finances. It also is widely held that the threshold for finding an individual ca- pable of making a decision (Grisso and Appelbaum, 1998) and/or the crite-ria used to make such a finding (Appelbaum et al., 1998; Cournos et al.,1993) should vary depending upon the risks and benefits involved (i.e.,when the stakes are higher, a higher level of ability is necessary). Althoughthere is some philosophical debate about this risk-related model of compe-tence (Brock, 1991; Cale, 1999; Wicclair, 1991), statements (American Psychiatric Association, 1998; Keyserlingk,1995; National Bioethics Advisory Commission, 1998; New York Depart-ment of Health Advisory Work Group on Human Subject Research Involv-ing the Protected Classes, 1999; Office of the Maryland Attorney General,1998). Moreover, many clinicians report adhering to this model in practice(Masand et al., 1998; Umapathy et al., 1999). The application of this modelhas implications for designing and implementing an overall evaluation pro-cess, especially when standards for competence are being set. For example,whether a person is capable of participating in a self-directed mental healthservices program may depend not only on that person's abilities, but alsoon the extent to which decision-making assistance is provided and safetynet practices are in place so that any adverse events are anticipated andprocedures exist for their prevention and management. Characteristics of the competency evaluator Ideally, individuals making judgments about others' decision-making capability would use only objec-tive evidence on the relevant abilities of the subject and information on therisks and benefits of the situation to make such a judgment. However, anevaluator who places greater value on protecting an individual from potentialharm may, for any given risk-benefit scenario, require a higher thresholdof ability than another evaluator who tends to err on the side of allowing theperson to determine his or her own course (Faden and Beauchamp, 1986).Thus, determinations of competency status inevitably involve value judg-ments (National Bioethics Advisory Commission, 1998; Roth et al., 1977). Most studies of decision-making capability conducted to date have focused on the abilities of the individual; however, application of the dataCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Currently, there is no \"gold standard\" oralgorithm that can be used by competency evaluators to make a finaldecision about an individual's decision-making capability (Grisso andAppelbaum, 1998). Decision-Making Abilities of Individuals with and without M/SU IllnessesMental illnesses Most research on decision-making capability in mental health has involved persons who might be expected to have the greatestimpairments in this capability\u2014those with chronic psychoses such asschizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Individuals with less severe ill-nesses, such as depression, have less often been the subjects of such re-search; however, findings to date suggest that this lack of research atten-tion may be appropriate. Mild to moderate depression, for example,appears to have little effect on decision-making capability; even inpatientswith depression tend to perform quite well on decision-making capacityinterviews (Appelbaum et etal., 2001; Vollmann et al., 2003). Severe depression without dementia orpsychosis also is not associated with severe impairments in decision-makingcapability (Bean et al., 1994; Lapid et al., 2003). The findings of research on decision-making capability involving indi- viduals with psychotic symptoms also are encouraging: Although as a group, persons with psychotic symptoms exhibit impaired decision-making capability to a greater extent than non-mentallyill individuals, there is considerable heterogeneity within the group. Psychotic symptoms have less influence on decision-making capa- bility than do cognitive abilities (i.e., the ability to remember, learn, under-stand, and reason). In this respect, individuals with severe mental illnesses,such as schizophrenia, that can affect cognition (Goldman-Rakic, 1994)may have much in common with those having other chronic general medi-cal conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or braininjury, that can impair brain functioning, memory, and cognition, as well asindividuals who are otherwise considered healthy but make poor decisions. There is substantial evidence that understanding of factual infor- mation (even among persons with psychotic symptoms) can be improvedthrough interventions. Difference in decision-making ability Despite methodological hetero- geneity and idiosyncrasies, studies over time consistently have found im-paired understanding in persons with schizophrenia as a group (Benson etCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES 97 al., 1988; Grossman and Summers, 1980; Irwin et al., 1985; Munetz and Roth, 1985; Roth et al., 1982; Schacter et al., 1994). The most significantstudy to date, the MacArthur Treatment Competence Study (Grisso andAppelbaum, 1995), found that persons with schizophrenia performed worsethan their normal counterparts on every measure of decision-making abil-ity. Using a psychometrically derived threshold score defined as the bottom5 percent of the normal controls, about 25 percent of those with schizo-phrenia failed on any given measure of decision-making ability. Further, 52percent of those with schizophrenia failed on at least one such measure.Subsequent studies have yielded similar findings (Carpenter et al., 2000;Grisso et al., 1997; Moser et al., 2002; Vollmann et al., 2003). Even whenthe capacity construct is operationalized very differently, the pattern ofgroup impairment is found (Saks et al., 2002). Despite this unequivocal evidence for impaired decision-making capa- bility in persons with chronic psychoses as a group, there is tremendouswithin-group heterogeneity (Palmer et al., 2004). For example, in theMacArthur study of acutely ill psychotic patients with symptoms severeenough for psychiatric inpatient admission, nearly half performed ad-equately on all the subscales relevant to decision-making capability. Thisheterogeneity is so great that any policy that ignores it will be either toorestrictive or too permissive for large proportions of this population. Forexample, while it may appear from an intuitive standpoint that patientswith obvious and severe psychotic symptoms (e.g., actively hallucinating ordelusional) may be readily identified as lacking decision-making capability,this is apparently not the case. Poor decision-making abilities better predicted by cognitive than by psychotic symptoms Some contemporary models of decision-making ca- pacity suggest that certain cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, informationprocessing, and executive functions) underlie specific tasks involved in deci-sional capacity (Dymek et al., 2001; Marson and Harrell, 1999; Marson etal., 1996, 1997). Among older persons with schizophrenia, diabetes, orAlzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment has been shown to be a signifi-cant predictor of decisional capacity (Palmer et al., 2004); this is the caseeven within diagnostic groups. Consistent with these findings, research hasshown that although patients' decision-making performance is correlatedmodestly with psychotic symptoms, it is correlated more strongly withcognitive dysfunction (Moser et al., 2002; Palmer et al., 2004; Saks et al.,2002). In total, these findings suggest that decisional incapacity is bestconceptualized as a reflection of brain dysfunction resulting in cognitiveimpairment, rather than as a direct by-product of positive symptoms ofpsychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions. The lay perception ofschizophrenia, defined largely by positive symptoms, thus poorly predictsCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Decisional capacity is a multidimensional con- struct reflecting the interaction of a wide range of patient characteristicsand contextual/environmental factors. Ability of interventions to improve decision-making capability The ability to understand the factual elements of informed consent has been shownto be highly responsive to interventions aimed at improving performance(Moser et al., 2002; Stiles et al., 2001; Wirshing et al., 1998; Wong et al.,2000). For example, a comparison of routine informed consent and consentenhanced by an educational session for older, chronically psychotic individu-als and normal controls found that although the patient group performedworse than the controls on a comprehension test, the patient group thatreceived education to enhance consent showed comprehension similar to thatof the normal group (Dunn et al., 2002). In another study, even those whoperformed very poorly on an understanding scale tended to improve consider-ably with a remediation session, to the point where their performance as agroup became comparable to that of the normal control group (Carpenter etal., 2000). However, few data exist on the effects of such interventions onother decision-making abilities, such as appreciation and reasoning. Summary The evidence detailed above shows that it is inappropriate to draw conclusions about individuals' capacity for decision making solely onthe basis of whether they are mentally ill, or even whether they have aparticular mental illness, such as schizophrenia. Many people with mentalillnesses\u2014indeed, many with severe mental illnesses\u2014are not incompetent on most measures of competency. Even among patients hospitalized withschizophrenia, the MacArthur researchers found only 25 percent incompe-tent on any given measure, and only 50 percent if the measures were aggre-gated (Grisso and Appelbaum, 1998). Other studies have found a higherproportion of individuals with schizophrenia to be competent in decisionmaking (Saks et al., 2002). The evidence shows that poor decision makinghas a stronger relationship to cognitive problems (e.g., problems withmemory, attention, learning, and thought) and deficiencies in higher-levelexecutive functions than to the symptoms of mental illness, such as psycho-sis. The minority who experience a decline in such cognitive abilities be-cause of their mental illness may not be very different from individuals whohave general medical conditions such as cerebrovascular disease, are underthe effects of serious emotional stress or in pain, or generally have lowerabilities to understand and analyze information. Simple screening instru-ments are needed to allow evaluators to determine when a more thoroughinvestigation is warranted, and it may be that such screening is just asappropriate when patients are seriously physically ill as when they areseriously mentally ill.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For example, although manifestations of in-toxication vary greatly\u2014according to the individual, the substance, thedose, the duration of exposure to the drug, the period of time since the lastdose, and other factors\u2014individuals intoxicated from use of any substanceare likely to have impaired cognition and judgment, including disturbancesof perception, attention, and thinking; mood lability; belligerence; and im-paired social functioning. These symptoms may be short-lived or persistfor hours or days beyond the time when the substance is detectable inbodily fluids (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Apart from these known cognitive and behavioral characteristics of intoxication, decision-making capacity has not been examined as closely insubstance-use illnesses as in mental illnesses. This is in part because withsubstance-related problems and illnesses, there are fewer concerns aboutdecision-making capability in a nonintoxicated state than about the abilityto maintain a desired pattern of behavior over time (Hazelton et al., 2003;Rosen and Rosenheck, 1999). For example, although nonintoxicated indi-viduals with substance-use problems or illnesses may perform quite well ona typical interview assessing decision-making capability (unless there areother issues, such as dementia due to substance use), they may still relapsein the face of drug-related cravings and cues in their environment. Accord-ing to the usual criteria, such persons would be considered to have in-tact decision-making capability. Indeed, this is the way researchers treatdecision-making capability for the purposes of enrolling patients in studiesof substance-use problems and illnesses (Gorelick et al., 1999). However, substance dependence is characterized by compulsive alcohol- and other drug-taking behaviors, even in the face of serious ad-verse consequences (Hyman and Malenka, 2001). Research designed toshed light on these behaviors has produced findings similar to those forindividuals with mental illnesses: although nonintoxicated individuals withsubstance dependence as a group exhibit problems in decision making, there are great within-group differences in decision-making abilities (Grantet al., 2000). Studies of decision making by individuals dependent uponalcohol, cocaine, or methamphetamines, for example, revealed three differ-ent decision-making subgroups. The first did not differ from normal com-parison subjects in decision-making abilities. The second performed simi-larly to people with certain types of brain lesions; they made choices thatwere insensitive to future consequences and favored short-term rewards,even though this strategy resulted in long-term losses. The third subgroupCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Impaired decision making by individuals not mentally ill or using sub- stances As mentioned above, the absence of an M/SU illness does not nec- essarily mean that one is unimpaired in decision-making ability. There aremany situations that stress mentally healthy people's decision-making ca-pacity. They may be under the sway of a strong emotion, desperate be-cause of bad medical news, physically frail in a way that affects theirthinking, under severe stress, or in great pain. Any of those factors, andmany others, can affect a mentally healthy person's ability to process medi-cal information and make a competent decision. In addition, even when not under such stress, mentally healthy people regularly process information in ways that are not completely rational.They overvalue vivid memories, misunderstand probabilities, depart fromthe laws of logic, and let irrational ideas affect their judgment (Kahnemanet al. 1982). Indeed, there is a separate branch of cognitive psychology thatidentifies such reasoning frailties in much of the population (Garnham andOakhill, 1994; Connolly et al., 2000). Not surprisingly, variable propor-tions of \"normal\" research subjects have been found to have deficits indecision-making capability (Davis et al., 1998; Roth et al., 1982). In short, not all , but also not only , individuals with M/SU illnesses are sometimes less than competent in their decision making. Risk of Dangerousness As noted above, fear of individuals with severe mental illnesses because of their perceived greater dangerousness is a significant factor in the devel-opment of stigma and discrimination (Corrigan et al., 2002; Martin et al.,2000). However, findings of population-based epidemiological and cohortstudies show that the vast majority of individuals with a mental illness andno concurrent substance use pose no greater risk of violent behavior thanthose without M/SU illnesses. 15 The empirical literature on violence and mental illnesses is copious. Samples and methods differ greatly across studies, making comparisons 15We focus here on studies of violence in the community because public fears of persons with mental illness typically are based on concerns about the likelihood of their perpetrating violence in the places where most people live and work. A separate literature, not reviewedhere, addresses violent behavior by persons with mental illnesses in institutions, which can be a major problem for front-line staff and directly contributes to difficulties in recruitment and retention and to quality-of-care issues in these settings.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The following summary of the data is illustrative of the majorstudies, rather than exhaustive, and does not attempt a detailed method-ological critique. The first large-scale epidemiological data on the prevalence and inci- dence of violence (assaultive behavior) among individuals with M/SU ill-nesses were produced in the early 1980s as a part of the EpidemiologicalCatchment Area (ECA) study, which was designed primarily to determine theprevalence of untreated psychiatric illnesses in community populations acrossthe United States. 16 A secondary analysis of these data (Swanson, 1994) found that the vast majority of individuals with mental illness who had notqualified for a substance-use or -dependence diagnosis in the past year werenot violent. Even among individuals with major mental illnesses (such asschizophrenia) having no co-occurring substance-use diagnosis, the propor-tion committing an act of violence was only somewhat higher than that in thepopulation without mental illness. Only about 7 percent of those with amajor mental illness (but without a substance-use or dependence diagnosis)had engaged in any assaultive behavior in the preceding year, compared withslightly more than 2 percent of individuals without any major psychiatricdiagnosis. Individuals with less-severe mental illness were at no greater risk ofcommitting an act of violence than those with no mental illness. Becausemajor mental illness is a relatively rare occurrence, individuals with mentalillnesses (but without a substance-use or -dependence diagnosis) account fora very small proportion (about 3-5 percent) of the risk of violence in acommunity. Substance-use illnesses by themselves and in combination with major mental illnesses were found to be related more strongly to violence. TheECA study found a 1-year violence prevalence rate of 19.7 percent amongrespondents with a substance-use or -dependence diagnosis without thepresence of a major mental illness, and rate of 22 percent among those withdual mental and substance-use or -dependence diagnoses. Individuals withsubstance-use or -dependence diagnoses alone represented 26-27 percent ofthe risk of violence in the community, while those with both diagnosescontributed a much smaller share of the risk (5-6 percent) because of theirsmaller numbers. 17 The ECA study also found that the presence of severe M/SU illnesses is only one factor helping explain (and statistically predict) violence. Other 16The study conducted a series of parallel surveys in New Haven, Baltimore, Saint Louis, Durham, and Los Angeles. 17The contribution of any group to overall rates of violence is a function of three factors: the number of individuals in the group, the prevalence of violence within the group, and the size of the group relative to the total population (Swanson, 1994).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A number of subsequent studies have examined cohorts selected from the general population and followed them at one or more points in time todetermine their rates of violence and mental illness. These studies havetended to be performed in countries other than the United States\u2014Denmark (Brennan et al., 2000), Sweden (Hodgins and Janson, 2002), NewZealand (Arsenault et al., 2000), and Finland (Tiihonen et al., 1997)\u2014where comprehensive databases are available. Many of these studies fo-cused on individuals with psychotic illnesses and major depression. Allfound a link between individuals with these illnesses and violence: personswith these severe illnesses had 2-27 times higher rates of violence, depend-ing on diagnosis and gender, compared with persons without such illnesses.Many of the studies controlled for substance-use diagnoses, socioeconomicstatus, and other variables likely to inflate rates of violence (Monahan,1981). However, studies from countries with lower overall rates of violencethan the United States, such as the Scandinavian countries where many ofthese studies were conducted, are likely to show a greater effect of mentalillnesses, and hence the results cannot be extrapolated directly to this coun-try (Simpson et al., 2003). In the United States, however, an epidemiologi-cal sample in an economically impoverished, largely immigrant neighbor-hood in New York City (Link et al., 1992) found that a group of currentpsychiatric outpatients and former psychiatric inpatients had significantlyelevated rates of reported violence compared with the never-treated mem-bers of the study sample. In contrast to the above epidemiological and cohort studies, the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study, the largest prospective studyto date of a clinical sample (i.e., newly discharged psychiatric inpatients)found that persons with severe mental illnesses were at no greater risk forcommunity violence than nonhospitalized persons in their neighborhoods,as long as they did not have concurrent symptoms of a substance-use diag-nosis. However rates of substance-use problems and illnesses were signifi-cantly elevated in the patient sample compared with the community com-parison group (31.5 percent at the first 10-week follow-up versus 17.5percent) (Steadman et al., 1998). Other studies that attempted to controlfor a co-occurring substance-use diagnosis, however, including the ECAanalysis, found that its presence did not fully account for the effect ofmental illnesses on violence. Further emphasizing the discrepancies in thedata, the MacArthur study found that persons with schizophrenia had thelowest violence risk of the major diagnostic categories, whereas severalother studies have found schizophrenia to have the strongest relationshipwith violence (Arsenault et al., 2000; Wessely, 1997). Two studies thatfollowed patients after their first episode of schizophrenia found an in-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In summary, although findings of many studies suggest a link between mental illnesses and violence, the contribution of people with mental ill-nesses to overall rates of violence is small. Based on the ECA data, Swanson(1994) and colleagues estimated that roughly 3-5 percent of violence in theUnited States could be attributed to persons with mental illnesses. More-over, results of studies from England and New Zealand indicate that inthose countries, the percentage of homicides accounted for by persons withmajor mental illnesses has fallen in recent decades despite policies ofdeinstitutionalization that have placed more people with severe mentalillnesses in the community (Monahan, 1981; Shaw et al., 2004; Taylor andGunn, 1999). Data also suggest that most violence committed by personswith mental illnesses is directed at family members and friends rather thanat strangers (Simpson et al., 2003; Steadman et al., 1998) and tends tooccur in the perpetrator's or the victim's residence rather than in publicplaces (Steadman et al, 1998). Indeed, persons without mental illnesses aremore likely to attack strangers and to be violent in public (Shaw et al.,2004; Steadman et al., 1998). Thus while there may be a causal relationshipbetween mental illnesses and violence, the magnitude of the relationship isgreatly exaggerated in the minds of the general population. COERCED TREATMENT 18 Individuals with substance-use illnesses, and to a lesser extent those with mental illnesses, are more likely to be forced or coerced into treat-ment than are individuals with general medical illnesses. 19 Coerced treat- ment sometimes occurs as the result of a legal order; sometimes as theresult of pressure from other formal organizations, such as employers orsocial agencies; and at other times through informal pressures exerted byfamily members or friends. Forms of coercion exist along a continuum,ranging from friendly persuasion, to interpersonal pressure, to control ofresources, to force. How individuals perceive this coercion is variable andis influenced by the nature of the coercive process, that is, the extent to 18In this report, the term \"coercion\" is not used in its narrow legal sense, but refers to the full range of pressures applied to individuals to secure their participation in treatment, en- compassing workplace mandates; criminal justice diversion programs (including drug and mental health courts); and other sources of leverage, such as social programs that requiretreatment adherence to receive housing, disability, or welfare benefits. 19Individuals are also coerced into treatment for general medical conditions, such as tuber- culosis, but this occurs less frequently.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Withinthe legal system, specialty drug or mental health courts offer individualswith M/SU problems or illnesses the option of treatment as an alternativeto criminal processing or sentencing. This and other types of coercion areintended to compensate for poor decision making, compulsive behavior,or a risk of danger to oneself or others. These practices generate greatcontroversy and raise the question of how patient-centered care with thepatient as the source of control can and should be provided in theirpresence. Coercion and Mental Illnesses Until relatively recently in the history of the treatment of mental ill- nesses, coercive interventions were the norm. In the United States, the firststatute authorizing voluntary hospitalization of persons with mental illnesswas not enacted until 1882, and even through the 1960s, the vast majorityof psychiatric hospitalizations took place on an involuntary basis. (Volun-tary hospitalizations accounted for only 10 percent of admissions in 1949and 24 percent in 1961 [Brakel, 1985].) Once hospitalized, even voluntar-ily, patients were assumed to have no right to decide whether to accept thetreatment chosen for them. And under provisions for conditional or proba-tionary discharge, many patients in the public system of care could be calledback to the hospital at their psychiatrist's discretion (Lindman andMcIntyre, 1961). There are several reasons for this reliance on involuntary hospitaliza- tion and treatment, and they relate to the themes discussed earlier. Violencecommitted by some individuals with mental illnesses led to a general mis-perception of all such persons as dangerous and thereby in need of confine-ment. This attitude was compounded by the belief that mental illnessesusually rendered persons incompetent to make decisions for themselves;asking them whether they desired hospitalization or treatment was there-fore regarded as pointless. The convenience for caregivers and treaters ofmaking decisions for rather than with persons with mental illnesses may also have contributed to the use of coercive approaches. In the 1960s and 1970s, as the rights of underrepresented groups in general received attention, involuntary commitment statutes were narrowedin every state to limit nonconsensual hospitalization to persons who mani-fested clear dangerousness to themselves or others. Procedures were re-vamped simultaneously to afford protections, such as judicial hearings andassistance of an attorney, characteristic of the criminal process.

A large number of these states required a formal findingof decisional incapacity before a patient's decisions could be overridden(Appelbaum, 1994). Compared with the situation in 1960, today's mental health system is substantially less coercive. But coercive approaches remain significant fea-tures of the system, and as the majority of treatment episodes have shiftedto the community, new mechanisms for pressuring or compelling personswith mental illnesses to undergo treatment have evolved (Monahan et al.,2001b). These developments have been motivated by the concerns aboutimpaired decisional capacity and dangerousness described above, as well asby more recent concerns about reducing the burden on the criminal justicesystem for treating mental illnesses and addressing the needs of untreatedpersons with severe mental illnesses. Outpatient commitment is probably the most discussed of the community-based mechanisms for compelling persons with mental illnessesto receive care (Swartz and Monahan, 2001). 20 A majority of states now have statutes permitting commitment to outpatient treatment (Judge DavidL. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 2000a). Criteria in the newerstatutes are typically broader than those for inpatient commitment, oftenbeing predicated on the likelihood that without treatment, the person willdeteriorate to the point that standards for inpatient commitment will bemet. In most statutes, this prediction must be based on a pattern of previousdeterioration after release from the hospital. For persons who are foundeligible for outpatient commitment, courts can require compliance with atreatment plan, including outpatient visits and medication. Although find-ings of a number of uncontrolled studies suggest positive effects from out-patient commitment (e.g., reduced rates of hospitalization), the only twocontrolled studies had methodological problems that rendered their resultsambiguous (Appelbaum, 2001). While outpatient commitment has garnered the most attention, with critics claiming both that it unfairly extends the state's coercive powers andthat it would be unnecessary if enough high-quality outpatient servicesexisted (Brown, 2003; Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental HealthLaw, 2000b), less visible approaches can be more coercive and may bemore common as well. This is because outpatient commitment statutes aregenerally without effective enforcement mechanisms. Statutes may allownoncompliant persons to be picked up by the police and brought for evalu- 20Seclusion and restraint are more intense forms of coercion used in inpatient settings and are addressed in Chapter 4 in a discussion of threats to safe care.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The criminal justice system also exercises coercion in several ways. Persons who have been arrested and convicted of an offense can be requiredby the terms of their probation or parole to participate in treatment of theirmental illness, at the risk of being incarcerated if they fail to comply. Theextent and effectiveness of this process are essentially unstudied (Skeem etal., 2003). In addition, the last decade has seen the growth of mental healthcourts in many jurisdictions, modeled on specialty drug courts that arecommon nationwide (Steadman et al., 2001). Defendants identified as hav-ing a mental illness may be given the option of referral to a mental healthcourt prior to or following trial; ongoing compliance with treatment maybe required to avoid incarceration. As yet, there is no unitary model formental health courts, and as with interventions by the probation and parolesystems, their effectiveness is unknown (Redlich et al., 2005; Wolff, 2004). More-informal means of leveraging persons with mental illnesses into treatment also exist but are less visible (Monahan et al., 2001b). Theseinclude control of their money by family members or formally appointedrepresentative payees. The latter can be designated by the Social SecurityAdministration to receive payments on behalf of recipients who are be-lieved to be too impaired to manage their money; the Veterans Administra-tion has a similar mechanism. Recent data suggest that formal and informalmoney managers are common for persons with severe mental illnesses, andthat control over a person's finances is often used in an attempt to promotecompliance with treatment (Luchins et al., 2003; Monahan et al., 2005;Redlich et al., 2005). Access to housing may similarly be conditioned ontreatment involvement, even where laws would appear to preclude suchconditions (Monahan et al., 2001b, 2005). Overall, the degree of coerciveness in the current mental health system may be underestimated and the source of the majority of coercive pressuresmisidentified. A recent cross-sectional study of the extent to which fourtypes of coercion were experienced by chronically mentally ill individualsreceiving mental health services in public-sector settings in five states during2002-2003 found that across all sites, 44 to 59 percent of individualsexperienced at least one of four types of coercion into treatment. Makinghousing contingent upon compliance was the most frequently used form ofleverage (experienced by 23-40 percent of individuals). Other types ofleverage and the frequency with which they were encountered across siteswere use of criminal sanctions (15-30 percent), outpatient commitment(12-20 percent), and withholding access to money (7-19 percent)(Monahan et al., 2005). Questions remain about both the extent to whichCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Coercion and Substance-Use Illnesses The majority of individuals entering treatment for substance-use ill- nesses do so as a result of coercion (Weisner and Schmidt, 2001). As is thecase with mental health care, this coercion takes many forms and can bethought of as ranging along a continuum. Thus coercion ranges from subtleforms, as when an individual acts to please family, friends, or significantothers, to more overt forms, such as coercion by an employer through astated risk of loss of employment, or a situation in which an individual isthreatened with the loss of custody of a child or liberty and the establish-ment of a criminal record, as is the case in the criminal justice system. In theprivate sector, for example, many clients enter treatment with some degreeof coercion from the workplace, either by employers, employee assistanceprograms, or unions (Polcin and Weisner, 1999; Roman and Blum, 2002;Weisner et al., 2002). These referrals are due to positive drug tests on thejob or to alcohol or drugs interfering with job performance. Public benefitprograms also exercise coercion. For example, local welfare agencies some-times exert pressure on individuals with alcohol or drug problems to receivetreatment for their substance use in order to maintain their benefits andbecome ready to work (Capitani et al., 2001). In addition, most states have mechanisms in place for involuntary civil commitment of individuals with substance-use illnesses and involuntarytreatment mechanisms in the criminal justice system (e.g., through drugcourts) (Hall and Appelbaum, 2002). Drug courts are increasing in numberthroughout the country. They focus on criminal behavior related to illicitdrugs (rather than alcohol) and are designed to reduce the number ofnonviolent substance-using offenders who are incarcerated, as well as po-tentially to provide better outcomes (Longshore et al., 2005; Marlowe,2003, Marlow et al., 2004). Drug courts rely upon the identification ofsubstance-use offenders during the pretrial or presentencing period and inreturn for a guilty plea offer these individuals the option of receivingcommunity-based treatment for their substance use in lieu of incarceration(Belenko, 1999, 2002; Longshore et al., 2005; Marlowe et al., 2004). Suc-cessful treatment (completion of a year or more) results in dismissal of theoriginal charges, while failure to complete treatment results in immediateincarceration, since the individual has already pled guilty. In some states,such as California, specific legislation exists to offer treatment for individu-als arrested for nonviolent felony offenses related to alcohol or drug use. Research on the effects of coerced treatment (through the legal system, the workplace, welfare, and informal pressure) for substance-use illnessesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html108 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS has yielded mixed results but on the whole has found higher retention and similar outcomes relative to voluntary clients (Farabee et al., 1998; Lawentalet al., 1996). A review of 18 longitudinal studies of the effectiveness ofcompulsory substance-use treatment published between 1988 and 2001found that compulsory treatment (legal, formal, informal, and mixed) gen-erally achieved better treatment retention, but no reduction of substanceuse or criminal behavior (Wild et al., 2002). This same review identified theneed for stronger research and analytic models to illuminate the utility ofcompulsory treatment. Further, agreement needs to be reached on appro-priate measures of the outcomes of coerced treatment; these can range fromincreased attendance at treatment appointments for outpatients; to the ab-sence of illicit drugs in urine/blood; to improved functioning in family,work, and educational roles. Finally, when patients are mandated to treat-ment, it is not always clear that they are getting the most appropriatetreatment, or that they are aware of the consequences of not doing well intreatment. Thus, issues relating to patient-centered care and decision mak-ing in health care for both mental and substance-use conditions are impor-tant here. When patients make choices between treatment and criminaljustice sanctions, it is essential that they be informed about the treatmentthey will receive, have as much choice in the decision as feasible, and beinformed about the \"usual\" outcomes of that treatment so they can makean informed decision. Summary The phenomenon of coercion, like the consequences of stigma and discrimination, has implications for the implementation of the Quality Chasm rule of patients being able to \"exercise the degree of control they choose over health care decisions that affect them.\" Despite these difficul-ties, however, the committee finds that the aim of patient-centered careapplies equally to individuals with and without M/SU illnesses. To compen-sate for the obstacles presented by coercion, as well as those posed bystigma and discrimination, the committee finds that health care clinicians,organizations, insurance plans, accrediting bodies, and federal and stategovernments will need to undertake specific actions to actively support allM/SU patients' decision-making abilities and preferences, including thoseof individuals who are coerced into treatment. ACTIONS TO SUPPORT PATIENT-CENTERED CARE Our knowledge of how stigma develops, how it affects stigmatized individuals, and how it can be eradicated is incomplete but growing(Corrigan, 2004; Farina, 1998). Many advocacy, governmental, and publicCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES 109 service organizations in the United States and elsewhere have used this knowledge to establish campaigns to combat the stigma of M/SU illnesses,usually through the use of one or more of the following strategies:(1) educating the public about M/SU illnesses; (2) creating opportunities forthe public to have contact with individuals with these illnesses; (3) protest-ing against erroneous, stereotyped portrayal of these individuals by themedia 21; and (4) pursuing legal action to guarantee rights to health care, housing, employment, and other justice-related concerns (Corrigan andPenn, 1999; Smith, 2002). These initiatives include those of SAMHSA'sResource Center to Address Discrimination and Stigma (SAMHSA, 2000);SAMHSA's National Addiction Technology Transfer Centers Network ini-tiative to develop and disseminate a training module on stigma for treat-ment providers, and to collect and distribute research-based information onfighting the stigma of drug and alcohol dependence (Woll, 2001); Faces &Voices of Recovery, a national recovery advocacy campaign and organiza-tion that promotes public policies and actions to end discrimination againstindividuals with substance-use illnesses 22; the National Alliance for the Ill's (NAMI) \"In Our Own Voices\" and \"StigmaBusters\" Mental Health's (NIMH) Outreach Partner-ship Program (NIMH, 2005); and the efforts of many other consumer andadvocacy organizations, such as the National Mental Health Associationand the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, that fightstigma by using a combination of the above strategies. Some consumersreport that becoming involved in these initiatives helps them cope with theadverse effects of stigma and develop feelings of self-empowerment andself-enhancement (Wahl, 1999). The committee applauds and supports the continuation of these cam- paigns. However, national, state, and local initiatives to eliminate stigmaand discrimination often are targeted at changing the attitudes of society atlarge. Research has shown that public attitudes are not the sole determinantof behaviors; behaviors are also influenced by a number of personal andsituational features present in the interactions of stigmatized individualswith others. Thus, to combat the effects of stigma on patient-centered care,additional actions are required of (1) health care organizations and clini-cians providing treatment services; (2) insurance plans that shape patient-provider relationships; and (3) public policy makers and quality oversightorganizations, who are able to address other situational conditions that 21There is less empirical evidence in support of protest as an effective mechanism for reducing stigma than is the case for the other three strategies (Corrigan and Penn, 1999; Corrigan et al., 2001). 22Pat Taylor, Faces & Voices of Recovery, e-mail communication, October 11, 2004.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Combating Stigma and Supporting Decision Making at the Locus of Care Delivery Health care clinicians, organizations, insurance plans, accrediting orga- nizations, and government bodies can counter the adverse effects of stigmaon patient-centered M/SU health care by taking several concrete actions.These include (1) endorsing and supporting decision making by M/SU healthcare consumers as the default policy in their organizational polices andpractices; (2) involving M/SU health care consumers in service design,administration, and delivery; (3) providing decision-making support toall M/SU health care consumers, including those under coercion and mak-ing decisions about diversion programs; and (4) supporting illness self-management practices for all consumers and formal self-management pro- grams for individuals with chronic illnesses. Endorsing and Supporting Consumer Decision Making in Organizational Polices and Practices All organizations have cultures, defined as the dominant and com- monly held beliefs, attitudes, values, and behaviors that shape organiza-tional goals, policies, and procedures (Schein, 1992). In health care, theeffect of an organization's beliefs, attitudes, values, and behaviors on thepractices of its individual members is so widely accepted that substantialanalysis and tool development have taken place to help organizations cre-ate, for example, \"cultures of safety\" (Bagian and Gosbee, 2000; Wong etal., 2002). Desired cultures can be consciously built and objectively as-sessed. Recently, for example, the Agency for Healthcare Research andQuality (AHRQ) developed a survey instrument for use by hospitals inassessing the extent to which they have been effective in creating an internalculture of safety (AHRQ, 2005). Organizations similarly can create cul-tures that endorse and support consumer decision making through theirleadership and formal policies, and through employee education in theadverse effects of stigma and the capabilities of M/SU consumers to engagein decision making. Leadership and policy practices Effective leadership within an organiza- tion is essential to achieving cultural change (Davenport et al., 1998;Heifetz and Laurie, 2001). If patient-centered care is to be provided anddecision making by consumers of M/SU services is to be ensured, leaderswithin treatment organizations must see that their organizational cultureCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES 111 actively supports these practices. Organizational leaders can take many different actions to create such a culture. First, organizational managersand leaders can demonstrate behaviors that recognize and support con-sumer decision making in their interactions with other organizational em-ployees. As noted above, each patient's right to make treatment decisionsand receive support in doing so should be clinicians' and organizations'default policy unless there is evidence of a danger to the patient or others,or the patient has been determined to be incompetent to make decisions.Organizations' formal, written policy documents, such as mission state-ments and policies and procedures manuals, can explicitly endorse andspecify this default policy and other organizational actions to support con-sumer decision making. If the organization has a consumer bill of rights, itcan include content on consumer decision making. The orientation of newproviders and ongoing training of existing providers also should includecontent on the adverse effects of stigma on patients' self-efficacy and recov-ery, and reaffirm organizational polices and practices that support patientdecision making. Continuing education of clinicians and other service personnel Because it is not reasonable to expect that all clinicians (especially those newly li-censed) will come to their practice settings possessing all of the necessaryknowledge and skills, organizations need to provide for their clinicians'ongoing training (IOM, 2004b) and education (see Chapter 7). Educationhas been shown to decrease stigma and improve clinicians' attitudes re-garding persons with mental illnesses (Corrigan and Penn, 1999; Farina,1998). Empirical evidence also indicates that having credible and compe-tent leaders deliver this education is important if some of these messages(e.g., those related to stigma) are to be taken up by learners (Corrigan etal., 2001). The education and training provided should include, for ex-ample, content on patient-centered care and decision making, erroneousbeliefs about dangerousness, and the clinician's and the organization's needto tolerate \"bad\" choices and achieve the right balance between \"benefi-cence\" and autonomy (Murdach, 1996). Tolerance for \"bad\" decisions 23The Quality Chasm report (IOM, 2001) notes that among all consumers, there can at times be a tension between theaim of providing patient-centered care and that of providing effective(evidence-based) care. For example, a patient may have received informa-tion on and desire to receive a particular type of treatment, but the provider 23The discussion in this section incorporates content from the paper \"Patient-Centered Care/Self-Directed Care: Legal, Policy and Programmatic Considerations,\" prepared for the committee by Susan Stefan of the Center for Public Representation.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html112 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS may know that evidence of the treatment's effectiveness is lacking or incon- clusive, or has shown the treatment to be ineffective. The provider may haveevidence that an alternative treatment may be more or equally effective atlower cost. The Quality Chasm report notes that in such instances, health care institutions, clinicians, and patients need to work together to reconcilecompeting and conflicting aims through shared decision making. A more difficult situation exists when patients, particularly individuals with severe mental illnesses, propose a course of action that their mentalhealth professional believes to be misguided. Without guidance in suchsituations, clinicians may react in ways that may reflect their own valuesmore than the patient's, and thereby undermine patient-centered care. Forexample, some clinicians may believe that the apparent irrationality of apatient's treatment decision raises questions about the individual's compe-tence to make such decisions, and use this to justify excluding the patientfrom decision making about his or her care. Others may formally respecttheir patient's autonomy and decision making but do so in a way thatdistances them from the patient and his or her decisions. For example,when a patient disagrees with a mental health professional about the courseof treatment, the professional may \"respect\" the patient's decision butformally or informally withdraw from the treatment partnership. Patientdecision making is preserved, but the treatment relationship is weakened,and the patient has in effect been punished for disagreeing with the mentalhealth professional (Stefan, 2004). In contrast, in her autobiographical book An Unquiet Mind , Kay Red- field Jamison paints a vivid portrait of patient-centered care as she describesher relationship with her psychiatrist, who remained steadfast through hermany disagreements with his recommendations that she take lithium forher bipolar illness. While Jamison does not represent a \"typical\" patient,her concerns, her reluctance to pursue a recommended course of treatment,and the concomitant risks are not unusual. Moreover, the manner in whichshe was involved in decision making is a strong example of patient-centeredcare. Jamison explains that over a 1-year period, she started and stopped taking lithium multiple times: . . . I still somehow thought that I ought to be able to carry on without drugs, that I ought to be able to continue to do things my own way. My psychiatrist, who took all of these complaints very seriously\u2014existentialqualms, side effects, matters of value from upbringing\u2014never wavered in his conviction that I needed to take lithium. . . . (Jamison, 1995:102) Her psychiatrist stayed with her, recording her decisions and their consequences and continuing his attempts to help her.

Jamisoneventually decided that she needed to take lithium and, because she hadmade the decision herself after struggling with it, has continued to do sodespite experiencing adverse effects. Her psychiatrist discussed and per-suaded but did not coerce. Instead, he listened to, respected, and respondedto her concerns, exemplifying being \"respectful of and responsive to indi-vidual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions\" (IOM, 2001:40). Jamison's experience can be contrasted with that of a patient involved in the research of the MacArthur Research Network on Mental Health andthe Law on coercion. That experience illustrates the opposite of Jamison's\u2014the absence of patient-centeredness: I talked to him [the therapist who had arranged for his commitment] this morning. I said, \"You . . listen to call yourself a counselor. . . . Why did you decide to do this instead of . . . try to listen tome and understand . . . what I was going through.\" And he said, \"Well, it doesn't matter, you know, you're going anyway.\" He didn't listen to what I had to say. . . . He didn't listen to the situation. . . . He had decidedbefore he ever got to the house . . . that I was coming up here. Either I come freely or the officers would have to subdue me and bring me in. (Bennett et al., 1993:298) It is important to be clear about what patient-centered care does and does not mean. Patient-centered care does not mean that professionalsmust agree with all of the patient's decisions. Nor does it mean that aprovider should abandon a patient if the patient's decisions disagree withthe provider's own. A Michigan policy on self-directed care explicitlyprovides that \"self-determination shall not serve as a method for a [com-munity mental health support program] to reduce its obligations to theconsumer, or to avoid the provision of needed specialty mental healthservices or supports\" (Michigan Department of Community Health,2003). Patient-centered care does involve supporting the patient throughdisagreements about treatment decisions, asking about the patient's goalsfor recovery, and factoring these into shared decision making for therecovery process. Taking these and other actions to endorse and support the primacy of consumer decision making in treatment polices and practices lays thegroundwork for implementing three additional practices that can support 24This may have been influenced in part by his stated belief that she could not be involun- tarily committed under the state's laws (Jamison, 1995).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Involving Consumers in Service Design, Administration, and Delivery Contact with individuals with mental illnesses improves health care workers' attitudes toward them and decreases negative stereotyping(Corrigan et al., 2001; Kolodziej and Johnson, 1996), including dangerousness (Corrigan et al., 2002; Farina, 1998). Thesame is true for the public at large (Rasinski, 2003). Contact is most effec-tive in countering erroneous beliefs and stigma when participants haveequal status, interact in a highly collaborative manner, have personal ratherthan formal interactions, and have support from the institution in whichthe contact occurs (Corrigan and Penn, 1999; Kolodziej and Johnson,1996). Equal status is facilitated when individuals work together on speci-fied activities giving those in a stigmatized group the opportunity to applyand demonstrate their own knowledge and skills. Such contact can beachieved by involving individuals with M/SU illnesses in administrative,clinical care delivery, and policy-making roles. Consumer participation in service design and administration Consumers have served in key administrative and service design roles in a number ofM/SU health care organizations. For example, they have served on keypolicy-making bodies that plan, design, and oversee internal performancemeasurement and quality improvement (Hibbard, 2003; Sabin and Daniels,1999, 2001), and that design and implement mechanisms for solicitingconsumer feedback on the quality of delivered services (Sabin and Daniels,1999). Serving on bodies that develop and oversee utilization managementpolicies (when the care-providing organization is also a health plan) isanother way for consumers to participate in service design and administra-tion (Sabin et al., 2001). These mechanisms for direct involvement in ser-vice design and administration are more effective in reducing stigma thansimply having consumers serve on separate advisory councils because theyprovide opportunities for consumers to work side by side with care provid-ers in a collaborative manner. Consumers as service providers People with M/SU illnesses have for many years served as providers of treatment and recovery support services byleading and participating in self-help or mutual help groups such as Alco-holics Anonymous (Humphreys et al., 2004); serving as case managers,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

These positions range from those thatare unpaid, to those that are paid but created or set aside exclusively forconsumers (available only to people with mental illnesses), to those thatare paid and competitive (available to consumers and nonconsumers)(Cook, 2004). Consumers also serve as providers in peer support programs that help individuals with severe M/SU illnesses achieve recovery. Georgia's PeerSupport program, for example, employs individuals who (1) are current orformer recipients of mental health services for a major mental illness, (2)openly identify themselves as consumers, (3) have had advocacy or advisoryexperience, (4) have made a demonstrated effort at self-directed mentalhealth recovery, and (5) have successfully passed a written and oral exami-nation after completing a 2-week training program. The Georgia Divisionof Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Addictive Diseases trainsand certifies these peer specialists to model competence and recovery byproviding (under the direct supervision of a mental health professional)structured, scheduled activities that promote socialization, recovery, self-advocacy, development of natural supports, and maintenance of commu-nity living skills to individuals with \"serious and persistent\" mental ill-nesses. Their primary responsibility is to assist consumers in regainingcontrol over their recovery process and developing the attitudes and skillsthat facilitate recovery. They do this through a variety of activities rangingfrom helping consumers create a wellness recovery action plan, to support-ing consumers in their vocational choices, to informing them about com-munity and other supports and how to utilize them in the recovery process(Sabin and Daniels, 2003). SAMHSA's Recovery Community Services Program similarly uses peer support to help consumers of substance-use treatment services prevent re-lapse, promote timely reentry into treatment when relapse occurs, and aidin achieving sustained recovery and an enhanced quality of life. Grantsmade through this program support peer-to-peer recovery assistance, in-cluding help in securing housing, education, and employment; buildingconstructive family and other personal relationships; managing stress; par-ticipating in alcohol- and other drug-free social and recreational activities;and obtaining services from multiple systems, such as the primary andmental health care, child welfare, and criminal justice systems (SAMHSA,2004a). Peer support programs are discussed further below as an important mechanism for increasing consumers' self-efficacy beliefs and decision-making capabilities.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Providing consumers with real choices Decision making is less relevant if the only choice presented is that between one treatment and no treatment.As evidence presented in Chapter 5 shows, there may be multiple differenttherapeutic approaches for a given M/SU illness\u2014different medications,medication alone without psychotherapy, psychotherapy alone withoutmedication, and medication combined with psychotherapy (frequentlyshown to be most effective). Some of these approaches have more proveneffectiveness than others; others may have less evidence to support theireffectiveness but offer the promise of fewer side effects. Because of this andother factors, patient preferences are likely to differ. The Quality Chasm report notes, for example, that among all patients, some people are \"riskaverse,\" while others may choose a riskier intervention despite a lesserlikelihood of benefit. 25 Moreover, patients with more chronic medical con- ditions often have been shown to be more willing to take risks in the hopesof achieving better health. Their preferences also have been shown to bemotivated in part by a concern for social health (defined as the ability todevelop, maintain, and nurture major social relations), not solely by adesire for physical or mental health (Sherbourne et al., 1999). When consumers are coerced into treatment or have no choice of pro- vider, offering them a choice of treatment is especially important. In gen-eral, few inpatients\u2014whether voluntarily or involuntarily admitted\u2014choosethe psychiatrist, therapist, or nurse who is assigned to their care. A similarsituation occurs for the many individuals who receive care in a clinic set-ting. In these inpatient and outpatient settings, individuals receive care fromthe providers scheduled to provide care on that day. For patients receivingcare from a specialized team (e.g., an assertive community treatment [ACT]team), there is typically only one team available. With respect to choice oftreatments, rules for involuntary treatment of committed patients varyacross states, with some states (but not all) precluding involuntary treat-ment with medications unless patients are first declared incompetent tomake decisions about their care. Whatever rule is in effect, and regardless 25The report further notes that patient preferences are likely to change over time and as a consequence of the issues at hand.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Patientsshould be supported in expressing their treatment preferences and havingthem incorporated into treatment decision making. Supporting decisionmaking and treatment preferences requires that patients have informationon the various treatment options available. Providing information about the benefits and risks of different treatment options Information needs to be available to consumers to support their decision making and to promote their exercise of choice. Clinicians andtheir sponsoring health care organizations should provide patients withinformation (in a user-friendly format) about the comparative effectivenessof different treatment approaches (regardless of whether those approachesare offered by the clinician or health care organization) and any risks/contraindications/side effects that may be present given the patient's clini-cal profile. When information on the comparative effectiveness of differenttreatment approaches is not available (see the discussion of the limitedevidence base in Chapter 4), this lack of information should be madeknown to the consumer. Patients should also be given information onwhether a specific therapeutic approach is available from their clinician,organization, or health plan. Providing decision support to all patients It is widely acknowledged that all clinicians need support in their clinical decision making to stay abreastof recent developments in therapeutics. If patient are truly to share inclinical decision making, it is likely that they, too, will need information tosupport that decision making. However, decision-support tools are justbeginning to be used in general health care to help consumers select amongdifferent treatment options for a limited number of medical conditions, forexample, problems with vision or specific diseases such as benign prostatichypertrophy (Stanton, 2002). Consumers of M/SU health care services alsoneed such decision-support tools, although their availability is currentlyvery limited. In the interim, clinicians and health care organizations can support all M/SU consumers in their decision making by (1) providing them with theinformation described above (in a user-friendly format); (2) avoiding un-dermining their decision-making abilities (verbal support is effective in in-creasing individuals' belief in their ability to make treatment decisions, ortheir self-efficacy; see the discussion earlier in this chapter [Bandura,1997b]); and (3) appreciating the changing nature of consumers' decision-making preferences. The Quality Chasm report, for example, underscores that shared decision making is a dynamic process that changes as patients'Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

As evidence presented in the preced- ing section indicates, decision-making capacity appears to be less a fixed,unchangeable trait and more a state dependent on a variety of factors. Thecapacity for decision making should therefore be viewed not as an all-or-nothing state, but as the result of the interplay of multiple functional abili-ties that can vary according to the context and over time. For example, aperson may understand a consent form one day but not the next when he orshe is distracted, confused, under duress, in pain, or delirious. Similarly, aperson may be impaired in the acute phases of a severe mental illness, suchas schizophrenia or bipolar illness, but may return to normal when inremission. The Quality Chasm report also acknowledges that patients vary in their preferences and views about how active they want to be in decisionmaking: some patients desire a very active role, while others may prefer todelegate decision making to their providers or a proxy. Providing stronger decision support mechanisms for individuals with sig- nificantly impaired cognition or diminished self-efficacy beliefs Peer sup- port services and advance directives can be used to assist individuals withsignificantly impaired cognition or diminished self-efficacy beliefs. Peer support programs As noted earlier in this chapter, evidence shows that individuals' belief in their self-efficacy can be increased through fourmechanisms: (1) their own success in mastering a task or activity, (2) obser-vation of others' success in the same area, (3) verbal persuasion and socialinfluences, and (4) individuals' own physiological and affective states. Vi-carious experience is particularly powerful when the observer can identifywith some of the characteristics of the person performing the activity.Observing the successes of a model with whom one identifies enhancesone's belief in one's own capabilities. Empowerment and belief in one's self-efficacy are also influenced by the verbal encouragement of others (Bandura,1997b). The positive effects of seeing or visualizing people similar to oneself successfully perform specific activities are proportionate to the degree ofsimilarity between the person performing the activities and the observer.Modeling that conveys effective coping strategies by individuals who begintimorously, but who gradually overcome their difficulties through persis-tent efforts can be more helpful than \"masterful\" models, that is, individu-als who perform calmly and faultlessly. Observers are persuaded that ifothers can do it, they can too (conversely, observing the failures of otherssimilar to themselves decreases the self-efficacy beliefs of observers)(Bandura, 1997b). Peer support programs involve individuals who serve as models of self- efficacy. These programs provide verbal persuasion and social influences,as well as the opportunity to observe others' success in facing the sameCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Peer leadership has been found to be a key component of suc- cessful self-management programs (Lorig et al., 2001). Peer support pro-grams also are identified in the Chronic Care Model of illness management(described in Chapter 5) as a useful mechanism for supporting patients intheir illness self-management (Bodenheimer et al., 2002b). Studies of illnessself-management programs have shown that when peers are well trainedand given a detailed protocol, they teach as well as and possibly better thanhealth professionals (Lorig and Holman, 2003). Peer support programs are a strong component of mental health care, as described above. Peer-based support services in recovery from substance-use problems and illnesses have an even longer history, extending from theeighteenth century to the present and encompassing Native American \"re-covery circles\"; fraternal temperance societies; and social and asylums, half-way houses, and self-managedrecovery homes (White, 2002, 2004). Twelve-step mutual support groupssuch as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), andCocaine Anonymous (CA) are used as a routine adjunct to treatment andare relied on as a form of long-term aftercare for many alcohol and drugtreatment programs today (McElrath, 1997; Troyer et al., 1995). The effi-cacy or effectiveness of the largest addiction-oriented mutual aid/self-helpgroup, AA, has been the focus of increased research and several reviews inrecent years (e.g., Emrick et al., 1993; Kaskutas et al., 2003; Kelly et al.,2002; Tonigan and Toscova, 1996). This work has documented correla- tional evidence of a relationship between AA attendance and, more strongly,AA \"involvement\" (e.g., having a sponsor, being a sponsor, working thesteps) and positive drinking-related outcomes. In addition, participation inself-help groups has been associated with lower subsequent health carecosts (Humphreys and Moos, 1996, 2001). Advance directives 26,27Psychiatric advance directives, like advance di- rectives used in general health care, are intended to preserve consumers'ability to engage in self-direction during times when their decision-makingcapacity or ability to communicate their preferences might be impaired.Psychiatric instructional directives typically address such issues as preferred medications, treatments, service providers and locations, and who is to benotified about hospitalizations and allowed to visit. Psychiatric proxy di- 26Advance directives for mental health care are legally executed documents stating an individual's preferences regarding various aspects of psychiatric treatment in times of crisis, inpatient care, or otherwise impaired decision making. 27Information in this section incorporates content from the commissioned paper \"'Patient- Centered' and 'Consumer-Directed' Mental Health Services\" by Judith A. Cook, PhD, Profes- sor and Director, Center on Mental Health Services Research and Policy, University of Illinois at Chicago.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html120 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS rectives (sometimes combined with instructional directives) allow people to designate someone to make treatment decisions on their behalf (Srebnikand La Fond, 1999). Allowing individuals to state their treatment prefer-ences ahead of time increases the likelihood that care during times of psy-chiatric crisis and/or lack of decision-making competency will reflect theirvalues and preferences. A number of approaches to preparing mental healthadvance directives have been developed, including completion of paper-and-pencil checklists, use of templates available on the Internet, and use ofan interactive CD-ROM on a computer. Duke University's Program onAdvance Psychiatric Directives provides tool kits and user-friendly instruc-tions for consumers, clinicians, and family members to use in completingpsychiatric advance directives (Cook, 2004). Although there is much interest in advance directives for mental health care, few people with mental illnesses create such directives or find themhonored in times of crisis. The reasons for failing to honor an advancedirective include lack of provider awareness of the directive; concerns aboutan individual's competency at the time the directive was prepared; writtendirectives that are unclear; poor communication with proxies about treat-ment preferences; limited availability of desired services in many communi-ties; revocation issues, such as who can revoke a directive and under whatcircumstances; and legal and ethical issues involved in implementing direc-tives that physicians disagree with or perceive as harmful to the individual(Cook, 2004). Moreover, although this option appears sensible and poten-tially applicable within the substance-use treatment field, there are as yet nopublished studies of its use in this field, and very few treatment programshave employed this approach with alcohol- or drug-dependent patients. Several evaluation studies have found psychiatric advance directives to be feasible for use (with support) by individuals with severe and chronicmental illnesses (Peto et al., 2004; Sherman, 1998; Srebnik et al., 2004).Use of such directives is also perceived positively by consumers and associ-ated with decreased feelings of coercion and increased perception of havinga choice in their treatment decisions (Srebnik et al., 2004; Sutherby et al.,1999). Psychiatric advance directives, like advance directives for generalmedical conditions, can help ensure patient-centered care in times of dimin-ished medical decision-making capacity (Backlar et al., 2001; Swanson etal., 2000). Supporting Illness Self-Management Practices and Programs The evidence reviewed earlier in this chapter shows the value of pa- tients' self-management of their illnesses. However, it is important to un-derscore that successful self-management programs go far beyond tradi-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Also, as cited earlier in this chapter, expertdesigners and researchers on these programs caution that many programscalling themselves self-management programs do not teach all the coreskills involved and fail to address the necessary scope of issues (Lorig andHolman, 2003). Self-management support is defined as the \"systematicprovision of education and supportive interventions to increase patients' skills and confidence in managing their health problems, including regularassessment of progress and problems, goal setting, and problem-solvingsupport\" (IOM, 2003:52 [emphasis added]). Whereas traditional patienteducation offers technical information and skills training (typically in areasdefined by the clinician), self-management education supports patients inidentifying their problems and provides techniques to help them make deci-sions, take appropriate actions, and modify these plans as circumstances orthe course of their illness changes. Patient self-management thus requiresthat a clinician utilize a collaborative model of practice in which the patientand clinician are equal partners, with equal expertise (Bodenheimer et al.,2002a). Whereas the clinician brings expertise in the illness and therapeu-tics, patients are experts in their own lives and in what concerns them andmotivates and enables them to make changes in their lives. This model is thebasis for a collaborative process between the health care provider andpatient in which attainable, short-term goals are identified by the patient,discussed jointly, and agreed upon. Several approaches have been developed in recent years to support individuals' self-management. One example, the Wellness Recovery ActionPlan (WRAP), is a structured approach designed to help individuals withmental illnesses identify internal and external resources for facilitating re-covery, and then use these tools to create a plan for successful living(Copeland, 2002). Creating a WRAP plan generally begins with develop-ment of a personal Wellness Toolbox, consisting of simple, safe, and (usu-ally) free self-management strategies such as a healthy diet, exercise, goodsleep patterns, and pursuit of adult life roles. The person then uses thistoolbox to create an individualized plan for using each strategy to attainand/or maintain recovery. The plan also includes identification of earlywarning signs of symptom exacerbations or crisis, and ways in which thetoolbox can help people manage and feel better. In addition, WRAP en-courages development of a crisis plan, which states how the person wouldlike to be treated in times of crisis (similar to an advance directive), as wellas a postcrisis plan for getting back on the road to recovery. Patient self-management of chronic illness also has become one of the pillars of the Chronic Care Model, reflecting recognition of the fact thatfor chronic illnesses, patients themselves are their principal caregivers\u2014Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html122 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS assuming such responsibilities as regulation of diet and exercise, self- measurement of laboratory values (e.g., blood glucose levels), and medi-cation use. The Chronic Care Model helps patients and their familiesdevelop the skills and confidence to manage their chronic illness, provid-ing self-management tools (e.g., symptom-monitoring flow charts, diets)and routinely assessing the patient's and family's problems and accom-plishments in illness management (Bodenheimer et al., 2002b). Compo-nents of the Chronic Care Model have been applied successfully to thetreatment of depression (Badamgarev et al., 2003; Gilbody et al., 2003;Pincus et al., 2003), and the model has been identified as having potentialapplicability to the care of persons with chronic substance-use illnesses aswell (Watkins et al., 2003). Eliminating Discriminatory Legal and Administrative Policies In addition to the practices recommended above to be undertaken at the locus of care, public policy needs to be aligned to support patient-centeredcare. One very important policy change needed is ending insurance discrimi-nation. Restrictions on access to student loans and the potential lifetime banon receipt of food stamps or welfare (discussed earlier in this chapter) alsoneed to be reexamined to determine whether their success in deterring druguse or achieving other purposes outweighs the obstacles they pose to therecovery of individuals with substance-use illnesses. Attention needs to be paid as well to how coerced treatment is used for individuals with M/SU illnesses. Although the use of coercion is somewhatdifferent for mental and substance-use illnesses, it is likely to continue forthe foreseeable future for many individuals with substance-use illnesses, aswell as for a minority of individuals with mental illnesses. For this reason,it is important that policies governing the use of coercion (1) reduce the riskof its use in situations in which it is not needed by making transparent thepolicies and practices used to assess decision-making capacity and danger-ousness; (2) preserve as much patient decision making as possible whenevercoercion is used, in part by providing comparative information on treat-ment and providers; and (3) minimize the risks associated with coercedtreatment. Research also is needed to better understand the need for, appro-priate use of, and outcomes of coercive practices for treatment of M/SUillnesses. Moreover, coercion can sometimes be avoided altogether. In astudy of inpatient psychiatric admissions in two states, many individualswho experienced involuntary legal commitment reported that they were notoffered the opportunity to enter the hospital voluntarily, and more thanhalf indicated that they would have entered voluntarily had the offer beenmade (Hoge et al., 1997).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Moreover, pressure for treatmentcan be expressed in both positive (persuasion or inducements) or negative(threats or force) forms. Evidence shows that threats and force lead tohigh levels of perceived coercion relative to persuasion and inducement.For this reason, positive pressure, such as persuasion, should be the strat-egy of choice to get people to accept treatment. Negative approachesshould be used in emergencies or when all other options have failed(Dennis and Monahan, 1996). With respect to involuntary commitment or treatment for mental ill- ness or other governmentally imposed treatment for substance use, care-fully crafted criteria for applying governmentally imposed coercion and dueprocess protections would help minimize the risk that involuntary treat-ment mechanisms will be used to serve other than therapeutic ends (Halland Appelbaum, 2002). However, application of even the best-crafted cri-teria is hampered by the lack of standardization in the approaches used byevaluators and the courts to determine both decision-making capacity andthe risk of violence for individuals with mental illnesses. Variation is dueboth to infrequent (though growing) reliance on standardized assessmentmeasures and to a lack of consensus on the relevant normative questions.These normative questions include (1) how much impairment of decisionmaking is tolerable, or at what level of impaired decision making it isappropriate to override a patient's preference to avoid treatment; and (2)how much risk of violence should be tolerated before a person is confinedfor treatment or other coercive interventions are undertaken. These ques-tions cannot be answered solely by empirical research because they involveidentifying and reaching agreement on matters of values. As noted in theprevious discussion of decision making, for example, decisions about aperson's competency status inevitably involve the value judgments of theindividual performing the evaluation (National Bioethics Advisory Com-mission, 1998; Roth et al., 1977). For this reason, some recommend thatthese judgments be made by a group of individuals from diverse back-grounds (Saks and Jeste, 2004). Until more standardized instruments with better normative data and consensus on standards and processes for making such a determination areavailable, following the Quality Chasm's rule of transparency could helpCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The rule oftransparency states: The health care system should make information available to patients and their families that allows them to make informed decisions when selecting a health plan, hospital, or clinical practice, or choosing among alternativetreatments. This should include information describing the system's per- formance on safety, evidence-based practice, and patient satisfaction. (IOM, 2001:8) In M/SU health care, the health care \"system\" encompasses other soci- etal systems that are not as strongly involved in the delivery of generalhealth care\u2014the criminal and juvenile justice, education, and child welfaresystems. The health care delivered under the auspices of these systems andthe policies that influence the delivery of that care also must be transparentto clients, their families, and the public at large so that individuals in needof care, their families, and society can make informed decisions about whenand how coerced treatment is to be used. Policies and practices not only forinitiating coercive treatment, but also for terminating it should be transpar-ent, providing information on what one has to do to be discharged frominvoluntary inpatient or outpatient treatment or to have one's statuschanged to voluntary. Moreover, documenting the tools and approaches used in the judicial system to arrive at decisions to invoke mandatoryoutpatient treatment would be of help in developing the normative data-base needed to provide better guidance to individuals charged with makingthese decisions. Preserving Patient-Centered Care and Patient Decision Making in Coerced Treatment As previously discussed, the ways in which individuals perceive coer- cion vary and are influenced by the nature of the coercive process\u2014theextent to which patients perceive those who are coercive as acting out ofconcern for them; treating them fairly, with respect, and without deception;giving them a chance to tell \"their side of the story\"; and considering whatthey have to say about treatment decisions (Dennis and Monahan, 1996).In all circumstances then, but especially when negative pressures are beingused, patients need to be afforded \"as much process as possible.\" Further,individuals who are coerced into treatment should still be involved in deci-sion making about the types of treatment to be used for their illness and inthe choice of provider.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

These risks can result from errors in care as well as from the delivery ofineffective care. As discussed earlier, while unsafe and ineffective care per-meates all of health care, individuals with M/SU illnesses may be especiallyat risk for errors and vulnerable to their effects. This is the case because thesymptoms of some severe M/SU illnesses, such as major depression orschizophrenia, when not alleviated by therapy, may decrease patients' abil-ity to be involved in the management of their care and therefore to detectand report errors in their care. Moreover, the stigma attached to individualswith M/SU illnesses may render them less likely to be believed when report-ing information about errors and adverse events. These risks may be multi-plied for an individual who has been committed involuntarily to inpatientor outpatient mental health treatment or coerced into treatment for sub-stance use. When the patient's autonomy and treatment preferences aresuperseded, it is critically important that those responsible for making treat-ment decisions use comparative information on provider and treatmentsafety and effectiveness and continue to involve the patient in selecting andevaluating treatment alternatives. Ensuring safe and effective care and preserving patient decision making can be accomplished by providing patients and their family members orother proxy decision makers with information about the illness to be treated;the range of available, evidence-based treatments for the illness and evi-dence on their relative effectiveness; and comparative information on theperformance of individual providers and organizations in treating the ill-ness (see Chapter 4). Needed Research More research is needed on how best to minimize the use of coercion and how to use it most effectively when it is unavoidable. In mental health care: Little hard information exists on the pervasiveness of the various forms of mandated treatment for people with mental disorders, how leverage is imposed, or what the measurable outcomes of using leverage actuallyare. The many vexing legal and ethical questions surrounding mandated treatment have not been thoroughly aired. . . . If policy makers and practitioners in mental health care are to embrace\u2014or repudiate\u2014someor all forms of mandated community treatment, an evidence-based ap- proach must soon replace polemics. (Monahan et al., 2003:37) With respect to the use of coercion in treatment for substance use, research is needed to determine the effects, both positive and negative, of outpatientCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Empirical data will not resolve the debate aboutthe legitimacy of these approaches, but to the extent that their conse-quences are known, such data can inform treatment interventions and policymaking. Data can also help identify how involuntary interventions can beavoided. Recommendations The committee finds that actions in all of the areas addressed in this chapter can help to counteract the effects of stigma and discrimina-tion on patient-centered care. To this end, the committee makes tworecommendations. Recommendation 3-1. To promote patient-centered care, all parties involved in health care for mental or substance-use conditions shouldsupport the decision-making abilities and preferences for treatment andrecovery of persons with M/SU problems and illnesses. Clinicians and organizations providing M/SU treatment services should:-Incorporate informed, patient-centered decision making through- out their practices, including active patient participation in thedesign and revision of patient treatment and recovery plans,the use of psychiatric advance directives, and (for children)informed family decision making. To ensure informed decisionmaking, information on the availability and effectiveness ofM/SU treatment options should be provided. -Adopt recovery-oriented and illness self-management practices that support patient preferences for treatment (including medi-cations), peer support, and other elements of the wellness re-covery plan. -Maintain effective, formal linkages with community resources to support patient illness self-management and recovery. Organizations providing M/SU treatment should also: -Have in place policies that implement informed, patient- centered participation and decision making in treatment, ill-ness self-management, and recovery plans. -Involve patients and their families in the design, administra- tion, and delivery of treatment and recovery services. Accrediting bodies should adopt accreditation standards that re- quire the implementation of these practices.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlSUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING ABILITIES AND PREFERENCES 127 Health plans and direct payers of M/SU treatment services should: -For persons with chronic mental illnesses or substance-use de- pendence, pay for peer support and illness self-managementprograms that meet evidence-based standards. -Provide consumers with comparative information on the qual- ity of care provided by practitioners and organizations, anduse this information themselves when making their purchasingdecisions. -Remove barriers to and restrictions on effective and appropri- ate treatment that may be created by copayments, service ex-clusions, benefit limits, and other coverage policies. The committee wishes to underscore that, with respect to the recom- mendation that health plans and direct payers of M/SU treatment servicespay for peer support and illness self-management programs for individualswith chronic mental and substance-use illnesses, we are not calling forpayment for all programs that involve peer support (including self- andmutual-help 12-step programs) or all programs that aim to teach illness self-management. Rather, the committee recommends funding of peer sup-port and illness self-management programs that provide a standardizedintervention encompassing all components found necessary through em-pirical testing and modeling, that have themselves been empirically tested,and that have been shown to improve health outcomes. The Georgia PeerSupport program and the Stanford University School of Medicine's stan-dardized approach for illness self-management are two examples of suchprograms. Recommendation 3-2. Coercion should be avoided whenever possible. When coercion is legally authorized, patient-centered care is still appli-cable and should be undertaken by: Making the policies and practices used for determining danger- ousness and decision-making capacity transparent to patients andtheir caregivers. Obtaining the best available comparative information on safety, effectiveness, and availability of care and providers, and usingthat information to guide treatment decisions. Maximizing patient decision making and involvement in the se- lection of treatments and providers. The committee notes that the above recommendations will be ineffec- tive if the receipt of care by those who need it is not timely, if the carereceived is of poor quality, and if the necessary linkages with supportiveCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Further, inthe absence of evidence on how best to treat some M/SU conditions,treatment for the same condition often varies inappropriately fromprovider to provider. Moreover, medication errors and the use ofrestraints and seclusion threaten patient safety, while many individualswith serious symptoms of M/SU illnesses receive no treatmentdespite having health insurance and geographic access to healthcare. Finally, although we know about risk factors for the developmentof some M/SU illnesses, the health care system fails to apply thisknowledge in prevention initiatives. As a result, large numbers ofpeople who are at risk of developing M/SU illnesses go on to doso, even as those with existing illnesses cannot always count onreceiving safe and effective care. Remedies for these problems are the same as those for general health care: identifying and disseminating effective practices, providingdecision support for clinicians at the point of care delivery, measuringthe extent to which effective practices are applied, and incorporatingmeasurement results into ongoing quality improvement activities.For multiple reasons, however, the infrastructure to support theseactivities is less well developed for M/SU than for general healthCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Clinical assessment and treatment practices (especially psychosocial interventions) have not been standardized and classifiedfor inclusion in the administrative datasets widely used to analyzevariations in care and other quality-related issues in general healthcare. Initiatives to disseminate advances in evidence-based careoften fail to use effective strategies and available resources. Thedevelopment of performance measures for M/SU health care hasnot received sufficient attention in the private sector, and effortsin the public sector have not yet achieved widespread consensus.Finally, the understanding and use of modern quality improvementmethods have not yet permeated the day-to-day operations oforganizations and individual clinicians delivering M/SU services\u2014both those in the general health care sector and those providingspecialty M/SU health care. The committee recommends a five-part strategy to build this infrastructure and improve the safety and effectiveness ofM/SU health care: (1) a more coordinated strategy for filling thegaps in the evidence base; (2) a stronger, more coordinated, andevidence-based approach to disseminating evidence to clinicians;(3) improved diagnostic and assessment strategies; (4) a strongerinfrastructure for measuring and reporting the quality of M/SUhealth care; and (5) support for quality improvement practices atthe locus of health care. PROBLEMS IN THE QUALITY OF CARE As in general health care, there is ample evidence of problems in the quality of care for mental and/or substance-use (M/SU) problems and ill-nesses. These problems include (1) failure to provide care consistent withexisting scientific evidence, (2) variations in care that occur when clearevidence on effective care is lacking, (3) failure to provide any treatment for an M/SU illness or to address the risk factors associated with the develop-ment of these illnesses, and (4) unsafe care. Failure to Provide Care Consistent with Scientific Evidence Numerous studies document the discrepancy between M/SU care that is known to be effective and the care that is actually delivered. An extensivereview of all peer-reviewed studies published from 1992 through 2000 inMedline, the Cochrane Collaborative, and related sources that assessedrates of adherence to specific clinical practice guidelines for treating diverseM/SU clinical conditions (including alcohol withdrawal, bipolar disorder,depression, panic disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, and substance abuse)Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html142 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS found that of the 21 cross-sectional studies showing unequivocal results, only 24 percent documented adequate adherence to the aspect(s) of thepractice guidelines under study. Of 5 pre/post studies, only 2 showed ad-equate adherence rates. When these two groups of naturalistic studies werecombined, only 27 percent demonstrated adequate rates of adherence. Bet-ter adherence was observed in 6 of the 9 controlled trials reviewed 1 (Bauer, 2002). Subsequent studies have continued to document clinicians' depar-tures from evidence-based practice guidelines for conditions as varied asattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Rushton et al., 2004),anxiety disorders (Stein et al., 2004), conduct disorders in children (Zima etal., 2005), comorbid mental and substance-use illnesses (Watkins et al.,2001), depression in adults (Simon et al., 2001) and children (Richardson etal., 2004), opioid dependence (D'Aunno and Pollack, 2002), use of illicitdrugs (Friedmann et al., 2001), and schizophrenia (Buchanan et al., 2002). As in general health care, M/SU care received by members of racial and ethnic minorities is even less consistent with standards for effective carethan that received by nonminority members. Two nationally representativestudies found that members of ethnic minorities were less likely to receiveappropriate care for depression or anxiety than were white Americans(Wang et al., 2000; Young et al., 2001). Likewise, facilities dispensingmethadone for the treatment of opioid dependence that have a greaterpercentage of African American patients have been shown to be more likelyto dispense low and ineffective doses (D'Aunno and Pollack, 2002). A 1999 comparison of the performance of 67.7 percent of the nation's health maintenance organizations (HMOs) on five measures of the qualityof mental health care 2 and nine measures3 of the quality of general health care found that the HMOs delivered mental health care in accordance withstandards of care on average 48 percent of the time, compared with anaverage of 69 percent for the nine general health care measures (Druss etal., 2002). In a landmark study of the quality of a wide variety of healthcare received by U.S. citizens, individuals with many different types ofillnesses received guideline-concordant care about 50 percent of the time,whereas those with alcohol dependence received care consistent with scien-tific knowledge only about 10.5 percent of the time (McGlynn et al., 2003). 1This was attributed to the multifaceted and intensive strategies employed to facilitate and maintain the uptake of these practice guidelines. 2Timely ambulatory care after inpatient hospitalization (two measures), medication man- agement of depression (two measures), and outpatient care for depression (one measure). 3Adolescent immunizations, use of specific drugs after a heart attack, breast cancer screen- ing, child immunizations, delivery of prenatal care in the first trimester, postpartum check- ups, cervical cancer screening, cholesterol screening, and eye examinations for diabetics.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlEVIDENCE BASE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE 143 This failure to provide care consistent with evidence also is manifest in the failure to offer ongoing care for substance dependence consistent withthe condition's chronic nature. Historically, drug dependence has been con-ceptualized as a disease, a bad habit, or a sin (Musto, 1973). Despitesignificant differences among these perspectives, all are based on a viewthat often persists today: that some limited (often very limited) amount,duration, and/or intensity of therapies, medications, and services should beadequate to cause patients with a drug dependence illness to \"learn theirlesson,\" \"achieve insight,\" and especially \"change their ways.\" The expec-tation is that once patients have achieved that insight or learned that lesson,they will be ready for discharge from treatment and will continue as recov-ered for a substantial period of time. This view has led to the universallyapplied convention of evaluating the outcomes of treatment through mea-surement of patient performance 6-12 (or more) months following dis-charge from treatment (see Finney et al., 1996; Gerstein and Harwood,1990; Gossop et al., 2001; Hubbard et 1989; McLellan et al., 1993a,b;Project MATCH Research Group, 1997; Simpson et al., 1997, 1999). In fact, however, most alcohol- and drug-dependent patients relapse following cessation of treatment (IOM, 1998; McLellan, 2002). In general,about 50-60 percent of patients begin reusing within 6 months of treatmentcessation, regardless of the type of discharge, patient characteristics, or theparticular substance(s) used (IOM, 1998; McKay et al., 1999, 2004;McLellan, 2002). It is increasingly apparent that patients with more chronicforms of substance-use illnesses require and do well with appropriatelytailored continuing care and monitoring (McKay, 2005; McLellan et al.,2000). Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that many cases of substance-use illness are best treated with the same type and level of ongoing clinicalsupport as other chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabe-tes (McLellan et al., 2000). Variations in Care Due to a Lack of Evidence Variations in health care are driven by a variety of factors\u2014some ap- propriate and therapeutic, others not. Appropriate variations in care resultwhen clinicians tailor therapeutic regimens to patients' unique clinical con-ditions, in consultation with patients about their expressed preferences andvalues. Undesirable variations reflect departures from widely acceptedevidence-based standards of care (as described above) due to provider pref-erences, traditions, ignorance of evidence-based standards, or administra-tive or financial constraints. Variations also result from inconsistencies indiagnosis (described later in this chapter) and from the absence of widelyaccepted standards of care. Variations in the absence of clinical practiceguidelines have been documented, for example, in the use of seclusion andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A 1999-2000 cross-sectional study of the care of children and adolescents at resi-dential treatment centers in four states, for instance, found that 42.9 per-cent of youths receiving antipsychotic medications had no history of orcurrent psychosis and were thus receiving those medications for \"off-label\" purposes. Significant regional differences in the prescription of anti-psychotic drugs were found across the four states and were associated withthe presence of attention deficit/impulsivity, substance use, the duration ofsymptoms, danger to others, sexually abusive behavior, elopement, andcrime/delinquency. The use of antipsychotic medications to treat aggressionand conduct disorders has been reported in the clinical literature and iden-tified as an off-label use. Yet positive outcomes for their use in children totreat attention deficit/impulsivity disorders is not well documented andraises concerns, as does the widespread use of antipsychotics for off-labelpurposes generally and the regional variations in this practice (Rawal et al.,2004). There is historical evidence that race and ethnicity account for some of these variations. African Americans have been more likely to receiveantipsychotics across the diagnostic spectrum, even without indications fortheir use (Strickland et al., 1991), and more likely than whites to receivethese medications \"PRN\" (as needed) and in higher doses (Chung et al.,1995; Strakowski et al., 1993). Failure to Treat and Prevent Failure to Treat More than a decade ago, the 1990-1992 National Comorbidity Study documented the high proportion of individuals with symptoms of seriousmental illness who failed to receive any treatment for their condition (Wanget al., 2002). Since that time, progress has been made. Recent studies haveshown improvements in access to and receipt of care for those with themost severe mental illnesses (Kessler et al., 2005; Mechanic and Bilder,2004). And although the prevalence of M/SU illnesses has remained thesame over the past decade, a greater proportion of all non-aged adults withM/SU problems and illnesses have received treatment. Between 1990 and1992, 20.3 percent of individuals with a mental \"disorder\" received treat-ment; between 2001 and 2003 this proportion was 32.9 percent (Kessler etal., 2005). Improvements also have been noted in the access to care forchildren with these illnesses (Glied and Cuellar, 2003).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlEVIDENCE BASE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE 145 Despite this progress, however, the same reports showing improved access to care for some reveal that many others who need treatment still donot receive it (Mechanic and Bilder, 2004); this is true especially for ethnicminorities (Kessler et al., 2005). Between 2001 and 2003, fewer than half(40.5 percent) of individuals with symptoms of a serious mental illnessreceived treatment (Kessler et al., 2005), and there is evidence of a declinein access for those with less severe mental illnesses (Kessler et al., 2005;Mechanic and Bilder, 2004). Findings of recent studies similarly reaffirmthe continuing failure to treat substance-use problems and illnesses (Watkinset al., 2001). These failures to treat persist, even when individuals are receiving some type of health care and have financial and geographic access to care.For example, data for 1998-2001 from a seven-site longitudinal studyof 1,088 youths in residential, outpatient, and inpatient treatment fordrug use show that 43 percent of the youths reported receiving no mentalhealth services in the 3 months after being admitted, despite having severemental health problems at the time of admission. At three siteswhere mental health services were provided at no additional charge, ratesof service receipt for those with severe mental illnesses were 6 percent, 28percent, and 79 percent, respectively. In contrast, rates of receipt of carefor comorbid general health problems among these youths ranged from 64to 71 percent (Jaycox et al., 2003). Results of the 2003 National Survey onDrug Use and Health document a similar failure to treat adults. Data fromanother national survey conducted in 1997-1998 reveal that among per-sons with probable comorbid mental and substance-use disorders whoreceived treatment for one of these conditions, fewer than a third (28.6percent) received treatment for the other (Watkins et al., 2001). Reasons for the failure to treat M/SU illnesses have not been fully determined, but the finding of low treatment rates in the presence of accessto services and no additional cost to the patient indicates that access andability to pay are not always the only contributing factors. This point isconfirmed by responses of civilian, noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 andolder to the 2003 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which capturedseparately information on mental and substance-use problems and illnesses.These respondents reported the following reasons for not receiving mentalhealth treatment that they believe they needed: cost/insurance issues (45.1percent), did not feel the need for treatment at the time/could handle theproblem without treatment (40.6 percent), did not know where to go forservices (22.9 percent), stigma (22.8 percent), did not have time (18.1percent), believed treatment would not help (10.3 percent), fear of beingcommitted/having to take medication (7.2 percent), and other access barri-ers (3.7 percent).

Other studies of factors that influence consumers' entry into alcohol and drug treatment have found that individuals with alcohol or drug prob-lems who do not experience recovery on their own typically do not go intotreatment until their problems become severe or until social circumstances,such as workplace problems or criminal offenses, send them there. In a2001 nationally representative survey of individuals in recovery from alco-hol or drug illnesses and their families, 60 percent reported that denial ofaddiction or refusal to admit the severity of the problem was the greatestbarrier to their recovery. Embarrassment or shame was the second mostfrequently cited obstacle (Peter D. Hart Research Associates, Inc., 2001).Factors that drive these individuals to seek help vary over the course of theiralcohol or drug use. Early on, these factors include adverse social conse-quences in the workplace, criminal convictions, or serious disturbances ininterpersonal relationships. As substance use progresses over time, healthproblems related to use are associated with seeking treatment (Satre et al.,2004; Weisner and Matzger, 2002). Individuals who are members of ethnic minorities face additional ob- stacles to receiving needed mental health services (DHHS, 2001). Despiteroughly similar levels of need, ethnic minorities are less likely to receivemental health care than are white Americans. Blacks, for example, are only50 percent as likely to receive psychiatric treatment as whites when bothreceive a diagnosis of the same severity (Kessler et al., 2005). Latino chil-dren also have higher rates of unmet need relative to other children (Kataokaet al., 2002). Access to mental health services may be restricted for ethnicminorities for multiple reasons\u2014for example, because they are more apt tobe uninsured (Brown et al., 2000), because ethnic minority providers and/or providers with appropriate language capabilities are often unavailable,and because they may have less trust in the health care system (LaVeist etal., 2000). Failure to Prevent Sometimes failure to provide care occurs at the level of the health system, rather than at the patient-provider level. The United States, likeother developed countries, has structures and mechanisms in place to ad-dress threats to the public's health that arise from both external environ-mental conditions and an individual's personal health practices.

Examples are primary prevention of cancer and heartdisease, for which the public health system has targeted known risk factors(e.g., diet, exercise, lipid levels, smoking) despite the lack of such knowl-edge. This risk reduction model of prevention targets the risk factors knownto be associated with an illness or injury. By contrast, despite scientificevidence on risk factors associated with some mental illnesses (predomi-nantly in children and adolescents) and effective interventions to mitigatethese factors (see, e.g., Beardslee et al., 2003; Hollon et al., 2002; Mojtabaiet al., 2003), this evidence has not yet been widely applied in practice(Davis, 2002), and the prevalence 4 of M/SU problems and illnesses does not appear to have declined over the past decade (Kessler et al., 2005). Although there is not yet clear evidence to support preventive interven- tions for specific diagnoses (e.g., ADHD, anxiety, or depression), risk fac-tors have been identified that have been helpful for developing broad,school-based preventive programs that generally target \"behavior prob-lems.\" This prevention literature for children is focused largely in twoareas: (1) risk factors for conduct problems, serious disruptive behaviors,and violence, and testing of interventions aimed at preventing the onset ofthose problems (Kazdin, 2003; Patterson et al., 1989, 1993; Webster-Stratton and Hammond, 1997, 1999); and (2) prevention of depressionamong adolescents (Clarke et al., 1995; Lewinsohn, 1987) or children(Beardslee et al., 1996, 1997; Podorefsky et al., 2001). The U.S. SurgeonGeneral's report on youth violence also clearly sets forth the evidence forprevention of violent behavior (Office of the Surgeon General, 2001). Unsafe Care As with the quality of M/SU health care overall, less is known about errors in or injuries due to M/SU treatment services than is the case forgeneral health care (Bates et al., 2003; Moos, 2005). This is especially truefor errors that occur in outpatient settings, where the greatest proportion oftreatment for individuals with M/SU problems and illnesses is provided.Some mental health \"interventions\" have been found to be harmful subse-quent to their use; examples are organized visits to jails and prisons bychildren or adolescents to deter their future delinquency (sometimes knownas \"scared straight\" programs) (Petrosino et al., 2005) and rebirthingtherapy (Lilienfeld et al., 2003). Others, such as critical incidence stress 4Data on incidence are not available.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Most data on threats to safety have been collected on medication errors andthe use of seclusion and restraints in mental health care. Errors or injuriesfrom treatment for substance-use problems and illnesses have not yet re-ceived substantial attention. Although an estimated 7-15 percent of pa-tients who receive psychosocial treatment for substance use may be worseoff after treatment, a conceptual model to help distinguish the iatrogeniceffects of the intervention from other factors that can cause worsening ofsubstance-use problems (e.g., social isolation) has only recently been pro-posed (Moos, 2005). Medication Errors A Medline search for articles published between 1996 and 2003 on medication errors (one of the most common types of health care errors) inpsychiatric treatment revealed relatively few data available, and only ahandful of studies of adverse drug events in inpatient psychiatric settings.Although studies of adverse drug events in general hospitals have yieldeddata on errors involving psychotropic drugs, less is known about medica-tion errors in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general hospi-tals. Moreover, as recently as 2002, terms such as \"adverse drug events,\"\"medication errors,\" and \"adverse drug reactions\" were not even listed askey search words in several widely read psychiatric journals (Grasso et al.,2003b). Errors committed in substance-use treatment also have receivedlittle attention. What is known from the few published studies gives cause for concern. A retrospective, multidisciplinary review of the charts of 31 randomly se-lected patients in a state psychiatric hospital discharged during a 4 1/2-month study period detected 2,194 medication errors during these patients'entire 1,448 inpatient days. 5 Of the 2,194 errors, 19 percent were rated as having the potential to cause minor harm, 23 percent moderate harm, and58 percent severe harm (Grasso et al., 2003a). Another 12-month study ofall long-term residents of 18 community-based nursing homes in Massa-chusetts found that psychoactive medications (antipsychotics, antidepres-sants, and sedatives/hypnotics) were among the most common medications 5These medication error rates are consistent with rates reported in studies occurring in general medical hospitals, but the distribution of the types of errors is markedly different. A much higher proportion of errors (66 percent) occurred during the administration of the medication as opposed to its prescribing, transcription, or dispensing. The authors note thatat the time the study was conducted, medication administration was performed by medical technicians as opposed to licensed nurses\u2014a practice that was discontinued subsequent to the study (Grasso et al., 2003a).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

With respect to ambulatory care, additional safety concerns have been raised about the practice of long-term treatment with combinations ofantipsychotic medications (except in instances of failures of monotherapyusing different drugs). The use of combinations of antipsychotic medica-tions continues despite (1) the absence of evidence to support the practice,(2) the lack of evidence to inform clinicians about how to adjust dosages inthe face of increased symptoms or side effects, and (3) increased risks to thepatient from problematic side effects and failure to adhere to treatment(Miller and Craig, 2002). Similarly, experts in children's mental health careexpress concern about the growing use of atypical antipsychotics to treataggression in children and adolescents in the face of limited basic andclinical research supporting the rationale, efficacy, and safety of using theseagents for this purpose (Patel et al., 2005). Seclusion and Restraint Use of seclusion and restraint, while necessary in some emergency situ- ations to prevent harm to a patient or others, also is associated with sub-stantial psychological and physical harm to patients (GAO, 1999). Thefederal government estimates that each year approximately 150 individualsin the United States die as the direct result of these practices (SAMHSA,2004b). In 1998, the death of an 11-year-old boy who died while secludedand restrained in a psychiatric hospital focused national attention on therisks to patients when these approaches are used. A follow-up report of theU.S. General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Of-fice) (GAO) confirmed the danger of improper use of seclusion and re-straint and called attention to inadequate monitoring and reporting of theiruse, inconsistent and insufficient standards for their use and reporting bylicensing and accreditation bodies, and widespread failure to employ strat-egies that can prevent their use and reduce the risk of related injuries.Children experience higher rates of seclusion and restraint relative to adultsand are at greater risk of injury from their use (GAO, 1999). Consumers and their advocates, professional associations, provider or- ganizations, and the federal government recommend substantial reductionsin the use of seclusion and restraint (American Association of CommunityPsychiatrists, 2003; NAMI, 2003; NASMHPD, 1999, 2005; SAMHSA,2004b). GAO found that these practices can be greatly reduced throughstrong management commitment and leadership, defined principles andpolicies regarding when and how they may be used, a requirement to reporttheir use, staff training in their safe use and alternative approaches, andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Pennsylvania's state psychiatrichospital system, for example, which called attention to the use of seclusionand restraints as an indicator of \"treatment failure,\" sharply decreasedtheir use from 107.9 hours per 1,000 patient days in 1993 to 2.72 hours per1,000 patient days in 2000 through quality improvement initiatives in allstate psychiatric hospitals (Smith et al., 2005). Use of seclusion and restraint continues, however, despite a Cochrane Collaboration finding that \"few other forms of treatment which are appliedto patients with various psychiatric diagnoses are so lacking in basic infor-mation about their proper use and efficacy (Sailas and Fenton, 2005:4). Asa result, seclusion and restraints are frequently applied without clear indica-tions for their use (Finke, 2001) and can lead to death (Denogean, 2003;Schnaars, 2003), physical harm (Mohr et al., 2003), or severe psychologicaltrauma (Pflueger, 2002). 7 Individuals admitted to inpatient psychiatric care often have a history of sexual or other physical abuse (Goodman et al.,1997; Mueser et al., 2002). Being physically overpowered, restrained, orplaced in a locked room may have many features in common with the abuseexperienced earlier by these individuals. Heightened Safety Concerns and Need for Multiple Actions The limited information on the safety of M/SU health care is of particu- lar concern because some of the unique features of M/SU illnesses and theirtreatments could make patients less able to detect and avoid errors andmore vulnerable to errors and adverse events when they occur. For ex-ample, the stigma experienced by individuals with M/SU illnesses may makethem less willing to report errors and adverse events and less likely to bebelieved when they do so. The symptoms of some severe illnesses, such asmajor depression or schizophrenia, when not alleviated by therapy, alsocould interfere with a patient's ability to detect and report medicationerrors. The departures from scientific knowledge, variations in care, failures to treat and prevent, and unsafe practices discussed above have multiple causes.These include (1) gaps in the evidence base, (2) problems in disseminatingexisting evidence to clinicians and ensuring its uptake, (3) greater subjectiv- 6These initiatives are intended to complement other essential elements, such as adequate numbers of well-trained staff and the use of proven psychological and medication treatments. 7Because reporting of the use of seclusion and restraints is not required, however, data on prevalence rates for their use and rates of adverse consequences are not available.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Thefollowing sections of this chapter present evidence on these issues anddescribe actions that can be taken to address them, specifically by: Improving the production of evidence. Improving diagnosis and assessment. Using evidence-based practices and untapped resources to better disseminate the evidence. Strengthening the quality measurement and reporting infrastructure. Applying quality improvement methods at the locus of care. Related issues of improved care coordination, use of information technol- ogy, implications of a more diverse workforce, and creation of incentives inthe marketplace to support this five-part strategy are addressed in succeed-ing chapters. IMPROVING THE PRODUCTION OF EVIDENCE Gaps in the Evidence Base Efficacious Treatments Over the past two decades, there has been an impressive increase in the number and quality of studies on M/SU problems, illnesses, and therapiesfor both children (Burns and Hoagwood, 2004, 2005; Pappadopulos et al.,2004; Weisz, 2004) and adults (IOM, 1997; Johnson et al., 2000). None-theless, gaps remain in our knowledge of how to treat some M/SU condi-tions, how to care simultaneously for multiple comorbidities, how to carefor some population subgroups, and which evidence-based therapies arebetter than others or best of all (see Box 4-1). Such gaps in knowledge mean that evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are unavailable for many M/SU problems and illnesses. The Efficacy-Effectiveness Gap In addition to the above gaps in knowledge of efficacious therapies, there has been more research on the efficacy of specific treatments than on the effectiveness of these treatments when delivered in usual settings of care; in the presence of comorbid conditions, social stressors, and varyingdegrees of social support; and when administered by service providers with-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

For example, while numerous clinical efficacy studies havedocumented that psychostimulant medications reduce the core symptomsof ADHD, accumulating evidence suggests that this drug treatment is muchless effective as currently delivered in routine community settings (Lefeveret al., 2003). For people with severe mental illnesses and many substance-use problems and illnesses, how well the clinical aspects of treatment workis often closely related to such factors as housing, income support, andemployment-related activities. This complicates considerations regardingeffectiveness and has resulted in calls for improved research efforts (dis-cussed below) that can provide information on both the effectiveness andefficacy of interventions (Carroll and Rounsaville, 2003; Tunis et al., 2003;Wolff, 2000). Although the knowledge gaps discussed above also exist for general health care, some of the tools and strategies used to build the evidence baseBOX 4-1 Some of the Knowledge Gaps in Treatment for M/SU Conditions Therapies for children and older adults. Knowledge about how to best care for individuals at both ends of the age continuum is limited, including how to incorpo-rate effective treatment for the most prevalent disorders of childhood (i.e., anxiety, ADHD, depression, conduct disorders) into routine care (Hoagwood et al., 2001; Stein, 2002), the effect of multiple medications on children's outcomes, and thecomparative efficacy of different therapies for severe conditions (e.g., bipolar dis- order, childhood depression) (Kane et al., 2003). Evidence is also needed on how to better care for older adults with comorbid conditions and the frail elderly in usualsettings of care (Borson et al., 2001). Treatment of multiple conditions. In spite of the high frequency of comorbid mental, substance-use, and general illnesses (see Chapters 1 and 5), there is a substantial lack of knowledge about effective treatment for individuals with com- plex comorbidity (Kessler, 2004). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder/Acute Stress Disorder. Better evidence is needed about effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) andacute stress disorder (ASD), e.g., how best to combine pharmacotherapy and psy- chotherapy, and how to relieve some specific symptoms, such as insomnia or nightmares, and in the presence of other medications. Moreover, although cogni-tive and behavioral therapies have demonstrated efficacy in treating victims of sexual assault, interpersonal violence, and industrial or vehicular accidents, their effectiveness in treating PTSD or ASD in combat veterans or victims of mass vio-lence requires further study (Work Group on ASD and PTSD, 2004).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Research on M/SU health care needs to make greater use of these ap-proaches to generating evidence on effective therapies. Filling the Gaps in the Evidence Base As is the case for general health care, federal agencies, philanthropic orga- nizations, and other private-sector entities undertake many efforts to identifypriority areas in M/SU health care in need of evidence, fund and conductresearch, and support systematic reviews of research findings to identifyevidence-based therapies. A strategy for coordinating these various efforts isarticulated in Chapter 9. However, the large number of gaps in the evidencebase for M/SU health care also requires that all sources of valid and reliableinformation be used to produce as much evidence as quickly, comprehensively,and accurately as possible. Three sources of information have been under-Psychotic illnesses. Questions remain about which antipsychotic medication should be the first line of therapy, what constitutes a sufficient period of time for atrial of a new medication to see if it is effective, and how to handle poor response to the initial prescribed medication (Kane et al., 2003). Moreover, the use of mul- tiple antipsychotic medications takes place despite a lack of evidence about theircombined efficacy and how to manage their dosing when increased symptoms or side effects occur (Miller and Craig, 2002). Amphetamine or marijuana dependence. No medications have yet been found effective in treating these dependencies. Cocaine dependence. No medications are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat this dependency. Relative effectiveness of different treatments. Multiple therapies are used to treat the same illness. For example, more than 550 psychotherapies are currently in use for children and adolescents, with little helpful information for clinicians orconsumers about their comparative effectiveness (Kazdin, 2000, 2004). As in other areas of health care, the federal government's drug approval rules give little incen- tive for head-to-head clinical trials (Pincus, 2003), and there is a lack of substantialcapital investment in developing and testing psychosocial interventions. Therapies for other population subgroups. Ethnic and cultural minorities are largely missing from efficacy studies for many treatments (DHHS, 2001) in spite of growing evidence that drug dosages may vary by ethnic status (Lin et al., 1997). Few of these studies had the power necessary to examine the impact of care onspecific minorities.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Steps canbe taken to make better use of each of these sources. Studies Other Than Randomized Controlled Trials While well-designed randomized controlled trials are recognized as the gold standard for generating sound clinical evidence, experts note that thesheer number of possible pharmacological and nonpharmacological treat-ments for many M/SU illnesses makes relying solely on such studies toidentify evidence-based care infeasible (Essock et al., 2003). Others addthat some features of mental health care make use of randomized controlledtrials methodologically problematic as well. For example, in studies of theeffectiveness of psychotherapy, the therapist and the patient cannot beblinded to the intervention, delivery of a placebo psychotherapeutic inter-vention is difficult to conceptualize, and standardization of the interventionis problematic because therapists must respond to what happens in a psy-chotherapy session as it unfolds (Tanenbaum, 2003). For such reasons, thebehavioral and social sciences have often used quasi-experimental as well asqualitative research designs (National Academy of Sciences, undated), prac-tices that are sometimes a source of contention. Some assert that quasi-experimental studies often are more useful than randomized controlled trials in generating practical information on how toprovide effective mental health interventions in some clinical areas (Essocket al., 2003). Consistent with this assertion, the U.S. Preventive ServicesTask Force notes that a well-designed cohort study may be more compel-ling than a poorly designed or weakly powered randomized controlled trial(Harris et al., 2001). Observational studies also have been identified as avalid source of evidence that is useful in determining aspects of betterquality of care (West et al., 2002). However, others note the comparativeweakness of these study designs in controlling for bias and other sources oferror and exclude them from systematic reviews of evidence for the deter-mination of evidence-based practices. A discussion of variations in study design and their implications for systematic reviews of evidence is beyond the scope of this report; manyresearchers and methodologists are considering strategies for addressingthese difficult issues (Wolff, 2000). As this study was under way, the Na-tional Research Council had established a planning committee to overseethe development of a broad, multiyear effort\u2014the Standards of Evidence-Strategic Planning Initiative\u2014to identify critical issues affecting the qualityand utility of research in the behavioral and social sciences and education(National Academy of Sciences, undated).

Better Capture of Mental and Substance-Use Health Care Data in Administrative Datasets In general health care, routinely collected administrative data (e.g., claims or encounter data) that are generally produced each time a patient isadmitted to a hospital or makes a visit to an ambulatory heath care pro-vider are widely used for health services research, epidemiologic studies,and quality assessment and improvement initiatives (Iezzoni, 1997; Zhanand Miller, 2003). While these datasets have limitations with respect totheir completeness, accuracy, and level of detail (AHRQ, 2004a; Iezzoni,1997), administrative data remain a preferred and routinely used source ofinformation for multiple quality-related purposes because they are readilyavailable, inexpensive, and computer readable (AHRQ, 2004b; Zhan andMiller, 2003). For example, analysis of administrative data revealed thenow well-known and sizable variations that exist in clinical care within theUnited States, an analysis that continues today (Mullan, 2004; Wennberg,1999). Consequently, administrative data produce a variety of clinical qual-ity indicators for hospital care (AHRQ, 2004b), underpin many of thequality measures found in the National Committee for Quality Assurance's(NCQA) Healthplan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) perfor-mance measures (NCQA, 2004a), and are the data source for the Agencyfor Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) new patient safety indica-tors (Zhan and Miller, 2003). Because of their utility, administrative dataare viewed as a mainstay of health services research on quality of care(Iezzoni, 1997) and are likely to become even more so as the NationalHealth Information Infrastructure is developed (see Chapter 6). These inpatient and outpatient datasets typically contain standardized information on each individual's diagnosis (using International Classifica-tion of Diseases [ICD] codes) and on the specific therapies and proceduresperformed for that diagnosis (using the American Medical Association's[AMA] Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes, the Centers for Medi-care and Medicaid Services' (CMS) Healthcare Common Procedure CodingSystem [HCPCS] for outpatient care, and ICD, ninth revision, ClinicalModification (ICD-9-CM) procedure codes for inpatient care). However,these codes are less useful at present for the study of M/SU care than for thestudy of general health care for several reasons. Psychotherapy codes arefew and imprecise and differ across inpatient and outpatient settings. Codesfor other psychosocial services generally are absent, as are codes for the useof restraints.

CPT codes CPT psychotherapy codes generally do not indicate what spe- cific type of psychotherapy was provided, only that psychotherapy in gen-eral was provided and how long the session lasted. The 2005 CPT codes(AMA, 2004a) include only two main codes for psychotherapy: \"Insight Oriented, Behavior Modifying and/or Supportive Psychotherapy\" in an office or other outpatient facility, approximately 20 to 30, or 45 to 50, or 75 to 80 minutes face-to-face with the patient (codes 90804, 90806,and 90808 respectively) without or with (codes 90805, 90807, or 90809) accompanying medical evaluation and management services. \"Interactive Psychotherapy\" which consists of individual psychotherapy, interactive, using play equipment, physical devices, language interpreter, or other mechanism of non-verbal communication, in an office or outpa- tient facility for approximately 20 to 30, or 45 to 50, or 75 to 80 minutesface-to-face with the patient (codes 90810, 90812, and 90814, respectively). These codes are typically used for children or others who have not yet developed or who have lost language communication skills. A similar number of codes exist for these same services when provided in an inpatient hospital, partial hospital, or residential care facility. Sixother codes for psychoanalysis and group, family, and interactive psycho-therapy exist, as well as 10 codes for \"Other Psychiatric Services or Proce-dures,\" such as electroconvulsive treatments, hypnotherapy, and biofeed-back. With the exception of a code for psychoanalysis, none of these codesidentify the specific type of psychotherapy administered (e.g., cognitivetherapy, behavior modification, cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonaltherapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, prolonged exposure therapy forindividuals suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, Gestalt therapy,movement/dance/art therapy, humanistic existential therapy, eyemovement desensitization therapy, primal therapy, person-centered therapy,multisystemic therapy, and the many variants of these. Nor are there proce-dure codes for the use of diagnostic or behavioral assessment instruments.Other evidence-based psychotherapies, as well as psychosocial interven-tions such as family psychoeducation, multisystemic therapy, illness self-management programs, and assertive community treatment also do nothave designated CPT codes. Moreover, a recent initiative of the AMA andthe CPT Editorial Panel to develop codes for performance measurement(CPT II codes) and emerging technologies, services, and procedures (CPTIII codes) has not yet adequately addressed M/SU health care.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The growing use of administrative data forresearch purposes also instigated their development. The CPT II codescurrently address specific types of patient management (e.g., prenatal care);patient history-taking activities (e.g., assessment of tobacco use, anginalsymptoms and level of activity); physical examination processes (e.g., mea-surement of blood pressure); and therapeutic, preventive, or other interven-tions (e.g., counseling or intervention for cessation of tobacco use andprescription of certain medications). 8 CPT III codes for new and emerging technologies include a new code for online medical evaluation service usingthe Internet or similar electronic communications network (AMA, 2004a).NCQA is proposing to use the new CPT II codes for the first time in HEDIS2006 to capture data on blood pressure ( 140/90 mm Hg or > 140/90), prenatal and postpartum care, beta-blocker treatment after heart attacks,diabetes care, and cholesterol management after a cardiovascular event(NCQA, 2005). Category II codes are reviewed by a Performance Measures Advisory Group (PMAG) made up of performance measurement experts representingAHRQ, CMS, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Orga-nizations (JCAHO), NCQA, and the AMA's Physician Consortium forPerformance Improvement (the Consortium). The PMAG may seek addi-tional expertise and/or input as necessary from other national health careorganizations, including national medical specialty societies, other nationalhealth care professional associations, accrediting bodies, and federal regu-latory agencies, and will consider code proposals submitted by nationalregulatory agencies, accrediting bodies, national professional and medicalspecialty societies, and other organizations (AMA, 2004a). ICD-9 procedure codes ICD-9 procedure codes for inpatient care are some- what more detailed than the CPT codes with respect to psychotherapy. Forexample, they include a separate code for behavior therapies such as \"aver-sion therapy, behavior modification, desensitization therapy, extinctiontherapy, relaxation therapy, and token economy.\" They do not, however,include a code for use of restraints in psychiatric care, although there aretwo codes for use of \"isolation.\" Similarly, ICD-9-E codes, used to classifyexternal events or circumstances that can cause injury or other adverseevents, do not include a specific code for injuries obtained during the appli- 8Codes for diagnostic/screening processes or results, follow-up or other outcomes, and patient safety are planned but not yet included in the 2005 version.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

As a result, when psychotherapy is delivered to a patient and paid for by insurers, it is essentially a \"black box.\" In child and adolescent therapyalone, for example, it is conservatively estimated that, even if one omitsvarious combinations of treatments and variants of treatments that are notsubstantially different, there are more than 550 psychotherapies in use(Kazdin, 2000). Because of their lack of specificity, however, administrativedata currently cannot document the extent of variation in therapeutic prac-tice and trends over time as they have done for general health care. More-detailed therapy codes, type-of-provider codes, 9 and codes that use consis- tent terminology across inpatient and outpatient settings could help inmeasuring the use and variation in use of the many hundreds of types ofpsychotherapy. Moreover, if the type of psychotherapy were routinely cap-tured in administrative data and combined with data on patients' reportsregarding the results of their care (as are currently obtained in some con-sumer surveys now in use), such information could assist in evaluating theeffectiveness of different therapies in the field, in contrast to evaluation of their efficacy in experimentally controlled settings (see above and the dis- cussion of outcome data below). The absence of detailed administrativedata linked to patient outcomes makes it difficult to discern the relativeeffectiveness of different therapies or whether, as some assert, the effective-ness of the therapist's relationship with the client may be equally or moreimportant than the type of therapy provided (Levant, 2004; Norcross,2002). Moreover, performance measurement and improvement would befacilitated by this type of administrative data. Performance measures basedon administrative data, such as claims data, are more likely to be used thanmeasures based on more costly or labor-intensive sources of data, such asmedical records or patient surveys (Hermann et al., 2000).

(NASMHPD), and the National Association ofState Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, Inc.

Similar, expanded efforts in coordination with public- and private-sector experts in coding,evidence-based practices, and use of administrative datasets could helpsubstantially in building the evidence base on the effectiveness of differentM/SU treatments. Collection of Outcome Data from Patients Patients are increasingly recognized as valid judges of the quality of their health care (Iezzoni, 1997); this applies equally to general and M/SUhealth care. In addition to reporting on their experiences with care deliveryprocesses\u2014such as the extent to which they were able to participate indecisions about their own care and gain skill in the self-management oftheir illness\u2014consumers can provide information on the effectiveness oftreatment in reducing symptoms and improving functioning (Hibbard,2003). Moreover, \"the shift toward patient-centered care has meant that abroader range of outcomes from the patient's perspective needs to be mea- sured in order to understand the true benefits and risks of healthcare inter-ventions.\" (emphasis added) (Stanton, 2002:2) Patient questionnaires thatask about the extent to which patients' symptoms have been reduced as aresult of treatment are already being used to measure outcomes for treat-ment of general medical conditions such as benign prostatic hypertrophyand cataracts. These questionnaires have been found to yield accurate andreliable information on the extent of improvement in symptoms, providingdetailed and sensitive measures of treatment effectiveness from the patient'sperspective. For example, the VF-14, a 14-item questionnaire on eyesight,asks patients about the amount of difficulty they experience in pursuingusual daily activities, such as driving and reading fine print. Many insurers(including Medicare) require that the results of the VF-14 be reported aspart of claims payment. The questionnaire also is required by the NationalEye Institute to test the benefits of new technologies and procedures forcataract patients (Stanton, 2002). Such consumer surveys may be an even more appropriate and valuable source of data on the outcomes of M/SU health care than on those ofgeneral health care. Laboratory tests or other physical measures, such asblood glucose levels, blood pressure, and forced expiratory lung volume,can measure outcomes of general health care accurately and easily. In con-trast, fewer laboratory or other physical examination findings can measurewhether mental illness or drug dependence is remitting. Thus patients arelikely to be the best source of information on the extent to which theirsymptoms are abating and functioning is improved. Patient reports of symptoms and functioning (outcomes of care) can readily be gathered using several clinically feasible, valid, and reliable ques-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Alternatively, clinicians can assess response totreatment systematically and reliably by obtaining information from thepatient, combined with other data, and following up over time by usingsuch instruments as the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), the BriefPsychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Health of the Nation OutcomeScales (HoNOS) (VA Technology Assessment Program, 2002). In the alco-hol and drug field, instruments such as the Addiction Severity Index (ASI),the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN), and the Project MATCHForm 90 are widely used to measure function. In addition, patient surveysused for quality measurement purposes, such as the Experience of Care andHealth Outcomes (ECHO) Survey (Anonymous, 2001) and the MentalHealth Statistical Improvement Project (MHSIP) surveys, include questionson patients' perceptions of their improvements in functioning. If the more detailed administrative data on treatment described above were linked to patient reports of improvement in clinical symptoms andother outcomes, additional evidence could be generated on what treatmentsand treatment approaches are more effective than others in usual settings ofcare. For example, the annual Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey asksaged and disabled Medicare beneficiaries living in the community and ininstitutions to answer questions about many aspects of their health andhealth care, including their health status and ability to function. Thesepatient self-report data are often combined with Medicare claims and ex-penditure data to answer a variety of questions about Medicare-coveredservices (CMS, 2004), such as whether particular services improve benefi-ciaries' functional status (Hadley et al., 2000) and what effects variations inMedicare spending have on the delivery of care and patient outcomes (Fisheret al., 2003). In addition, the analysis of administrative data and patientoutcomes can be used to facilitate experimental research by identifyingtarget population groups that are using therapies or medications of interestand have experienced either treatment failures, partial symptom abatement,or more complete recovery (Miller and Craig, 2002). In the Veterans HealthAdministration (VHA), linking outcome data on patients treated for post-traumatic stress disorder with administrative data showed that long-term,intensive inpatient treatment was not more effective than short-term treat-ment and cost $18,000 more per patient per year (Fontana and Rosenheck,1997; Rosenheck and Fontana, 2001). In 1999, the VHA mandated that allmental health inpatients be rated at discharge using the GAF instrument,and that all outpatients be similarly rated at least once every 90 days duringactive treatment. The agency now includes GAF outcome measures inits National Mental Health Program Performance Monitoring System(Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2005) (see the discussion in Appendix C).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Many organizations and initiatives in the United States are perform-ing such analyses for M/SU health care. However, there is often little coor-dination of those efforts. Moreover, although the practice of evidence-based care is widely endorsed, there is not yet a shared understanding inM/SU health care (as is also the case in general health care [Steinberg andLuce, 2005]) of what constitutes a finding that a given practice is evidence-based. Views differ about the acceptability of various forms of evidence,what level of evidence is necessary for a practice to be recommended orendorsed as evidence-based (Tanenbaum, 2003), and whether knowledgeof evidence-based care for a population can be adapted to meet eachindividual's unique needs (Tanenbaum, 2005). This lack of consensus prompted a call from Congress in 1999 for AHRQ to identify and describe sound methods for rating the strength ofscientific evidence. AHRQ found several acceptable systems that addressthe essential considerations of (1) the aggregate quality ratings for indi-vidual studies; (2) the quantity of studies (number of studies, magnitude ofobserved effects, and sample size or power); and (3) consistency, or theextent to which similar and different study designs yield similar findings(West et al., 2002). However, AHRQ's findings while helpful, do not re-solve debates about whether a given intervention is evidence-based. Mostevidence reviewers acknowledge that many interventions have varying de-grees of evidence in their favor, ultimately necessitating a judgment as towhether the evidence supports recommending their use. This judgment can often differ according to the entity conducting the evidence review but may be more susceptible to variation in M/SU than ingeneral health care for several reasons. First, a greater number of organiza-tions are involved in making determinations with regard to evidence-basedpractices in M/SU health care. As Chapter 7 attests, a greater number ofprofessions (e.g., physicians, psychologists, counselors, marriage and familytherapists) with their diverse traditions and training are involved in indepen-dently diagnosing and treating M/SU conditions than is the case for generalhealth care. Their professional organizations are increasingly conducting evi-dence reviews and promulgating their own practice guidelines. Moreover,because M/SU problems and illnesses are addressed not only by the healthcare system, but also by the welfare, justice, and education systems, organiza-tions and disciplines involved in these latter systems also are dedicating re-sources to evaluating the evidence and identifying evidence-based M/SU healthcare practices (see the Department of Justice's What Works initiative in TableCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html162 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS 4-1). Second, the biological and social sciences often have employed different types of research designs, with resulting differences in the types of empiricalevidence produced. Because M/SU health care involves both medical andpsychosocial issues and professions that have their historical origins in eitherthe biological or social sciences, reviews are conducted by entities with differ-ent origins and research traditions and sometimes produce different types ofempirical evidence and judgments about their meaning. Table 4-1 lists someof the leading organizations or initiatives that conduct evidence reviews ofM/SU health care services and make determinations with regard to effectivepractices. The commitment of these and other organizations to promoting the delivery of evidence-based care is to be applauded. \"Reinvention\" has beenidentified as a key ingredient in ensuring acceptance of new concepts andnecessary change (Greenhalgh et al., 2004). At the same time, however,variations in review and rating methodologies can result in different prac-tice guidelines for treating the same condition and a lack of consensus onwhat guidelines are best (Manderscheid et al., 2001). The lack of coordina-tion and consensus across the multiple existing review efforts also contrib-utes to significant confusion about what constitutes \"evidence-based\" healthcare for mental and substance-use conditions (Ganju, 2004). These varia-tions and sometimes duplication in the topics reviewed create challenges tothe promotion of evidence-based care. Moreover, the lack of coordinationamong these initiatives means there are fewer resources available for otherquality improvement activities. There is also a contrast between the evidence review infrastructure for psychotherapies and that for drug safety and efficacy, as well for how newtreatments and therapies are deployed. The U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-tration (FDA) oversees the development, delivery, and dissemination of safeand effective medication therapies by subjecting new medications to a safetyreview before they are released into the marketplace for use by consumers.FDA review mechanisms also assess the strength of the evidence for theeffectiveness of certain drugs prior to their release. Medications cannot bedistributed or advertised to the public unless they have been approved bythe FDA. However, no such safety and efficacy reviews are required forpsychotherapies. As a consequence, those seeking psychotherapy cannotalways be confident that the treatment they are receiving has met anystandards for safe and effective care. In one extreme example, this situationresulted in the death of a 10-year-old child who was subjected to \"rebirth-ing therapy\" (Associated Press, 2005), a practice subsequently discredited(Lilienfeld et al., 2003). Moreover, while many new therapies in generalhealth care, such as surgical procedures not involving a new medical device,can be used without an FDA-type review, individual patients for whomsuch therapies are used generally receive information about the evidence forCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

CRGs re- view primarily randomized controlled trials (Aldersonet al., 2004). The Cochrane Collaboration maintains four CRGs related to M/SU illnesses: the Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group; the Developmental,Psychosocial, and Learning Problems Group; the Drug and Alcohol Group; and the Schizophrenia Group, which together have produced over 100 evidencereports for these areas (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2004). The U.S. Preventive Services Congressionally mandated, it is the \"gold standard\" Task Force for reviewing preventive services in the United States (AHRQ, 2002-2003). Its standardized methodologyhas been adopted by others, including the Veterans Health Administration and Department of Defense. Because of its focus on prevention, its evidence re-views are limited to screening practices, counseling interventions, and other preventive interventions delivered in primary care settings (Harrison et al.,2001). To date, the task force's recommendations pertaining to M/SU illnesses have addressed screening and/or counseling in primary care settings for alcoholmisuse by adults, depression in adults, and suicide risk in the general population (Harris et al., 2001). National Registry of The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Evidence-based Programs Administration's (SAMHSA) rating and classification and Practices (NREPP) for M/SU prevention and treatment \"promising.\" As of June 2005, NREPP listed more than 50 model, 30effective, and 50 promising programs. In contrast to the evaluation of generic practice interventions (e.g., screening, cognitive behavioral therapy), as is thefocus of the Cochrane Collaboration and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the majority of NREPP's reviews to date have evaluated specific\"brand-name\" programs for prevention (e.g., the Keep A Clear Mind drug education program), but it also reviews generic practices such as multisystemictherapy and cognitive behavioral treatments. NREPP (continued on next page)Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Origi-nally developed to evaluate substance-use prevention interventions, the scope of NREPP's reviews has been expanded to include both prevention and treatment ofall mental and addictive disorders (SAMHSA, 2005). In a Federal Register notice in August 2005, SAMHSA solicited formal public comment on NREPP's reviewprocesses and criteria (SAMHSA, 2005). Agency for Healthcare Through AHRQ, the United States funds 13 EPCs that Research and Quality's address topics particularly relevant to the Medicare (AHRQ) Evidence-based and Medicaid programs. One EPC specializes in tech- Practice Centers (EPCs) nology assessments for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services; another supports the work of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. EPC reviews are developed from comprehensive syntheses and analysesof the scientific literature, and can include meta- analyses and cost analyses. EPCs also provide techni- cal assistance to stakeholders to help translate thereports into quality improvement tools, curriculums, and policy. EPCs are located predominantly in aca- demic research centers. Of the 123 EPC evidencereports listed on AHRQ's website as of November 2004, 4 addressed M/SU health care: the diagnosis of ADHD, the treatment of ADHD, pharmacotherapy foralcohol dependence, and new drug therapies for de- pression\u2014all published in 1999 (AHRQ, undated). Veterans Health VHA performs systematic reviews of health care tech- Administration (VHA) nologies through its national Technology Assessment Program (VATAP) and development of clinical prac-tice guidelines. VATAP's reviews of devices, drugs, procedures, and organizational and supportive systems used in health care have focused on outcome measure-ment in mental health services (Department of Veter- ans Affairs, 2004). Practice guidelines have addressed major depression, psychoses, posttraumatic stressdisorder, and substance use. Department of Justice's Like the efforts of NREPP, DOJ's What Works initia- (DOJ) Federal Collaboration tive aims to develop and apply consistent federal on What Works standards to determine what constitutes evidence- based programs. In conjunction with the U.S. Depart-ment of Education, SAMHSA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the National Institute on AlcoholTABLE 4-1 continuedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This Hierarchical Classification Framework for Program Effectiveness is intended to be applied initially to programs relevantto the mission of the Office of Justice Programs (i.e., primarily prevention, intervention, supervision, and treatment of drug abuse, juvenile delinquency, andadult crime), but the working group has identified it as potentially contributing to the development of a common standard of program effectiveness for usethroughout the federal government (Department of Justice, 2005). The Campbell Collaboration Created in 2000 as a sibling of the Cochrane Collabo- ration, the Campbell Collaboration conducts system- atic reviews of evidence in the fields of education,criminal justice, and social welfare. Its systematic reviews are carried out in accordance with explicit review protocols published in the Campbell Databaseof Systematic Reviews and are subject to comment and criticisms from users of that database. As of March 1, 2005, seven completed systemic reviewswere listed on its website, along with an additional 35 registered titles or protocols for forthcoming reviews. Because the education, criminal justice, and socialwelfare systems play key roles in the funding and delivery of M/SU treatment services, there is some expected overlap between Cochrane and Campbellreviews, and seven completed Campbell reviews are also registered as Cochrane reviews. To address this overlap, the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborationsare pursuing coordination of their activities, including joint registration of methods groups, as well as links with other conveners and members of Cochrane andCampbell methods groups and with the steering group representatives of both organizations* (The Campbell Collaboration, undated). State Governments Some states conduct or sponsor their own evidence reviews. For example, in 1999 Hawaii created a panelto review the efficacy and effectiveness of treatments for a range of child and adolescent mental health conditions (Chorpita et al., 2002). Using methods andrating criteria adapted from those of the AmericanTABLE 4-1 continued (continued on next page)Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The reviews are used to specify services that will and will not be provided to the state's mental health clients. State mental healthcommissioners as a group have identified the need for a central location where they can obtain the latest research related to evidence-based practices. As aresult, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors' National Research Institute created a Center for Mental Health Quality and Ac-countability to collate research on such practices, foster the development of new evidence-based prac- tices, and facilitate the dissemination of this knowl-edge to state mental health programs (Ganju, 2003). Professional Associations Professional associations for many disciplines (e.g., the American Psychiatric Association, American Society of Addiction Medicine, American Psychological Associa- tion, and American Academy of Pediatrics) conductreviews of the evidence as a prelude to promulgating clinical practice guidelines. The American Psychologi- cal Association's criteria for determining effectivepractices (American Psychological Association, un- dated) also have been adopted by other organizations for use in reviews of the evidence. The Interdiscipli-nary Committee on Evidence-Based Youth Mental Health (a consortium of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Ado-lescent Psychiatry, and the American Psychological Association's divisions of clinical child psychology and school psychology) also has identified a goal of devel-oping and periodically updating an archive of data from clinical trials in order to provide a synthesis of the research on child and adolescent mental health(Hoagwood et al., 2001). *Personal communication, Sally Hopewell, coeditor Cochrane Methods Groups Newsletter , via e-mail on March 4, 2005.TABLE 4-1 continuedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

If a new treatment in general health care is considered experimental, reviewby an institutional review board is required. Psychotherapies are unique inthis regard in that a given therapist may offer a new therapeutic approachwithout its undergoing a safety or effectiveness review and without havingto inform the patient about the extent to which its safety and effectivenesshave been established. The committee concludes that a more comprehensive, systematic, and coordinated approach is needed to describe, assess, and classify M/SUtreatments and practices according to the level of evidence that supportstheir use. Better coordination of current national and international reviewactivities, as well as coordination of those efforts with the evidencereview activities that underlie the guideline development process of manyorganizations, could prevent redundancy and waste, produce more evi-dence reviews on a timelier basis, and avoid conflicting interpretations ofthe data for clinicians and consumers. The organizations engaged in theseactivities are natural partners for building a more comprehensive, coordi-nated, and systematic review network. Many of these same organizationsare also involved with the dissemination of their review findings in theform of practice guidelines and other clinical decision-support tools. IMPROVING DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT The production of evidence will be less fruitful if it is not accompanied by accurate diagnosis and comprehensive longitudinal assessment. Becausehaving a mental illness or alcohol- or other substance-use diagnosis is aleading risk factor for suicide (Maris, 2002), failure to diagnose these con-ditions can be lethal. An inaccurate diagnosis also can lead to ineffectivetreatment and even harmful outcomes. Yet individuals with the same symp-toms presenting to different mental health clinicians can receive differentdiagnoses. For example, variations have been documented in the extent towhich depression is diagnosed in individuals with similar symptoms byboth psychiatrists (Kramer et al., 2000) and primary care providers(Mojtabai, 2002) and in the extent to which ADHD is diagnosed withindifferent communities (Lefever et al., 2003). Recently, the diagnosis ofbipolar illness in children, especially preschoolers, has been the subject ofconsiderable controversy among psychiatrists (McClellan, 2005). For manyconditions, significant discrepancies have been observed among diagnosesgenerated from structured interviews for research purposes and those re-sulting from clinician judgments (Lewczyk et al., 2003) and diagnostic toolsdeveloped for clinical purposes (Eaton et al., 2000). In children, diagnoses may have an even greater range of variability because diagnostic manifestations change over the course of development.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html168 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Moreover, clinicians are greatly dependant upon parents' perceptions of the nature of the presenting problems. Parents may differ, for example, in theextent to which they perceive very active behavior as problematic versusbeing \"all boy,\" or view a quiet and introspective child as being \"shy\"versus having a \"social disorder.\" Subjectivity in diagnosis also is manifestin the variable diagnoses received by white patients and individuals whoare members of ethnic minorities. African American patients with manic-depressive illness, for example, have been found to be at higher risk forbeing misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia than are whites (Bell andMehta, 1980, 1981; Mukherjee et al., 1983). Such racial differences havetended to disappear when structured interviews rather than clinical diag-noses are used (Adebimpe, 1994; Simon and Fleiss, 1973), suggesting theexistence of differences in clinician assessment by patient ethnicity. A number of factors account for variations in diagnosis of M/SU ill- nesses. Foremost, in contrast with general health conditions, relatively fewlaboratory, imaging, or other physical measures can detect the presence ofa mental illness or substance dependence. 10 Accurate diagnosis relies in- stead upon descriptive methods whereby patients or their caregivers informclinicians about symptoms, and clinicians apply their expert judgment todetermine whether diagnostic criteria for a condition are met. Moreover,individual clinicians vary in the breadth, depth, and theoretical basis oftheir training (see Chapter 7). Because diagnosis requires a subjective inter-pretation of reported symptoms, these variations result in inconsistency andunreliability in how individuals are diagnosed. Administrative rules andfinancial incentives can also influence diagnostic practices. Criteria for diagnosing M/SU problems and illnesses reliably are found in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which has been a highly significant milestone in the diagnosis and treatment of mental and substance-use problems andillnesses and is now in its revised fourth edition (DSM-IV-R). However,adherence to these guidelines is not uniform. Fully 56 percent of primarycare physicians in Michigan surveyed in 2002 reported that they did not useDSM criteria to diagnose ADHD (Rushton et al., 2004). This may bebecause DSM-IV is not easy to use in primary care settings, in part becauseof its focus on specialty care, its length, and its complexity (Pincus, 2003). Several different approaches have been undertaken to improve the ac- curacy of diagnosis of M/SU illnesses. System-level interventions, such asroutine screening, have been shown to help (Gilbody et al., 2001; Rollmanet al., 2001). Structured diagnostic interview instruments have also beendeveloped to reduce variability in information gathering and biases that caninadvertently influence individual clinicians' decision making. While these 10Substance use, but not dependence, can be detected by laboratory tests.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Other initiatives have provided clinicians with education and guide-lines to improve their recognition and treatment of mental illnesses (Lin etal., 2001; Thompson et al., 2000). The committee concludes that multiple strategies are needed to im- prove diagnostic accuracy in M/SU health care. First, existing evidence-based diagnostic tools and assessment practices should be identified andapplied in practice, just as must be done for evidence-based treatment.More age-appropriate diagnostic instruments also should be developed thatare reliable and practicable for routine use, and information about thesetools should be included in initiatives to better disseminate evidence-basedpractices. Further, clinicians should be encouraged to employ standardizedclinical assessment instruments to measure target symptoms consistentlyand systematically, and document results over the course of treatment(American Psychiatric Association Task Force for the Handbook of Psychi-atric Measures, 2000). As discussed earlier in this chapter, however, even when evidence-based practices are known, their adoption by all relevant practitioners\u2014in bothgeneral and M/SU health care\u2014is too slow. Accordingly, many public andprivate organizations are actively engaged in efforts to strengthen the dis-semination and uptake of effective clinical practices. Yet these activitiesthemselves are not always consistent with the evidence on effective dissemi-nation and uptake of new knowledge. Improving the effectiveness of dis-semination activities is thus the next essential step in improving the effec-tiveness of M/SU health care. BETTER DISSEMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE Research has been under way for many years, in health care as well as other fields of study, to identify the multiple contributors to successfuldissemination and adoption of new practices and innovations by their tar-geted users. An extensive and systematic review of empirical evidence andrelated theoretical literature from multiple disciplines (Greenhalgh et al.,2004) identified the following key factors in successful dissemination andadoption of innovations: (1) the characteristics of the innovation itself, (2)the characteristics of the individuals targeted to adopt it, (3) sources ofcommunication and influence regarding the innovation, (4) structural andcultural characteristics of organizations targeted to adopt it, (5) externalinfluences on targeted individuals or organizations, (6) organizations' up-take processes, and (7) the linkages among these six factors (see Box 4-2).

For example, the sources of communication and influence used in dissemination of information can be chosen. Whilemany initiatives are now under way to disseminate evidence-based M/SUpractices, these initiatives are generally being undertaken by specialty M/SUorganizations, as opposed to those associated with general health care.Evidence indicates that integrating the dissemination of evidence-basedM/SU health care practices into the scope and initiatives of mainstreamgeneral health care dissemination activities is essential to reaching the vastnumbers of general health care clinicians who now treat M/SU problemsand illnesses and have an essential role in ensuring the early detection,appropriate treatment, and referral of these conditions. Key Dissemination Efforts Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration As part of its Science to Service Initiative, SAMHSA has multiple activi- ties under way to disseminate information on evidence-based practices,promote the incorporation of such practices into general and M/SU healthcare, and facilitate feedback from the field to guide research. For example,SAMHSA's Center for Mental Health Services is developing six \"tool kits\"addressing Illness Management and Recovery, Medication Management,Assertive Community Treatment, Family Psychoeducation, Supported Em-ployment, and Integrated Dual Diagnosis Treatment for Co-Occurring Dis-orders. The kits include information sheets for all stakeholder groups,introductory videos, practice demonstration videos, and workbooks ormanuals for practitioners. The tool kits will be finalized through a nationaldemonstration project to be completed at the end of 2005 (SAMHSA,undated-a). SAMHSA also funds the Center for Mental Health Quality andAccountability of the National Association of State Mental Health ProgramDirectors (NASMHPD) Research Institute (NRI) to provide an overview ofevidence-based practices to the association's constituents and other stake-holders (NASMHPD Research Institute, undated). SAMHSA's dissemination mechanisms for substance-use prevention and treatment include Treatment Improvement Protocols, the NationalAddiction Technology Transfer Centers (ATTC) Network (1 national and13 regional centers), the Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treat-ment, and the Centers for the Application of Prevention Technology.Further, SAMHSA's State Systems Development Program\u2014an enhancedtechnical assistance program involving conferences and workshops, devel-opment of training materials and knowledge transfer manuals, and on-siteconsultation\u2014assists states with the administration and implementation ofSubstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant activities.

Theseactivities include information development and dissemination; state, re-gional, and national conferences; and on-site expert consultation (SAMHSA,undated-c). In addition, SAMHSA is partnering with the National Instituteof Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse(NIDA) to jointly fund planning activities and research on the adoption ofevidence-based practices by state M/SU agencies. National Institutes of Health NIMH is partnering with SAMHSA to promote and support the dis- semination of evidence-based mental health treatment practices and theiradoption by state mental health systems through Bridging Science and Ser-vice grants to states (NIMH, 2004). NIDA and CSAT have a similar jointinitiative\u2014the NIDA/SAMHSA-ATTC Blending Initiative\u2014which encour-ages the use of evidence-based treatments by professionals in the drug abusefield. NIDA has identified specific research practices (e.g., motivationalinterviewing) as ready for use by the field at large. Blending teams compris-ing staff from CSAT's ATTC network and NIDA researchers then developstrategic dissemination plans for the adoption and implementation of thesepractices (NIDA, 2005). In addition, NIMH, NIDA, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) have multiple publication, interpersonal, elec-tronic media, and other initiatives to help disseminate information onevidence-based practices. For example, NIDA's Office of Science Policy and Communications, responsible for research dissemination activities, producesa number of periodical publication (e.g., NIDA Notes , Perspectives ), as well as topic-specific publications. NIDA's Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment: A Research-based Guide , for example, is a synthesis of the treatment research organized into 13 key principles, questions and answers,and a listing of some programs for which a strong evidence base exists. 11 Veterans Health Administration VHA's clinical practice guidelines initiative (described in Table 4-1) also identifies, disseminates, and promotes the adoption of evidence-basedpractices. Practice guidelines resulting from evidence reviews are frequently 11E-mail communication, Jack B.

VHA's Quality Enhancement Research Initiative facili-tates the translation of research findings into routine care by (1) conductingresearch to fill gaps in knowledge about what constitutes best treatmentpractices, (2) undertaking demonstration projects that implement alreadyknown best practices, (3) identifying enhancements to VHA's informationsystems, and (4) conducting research and demonstration projects to acceler-ate the uptake of evidence-based practices (Fischer et al., 2000). The initia-tive includes projects in mental health (schizophrenia and depression) andsubstance-use illnesses (improving the quality of methadone maintenancetherapy). Professional Associations As discussed above, many professional bodies are actively engaged in dissemination activities. These activities are often connected with their de-velopment and distribution of practice guidelines. Underused Sources of Communication and Influence The dissemination activities described above are conducted by organi- zations that generally are perceived as specialty M/SU organizations andthus may be most likely to communicate and have influence with specialtyM/SU health care providers. As described in Chapter 7, however, primarycare providers deliver a substantial portion of mental health services andare a critical source for the detection of M/SU conditions, referral, andsubsequent treatment. Other non-M/SU specialty providers also have keyroles to play in detection, treatment, and referral. However, data show thatthese general health care providers need to adopt evidence-based practicesto better detect, treat, and appropriately refer individuals in need of M/SUhealth care. Thus it is important that dissemination of the evidence oneffective M/SU health care reach all providers, not just those specializing inM/SU care. However, the key current dissemination efforts described above may be less likely to influence primary care providers and other non-M/SU spe-cialty clinicians. Research on the effective dissemination of innovationsdescribed above (Box 4-2) shows that individuals' and organizations' adop-tion of new practices is greatly influenced by their social networks. Success-ful dissemination occurs most easily among individuals with similar educa-tional, professional, and cultural backgrounds. Opinion leaders within afield also strongly influence the dissemination and uptake of innovations.Formal dissemination programs will be more successful if they are aware ofand address potential adopters' needs and perspectives, and tailor theirCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

To this end,resources routinely tapped by general and other non-M/SU specialty healthcare practitioners and policy makers should be used to help disseminateevidence on effective detection and treatment of M/SU illnesses. In short,M/SU health care needs to be better addressed in evidence disseminationefforts that are routinely employed to address providers of general healthpromotion and disease and disability prevention and treatment. The U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and AHRQ's Divisionof User Liaison and Research Translation (formerly called the User LiaisonProgram) are two highly regarded organizations with expertise in knowl-edge dissemination that can be utilized more fully for this purpose. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC's mission is \"to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability\" (CDC, 2005a:1). It does soby serving as \"the principal agency in the United States government forprotecting the health and safety of all Americans and for providing essentialhuman services, especially for those people who are least able to helpthemselves\" (CDC, 2005b:1). Despite this mandate, CDC's substantial and highly regarded expertise in these areas, and the large contribution of M/SUillnesses to morbidity, disability, and injury (see Chapter 1), M/SU illnessescould be better represented in CDC's organizational structures, programs,and initiatives. CDC encompasses multiple centers, institutes, and offices (CDC, 2005c) (see Box 4-3). Of these, the National Center for Chronic Disease Preventionand Health Promotion might reasonably be expected to address M/SUproblems and illnesses, given their substantial contribution to chronic dis-ease and general health problems. Yet the listing of chronic disease pro-grams on the center's website includes arthritis, cancer, diabetes, epilepsy,global health, healthy aging, healthy youth, heart disease and stroke, nutri-tion and physical activity, oral health, a block grant program to implementnational objectives contained in the Healthy People report, prevention re-search programs, elimination of racial disparities, pregnancy-related ill-nesses, tobacco use, and an initiative for uninsured women (addressing highblood pressure and cholesterol, nutrition and weight management, physicalinactivity, and tobacco use)\u2014but not M/SU illnesses. Another key initiativeof the center\u2014Steps to a HealthierUS\u2014is designed to advance the goal ofhelping Americans live longer, better, and healthier lives through 5-yearcooperative agreements with states, cities, and tribal entities to implementchronic disease prevention efforts focused on reducing the burden of dia-betes, overweight, obesity, and asthma and three related risk factors\u2014Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The prevention and treatment of M/SU illnesses are not mentioned in these andsimilar CDC initiatives Moreover, the CDC website providing an overview of chronic illness (http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/overview.htm) 12 fails to list any M/SU prob- lems or illnesses among the Leading Causes of Disability among PersonsAged 15 Years or Older, United States (although the source for the datacited is dated 1991-1992). This omission is in spite of the evidence pre-sented in Chapter 1 and acknowledged in the President's New FreedomCommission report that mental illnesses rank first among conditions thatcause disability in the United States (New Freedom Commission on MentalHealth, 2003). Instead of being included explicitly in these and other structures or formal initiatives, mental health is addressed in CDC through a MentalHealth Work Group that is not part of any of the agency's formal centers,programs, or offices and has no formal budget allocation, personnel posi-tions, or other dedicated administrative support. \"Staff members partici-pating in this work group do so voluntarily as an add-on to their otherCDC responsibilities because of their commitment to advancing the field ofmental health within the context of the overall mission of CDC\" (CDC,2005e:1). Although CDC has undertaken important work on alcohol use(see, for example, http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about.htm) and alcohol anddrug use among youth (see http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/alcoholdrug/index.htm), M/SU health care could benefit greatly from a larger commit-ment of CDC resources and expertise. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's User Liaison Program For more than 22 years, AHRQ's User Liaison Program (ULP) has focused on bringing information on science-based health care services topolicy makers at the state and local levels, including the staff of governors'offices, state legislators and their staffs, and executive branch agency headssuch as Medicaid and public health directors, to help them develop moreeffective policies and programs. The ULP historically has relied on work-shops, seminars, and conferences to provide this information, but in thepast few years has also been conducting audio and web conferencing. TheULP has addressed a wide variety of topics identified through regular for-mal and informal mechanisms, including biennial needs assessment meet-ings across the country, conference calls with stakeholders, and portions ofworkshops devoted to audience feedback regarding topics to be addressed 12As of October 10, 2005.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

As of 2004, the ULP's mission had been expanded to encompass a wider range of knowledge transfer activities (e.g., technical assistance,distance learning, electronic and face-to-face networking, web and telecon-ferencing). Its target audience has also been expanded to include providersand purchasers in addition to policy makers. To better carry out these newmandates, AHRQ has revised the ULP to focus on long-term knowledgetransfer strategies for a few critical health care issues. As of December 2004,these issues were (1) developing high-reliability organizations, (2) care man-agement, (3) purchaser-provider synergies for improving health care qual-ity, and (4) decreasing disparities. This change in direction means that theULP will likely not offer specific disease-focused programs in the future.Rather, multiple clinical areas of concern can be addressed within the fourtargeted issues identified above. 13 M/SU health care policy makers, admin- istrators, and clinicians ought to be targeted as part of ULP activities. Conclusions and Recommendation The committee concludes that dissemination strategies for effective M/SU treatment innovations should use the sources of communication andinfluence that are highly regarded in general health care in addition to thoseso regarded in M/SU health care. Moreover, organizations that are espe-cially influential with private-sector providers and other policy makers andpurchasers because of their past relationships should be included in a coor-dinated strategy. For example, with its new focus on policy makers andpurchasers, as well as clinicians, AHRQ's ULP could be an instrument forbringing M/SU health care to the attention of these key leaders. Recommendation 4-1. To better build and disseminate the evidence base, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) shouldstrengthen, coordinate, and consolidate the synthesis and dissemina-tion of evidence on effective M/SU treatments and services by theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; the Na-tional Institute of Mental Health; the National Institute on Drug Abuse;the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; the NationalInstitute of Child Health and Human Development; the Agency forHealthcare Research and Quality; the Department of Justice; the De-partment of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Defense; the Depart-ment of Education; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; theCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services; the Administration for 13Personal communication with Steve Seitz, User Liaison Program, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on December 9, 2004.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

To implement this recommendation, DHHS should charge or create one or more entities to: Describe and categorize available M/SU preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions (including screening, diagnostic, andsymptom-monitoring tools), and develop individual procedurecodes and definitions for these interventions and tools for theiruse in administrative datasets approved under the Health Insur-ance Portability and Accountability Act. Assemble the scientific evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions, including their use in varied age and ethnicgroups; use a well-established approach to rate the strength ofthis evidence, and categorize the interventions accordingly; andrecommend or endorse guidelines for the use of the evidence-basedinterventions for specific M/SU problems and illnesses. Substantially expand efforts to attain widespread adoption of evidence-based practices through the use of evidence-based ap-proaches to knowledge dissemination and uptake. Dissemina-tion strategies should always include entities that are commonlyviewed as knowledge experts by general health care providersand makers of public policy, including the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention, the Agency for Healthcare Research andQuality, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, theOffice of Minority Health, and professional associations andhealth care organizations. The committee calls attention to three important considerations in- volved in implementing this recommendation. First, implementing this rec-ommendation will require a long-term commitment on the part of DHHS.An ongoing process accommodating changes in the science base over timewill be necessary to synthesize the evidence base; assess interventions basedon the strength of their scientific evidence; and develop and continuallyupdate a reliable categorization and coding scheme for individual M/SUprevention, screening, assessment, psychotherapy, psychosocial, and othertreatment interventions. Given fiscal constraints, and in an effort to main-stream M/SU health care, the committee recommends that DHHS make useof public- and private-sector structures and processes already in place thatsynthesize evidence, develop procedure codes such as the HCPCS codes andCPT codes for administrative datasets, develop performance measures andmeasurement approaches for the public and private sectors, and carry outCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

To marshal the substantial expertise and resources of these entities and assist them in dedicating additional resources to M/SUhealth care, DHHS will need to provide them with formal support andfinancial and nonfinancial resources to enable and sustain these activitiesuntil they are firmly in place. In addition, the committee notes that a wide variety of M/SU health care interventions are important to the effective treatment of M/SU condi-tions and need to be included in the recommended evidence review, cod-ing, and performance measurement initiatives. In addition to traditionalpsychotherapy, these initiatives should encompass screening and diagnos-tic questionnaires and assessment tools with practical utility in routineprimary and specialty care settings (as opposed to tools used for researchpurposes); other clinically practicable tools used to monitor symptomsand patient outcomes; and the range of psychosocial services with proveneffectiveness, such as family psychoeducation, illness self-management,and assertive community treatm ent. In addition to procedure codes, codes should be developed that indicate the type of clinician providingcare (e.g., psychiatrist, psychologist, marriage and family therapist, orcounselor). Finally, the committee reaffirms its view that the development of more precise procedure and provider codes is a critical pathway to improvementsin quality. The development of an analytic database comparable to thatwhich exists for general health is critical to informing our understanding offactors that influence utilization of care, variations in care, and the relation-ship between health outcomes and various types of treatments. Such infor-mation also will provide transparency as to what health care purchasers arepaying for and what consumers are actually receiving. As these codes aredeveloped, the federal government should require their use in all federallymandated and supported administrative data collection activities. In addition, as discussed above, the committee believes that the collec- tion of outcome data can both inform clinical care at the point of caredelivery and contribute to the development of evidence on effective treat-ments. It therefore makes the following recommendation: Recommendation 4-2. Clinicians and organizations providing M/SU services should: Increase their use of valid and reliable patient questionnaires or other patient-assessment instruments that are feasible for routineuse to assess the progress and outcomes of treatment systemati-cally and reliably. Use measures of the processes and outcomes of care to continu- ously improve the quality of the care provided.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

STRENGTHENING THE QUALITY MEASUREMENT 14 AND REPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE A frequently stated maxim across many industries is, \"You can't im- prove what you can't measure.\" This holds true in health care. Measuringthe quality of care provided by individuals, organizations, and health plansand reporting back the results is linked both conceptually and empiricallyto reductions in variations in care and increases in the delivery of effectivecare (Berwick et al., 2003; Jha et al., 2003). However, this successful strat-egy has not yet seen widespread application in M/SU health care. Lessmeasurement of the safety, effectiveness, and timeliness of M/SU healthcare has taken place than is the case for general health care (AHRQ, 2003;Garnick et al., 2002). In 1998, the President's Advisory Commission onConsumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry identifiedmental health care as an aspect of health care not well addressed by existingquality measures and measure sets (The President's Advisory Commissionon Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry, 1998).Five years later, the first National Healthcare Quality Report published byDHHS continued to identify mental illness as a clinical area lacking\"broadly accepted\" and \"widely used\" measures of quality. Of 107 mea-sures of the effectiveness of health care, only 7 addressed mental health: 3the treatment of depression in adults, 1 suicide, and 3 management ofdelirium and confusion in nursing homes and home health. None addressedthe quality of care for substance-use problems and illnesses. The only mea-sure that pertained to children was that for suicide (AHRQ, 2003). Noadditional measures of the quality of mental health care were included inthe second annual report published in 2004, and measures of the quality ofsubstance-use care remained absent (AHRQ, 2004a). This lack of measurement is not caused by a lack of organizations and initiatives developing measures of M/SU health care quality. A NationalInventory of Mental Health Quality Measures, funded by AHRQ, NIMH,SAMHSA, and The Evaluation Center@HSRI (The Human Services are often used interchangeably because quality measures are a type of performance measures (financial performance, for example, is another type). Inthis report, we follow that practice, using \"performance measures/measurement\" and \"qual- ity measures/measurement\" interchangeably to refer to all aspects of quality health care\u2014the structures, processes, and outcomes of care.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlEVIDENCE BASE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE 181 search Institute) identified more than 100 measures of the processes of M/SU health care developed by government agencies, researchers, clinician/professional organizations, accreditors, health systems/facilities, employerpurchasers, consumer coalitions, and commercial organizations (Hermannet al., 2004). A significant number of outcome measurement instrumentsalso have been identified by VHA (VA Technology Assessment Program,2002). The failure of mainstream health care quality measurement andimprovement efforts to incorporate a greater number of M/SU quality mea-sures is due in part to the separation of M/SU and general health care, asdiscussed in Chapters 2 and 5. Because of this separation, many M/SUhealth care advocates, professional associations, and other organizationshave undertaken efforts to develop and apply measures of the quality ofM/SU health care. However, a major factor inhibiting both mainstream andspecialty efforts is the lack of a quality measurement and reporting infra-structure addressing M/SU health care. Necessary Components of a Quality Measurement and Reporting Infrastructure Effectively measuring quality and reporting results to providers, con- sumers, and oversight organizations requires structures, resources, and ex-pertise to perform several related functions: Conceptualizing the aspects of care to be measured. Translating the quality-of-care measurement concepts into perfor- mance measure specifications. Pilot testing the performance measure specifications to determine their validity, reliability, feasibility, and cost. Ensuring calculation of the performance measures and their sub- mission to a performance measure repository. Auditing to ensure that the performance measures have been calcu- lated accurately and in accordance with specifications. Analyzing and displaying the performance measures in a format or formats suitable for understanding by the multiple intended audience(s),such as consumers, health care delivery entities, purchasers, and qualityoversight organizations. Maintaining the effectiveness of individual performance measures and performance measure sets and policies over time. These seven functions are currently performed to varying degrees for M/SU health care by multiple organizations\u2014again often separately fromgeneral health care, but in this case the separation also exists across thepublic and private health care sectors.

What is neededis one or more infrastructures that perform these seven functions for thefour different levels of health care delivery: (1) individual clinicians orgroups of clinicians; (2) health care organizations, such as inpatient facili-ties; (3) health plans; and (4) public health systems (national, state, andlocal). Below we discuss for each of the seven functions special issues re-lated to the delivery of M/SU health care that should influence the imple-mentation of that function and the development of a quality measurementand reporting infrastructure for M/SU health care. Conceptualizing the Aspects of Care to Be Measured Because of the large number of existing process and outcome quality indicators and measures, the multiple populations of interest (e.g., children;older adults; individuals with less-frequent but severe and chronic mentalillnesses, such as schizophrenia; and inpatients), the different units (clinicians; inpatient and outpatient organizations; health plans; andlocal, state, and national systems), and the importance of not overburden-ing the clinicians and organizations that will produce the measures, a frame-work is needed for identifying a finite number (often termed a \"core\" set) ofvalid, reliable, effective, and efficient measures that can best serve the mul-tiple interested parties and purposes. The best-documented example of sucha framework is that of the Strategic Framework Board, which designed aNational Quality Measurement and Reporting System (NQMRS) for U.S.health care overall to guide such efforts as those of the National QualityForum (McGlynn, 2003). Within M/SU health care, multiple organizations and initiatives also have put forth frameworks or core measure sets, using different approachesto identify aspects of care delivery to be measured and select measures ofthe structures, processes, and outcomes of M/SU care. These initiativesinclude the Forum on Performance Measures in Behavioral Health andRelated Service Systems (Teague et al., 2004), the Mental Health StatisticsImprovement Program Quality Report (Ganju et al., 2004), the Center forQuality Assessment and Improvement in Mental Health (Hermann andPalmer, 2002; Hermann et al., 2004), the Behavioral Healthcare Perfor-mance Measurement System for inpatient care of the NRI, the OutcomesRoundtable for Children and Families (Doucette, 2003), and the Washing-ton Circle Group (McCorry et al., 2000) (all of which are convened and/orfunded by SAMHSA), as well as the previous efforts of the American Col-lege of Mental Health Administrators Accreditation Workgroup (ACMHA,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlEVIDENCE BASE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE 183 2001) and the American Managed Behavioral Health Association. The fed- eral government also has adopted a framework through its State OutcomesMeasurement and Management System (described below) (SAMHSA,undated-b). These efforts are in addition to performance measure sets thataddress health care overall and include some M/SU performance measures,such as NCQA's HEDIS and measures used by VHA (see Appendix C). All of these efforts have tackled two enduring and related problems that are encountered in all performance measurement efforts: (1) the ten-sion between having measures of high validity, reliability, and ease of calcu-lation and having a broader set of measures that is more representative ofthe populations and conditions of interest; and (2) the difficulty of achiev-ing consensus on the measure set across all stakeholders (Hermann andPalmer, 2002). In addition to these problems, conceptualizing a frameworkfor M/SU health care is more complex than doing so for general health carefor the reasons discussed below. More-diverse stakeholders The larger number of disciplines licensed to diagnose and treat M/SU problems and illnesses relative to those licensedto diagnose and treat general health conditions potentially requires theinvolvement of a greater number of stakeholder groups in a consensusprocess. Moreover, as discussed earlier, M/SU health care involves bothspecialty and general medical providers. In addition, the involvement ofthe education, juvenile and criminal justice, and child welfare systems aspayers and providers of M/SU services means performance measures se-lected for M/SU health care must be determined with input from thesestakeholders, who are not typically involved in general health care. Con-sumer advocates also have been very active in shaping the delivery of M/SUhealth care, again with implications for the numbers and diversity of stake-holders in a consensus process. Difference between the public and private sectors Although general health care is delivered in both the public and private sectors, in M/SU health carethe public sector serves a population with a clinical profile much differentfrom that of the population served by the private sector\u2014most often thosewith severe and chronic illnesses. Thus, measures that may be meaningful toprivate-sector stakeholders may be less useful to those in the public sector. InNCQA's HEDIS measures for general health care, for example, some mea-sures 15 are designated for calculation for Medicaid populations but not for privately insured populations (NCQA, 2004b). This practice may need to beemployed more widely for M/SU health care. Even measures appropriate formultiple populations may need to be reported separately. 15Frequency of ongoing prenatal care and annual dental visit.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html184 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Different types of evidence As discussed earlier, M/SU health care has of- ten relied on evidence generated by quasi-experimental studies rather thanrandomized controlled trials. Some performance measures that are deemedvalid by M/SU stakeholders may therefore be less credible to performancemeasurement stakeholders in the general health care sector. Unclear locus of accountability The separation of the delivery of M/SU and general health care discussed earlier impairs performance measurement intwo ways. First, it can create confusion as to whether a given performancemeasure can be used because it is unclear to whom the measure shouldapply. There is confusion about the entity accountable for care qualitywhen care can be delivered through multiple delivery arrangements (e.g.,primary or specialty care, general or carve-out health plans, school-basedprograms). For example, the HEDIS performance measures addressingM/SU health care apply to general health plans seeking accreditation, butnot to managed behavioral health care organizations. 16 Another problem caused by the separation of M/SU and general health care, as well as by the separation of mental and substance-use care, relatesto access to data. To produce many performance measures, data on thepatient's entire illness\u2014from detection through ongoing treatment\u2014areneeded. When patients are served by entities separate from their generalhealth care plan or from each other, such as carved-out managed behav-ioral health plans, employee assistance programs, school-based health careservices, and child welfare agencies, the ability to link necessary data isimpaired, making many performance measures infeasible (Bethell, 2004;Garnick et al., 2002). Moreover, the voluntary support sector is not typi-cally viewed as formal treatment despite the fact that self-help groups suchas Alcoholics Anonymous and other types of peer counseling play animportant role in recovery for many individuals with M/SU illnesses. In-deed, the voluntary support sector has been characterized by a lack of dataand, in some cases, a commitment to anonymity (Horgan and Garnick,2005). As articulated in a paper on performance measurement for child and adolescent M/SU health care that was commissioned by the committee(Bethell, 2004:30): Perhaps one of the most significant findings . . . is the lack of coordina- tion in the field among the many actors engaged in measurement devel- opment in the area of mental and behavioral health care for children andadolescents. It seems new activities evolve daily with no coordinating center to ensure activities address priority needs and strategic goals as 16Personal communication Phil Renner, Vice President, NCQA on March 22, 2005.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The lack of coordination is especially evident between efforts occurring primarily from the vantage point of the medical arena (e.g., Medicaid, health planand pediatric practice-based measurement) and those taking place in the more community-based, public health mental health arena (state mental health agencies, community-based clinics, etc.). Ironically, this lack ofcoordination on the measurement front exactly mirrors the very frustrat- ing lack of coordination between the medical and psychiatric-based men- tal health services also experienced by families with children with mentaland behavioral health care problems. Translating Quality-of-Care Measurement Concepts into Performance Measure Specifications Some quality measures address structural and qualitative characteris- tics of care providers and require a \"yes/no\" answer. The Leapfrog Group'smeasure of whether inpatient facilities use computerized physician orderentry exemplifies such a structural measure. Most quality measures in usetoday, however, measure processes of care and require a numerical calcula-tion of the rate at which an appropriate activity is performed for a definedpopulation. These calculations require detailed instructions for calculatingthe numerators and denominators of the rates to guarantee the accuracyand reliability of the measures. The instructions specify, for example, datasources to be used to calculate a measure, rules for including and excludingsome individuals from the rate, time frames for data capture, and samplingstrategy if sampling is used. Translating measurement concepts into qualitymeasures also requires detailed knowledge of multiple data sources, includ-ing health plan enrollment and encounter data, inpatient and outpatientclaims data, pharmacy and laboratory databases, administrative data cod-ing sets, and patient surveys, as well as knowledge of the capabilities oforganizations' information systems and of the appropriateness of and tech-niques for case-mix adjustment. Appreciation of and knowledge in all these areas is not universal. As a result, many entities that put forth intended quality measures are actually putting forth quality measure concepts , as opposed to well-developed mea- sures with accompanying specifications for their calculation. A comprehen-sive 1999-2000 search for and review of mental health performance mea-sures developed in the United States that met a minimum threshold ofdevelopment (i.e., had a specific numerator and denominator, a designateddata source, and an ostensible relationship to quality) found that half of thefirst 86 measures reviewed were insufficiently developed for implementa-tion, and few measures had been tested for reliability or validity (Hermannet al., 2000).

All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html186 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS quality measurement concepts into measures that are ready for deployment. NCQA, for example, conducts this translation activity using both internalstaff and a formal structure of measurement advisory panels that provideclinical and technical expert knowledge, ad hoc expert panels, and a techni-cal advisory group (NCQA, 2004b). Pilot Testing the Performance Measure Specifications Frequently, measures that appear to be theoretically sound are opera- tionally complex, very costly to produce, or unreliable and invalid for reasonsnot apparent during their design. For example, with respect to M/SU qualitymeasures, the fact that a population is covered by both a general health planand a separate employee assistance program or carved-out behavioral healthplan means that the clinical data required to calculate a measure may be inthe possession of multiple separate organizations and difficult to access andlink. Stigma and discriminatory benefit designs (discussed in Chapter 3) alsomean that many individuals choose to or must pay for M/SU services out ofpocket; in such cases, no claim record is produced, so that a major datasource for the calculation of quality measures is lacking. For the same rea-sons, providers sometimes deliver an M/SU service but code it as a generalmedical problem. Because of these impediments to accurate and reliablemeasurement of the quality of M/SU health care, new quality measures al-most always require some type of pilot testing before being implemented andused for decision making (Garnick et al., 2002). For example, prior toNCQA's incorporation of quality measures addressing health plans' treat-ment of alcohol and other drug problems into the HEDIS measurementprocess, these measures were pilot tested by six health care organizations thatdelivered services to approximately 5 million people so as to evaluate themeasures' feasibility and quality improvement potential (Hon, 2003). Ensuring Calculation and Submission of the Performance Measures Successful quality measurement initiatives in general health care have taken place under one of two conditions: (1) a critical mass of influentialsupporters is committed to either requiring or carrying out the calculationand submission of measures (e.g., HEDIS), or (2) there is an ongoing com-mitment of sufficient resources to enable the analysis of quality measures,making them so useful that those calculating and submitting them do sovoluntarily (e.g., NRI's Behavioral Healthcare Performance MeasurementSystem and AHRQ's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project [H-CUP]Quality Indicators). For example, the success of the HEDIS performance measures dataset can be traced to its initiation by a small but committed and influentialCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

These employers, who purchased health care for their employees, were seeking meaningful data to require oftheir contracting health plans. The health plans wished to reduce costlyvariations in the data they were required to submit to multiple purchasers.This critical mass of employer-purchasers and health plans ensured thecalculation and submission of the HEDIS measures while they were still ina preliminary state, which subsequently attracted other influential support-ers. CMS, for example, now requires health plans participating in the Medi-care program to submit data on HEDIS measures. Many state Medicaidagencies also require the submission of HEDIS or HEDIS-like measures. Incontrast, submission of the Behavioral Healthcare Performance Measure-ment System inpatient hospital measures to NASMHPD or NRI is not re-quired, but facilities that choose to do so may use those measures to fulfillaccreditation reporting requirements. Auditing to Ensure That Performance Measures Have Been Calculated Accurately and According with Specifications Reported measures may not accurately represent an individual's or organization's performance. Information systems and internal data record-ing conventions used by individual clinicians and health care organizationsvary greatly. Data also may not be collected or stored in ways that facilitatecollection of a measure as requested. When measures further require data tobe linked across organizations, there may be incompatible data formats. Allthese factors can introduce error, as can less-than-scrupulous adherence toa measure's specifications. Because the reporting of quality measures toexternal bodies for public disclosure to consumers, for use in financialreimbursement strategies to reward best performance, or in response toother quality oversight requirements can have significant consequences forthe entity being measured, it is important for the accuracy of the reportedmeasures to be verified. This is typically accomplished through systematicaudits of the measures' calculation. NCQA, for example, has developedstandardized auditing procedures for use in verifying the integrity of thecalculation of HEDIS measures (NCQA, undated). Analyzing and Displaying the Performance Measures in Suitable Formats Ensuring that quality measures are useful for multiple audiences re- quires analytic and communication capabilities that can respond to thesometimes differing needs of consumers, health care providers (both indi-vidual clinicians and organizations), purchasers, and quality oversight or-ganizations. For example, while clinicians and health care organizationsmay want numerous, detailed data on their performance on individualCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Thus, in addition to providing detailed perfor-mance measures, there is a need to aggregate such measures into a smallerset. Data also need to show real differences in performance to help consum-ers select among care providers. In addition, health care delivery entitiesrequire benchmarking data so they can compare their performance withthat of others in their field. Purchasers and quality oversight organizationsalso need comparative information for incentivizing and rewarding bestperformance. Risk adjustment of performance measures may sometimes benecessary, especially when reporting measures of patient outcomes as op-posed to measures of the processes of care delivery. Maintaining the Effectiveness of Performance Measures and Measure Sets and Policies Individual performance measures and their deployment require ongo- ing maintenance. Performance measures' specifications often change overtime; for example, administrative coding systems may change, health careentities calculating the measures may discover issues not anticipated in theoriginal specifications, and health care delivery systems themselves change.Also, some measures need to be retired as priorities shift over time and asnew, needed measures are developed. For example, a comprehensive reviewof mental health performance measures found several gaps in the availableset of M/SU measures. First, only a handful of adequately developed process-of-care measures exist for children, older adults, individuals with prevalentbut not severe mental illnesses (e.g., anxiety disorders, dysthymia, or per-sonality disorders), and individuals with dual mental health and substance-use disorders. The review further documented a lack of measures assessingthe content of psychotherapy; instead measures focused on whether psy-chotherapy was provided and how frequently. 17 And there were fewer process-of-care measures for substance-use problems and illnesses com-pared with those for mental illnesses (Hermann et al., 2000). There is also a need for performance measure deployment policies and practices that guard against the unintended consequences of measuringonly a small portion of the care that is delivered. Because it is not possibleto measure everything, and because how an entity performs on one measuredoes not indicate how it will perform on another or in an area not measured 17This is likely due in part to the poor specificity of administrative codes discussed earlier in this chapter.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlEVIDENCE BASE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE 189 (Brook et al., 1996), focusing on only a small set of performance measures may have the unintended consequence of drawing quality improvementresources away from care delivery practices that are not in the measurementset. Periodic rotation of the measures to be calculated may therefore beneeded, especially as new performance measures are developed. Need for Public-Private Leadership and Partnership to Create a Quality Measurement and Reporting Infrastructure Ensuring the existence of a quality measurement and reporting infra- structure that is responsive to the issues outlined above requires leadership.The committee also notes that, as with successful efforts in performancemeasurement in general health care, leadership is required from a criticalmass of influential stakeholders; no one entity has sufficient influence orcontrol over the vast array of M/SU providers and delivery systems orcommand over the many diverse technical and other resources needed todevelop, test, ensure reporting of, audit, analyze, display, and continuouslyimprove a set of M/SU health care performance measures for the nation.Moreover, although much M/SU health care is delivered in the public sec-tor, many individuals also receive care in the private sector, often fromgeneral as opposed to specialty M/SU providers. And the many cliniciansproviding M/SU health care receive both public and private reimbursement.To ensure that these providers (both general and M/SU) are not required toreport different quality measures to different purchasers or to report mea-sures that are purportedly the same but calculated in different ways tomultiple purchasers, public- and private-sector purchasers must reach agree-ment on a common set of quality measures and specifications for theirreporting. The committee acknowledges the primary leadership role played by the public sector to date in developing M/SU performance measures. While theprivate sector has exhibited strong leadership in the development of perfor-mance measures and measurement initiatives for general health care, lead-ership in M/SU performance measurement has come primarily from thepublic sector, most notably from SAMHSA and the Department of Veter-ans Affairs (DVA). For example, the successful efforts of the WashingtonCircle Group to identify a set of performance measures for substance-usehealth care and the subsequent inclusion of these measures in HEDIS cameabout as a result of SAMHSA's convening and nurturing these efforts. Allof the efforts to conceptualize and define a comprehensive set of perfor-mance measures in mental health described above also have occurred underthe auspices of SAMHSA. Given its role in stimulating and supporting the existing M/SU health care performance measurement initiatives, together with the fact that gov-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

It can do soby (1) partnering more strongly in initiatives located in the private sector,(2) requiring the submission of jointly agreed-upon public- and private-sector measures in state grants and directly administered programs, and (3)continuing its historical efforts to develop and test new performance mea-sures. However, the public sector alone cannot achieve a performance mea-surement and reporting system for M/SU health care. Private-sector ini-tiatives to build the components of the performance measurement andreporting infrastructure for health care overall need to reach out to M/SUcommunities to ensure their strong participation in these initiatives. Considering currently available resources, influence, and expertise, the committee believes a partnership of public and private leaders is needed tobuild a quality measurement and reporting infrastructure for M/SU healthcare. The committee further believes that this infrastructure should build onexisting structures. It should also aim to achieve maximal consistency andintegration of public and private performance measurement and reportingefforts, as well as the efforts of M/SU and general health care. Establishing Collaborative Public- and Private-Sector Efforts There is ample precedent for collaborative public-private quality mea- surement efforts, as is seen in the agreement reached by public-sector (i.e.,Medicaid) and private-sector (private insurance) purchasers and other stake-holders on the reporting of standardized measures of child health care inHEDIS, in the endorsement of a wide variety of performance measures byboth the public and private sectors through the National Quality Forum,and in the agreement reached by the public and private sectors on a com-mon set of performance measures for inpatient psychiatric care through apartnership among NASMHPD, NRI, the National Association of Psychi-atric Health Systems (NAPHS), the American Psychiatric Association, andJCAHO. The core measures developed by NASMHPD, NRI, and NAPHShave been accepted by JCAHO as meeting its ORYX \u00a9 reporting require- ments for accredited inpatient psychiatric facilities (Ghinassi, 2004). DHHS could further its collaboration with the private sector by partici- pating more strongly in general health care and private-sector performancemeasurement initiatives. For example, while VHA and DHHS's CMS andAHRQ have liaison positions on NCQA's policy-making Committee onPerformance Measurement, SAMHSA has no such position. theNational Quality Forum, a private, not-for-profit, open-membership orga-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The forum has begun to address the quality of M/SUhealth care by convening a workshop to identify evidence-based practicesfor substance-use treatment and a workshop on behavioral health funded inpart by DVA (Kizer, 2005; National Quality Forum, 2004). 18 Continued involvement and support of SAMHSA and DVA in this and other nationalperformance measurement and reporting initiatives for general health care,as well as their encouraging other M/SU organizations to participate, wouldhelp bring the resources of the private sector to bear on M/SU performancemeasurement and achieve consistency across the public and private sec-tors\u2014both of which would facilitate the creation of a performance mea-surement and reporting infrastructure for M/SU health care. An additional benefit is that M/SU health care would be able to partici- pate on the ground floor in quality measurement initiatives, such as thedevelopment of new CPT II codes to capture outcome and otherwise non-reimbursed process-of-care measures in administrative datasets. As de-scribed earlier in this chapter, this advance has taken place through aPerformance Measures Advisory Group comprising representatives ofAHRQ, CMS, JCAHO, NCQA, and the AMA's Physician Consortium forPerformance Improvement (AMA, 2004a). Had representatives of M/SUhealth care been a part of this effort and the precursor efforts of the con-stituent agencies, improvements in M/SU performance measurement mighthave occurred alongside the development of CPT II codes for general healthcare. While the federal government can take action to become more in-volved in such private-sector initiatives, these private initiatives must alsotake action to ensure strong representation of M/SU health care providersand delivery systems (both public and private). Requiring Submission of Jointly Agreed-Upon Public- and Private-Sector Measures in Public and Publicly Funded Programs The federal government also can do much to promote the collection and reporting of M/SU quality measures in both the private and publicsectors. This is illustrated by the inclusion of measures developed for theMedicare and Medicaid programs in HEDIS and their subsequent applica-tion to privately enrolled populations. Both SAMHSA and DVA have ini- 18Elaine J. Power, Vice President, The National Quality Forum, personal communication on March 23, 2005.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

SAMHSA is beginning to require performance measurement and re- porting in all its grant programs for substance-use prevention and treat-ment and mental health as part of its National Outcome Measures initia-tive. This initiative aims to measure 10 outcomes of care: (1) abstinencefrom substance use and decreased mental illness symptomotology,(2) increased/retained employment or return to/stay in school, (3) decreasedcriminal justice involvement, (4) increased stability in housing, (5) increasedaccess to services, (6) increased retention in treatment for substance abuseand reduced utilization of inpatient psychiatric care, (7) increased socialsupports/social connectedness, (8) clients' perception of care, (9) cost-effectiveness, and (10) use of evidence-based practices. While several of theactual measures (e.g., for evidence-based substance-use practices) are stillbeing developed, SAHMSA achieved a major milestone in this initiativewhen, in 2004, it reached agreement with a representative body of states onthe measures to be reported in 2005, on measures that required develop-mental work, and on a plan for preparing all states to report fully on themeasures by the end of fiscal year 2007. SAMHSA's State Outcomes Mea-surement and Management System will support the expansion of state datacollection efforts to meet the requirements of the agreed-upon NationalOutcome Measures (SAMHSA, undated-b). DVA similarly has a National Mental Health Program Performance Monitoring System, which uses internal VHA performance measures toevaluate the work of the VA's 21 Veterans Integrated Services Networks(VISNs) and the medical centers within each of these networks. Many ofthese measures address the quality of M/SU health care, including thenew outcome measures of each patient's functional status (Greenberg andRosenheck, 2005). While these performance measurement initiatives are noteworthy, their benefits could be even greater if the information obtained by the federalgovernment were shared with the private sector as part of formal publicand private collaboration. Continuing Public-Sector Efforts to Develop, Test, and Implement New Performance Measures While DHHS and DVA are reaching out to become an integral part of private-sector performance measurement and reporting initiatives, theyshould not discontinue their internal efforts to develop, test, and implementperformance measures, for several reasons. First, SAMHSA and DVA arethe primary payers for much of the M/SU health care provided in the UnitedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

They have an obligation to move forward to ensure that the quality of the care they secure and provide to their beneficiaries is as good as it canbe. Second, there is not yet an agreed-upon National Quality Measurementand Reporting System in place. Until such a system begins to take shape,SAMHSA and DVA need to develop as much expertise as possible in qual-ity measurement and reporting so they can be strong partners in the system'sdevelopment and implementation. Finally, SAMHSA and DVA will be moreattractive partners if they bring to the table both experience and influencein shaping the quality measurement activities of a large portion of themarketplace, as has the Medicare program. APPLYING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT METHODS AT THE LOCUS OF CARE Measuring and reporting on quality by themselves will not achieve improvements in care (Berwick et al., 2003). Since quality improvement is,at its heart, a change initiative, successful quality improvement requiresthat quality measurement be linked with activities at the locus of care toeffect change and that understanding and use of these change (qualityimprovement) techniques be woven into the day-to-day operations of healthcare organizations and provider practices. Although a systematic review and analysis of quality improvement strategies reveals remarkably little information about the most effectiveways to secure the consistent incorporation of research findings into rou-tine clinical practice (Shojania et al., 2004), many published reports ofsuccessful quality improvement initiatives clearly show that it is possible fororganizations to change the quality of their health care for the better(Shojania and Grimshaw, 2005), just as it is possible to increase the qualityof other industries' products (Deming, 1986). While the susceptibility tosuccessful change is a function of some intrinsic characteristics of individu-als (Berwick, 2003), the types of activities that organizations and cliniciansneed to undertake to achieve and sustain quality improvement can be sur-mised from research on and studies of organizational change (Shojania andGrimshaw, 2005). A large body of research and other published work onorganizational change, for example, consistently calls attention to five pre-dominantly human resource management practices 19 (and one other orga- nizational practice) that are key to successful change implementation:(1) ongoing communication about the desired change with those who are toeffect it; (2) training in the new practice; (3) worker involvement in design-ing the change process; (4) sustained attention to progress in making the 19The human resource side of change tends to be undermanaged as compared with man- agement of the implementation of technological changes (Kimberly and Quinn, 1984).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

All of these practices requirethe exercise of effective leadership (IOM, 2004). These practices are illustrated in some of the leading quality improve- ment initiatives in health care, including those of VHA (Jha et al., 2003)and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (http://www.ihi.org/ihi/programs). Most recently, they have been employed by some of the smallestand least resource-rich health care providers\u2014providers of substance-usetreatment services\u2014through the Network for the Improvement of Addic-tion Treatment (NIATx) (see Box 4-4). More-widespread application of quality improvement techniques would be facilitated by similar initiatives in mental health care, additional sub-stance-use treatment sites, and provider sites offering combined M/SU treat-ment that could undertake research, demonstration, and dissemination ofquality improvement strategies across more diverse clinicians, organiza-tions, and systems delivering M/SU health care. BOX 4-4 The Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) NIATx is a partnership between The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's \"Paths to Recovery\" program and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment's \"Strengthen- ing Treatment Access and Retention\" program. The mission of NIATx is to helpproviders learn approaches that make more efficient use of their treatment capac- ity and produce improvements in care delivery that affect access to and retention in addiction treatment. Of the millions of Americans who need substance-use treatment, only a small minority receive it. Fifty percent of those who do leave treatment before its benefits can be realized. While finances and psychological readiness explain some of thisdeficit, the issue that often keeps clients from treatment is the way services are delivered. Systems engineering, process improvement, and innovative uses of technology have been shown in other industries to dramatically improve the qualityand efficiency of service delivery processes. NIATx brings these resources to substance-use treatment. The National Program Office at the University of Wisconsin's Industrial and Systems Engineering Department provides coaching,phone, and face-to-face educational sessions; a process improvement website and other communications to the field; and administrative support. NIATx aims to reduce waiting time, reduce the percentage of no shows for treatment, reduce the percentage of clients that leave treatment early, and in- crease the number of clients admitted to treatment through three initiatives. The Treatment Provider Initiative. The 39 treatment agencies (including 9 men- tal health agencies with addiction services) in 25 states that participate in NIATx are demonstrating the potential of process improvement to help treatment provid-ers improve nine work processes that influence treatment access and retention: (1) the first contact a client has with the treatment agency, (2) the intake andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Recommendation 4-3. To measure quality better, DHHS, in partner- ship with the private sector, should charge and financially support anentity similar to the National Quality Forum to convene governmentregulators, accrediting organizations, consumer representatives, pro-viders, and purchasers exercising leadership in quality-based purchas-ing for the purpose of reaching consensus on and implementing a com-mon, continuously improving set of M/SU health care quality measuresfor providers, organizations, and systems of care. Participants in thisconsortium should commit to: assessment process, (3) the process by which clients are transferred between levels of care, (4) paperwork burden, (5) client and employee scheduling, (6) sup- port systems (e.g., day care) that can help clients stay in treatment, (7) processesfor reaching out to clients and referral agencies, (8) techniques for engaging cli- ents, and (9) strategies to improve the agency's financial condition. The Single State Agency Initiative. While the Provider Initiative demonstrates the potential to substantially improve access and retention, the state initiative tests the potential of Single State Agencies to improve their own work processes and towidely disseminate improvements (such as those identified in the Provider Initia- tive) across all treatment agencies in each of five states. The Innovation Initiative. The innovation initiative examines ways to take full advantage of the technologies (e.g., consumer health informatics, virtual reality simulation, sensors, computer-mediated communication) currently or soon to beavailable to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of addiction prevention and treatment. NIATx members have demonstrated that work processes can be improved, which in turn improves the quality of care clients receive, as well as the fiscal health of treatment agencies. Within the first 18 months of the initiative, members reportedimprovements in each of the four project aims. Thirty-seven change projects re- sulted in an average reduction of 51 percent in waiting times between first contact and first treatment session. Twenty-eight change projects produced an averagereduction in no-show rates of 41 percent. Twenty-three change projects produced an average increase of 56 percent in admissions, while 39 change projects pro- duced improvements in continuation averaging 39 percent. The extent to whichthose improvements can be sustained and diffused to other parts of the organiza- tion is now being examined, and early results are encouraging.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

They frequently accompany each other, as well as asubstantial number of general medical illnesses such as heart disease,cancers, diabetes, and neurological illnesses. Sometimes they masqueradeas separate somatic problems. Consequently, mental, substance-use, and general health problems and illnesses are frequently intertwined,and coordination of all these types of health care is essential toimproved health outcomes, especially for chronic illnesses. Moreover,mental and/or substance-use (M/SU) problems and illnesses frequentlyaffect and are addressed by education, child welfare, and otherhuman service systems. Improving the quality of M/SU health care\u2014and general health care\u2014depends upon the effective collaborationof all mental, substance-use, general health care, and other humanservice providers in coordinating the care of their patients. However, these diverse providers often fail to detect and treat (or refer to other providers to treat) these co-occurring problemsand also fail to collaborate in the care of these multiple healthconditions\u2014placing their patients' health and recovery in jeopardy.Collaboration by mental, substance-use, and general health care clinicians is especially difficult because of the multiple separationsthat characterize mental and substance-use health care: (1) thegreater separation of mental and substance-use health care fromgeneral health care; (2) the separation of mental and substance-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 211 use health care from each other; (3) society's reliance on the education, child welfare, and other non-health care sectors to secure M/SUservices for many children and adults; and (4) the location ofservices needed by individuals with more-severe M/SU illnesses inpublic-sector programs apart from private-sector health care. This mass of disconnected care delivery arrangements requires numerous patient interactions with different providers, organizations,and government agencies. It also requires multiple provider \"handoffs\"of patients for different services and transmittal of information toand joint planning by all these providers, organizations, and agenciesif coordination is to occur. Overcoming these separations also ismade difficult because of legal and organizational prohibitions onclinicians' sharing information about mental and substance-usediagnoses, medications, and other features of clinical care, as wellas a failure to implement effective structures and processes forlinking the multiple clinicians and organizations caring for patients.To overcome these obstacles, the committee recommends that individualtreatment providers create clinically effective linkages among mental,substance-use, and general health care and other human serviceagencies caring for these patients. Complementary actions are alsoneeded from government agencies, purchasers, and accrediting bodiesto promote the creation of these linkages. To enable these actions, changes are needed as well to address the less-evolved infrastructure for using information technology,some unique features of the M/SU treatment workforce that alsohave implication for effective care coordination, and marketplacepractices. Because these issues are of such consequence, they areaddressed separately in Chapters 6, 7, and 8, respectively. CARE COORDINATION AND RELATED PRACTICES DEFINED Crossing the Quality Chasm notes that the multiple clinicians and health care organizations serving patients in the American health care sys-tem typically fail to coordinate their care. That report further states that theresulting gaps in care, miscommunication, and redundancy are sources ofsignificant patient suffering (IOM, 2001). 1 The Quality Chasm's health care quality framework addresses the need for better care coordination in 1In a subsequent report, produced at the request of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Institute of Medicine identified \"care coordination\" as one of 20 priorityhealth care areas deserving of immediate attention by all participants in American health care (IOM, 2003a).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html212 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS one of its ten rules and in another rule calls attention to the need for provider communication and collaboration to achieve this goal: Cooperation among clinicians. Clinicians and institutions should actively collaborate and communicate to ensure an appropriate exchange of infor- mation and coordination of care. Shared knowledge and the free flow of information. Patients should have unfettered access to their own medical information and to clinical knowl- edge. Clinicians and patients should communicate effectively and shareinformation. (IOM, 2001:62) These two rules highlight two prerequisites to coordination of care: communication and collaboration across providers and within and acrossinstitutions. Communication exists when each clinician or treatment pro- vider caring for a patient shares needed treatment information with otherclinicians and providers caring for the patient. Information can be sharedverbally; manually in writing; or through information technology, such as ashared electronic health record. Collaboration is multidimensional and re- quires the aggregation of several behaviors, including the following: A shared understanding of goals and roles \u2014Collaboration is en- hanced by a shared understanding of an agreed-upon collective goal (Gittellet al., 2000) and clarity regarding each clinician's role. Role confusion androle conflict are frequent barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration (Rice,2000). Effective communication \u2014Multiple studies have identified effective communication as a key feature of collaboration (Baggs and Schmitt, 1988;Knaus et al., 1994). \"Effective\" isdefined variously as frequent, timely, understandable, accurate, and satisfy-ing (Gittell et al., 2000; Shortell et al., 1994). Shared decision making \u2014In shared decision making, problems and strategies are openly discussed (Baggs and Schmitt, 1997; Baggs et al.,1999; Rice, 2000; Schmitt, 2001), and consensus is often used to arrive at adecision. Disagreements over treatment approaches and philosophies, rolesand responsibilities, and ethical questions are common in health care set-tings. Positive ways of addressing these inevitable differences are identifiedas a key component of effective caregiver collaboration (Shortell et al.,1994). It is important to note that, according to health services researchers, collaboration is not a dichotomous variable, simply present or absent.Rather, it is present to varying degrees (Schmitt, 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 213 Collaboration also is typically characterized by necessary precursors. Clinicians are more likely to collaborate when they perceive each other ashaving the knowledge necessary for good clinical care (Baggs and Schmitt,1997). Mutual respect and trust are necessary precursors to collaboration as well (Baggs and Schmitt, 1988; Rice, 2000); personal respect and trustare intertwined with respect for and trust in clinical competence. Care coordination is the outcome of effective collaboration. Coordi- nated care prevents drug-drug interactions and redundant care processes. Itdoes not waste the patient's time or the resources of the health care system.Moreover, it promotes accurate diagnosis and treatment because all provid-ers receive relevant diagnostic and treatment information from all otherproviders caring for a patient. Care integration is related to care coordination. As defined by experts in health care organization and management (Shortell et al., 2000), integra-tion of care and services can be of three types: \"Clinical integration is the extent to which patient care services are coordinated across people, functions, activities, and sites over time so as to maximize the value of services delivered to patients\" (p. 129). Physician (or clinician) integration is the extent to which clinicians are economically linked to an organized delivery system, use its facilitiesand services, and actively participate in its planning, management and gov-ernance. Functional integration is \"the extent to which key support func- tions and activities (such as financial management, strategic planning, hu-man resources management, and information management) are coordinatedacross operating units so as to add the greatest overall value to the system\"(p. 31). The most important of these functions and activities are humanresources deployment strategies, information technologies, and continuousimprovement processes. Shortell et al.'s clinical integration corresponds to care coordination as addressed in the Quality Chasm report. In the context of co-occurring mental and substance-use problems and illnesses, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration(SAMHSA) similarly identifies three levels of integration (SAMHSA,undated): Integrated treatment refers to interactions between clinicians to address the individual needs of the client/patient, and consists of \"anymechanism by which treatment interventions for co-occurring disorders arecombined within the context of a primary treatment relationship or servicesetting\" (p. 61).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html214 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Integrated program refers to an organizational structure that en- sures the provision of staff or linkages with other programs to address all ofa client's needs. Integrated systems refers to an organizational structure that sup- ports an array of programs for individuals with different needs throughfunding, credentialing/licensing, data collection/reporting, needs assessment,planning, and other system planning and operation functions. SAMHSA's integrated treatment corresponds to Shortell et al.'s clinical integration; both appear to equate to coordination of care as used in the Quality Chasm report. In this report, we use the Quality Chasm terminol- ogy of care coordination and address the coordination of care at the level of the patient. We do not address issues surrounding the other levels of coor-dination or integration represented by Shortell et al.'s clinician and func- tional integration or SAMHSA's integrated programs and systems . FAILED COORDINATION OF CARE FOR CO-OCCURRING CONDITIONS Co-Occurring Mental, Substance-Use, and General Health Problems and Illnesses Mental or substance-use problems and illnesses seldom occur in isola- tion. Approximately 15-43 percent of the time they occur together (Kessleret al., 1996; Kessler, 2004; Grant et al., 2004a,b; SAMHSA, 2004). Theyalso accompany a wide variety of general medical conditions (Katon, 2003;Mertens et al., 2003), sometimes masquerade as separate somatic problems(Katon, 2003; Kroenke, 2003), and often go undetected (Kroenke et al.,2000; Saitz et al., 1997). As a result, individuals with M/SU problems andillnesses have a heightened need for coordinated care. Co-Occurring Mental and Substance-Use Problems and Illnesses The 1990-1992 National Comorbidity Survey well documented the high rates of co-occurring mental and substance use conditions, finding anestimated 42.7 percent of adults aged 15-54 with an alcohol or drug \"dis-order\" also having a mental disorder, and 14.7 percent of those with amental disorder also having an alcohol or drug disorder (Kessler et al.,1996; Kessler 2004). These findings are reaffirmed by more recent studies.According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism(NIAAA) 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Re-lated Conditions, 19.7 percent of the general adult (18 and older) U.S.population with any substance-use disorder is estimated to have at least oneCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 215 co-occurring independent (non-substance-induced) mood disorder, and 17.7 percent to have at least one co-occurring independent anxiety disor-der. Among respondents with a mood disorder, 20 percent had at least onesubstance-use disorder, as did 15 percent of those with an anxiety disorder.Rates of co-occurrence are higher among individuals who seek treatmentfor substance-use disorders; 40.7 percent, 33.4 percent, and 33.1 percent ofthose who sought treatment for an alcohol-use disorder had at least oneindependent mood disorder, anxiety disorder, or other drug use disorder,respectively. Among those seeking treatment for a drug-use disorder, 60.3percent had at least one independent mood disorder, 42.6 percent at leastone independent anxiety disorder, and 55.2 percent a comorbid alcohol-usedisorder (Grant et al., 2004a). Similar or higher rates of co-occurrence are found for other types of mental problems and illnesses (Grant et al., 2004b), as well as for seriousmental illnesses generally. The 2003 National Survey on Drug Use andHealth documented that among adults aged 18 and older not living in aninstitution or inpatient facility, an estimated 18 percent of those who hadused illicit drugs in the past year also had a serious mental illness. 2 Over 21 percent of adults with substance \"abuse\" or dependence were estimated tohave a serious mental illness, and 21.3 percent of adults with such an illnesshad been dependent on or \"abused\" alcohol or illicit drugs in the past year(SAMHSA, 2004). One longitudinal study of patients in both mental health and drug treatment settings found that mental illnesses were as prevalent and seriousamong individuals treated in substance-use treatment facilities as amongpatients in mental health treatment facilities. Similarly, individuals servedin mental health treatment facilities had substance-use illnesses at rates andseverity comparable to those among individuals served in substance-usetreatment facilities (Havassy et al., 2004). Co-occurrence with General Health Conditions M/SU problems and illnesses frequently accompany a substantial num- ber of chronic general medical illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, neu-rologic illnesses, and cancers, sometimes masquerading as separate somaticproblems (Katon, 2003). Approximately one in five patients hospitalized fora heart attack, for example, suffers from major depression, and evidencefrom multiple studies is \"strikingly consistent\" that post-heart attack depres- 2A serious mental illness was defined for this study as a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that met criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , fourth edition (DSM-IV) and resulted in functional impairment that substantially interfered with or limited one or more major life activities.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Depression and anxiety also are stronglyassociated with somatic symptoms such as headache, fatigue, dizziness, andpain, which are the leading cause of outpatient medical visits and oftenmedically unexplained (Kroenke, 2003). They also are more often present inindividuals with a number of medical conditions as yet not well understood,including chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome,and nonulcer dyspepsia (Henningsen et al., 2003). The converse also is true. Individuals with M/SU conditions often have increased prevalence of general medical conditions such as cardiovasculardisease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, digestive disorders, andasthma (De Alba et al., 2004; Mertens et 2003; Miller et al., 2003; Sokolet al., 2004; Upshur, 2005). Persons with severe mental illnesses have muchhigher rates of HIV and hepatitis C than those found in the general popula-tion (Brunette et al., 2003; Rosenberg et al., 2001; Sullivan et al., 1999).Moreover, specific mental or substance-use diagnoses place individuals athigher risk for certain general medical conditions. For example, those intreatment for schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar illness are more likelythan the general population to have asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphy-sema (Sokol et al., 2004). Persons with anxiety disorders have higher rates ofcardiac problems, hypertension, gastrointestinal problems, genitourinary dis-orders, and migraine (Harter et al., 2003). Individuals with schizophrenia areat increased risk for obesity, heart disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis,and osteoporosis (American Diabetes Association et al., 2004; Goff et al.,2005; Green et al., 2003). And chronic heavy alcohol use is associated withliver disease, immune system disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes(Carlsson et al., 2000; Corrao et al., 2000; NIAAA, 2000). Substance use, particularly injection drug use, carries a high risk of other serious illnesses. In a large cohort study of middle-class substance-using patients, the prevalence of hepatitis C was 27 percent in all substanceusers and 76 percent in injection drug users (Abraham et al., 1999). Injec-tion drug use accounts for about 60 percent of new cases of hepatitis C(Alter, 1999) and remains the second most common risk behavior for ac-quisition of HIV in the United States (CDC, 2001). Evidence of past infec-tion with hepatitis B also is common in injection drug users (Garfein, et al.,1996). Hepatitis C and coinfection with HIV and active hepatitis B areassociated with more-severe liver disease (Zarski et al., 1998). Alcohol useis prevalent among HIV-infected patients (Conigliaro et al., 2003), andaccelerates cognitive impairment in HIV-associated dementia complex (Feinet al., 1998; Tyor and Middaugh, 1999). Given that patients with HIV infection are now living longer, the impact of comorbid conditions in these patients, including alcohol and drug-useCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 217 problems, has become increasingly important. Hepatitis C-related liver injury progresses more rapidly in both HIV coinfected persons and alcoholusers. Laboratory and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that both al-cohol use and hepatitis C can negatively affect immunologic and clinicalHIV outcomes. Furthermore, both alcohol and drug use may adverselyaffect the prescription and efficacy of and adherence to HIV medications(Moore et al., 2004; Palepu et al., 2003; Samet et al., 2004). The co-occurrence of mental, substance-use, and general health prob- lems and illnesses has important implications for the recovery of individu-als with these illnesses. All of these conditions need to be to be detectedand treated; however, this often does not happen, and even when it does,providers dealing with one condition often fail to detect and treat the co-occurring illness and to collaborate in the coordinated care of thesepatients. Failure to Detect, Treat, and Collaborate in the Care of Co-Occurring Illnesses Although detection of some common mental illnesses, such as depres- sion, has increased over the past decade, general medical providers still toooften fail to detect alcohol, drug, or mental problems and illnesses (Friedmannet al., 2000b; Miller et al., 2003; Saitz et al., 1997, 2002). In a nationallyrepresentative survey of general internal medicine physicians, family medi-cine physicians, obstetrician/gynecologists, and psychiatrists, for example, 12percent reported that they did not usually ask their new patients whether theydrank alcohol, and fewer than 20 percent used any formal screening tool todetect problems among those who did drink (Friedmann et al., 2000b).Moreover, evidence indicates that general medical providers often assumethat the health complaints of patients with a prior psychiatric diagnosis arepsychologically rather than medically based (Graber et al., 2000). Similarly, mental health and substance-use treatment providers fre- quently do not screen, assess, or address co-occurring mental or substance-use conditions (Friedmann et al., 2000b) or co-occurring general medicalhealth problems. In a survey of patients of one community mental healthcenter, 45 percent of respondents reported that their mental health providerdid not ask about general medical issues (Miller et al., 2003). Evidence presented in Chapter 4 documents some of the failures of providers to treat co-occurring conditions. Other studies have added to theevidence that even when co-occurring M/SU conditions are known, they arenot treated (Edlund et al., 2004; Friedmann et al., 2000b, 2001).

Substance abuse treatment sites only documented sub-stance use disorders\" (Havassy et al., 2004:140). In the national survey ofprimary care providers and psychiatrists described above, 18 percent ofphysicians reported that they typically offered no intervention (including areferral) to their problem-drinking patients, in part because of misplacedconcern about patients' sensitivity on these issues (Friedmann et al., 2000b).Nearly the same proportion (15 percent) reported that they did not inter-vene when use of illicit drugs was detected (Friedmann et al., 2001). A1997-1998 national survey found that among persons with probable co-occurring mental and substance-use disorders who received treatment foreither condition, fewer than a third (28.6 percent) received treatmentfor the other (Watkins et al., 2001). Additional evidence of the failure to coordinate care is found in the complaints of consumers of M/SU services. The President's New FreedomCommission reported that consumers often feel overwhelmed and bewil-dered when they must access and integrate mental health care and relatedservices across multiple, disconnected providers in the public and privatesectors (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). These failures to detect and treat co-occurring conditions take place in a health care system that has historically and currently separates care formental and substance-use problems and illnesses from each other and fromgeneral health care, to a greater extent than is the case for other specialtyhealth care. Absent or poor linkages characterize these separate care deliv-ery arrangements. Numerous demonstration projects and strategies havebeen developed to better link health care for general, mental, and substance-use health conditions and related services. These include The Robert WoodJohnson Foundation's Depression in Primary Care: Linking Clinical andSystems Strategies Project (Upshur, 2005) and the MacArthur Foundation'sRESPECT\u2014Depression Project (Dietrich et al., 2004). NUMEROUS, DISCONNECTED CARE DELIVERY ARRANGEMENTS \"Every system is perfectly designed to achieve exactly the results it gets.\" (Berwick, 1998) Organizations and providers offering treatment and services for men- tal, substance-use, and general health care conditions typically do so throughseparate care delivery arrangements:Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 219 Arrangements for the delivery of health care for mental and substance-use conditions are typically separate from general health care(financially and organizationally more so than other specialty health careservices). In spite of the frequent co-occurrence of M/SU problems and ill- nesses, the delivery of health care for these conditions also typically occursthrough separate treatment providers and organizations. Some health care for mental and substance-use conditions and re- lated services are delivered through governmental programs that are sepa-rate from private insurance\u2014requiring coordination across public and pri-vate sectors of care. Non-health care sectors\u2014education, child welfare, and juvenile and criminal justice systems\u2014also separately arrange for M/SU services. Traversing these separations is made difficult by a failure to put in place effective strategies for linking general, mental, and substance-use healthcare and the other human services systems that also deliver much-neededservices for M/SU problems and illnesses; by a lack of agreement aboutwhich entity or entities should be held accountable for coordinating care;and by state and federal laws (and the policies and practices of some healthcare organizations) that limit information sharing across providers. 3 Separation of M/SU Health Care from General Health Care Although the proportion has been declining in recent years, two-thirds of Americans (64 percent in 2002) under the age of 65 receive health carethrough private insurance offered by their or their family member's em-ployer (Fronstin, 2003). Over the past two decades, employers and othergroup purchasers of health care (e.g., state Medicaid agencies) have increas-ingly provided mental and substance-use health care benefits through healthinsurance plans that are separate administratively and financially from theplans through which individuals receive their general health care. Theseseparate M/SU health plans are informally referred to as \"carved out.\" Inpayer carve-outs, an employer or other payer offers prospective enrollees one or more health plans encompassing all of their covered health careexcept that for mental and substance-use conditions. Covered individualsare then enrolled in another health plan that includes a network of M/SU 3In addition, the less-evolved infrastructure for deploying information technology among mental health and substance-use treatment providers inhibits ease of coordination (see Chap- ter 6). Some of the unique features of the M/SU treatment workforce (e.g., the greater number of provider types, variation in their training and focus, and their greater location in solo orsmall group practices) that also contribute to this problem are addressed in Chapter 7.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html220 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS providers chosen separately by the employer/payer. In health plan carve- outs, employees enroll in just one comprehensive health plan, and the ad-ministrators of that plan arrange internally to have M/SU health care pro-vided and managed through a separate vendor. Estimates of the proportionof employees receiving M/SU health services through carve-out arrange-ments with managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs) vary from36 to 66 percent, reflecting differences in targeted survey respondents (e.g.,employers, MBHOs, or employees) and what is being measured (e.g.,carved-out services can include utilization review or case management only,or the provision of a full array of M/SU services) (Barry et al., 2003). The MBHOs that provide these carve-out M/SU services arose in part in response to financial concerns. In the 1980s, employers' costs for behav-ioral health services were increasing at twice the rate of medical care overalland four times the rate of inflation. Evidence is clear that MBHOs havebeen successful in reducing these costs and also in achieving greater use ofcommunity-based care as opposed to institutionalization. They also havebeen credited with playing a role in keeping costs down in the face ofbroadened benefits, which has assisted in securing support for greater par-ity of mental health benefit coverage. Moreover, MBHOs have helped moveclinicians from solo into group practices (Feldman, 2003), which, as dis-cussed in Chapter 7, can facilitate quality improvement. Carve-out arrange-ments can nurture recognition and support for specialized knowledge ofM/SU problems and illnesses and treatment expertise. They also can attenu-ate problems involving the adverse selection of individuals with M/SU ill-nesses in insurance plans (see Chapter 8). In contrast to the clear evidence for the benefits described above, evi- dence for the effects of carve-out arrangements on quality of care is limitedand mixed (Donohue and Frank, 2000; Grazier and Eselius, 1999;Hutchinson and Foster, 2003). However, models of safety and errors inhealth care suggest that whenever individuals are cared for by separateorganizations, functional units, or providers, discontinuities in care canresult unless the unavoidable gaps in care are anticipated, and strategies tobridge those gaps are implemented (Cook et al., 2000). A previous Instituteof Medicine (IOM) report found that carved-out M/SU services \"do notnecessarily lead to poor coordination of care. . . . However the separationof primary care and behavioral health care systems brings risks to coordina-tion and integration. . .\" (IOM, 1997:116). The President's New FreedomCommission on Mental Health care deemed the separation between systemsfor mental and general health care so large as to constitute a \"chasm\" (NewFreedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). Several factors could help account for problems with coordinating care in the presence of M/SU carve-outs. First, under carve-out arrangements,primary care physicians generally are not expected to treat (and may notCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The employer or other purchaser ofhealth insurance benefits for the individual has, by contract, specified thatgeneral health care is to be provided by one network of providers though ahealth plan covering that care, and M/SU care through a different healthplan's network of specialty M/SU providers. This is different from thesituation with other medical problems and illnesses. For example, when apatient seeks care for diabetes, asthma, allergies, heart problems, or othergeneral medical conditions, the patient's primary care provider is allowedto treat these illnesses and can be reimbursed for those services. When theprimary care provider and/or the patient decides that the problem requiresthe attention of a specialist, the provider makes a referral or the patient self-refers to a specialist. Use of a specialist comes about based generally on theprimary care provider's and/or patient's judgment. In contrast, under M/SUcarve-out arrangements, M/SU health care often is predetermined by theemployer or other group purchaser to require the attention of a specialistand must therefore be provided by a second provider. As a result, onemethod of care coordination\u2014care by the same provider\u2014is not availableto the patient. While not all primary care providers have the expertise and/or desire to treat M/SU illnesses (see Chapters 4 and 7), some do, andevidence indicates that many patients typically turn initially to their pri-mary care provider for help with M/SU problems and illnesses (Mickus etal., 2000). A second obstacle to care coordination is that information about the patient's health problem or illness, medications, and other treatments mustnow be shared across and meet the often differing privacy, confidentiality,and additional administrative requirements imposed by the different healthplans. Consumers also are required to navigate the administrative require-ments of both health plans. Finally, as described in Chapter 4, the use of carve-outs poses difficul- ties for quality measurement and improvement\u2014including measurementand improvement of coordination\u2014in two ways. First, because primarycare providers cannot always be reimbursed for M/SU health care, theysometimes provide the care but code the visit according to the patient'ssomatic complaint (for which the treatment they provide can be reim-bursed) (Rost et al., 1994). This situation masks the true prevalence ofM/SU illnesses in primary care and impedes quality measurement and im-provement efforts. Moreover, the existence of two parallel health plansserving the patient creates some confusion about accountability for qualityand coordination. For example, the National Committee for QualityAssurance's mental and substance-use quality measures (i.e., those con-tained in its Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set [HEDIS]measurement set) are required to be reported by comprehensive managedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Separation of Health Services for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions from Each Other The mental health and substance-use treatment systems evolved sepa- rately in the United States as a result of the different historical understandingsof and responses to these illnesses described in Chapter 2. This separationbecame increasingly institutionalized with the evolution of three separateinstitutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (the National Instituteof Mental Health [NIMH] in 1949 and National Institute on Alcohol Abuseand Alcoholism [NIAAA] and the National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA]in 1974) and separate programming and funding divisions within SAMHSA.This separation at the federal policy level is frequently mirrored at the statelevel, where separate state mental health and substance-use agencies exist(although they are combined in some states). The separation of service delivery that mirrors this separation of policy making and funding does not optimally serve individuals with co-occurringmental and substance-use illnesses. A congressionally mandated study ofthe prevention and treatment of co-occurring substance-use and mentalconditions (SAMHSA, undated) found that the difficulties faced by indi-viduals with these co-occurring conditions in receiving successful treatmentand achieving recovery are due in part to the existence of these two separateservice systems. The study notes: \"Too often, when individuals with co-occurring disorders do enter specialty care, they are likely to bounce backand forth between the mental health and substance abuse services systems,receiving treatment for the co-occurring disorder serially, at best\" (SAMHSA,undated: i). The study further states that this separation of public-sector substance-use and mental health service systems is accompanied by markeddifferences in \"staffing resources, philosophy of treatment, funding sources,community political factors, regulations, prior training of staff, credentialsof staff, treatment approaches, medical staff resources, assertive commu-nity outreach capabilities, and routine types of evaluations and testingprocedures performed\" (SAMHSA, undated: v). Of greatest concern, the study found that individuals with these co-occurring conditions also may be 4Personal communication, Philip Renner, MBA, Assistant Vice President for Quality Mea- surement, NCQA on March 22, 2005.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Frequent Need for Individuals with Severe Mental Illnesses to Receive Care Through a Separate Public-Sector Delivery System Treatment for M/SU conditions also is unique in that state and local governments manage public-sector health care systems that are separatefrom the private-sector health care system for individuals with M/SU ill-nesses. Indeed, \"behavioral disorders remain essentially the only set ofhealth problems for which state and local governments finance and managea specialty treatment system. [Although] public funds pay for a large por-tion of the costs of care for certain other disorders (such as Medicarefinancing of dialysis), and public services exist for a few rare disorders suchas leprosy, . . . the public mental health system is the only substantialdisorder-specific treatment system in existence today\" (Hogan, 1999:106). Because (as discussed in Chapter 3) individuals with M/SU illnesses face greater limitations in their insurance coverage than is the case with cover-age for other illnesses, some individuals with M/SU illnesses who startreceiving their care through private insurance must switch to public insur-ance (Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program [SCHIP]) 5 or other publicly funded programs at the state and local levels when theirprivate insurance is exhausted. Evidence indicates that these benefit limitsmost often are reached by individuals with some of the most severe mentalillness diagnoses, including depression, bipolar disorder, and psychoses.There is also evidence that other serious diagnoses appearing in childhood,such as autism, are excluded from coverage under certain private healthbenefit plans (Peele et al., 2002). The lesser availability of health insurancefor severe mental illnesses and for substance-use treatment also helps ex-plain the involvement of other public sectors (i.e., child welfare and juvenilejustice) in the delivery of mental health care (as described below). The federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) and Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Block Grant programs pro-vide funds to states help fill these gaps. SAPT and CMHS grants to statessupport the planning, delivery, and evaluation of M/SU treatment services.SAPT funds can be used for individuals regardless of the severity of theirsubstance-use problem or illness, while CMHS grant funds may be usedonly for individuals with serious mental illnesses and children with \"serious 5The Medicaid and SCHIP programs also deliver mental health services to individuals for whom these programs are the primary source of health insurance as a result of low income.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Some of these funds also are given to county and other local government units to use in the planning anddelivery of care. In a number of states, major responsibility for mentalhealth services rests with local government, and the extent of coordinationbetween state and local governments is variable. In addition, public mental health hospitals play a key role in the care of forensic patients\u2014those charged with crimes and being evaluated forcompetence to stand trial or assume criminal responsibility, or for otherissues; those found incompetent to stand trial and being treated to restorecompetence; those found not guilty by reason of insanity and beingtreated; those referred for presentencing evaluation; and those sent fromprison for hospital-based treatment. In some states, these and relatedcategories account for more than half of all inpatient beds in public men-tal hospitals. A growing number of people in each of these categories arealso being treated in the public (or equivalent community mental healthclinic-based) outpatient system. To a considerable extent, this is a func-tion that the public sector has always served. But as other functions haveshrunk or been transferred to the private sector (e.g., acute care in manystates), forensic functions have come to account for a larger percentage ofthe public system. Involvement of Non-Health Care Sectors in M/SU Health Care M/SU problems and illnesses often are detected (sometimes for the first time) by agencies or organizations that are not part of the traditionalhealth care sector, such as schools, employers, or the welfare and justicesystems. These organizations often refer, arrange for, support, monitor,and sometimes deliver M/SU health services. School mental health ser-vices and the child welfare and juvenile justice systems provide access tomental health services for the majority of children (DHHS, 1999). Thecriminal justice system also plays a role in securing M/SU services forsome adults. In the private sector, employee assistance programs play akey role in the identification, referral, and provision of services to indi-viduals with M/SU problems and illnesses. Moreover, many other publiclyfunded entities, such as housing programs, programs for individuals whoare homeless, income maintenance programs, and employment programs,provide services that are essential to the recovery of many individualswith severe and chronic M/SU illnesses. The involvement of this array ofhuman service providers generally not considered to be part of the healthcare sector necessitates additional levels of care coordination. This coor-dination must be effected despite the inevitable difficulties of work-ing with multiple bureaucracies and in systems with differing priorities,knowledge bases, and practices.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 225 Schools Most children and adolescents who receive health care for mental con- ditions receive that care through their schools, not from primary medical orspecialty mental health care providers (Kessler et al., 2001). The approachesused by schools to deliver M/SU health care services are highly variable,ranging from (1) class-room based, teacher-implemented programs; to (2)multifaceted, schoolwide programs that employ multiple strategies, such asmodification of school policies, classroom management strategies, curricu-lum changes, and facilitation of parent-school communications; to (3)therapy provided to an individual student, group, or family; to (4) otherstrategies, such as parent training and education, case management, andconsultation. Some of these approaches are prevention-oriented, while oth-ers are designed to treat individuals with identified psychopathology. Ser-vice modality, intensity, and duration also vary according to individualneeds (Rones and Hoagwood, 2000). Some programs rely primarily orexclusively on school-supported mental health professionals (e.g., schoolsocial workers, guidance counselors, school nurses), while others have vary-ing degrees of linkage with community mental health agencies and provid-ers (e.g., clinical psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists) who eitherprovide the mental health services exclusively in the school or partner withschool staff. In some cases, mental health providers from the school and/orcommunity work on-site in school-based health centers in partnership withprimary care providers (Weist et al., 2005). A review of research on such school-based mental health services pub- lished between 1985 and 1999 found that although evidence exists for theeffectiveness of a subset of strong programs across a range of emotional andbehavioral problems, most school-based programs have no evidence tosupport their impact, and no programs are targeted to specific clinicalsyndromes such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),and depression. This same study also found that precisely what is providedby schools under the rubric of mental health services is largely unknown, asis whether those services are effective (Rones and Hoagwood, 2000). To learn more about school-based mental health services, SAMHSA and Abt Associates recently conducted a national survey aimed at providinginformation on mental health services delivered in U.S. public schools,including: The types of mental health problems/issues encountered most fre- quently in the school setting. The types of mental health services delivered, and models and ar- rangements for their delivery in public elementary, middle, and secondaryschools.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The numbers, availability, and qualifications of mental health staff in public schools. The final report is to be released during fall 2005.6 Experts on school-based mental health services note that (1) schools should not be viewed as responsible for meeting all the mental health needsof their students (in some cases they are already overburdened with de-mands that should be addressed elsewhere); and (2) connections betweenschool-based mental health services and substance-use treatment servicesare nonexistent or tenuous (Weist et al., 2005). These two factors, plus theneed to coordinate M/SU services with general health care, impose respon-sibilities on school-based M/SU providers to collaborate with other spe-cialty and general health care providers serving the student, and for theother specialty and general health care providers to do the same. Child Welfare Services Almost half (47.9 percent) of a nationally representative, random sample of children aged 2-14 who were investigated by child welfare services in1999-2000 had a clinically significant need for mental health care (Burns etal., 2004). Even higher rates have been observed in children placed in fostercare arrangements (Landsverk, 2005). This is not surprising given that thecircumstances of children who are the subject of reports of maltreatment andinvestigated by child welfare services are characterized by the presence ofknown risk factors for the development of emotional and behavioral prob-lems, including abuse, neglect, poverty, domestic violence, and parental sub-stance abuse (Burns et al., 2004). Moreover, substantial rates of substance useamong adolescents in child welfare have been detected (Aarons et al., 2001). Ensuring the well-being of children is typically considered part of the mandate of child welfare services, and the children served by these agenciesalso have very high rates of use of mental health services. However, the firstnationally representative study examining the well-being of children andfamilies that came to the attention of child welfare services (the NationalSurvey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being [NSCAW]) found that three offour youths in child welfare who met a stringent criterion of need did notreceive mental health care within 12 months of a child abuse and neglectinvestigation (Landsverk, 2005). States have traditionally used Medicaid toprovide medical, developmental, and mental health services to children in 6Personal communication, Judith L. Teich, ACSW, Health Policy Analyst.

Analysis of the NSCAWdata found that although 94 percent of counties participating in the surveyassessed all children entering foster care for physical health problems, only47.8 percent had policies for assessing mental health problems (Leslie et al.,2003). Data from the NSCAW also indicate that underutilization of neededservices can be alleviated when there is strong coordination between localchild welfare and public mental health agencies (Hurlburt et al., 2004). Justice Systems Criminal justice system The proportion of U.S. citizens incarcerated has been increasing annually\u2014from a rate of 601 persons in custody per100,000 U.S. residents in 1995 to 715 persons in custody per 100,000residents in 2003. As of mid-2003, the nation's prisons and jails 8 held 2,078,570 persons\u2014one in every 140 U.S. residents (Harrison and Karberg,2004). Corrections facilities increasingly must attend to M/SU treatmentbecause of this growth in the proportion of the U.S. population that isincarcerated and the requirement that prisons and jails provide treatmentto inmates with medical needs (Haney and Specter, 2003). A rigorous epidemiologic study of the prevalence of mental and substance-use illnesses in correctional settings has not been undertaken. 9 According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice, however, approximately 16 per-cent of all persons in jails and state prisons reported having either a mental\"condition\" or an overnight stay in a psychiatric facility, as did 7 percent ofthose in federal prisons (Ditton, 1999). Consistent with the evidence inChapter 3 indicating that those with mental illnesses are responsible for asmall share of violence in society, this rate is not much higher than thatamong the U.S. population overall (13 percent of those over age 18 re-ported receiving mental health treatment in an inpatient or outpatient set-ting in 2003 10) (SAMHSA, 2004). Also consistent with the evidence in 7Little information is available about the need for and use of mental health services for children whose families receive in-home services from the child welfare system (Landsverk, 2005). 8In general, prisons and jails differ by the inmates' length of sentence. Prisons hold those convicted of felonies and serving sentences longer than a year, while jails hold those awaiting adjudication, convicted of misdemeanors, and serving sentences of a year or less. Prisons areoperated by the state; jails by counties and other localities (Wolff, 2004). 9A more rigorous epidemiologic study of the prevalence of mental and substance use ill- nesses in correctional settings, modeled on the prevalence studies of the general population inthe United States (Kessler et al., 2001) and the correctional and general populations in the United Kingdom, has been called for (Wolff, 2004). 10This figure does not include treatment solely for substance use.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html228 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Chapter 3, substance use plays a larger role in incarceration. Over half of inmates in state prisons and local jails were under the influence of alcoholor other drugs at the time of their offense, as were 33 to 46 percent offederal prison inmates (Ditton, 1999). In an average year, moreover, ap-proximately one-third of new admissions to prisons result from a violationof parole conditions, nearly 16 percent of which are for some type of drug-related violation, such as a positive test for drug use or possession of drugs(Hughes et al., 2001). Although the majority of prisons and jails screen,assess, and provide treatment for mental illnesses, far fewer prisoners re-ceive treatment for their substance-use problems and illnesses. When theydo, detoxification and self-help group/peer support counseling are mostcommonly provided (Wolff, 2004). The police and courts also interact with systems providing treatment for M/SU illnesses as they exercise their judgment and license to divertindividuals with such illnesses from criminal processing (Metzner, 2002).As discussed in Chapter 3, courts increasingly influence the receipt of treat-ment for M/SU illnesses through the use of specialty drug and mental healthcourts. Defendants in these courts have the option of treatment or incar-ceration. If they choose treatment, they may forgo criminal processingaltogether, or undergo criminal processing but forgo sentencing. The courtsupervises compliance with treatment. Police also influence treatment; asthe gatekeepers for the criminal justice process, they are charged with deter-mining whether to \"socialize, medicalize, or criminalize\" the event. Andprobation and parole officers influence treatment in exercising their over-sight over compliance with terms of probation and parole. All of theseactors' decisions are influenced by their personal understanding of theseissues, the culture of their agency, and their localities' enforcement policiesand social norms (Wolff, 2004). Appropriate decision making about diverting or prosecuting, exercising coercion into treatment in a way that preserves patient-centered care (seeChapter 3), and fulfilling the right of incarcerated persons to medical treat-ment requires policies and practices that reflect an understanding of M/SUproblems and illnesses and their effective treatment, as well as knowledgeof the availability of treatment in the local community. However, indi-vidual agents of the judicial system vary in their training on these issues,and the policies and practices of each locality vary according to local normsand the public's beliefs about M/SU illnesses 11 (Wolff, 2004). As a result, coordination with specialty M/SU providers, organizations, and systems isessential to the development of evidence-based criminal justice policies and 11Since the chief prosecutor in each jurisdiction is typically elected, the public's perception of M/SU illnesses and dangerousness, for example (see Chapter 3), even if erroneous, may shape policies and practices (Wolff, 2004).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

However, numerous and sizable obstacles to coordination between M/SU health care and criminal justice systems have been documented. Severalactions that are consistent with the Quality Chasm framework for redesign- ing health care have been recommended to overcome these obstacles. Theseinclude using performance measures of the coordination between M/SUhealth care and criminal justice systems at the system, agency, program,and individual levels; providing combined, interdisciplinary training incollaboration and coordination for personnel from both types of agenciesand programs; incentivizing coordination through promotion, salary, andbudget decisions; providing education and decision support to prosecutorsand judges; and using information systems to facilitate the communicationof information essential to responding appropriately to each individual(Wolff, 2004). Juvenile justice system Primary components of the juvenile justice system include intake, detention centers, probation services, secure residential fa-cilities, and aftercare programs (Cocozza, 2004). Although research on theprevalence and nature of M/SU illnesses in juvenile justice systems is lim-ited (Cocozza, 2004), between 60 and 75 percent of youths in these systemsare estimated to have a diagnosable mental health \"disorder\" (Cocozza2004; Teplin et al., 2002; Wierson et al., 1992), and 20 percent are conser-vatively estimated to have a severe mental illness (Cocozza and Skowyra,2000). Rates of co-occurring substance-use illnesses also are high (Cocozza,2004; Grisso, 2004). Moreover, in a 2003 survey of all (698) secure juvenile detention facili- ties in the United States, 12 two-thirds of the facilities reported holding youths (prior to, after, or absent any pending adjudication) because theywere awaiting community mental health services. Further, like youths whoare not abused or neglected but are placed in child welfare solely to obtainmental health services (discussed in Chapter 1), children who are not guiltyof any offence are similarly placed in local juvenile justice systems andincarcerated solely to obtain mental health services not otherwise available.Although no formal counting and tracking of such children takes place,juvenile justice officials in 33 counties in the 17 states with the largestpopulations of children under age 18 estimated that approximately 9,000such children entered their juvenile justice systems under these circum-stances in 2001.

Although the vast majority of juvenile justice facilities report providing some type of mental health service (Goldstrom et al., 2001), \"numerousinvestigations suggest that many youth in the juvenile justice system do notreceive needed mental health services and that available services are insuffi-cient and inadequate.\" Most existing programs have not been evaluated,and some of the most popular and widely implemented programs have noevidence to support them and may actually be harmful. Juvenile justicesystems, however, lack the training, service, and expertise to respond moreeffectively (Cocozza, 2004). Because many youths are in juvenile justicesystems for relatively minor, nonviolent offenses, there also is a growingsentiment that whenever possible, youths with serious mental illnessesshould be diverted from those systems. However, the limited amount ofresearch on the efficacy of juvenile diversion programs has yielded mixedresults. To achieve appropriate diversion and the provision of evidence-based care to children and youths in juvenile justice, coordination is crucial:\"Almost every study and report that has focused on youth with mentalhealth disorders who come in contact with the juvenile justice system hasarrived at the same conclusion\u2014that collaboration between mental healthand juvenile justice (and other systems such as child welfare and educationas well) at every level and at every stage is critical to any progress. Theproblem cannot be solved by any single agency\" (Cocozza, 2004:35). Employee Assistance Programs An increasing number of individuals are covered by employee assis- tance programs (EAPs). An estimated 66.5 million employees were enrolledin such programs in 2000\u2014a 245 percent increase since 1994 and a 13percent increase over the year before (Fox et al., 2000). EAPs offered byemployers 13 to their employees (and frequently employees' family mem- bers) vary in structure, types and qualifications of personnel, scope andlength of services provided, location, and relationship to health plans pro-viding M/SU and general health care services to the same employees. Al-though EAPs began as occupational programs to address alcohol-relatedproblems in the workplace, they now typically offer consultation with per-sonnel in identifying and resolving other job performance issues, and pro- 13Other organizations, such as labor organizations, unions, and professional associations, also sponsor EAPs.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 231 vide further assessment, referral, and follow-up services. Additional ser- vices offered include assistance to employees experiencing stressful events,wellness training, assistance with work/life issues, legal assistance, and fi-nancial services. EAPs sometimes have a formal relationship with the M/SUservices offered by a health plan and/or serve as a required gateway toM/SU services (Masi et al., 2004). Thus, an EAP's caseload can includeindividuals with severe M/SU problems and illnesses (Masi, 2004). EAPsare distinct in that their services are typically brief (an average of six coun-seling sessions) and often are provided via telephone or the Internet by aprovider in a different location\u2014perhaps several states away\u2014and withround-the-clock access (Masi, 2004). Linkages with Community and Other Human Services Resources Individuals with M/SU problems and illnesses sometimes require addi- tional services from a variety of community resources, such as self-help andsupport programs for individuals with specific diseases, housing services,income maintenance programs, and employment services, that are essentialto the recovery of many individuals with severe and chronic M/SU illnesses.Appendix C contains a description of an array of such support servicesprovided by the Veterans Health Administration to veterans with severeM/SU illnesses. Discharge planning units or similar staff within inpatient facilities, as well as case management staff within outpatient treatment settings or pro-grams, must assess patients for the need for these services, establish referralarrangements, and coordinate the services with the human service agenciesproviding them. Such coordination of care across inpatient and outpatientproviders is essential to ensure timely access to these services. When dis-charge planning or outpatient care fails to ensure speedy access to theseservices and continuity of care within the community, patients are at riskfor failure to implement their treatment plans, homelessness, incarceration,or other adverse outcomes. Unclear Accountability for Coordination Because patients receive care from multiple providers and delivery sys- tems, there often is an unclear point (or points) of accountability for pa-tients' treatment outcomes. When organizations or providers are reimbursedseparately for the services they provide, each may perceive no responsibilityfor the services delivered by others and, as a result, for any patient out-comes likely to be affected by those services. Unless providers' accountabil-ity for sharing information or collaborating with other providers is explic-itly identified in their agreements with purchasers, they may reasonablyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html232 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS believe that those other providers have primary responsibility for initiating and maintaining ongoing communication and collaboration. Moreover, the concept of collaboration has not been clearly defined (Schmitt, 2001). Thus, when providers do accept responsibility for collabo-rating with other providers, what constitutes \"collaboration\" is left to theirown interpretation based on historical local practice patterns and limita-tions imposed by their current workload. This unclear accountability hasbeen acknowledged and addressed in a conceptual model for coordinatedcare delivery developed by the National Association of State Mental HealthProgram Directors and the National Association of State Alcohol and DrugAbuse Directors. This model articulates a vision of coordinated care involv-ing primary, mental health, substance-use, and other health and humanservice providers who share responsibility for delivering care to the fullpopulation in need of M/SU health care depending upon the predominanceof medical, mental, or substance-use symptoms (SAMHSA, undated). DIFFICULTIES IN INFORMATION SHARING The sharing of patient information across providers treating the same patient so that care can be coordinated is widely acknowledged as necessaryto effective and appropriate care. This need was acknowledged most re-cently in regulations governing the privacy of individually identifiable healthinformation under the authority of the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. HIPAA's implementing regulationsgenerally permit health care organizations to release\u2014without requiringpatient consent\u2014individually identifiable information (except psycho-therapy notes) about the patient to another provider or organization fortreatment purposes. 14 However, the HIPAA regulations are superseded by other federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions that may make it difficult fordifferent providers or treatment organizations to share information. First,HIPAA itself (Section 264 (c)(2)) requires that regulations promulgated toimplement its privacy provisions not supersede any contrary provisions ofstate law that impose more stringent requirements, standards, or implemen-tation specifications pertaining to patient privacy. Each of the 50 states(and the District of Columbia) has a number of statutes governing theconfidentiality of medical records, and specifically governing aspects ofmental health records. Many of these statutes are more stringent than theHIPAA requirements, and the variation among them is great (see AppendixB for a detailed discussion of federal and state laws regarding confidential- 1445 CFR Part 164, Subpart E, \u00a7 164.502.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 233 ity and the release of health care information pertaining to mental and substance-use conditions). Second, regulations implementing HIPAA also permit health care organi- zations to implement their own patient consent policies for the release ofpatient information to other treating providers. 15 As a result, health care organizations may adopt even more stringent privacy protections that requireparticipating providers to adhere to additional procedures before sharingpatient information with other treatment providers or organizations. Moreover, separate federal laws govern the release of information per- taining to an individual's treatment for drug or alcohol use. These laws donot permit sharing of records related to substance-use treatment or rehabili-tation by organizations operated, regulated, or funded by the federal gov-ernment without the patient's consent, except within a program or with anentity with administrative control over the program, between a programand organizations that provide support services such as billing and dataprocessing, or in case of a \"bona fide medical emergency.\" These federallaws are also superseded by any state laws that are more stringent (seeAppendix B). The preamble to the HIPAA privacy regulations also recog-nizes the constraints of the substance-use confidentiality law and states thatwherever one is more protective of privacy than the other, the more restric-tive should govern (65 Fed. Reg. 82462, 82482-82483). The bottom line is that clinicians providing treatment to individuals with M/SU illnesses must comply with multiple sets of rules governing therelease of information: one prescribed federally and pertaining to informa-tion on treatment for alcohol or drug problems, state laws that pertain toinformation on health care for mental and substance-use conditions (de-pending upon whether they are more stringent than the federal rules), andother policies prescribed by the organization or multiple organizations un-der whose auspices patient care is provided. STRUCTURES AND PROCESSES FOR COLLABORATION THAT CAN PROMOTE COORDINATED CARE Because of the complexities described above, strategies to improve co- ordination of care need to be multidimensional (Gilbody et al., 2003; Pincuset al., 2003). A systematic review of studies of organizational and educa-tional interventions to improve the management of depression in primarycare settings found that initiatives with the most multidimensional ap-proaches generally achieved positive results in their primary outcomes(Gilbody et al., 2003). Components of multidimensional strategies to CFR Part 164 Subpart E 164.506(b).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Purchasers and qualityoversight organizations can create incentives for providers to employ thesestrategies through their funding and accountability mechanisms and byexercising leadership within their spheres of influence. Health Care Provider and Organization Strategies Screening Because of the high rates of comorbidity described above\u2014especially among those seeking treatment\u2014screening to detect the presence of co-morbid conditions is a necessary first step in care coordination. Screeningenables a service provider to determine whether an individual with asubstance-use problem or illness shows signs of a mental health problem orillness, and vice versa. If a potential problem is identified, a more detailedassessment is undertaken. Routine screening has been shown to improverates of accurate mental health and substance-use diagnosis (Pignone et al.,2002; Williams et al., 2002). The above-mentioned congressionally mandated study of the preven- tion and treatment of co-occurring substance-use and mental conditions(SAMHSA, undated) identified screening as critical to the successful treat-ment of comorbid conditions. Similarly, because of the high prevalence ofemotional and behavioral problems among children served by child welfareservices, screening has been recommended for children in the child welfaresystem overall (Burns et al., 2004) and especially for those placed in fostercare (American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry and Child Wel-fare League of America, 2003). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Forcealso has recommended two types of screening in primary care settings: Screening for alcohol misuse by adults, including pregnant women, along with behavioral counseling interventions. Screening for depression in adults in clinical practices that have systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, andfollow-up (AHRQ, 2002-2003). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has not addressed the issue of screening for comorbid mental or substance-use conditions among indi-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

To facilitate the adoption of screen- ing and treatment for comorbid mental and substance-use illnesses, the taskforce could include among its recommended guidelines screening for a co-occurring mental or substance-use problem at the time of an individual'sinitial presentation with either condition. As discussed earlier, however, when screening is done, it often is not performed effectively (Friedmann et al., 2000b; Saitz et al., 2002). Effec-tiveness can be increased by use of any of a broad range of available andreliable instruments for screening for mental illnesses and co-occurringsubstance-use problems and illnesses (NIAAA, 2002; Pignone et al., 2002;Williams et al., 2002). An example is the Patient Health Questionnaire, aself-administered instrument designed to screen for depression, anxiety dis-orders, alcohol abuse, and somatiform and eating disorders in primary care(Spitzer et al., 1999). Other very brief, single-question screens have beenevaluated for use in screening for alcohol-use problems (Canagasaby andVinson, 2005). NIAAA has developed a single question (one for menand one for women) for screening for alcohol-use problems in primary careand other settings (NIAAA, 2005). Anticipation of Comorbidity and Formal Determination to Treat or Refer Again because of the high prevalence of co-occurring conditions, espe- cially among individuals seeking treatment, the congressionally mandatedstudy of the prevention and treatment of co-occurring substance-use andmental conditions (SAMHSA, undated) stated that individuals with co-occurring disorders should be the expectation, not the exception, in thesubstance-use and mental health treatment systems. SAMHSA and othershave concluded that substance-use treatment providers should expect andbe prepared to treat patients with mental illnesses, and similarly that mentalhealth care providers should be prepared to treat patients with substantialpast and current drug problems (Havassy et al., 2004; SAMHSA, undated).In its report to Congress, SAMHSA stated that one of the principles foreffective treatment of co-occurring disorders is that \"any door is the rightdoor\"; that is, people with co-occurring disorders should be able to receiveor be referred to appropriate services whenever they enter any agency formental health or substance-use treatment. This same principle is applicable to general health problems and ill- nesses as well. A review of innovative state practices for treating comorbidM/SU conditions found that agency staff expected their clients to present with co-occurring general health problems. They screened and assessed forrelated conditions, including HIV/AIDS, physical and sexual abuse, braindisorders, and physical disabilities. Staff were cross-trained in both mentalhealth and substance-use disciplines (although they did not work outside ofCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The congres- sionally mandated study also stated that with training and other supports,primary care settings can undertake diagnosis and treatment of these inter-related disorders (SAMHSA, undated). Alternatively, use of a systematicapproach to referral to and consultation with a mental health specialist isoften used in model programs for better care (Pincus et al., 2003). Linking Mechanisms to Foster Collaborative Planning and Treatment As discussed at the beginning of this chapter, the simple sharing of information, by itself, is insufficient to achieve care coordination. Carecoordination is the result of collaboration, which exists when the sharing ofinformation is accompanied by joint determination of treatment plans and goals for recovery, as well as the ongoing communication of changes inpatient status and modification of treatment plans. Such collaboration re-quires structures and processes that enable, support, and promote it (IOM,2004a). Not surprisingly, available evidence indicates that referrals alone do not lead to collaboration or coordinated care (Friedmann et al., 2000a).Stronger approaches are needed to establish effective linkages among pri-mary care, specialty mental health and substance-use treatment services,and other care systems that are involved in the delivery of M/SU treatment.These stronger linkage mechanisms vary in form and are theorized to existalong a continuum of efficacy. The extremes range from the ad hoc pur-chase of services from separate providers to on-site programs (see Figure 5-1) (D'Aunno, 1997; Friedmann Linkage mechanisms towardthe right of the continuum are theorized to be stronger because they lowerbarriers or causes of \"friction\" (e.g., problems in identifying willing provid-ers, clients' personal disorganization, and lack of transportation 16) that prevent patients from receiving services. 16These are in addition to the problems in insurance coverage discussed in Chapter 3.FIGURE 5-1 The continuum of linkage mechanisms.

Evidence to date also indicates that some of these approaches are more effective than others.Moreover, their successful implementation requires leadership within anorganization, facilitating structures and processes within treatment settings,and often redesigned professional roles and training in these new roles. Collocation and clinical integration of services Physical proximity of would-be collaborators facilitates collaboration (IOM, 2004a). This pointis exemplified by the multiple studies of mental or substance-use healthcare showing that same-site delivery of both types of care or primary careis more effective in identifying comorbid conditions (Weisner et al., 2001),effectively links clients to the collocated services (Druss et al., 2001; Sametet al., 2001), and can improve treatment outcomes (Unutzer et al., 2001;Weisner et al., 2001). In a 1995 study of a nationally representative sampleof all outpatient drug-use treatment units, same-site delivery of serviceswas more effective than formal arrangements with external providers, re-ferral agreements, or case management in ensuring that patients wouldutilize necessary services (a first step in collaborative care) (Friedmann etal., 2000a). For these reasons, the collocation of multiple services (mental,substance-use, and/or general health) at the same site is a frequently citedfeature of many care collaboration programs. The congressionally man-dated study of prevention and treatment of co-occurring defined, in part,as services delivered \"in one setting.\" The report noted that such integratedtreatment programs can take place in either the mental or substance-usetreatment setting, but require that treatment and service for both condi-tions be delivered by appropriately trained staff \"within the same setting.\" Others have noted the benefits of integrating behavioral health special- ists into primary settings, as well as the reciprocal strategy of includingprimary care providers at locations that deliver care to individuals withsevere mental and substance-use illnesses. This type of collocation facili-tates patient follow-through on a referrals, allows for face-to-face verbalcommunication in addition to or as an alternative to communicating inwriting, and allows for informal sharing of the views of different disciplinesand easy exchange of expertise (Pincus, 2003). Such opportunities for face-to-face communication are important be- cause multiple studies identify effective communication as a key feature ofcollaboration (Baggs and Schmitt, 1988; \"Effective\" communication is described as frequentand timely (Gittell et al., 2000; Shortell et al., 1994), 17 and is characterized 17As well as accurate, understandable, and satisfying.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html238 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS by discussion with contributions by all parties, active listening, openness, a willingness to consider other ideas and ask for opinions, questioning (Baggsand Schmitt, 1997; Shortell et al., 1994), and the free flow of informationamong participants. This type of communication is less easily achievedthrough electronic, mail, and telephone communications. Nonetheless, whenphysical integration of services is not feasible, other efforts to promote effec-tive collaboration (i.e., communication between providers by indirect meanssuch as shared patient records or use of a case manager) may yield benefits. Shared patient records Coordination of care provided by different pro- viders can also be facilitated by shared patient records and documentationpractices that promote interdisciplinary information exchange. Electronichealth records (EHRs) are supported as an important mechanism for shar-ing such information and have been highlighted as one of the essentialcomponents of the developing National Health Information Infrastructure(NHII). EHRs allow (1) the longitudinal collection of electronic informa-tion pertaining to an individual's health and health care; access\u2014by authorized users only\u2014to person- and population-level information; (3) provision of knowledge and decision support to en-hance the quality, safety, and efficiency of patient care; and (4) support forefficient processes of health care delivery (IOM, 2003b). Although still in aminority, hospitals and ambulatory practices are increasingly investing inEHRs; these investments typically are being made by larger facilities, creat-ing what is referred to as the \"adoption gap\" between large and smallorganizations (Brailer and Terasawa, 2003). Although sharing of patientinformation maintained in paper-based records can still take place, thecapture and storage of patient information electronically is endorsed as amore thorough and efficient mechanism for timely access to needed infor-mation by the many providers serving a patient. Case (care) management Case (or care) management refers to varying com- binations of actions performed by a designated individual 18 (i.e., case man- ager) to arrange for, coordinate, and monitor health, psychological, andsocial services important to an individual's recovery from illness and theeffects of these services on the patient's health. Although the services en-compassed by case management often vary by the severity of the illness,the needs of the individual, and the specific model of case management 18We distinguish in this section between case management, provided by an additional resource person working with both the patient and the involved clinicians, and disease man- agement programs . The latter often involve transfer of the overall medical and related health care management of a patient's specific disease to a separate organization or program, fre- quently through a contract. Disease management programs can also offer case management services by an individual as a part of their approach to disease management.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 239 employed (Gilbody et al., 2003; Marshall et al., 2004), typical activities include assessment of the patient's need for supportive services; individualcare planning, referral, and connection of the patient with other necessaryservices and supports; ongoing monitoring of the patients' care plan; advo-cacy; and monitoring of the patient's symptoms. Although systematic reviews of the effectiveness of case management for individuals with serious mental illnesses have been conducted withdifferent review strategies and produced conflicting findings (Marshall etal., 2004; Ziguras and Stuart, 2000) (perhaps in part because of the largenumber of different models of case management [Zwarenstein et al., 2000]),the approach continues to be a common component of many mental healthtreatment services for individuals with other than mild mental illnesses. Asystematic review of studies of organizational and educational interven-tions to improve the management of depression in primary care settingsfound that although most initiatives used multiples strategies, case manage-ment was one of two approaches used most often in projects achievingpositive outcomes and health-related quality of life 19 (Gilbody et al., 2003). More recently, within The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's nationalprogram for depression treatment in primary care, all eight demonstrationsites independently designed their interventions to incorporate case man-agement, often with expanded roles for case managers that include ensuringthat treatment guidelines and protocols are followed and that a depressionregistry is used by clinicians. Case managers also serve as intermediariesbetween patients' primary care providers and mental health specialists(Anonymous, 2004; Rollman et al., 2003). Case management is an essentialelement as well of the MacArthur Foundation's RESPECT\u2014DepressionProject for improving the treatment of depression in primary care, and ofdisease management programs such The John A. Hartford Foundation andCalifornia Health Care Foundation's Project IMPACT program for treatinglate-life depression (Unutzer et al., 2001). Formal agreements with external providers Formal agreements with exter- nal providers also can influence patients' appropriate utilization of neededservices (Friedmann et al., 2000a). Such agreements can include, for ex-ample, a substance-use treatment or mental health organization that con-tracts with a medical group practice to provide physical examinations androutine medical care for its patients. The advantages of this approach are 19In some studies, the case manger role was of low intensity and included follow-up phone calls to monitor medication adherence, providing brief patient education and medicationcounseling, or giving support over the phone. In other programs, nurse case managers took on additional roles that included, for example, ongoing support and monitoring of patient therapy and treatment response according to algorithms.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Specialty consultation with primary care providers is another frequently identified service that can be secured through a formalagreement with an external provider (Pincus et al., 2003). At a minimum,formal agreements with external providers should include not just theagreement to provide the referred service, but also provisions addressinginformation sharing, joint treatment planning, and monitoring of patientoutcomes. Organizational Support for Collaboration Successfully implementing the above strategies for care coordination requires facilitating structures and processes within treatment settings. Col-laboration also often requires changes in the design of work processes attreatment sites, in particular, flexibility in professional roles. Effective lead-ership is an overarching need to help health care providers successfullyadopt, adapt to, and sustain these changes. Facilitating structures and processes at treatment sites Structures and pro- cesses that encourage multidisciplinary providers to come together for jointtreatment planning foster collaboration. For example, in acute, generalinpatient care, there is evidence that using interdisciplinary rounds can beeffective in improving patient care (Curley et al., 1998). Improvement incare can also be achieved by involving primary and mental health careproviders in interdisciplinary team meetings (Druss et al., 2001; Unutzer etal., 2001) at which joint care planning takes place, or by providing casemanagers (see above) to facilitate patient education, monitoring, and com-munication between primary care providers and M/SU specialists (Feldmanet al., 2005). In addition, a number of more general quality improvement strategies, such as medication algorithms, hold the potential to improvecoordination of care by standardizing care processes and creating channelsof communication. For instance, the Texas Medication Algorithm Projectincludes a clinical coordinator to help ensure appropriate coordinationamong clinicians, patients, and family members in promoting adherence tomedication guidelines (Miller et al., 2004; Rush et al., 2003). In a randomized controlled trial of the integration of medical care with mental health services, it was found that same-site location, common chart-ing, enhanced channels of communication (including joint meetings ande-mail), and in-person contact facilitated the development of common goalsand sharing of information between medical and mental health providers.Interdisciplinary team meetings involving primary and behavioral healthcare providers can do the same (Druss et al., 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 241 Heavy workloads can interfere with the formation of collaborative relationships. Collaboration requires that staff have the time to participatein such activities as interdisciplinary team meetings (Baggs and Schmitt,1997). Illustrating this point, additional staff resources and reduced caseloadwere identified as two of several components of success in a randomizedcontrolled trial of collocating and integrating medical care with mentalhealth care (Druss et al., 2001). When staff are overwhelmed with caregivingresponsibilities, they may not take the time to collaborate. Yet while unilat-eral decision making is easier in the short run, collaborative relationshipsare viewed as saving time in the long run (Baggs and Schmitt, 1997). The committee also calls attention to the Chronic Care Model, used to improve the health care of individuals with chronic illnesses in primary caresettings. This model has six components: (1) providing chronic illness self-management support to patients and their families (see Chapter 3); (2)redesigning care delivery structures and operations; (3) linking patients andtheir care with community resources to support their management of theirillness (described above); (4) providing decision support to clinicians (seeChapter 4); (5) using computerized clinical information systems to supportcompliance with treatment protocols and monitor patient health indica-tors (see Chapter 6); and (6) aligning the health care organization's (orprovider's) structures, goals, and values to support chronic care (discussedbelow) (Bodenheimer et al., 2002). The Chronic Care Model has beenapplied successfully to the treatment of a wide variety of general chronicillnesses, such as diabetes, asthma, and heart failure (The National Coali-tion on Health Care and The Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2002),as well as to common mental illnesses such as depression (Badamgarev etal., 2003), and has been theorized to have the potential for improving thequality of care for persons with other M/SU illnesses (Watkins et al., 2003). The Chronic Care Model also emphasizes the use of certain organiza- tional structures and processes, including interdisciplinary practices in whicha clear division of the roles and responsibilities of the various team mem-bers fosters their collaboration. Instituting such arrangements may necessi-tate new roles and divisions of labor among clinicians with differing train-ing and expertise. In the Chronic Care Model, for example, physician teammembers are often responsible for the treatment of patients with acuteconditions, intervene in stubbornly difficult chronic care problems, andtrain other team members. Nonphysician personnel support patients in theself-management of their illnesses and arrange for routine periodic healthmonitoring and follow-up. Providing chronic care consistent with this modelrequires support from health care organizations, health plans, purchasers,insurers, and other providers. Elements of the Chronic Care Model havebeen implemented in a variety of care settings, including private generalmedical practices, integrated delivery systems, and a community healthCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html242 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS center for general health care (Bodenheimer et al., 2002). The committee believes this model should be developed for use in the care of individualswith chronic M/SU illnesses as a mechanism for improving coordination ofcare, as well as other dimensions of quality. Flexibility in professional roles As seen in the Chronic Care Model, col- laboration sometimes requires revision in professional roles, including theshifting of roles among health care professionals and the expansion of rolesto include new tasks (Gilbody et al., 2003; Katon et al., 2001). It also oftenrequires participating as part of an interdisciplinary team with certain pre-scribed roles (Unutzer et al., 2001). Research findings and other empiricalevidence show that health care workers of all types are capable of perform-ing new tasks necessitated by advances in therapeutics, shortages in thehealth care workforce, and the pressures of cost containment. For example,the development of safer and more effective medications for mental andsubstance-use illnesses (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) hasenabled the treatment of depression by primary care clinicians. Other medi-cations, such as buprenorphine, may do the same. Other developmentsthat are likely to require redefinition of professional roles include the useof peer support personnel (described in Chapter 3) and the delivery ofmore M/SU health care in primary care settings and by primary care pro-viders (Strosahl, 2005). However, new communication patterns and changes in roles, especially functioning as part of an interdisciplinary team, can at times be uncomfort-able for health professionals. Role confusion and conflict are a frequent barrier to interdisciplinary collaboration (Rice, 2000). As a result, it may be necessary to provide training and development in collaborative practicebehaviors, such as effective communication and conflict resolution (Dischet al., 2001; Strosahl, 2005). Collaboration is enhanced by a shared under- standing of agreed-upon collective goals and new individual roles (Gittell etal., 2000). Leadership Leadership is well known to be a critical factor in the success of any major change initiative or quality improvement effort (BaldridgeNational Quality Program, 2003; Davenport et al., 1998) and an essentialfeature of successful programs in care coordination (NASMHPD, NASADAD,2002). Effective leadership in part models the behaviors that are expectedat the clinical care level. For example, in The Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation's Initiative on Depression in Primary Care , leadership was one of six component interventions to overcome barriers to the delivery ofeffective care for depression in primary care settings. Teams of primarycare, mental health, and senior administrative personnel were responsiblefor securing needed resources, representing stakeholder interests, promot-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Such activities ensure that the structuresand processes that enable and nurture collaboration are in place at thelocus of care. Practices of Purchasers, Quality Oversight Organizations, and Public Policy Leaders Clinicians and health care organizations will not be able to achieve full coordination of patient care without complementary and supporting activi-ties on the part of federal and state governments, health care purchasers,quality oversight organizations, and other organizations that shape theenvironment in which clinical care is delivered. As noted earlier, care co-ordination has been identified by the IOM as one of 20 priority areasdeserving immediate attention by all participants in the American healthcare system. Health care purchasers, quality oversight organizations, andpublic policy leaders can help give care coordination this immediate atten-tion by (1) clarifying their expectations for information sharing, collabora-tion, and coordination in their purchasing agreements; (2) including thecare coordination practices recommended above in their quality oversightstandards and purchasing criteria; and (3) modeling collaborative practicesacross health care for general, mental, and substance-use health conditionsin their policy-making and operational activities. Purchaser Practices Purchasers can stimulate and incentivize better coordination of care among general, mental, and substance-use health care by including carecoordination as one of the quality-of-care parameters used to evaluateproposals and award contracts for the delivery of general, specialty M/SU,and comprehensive (general and M/SU) health care (see Chapter 8). Insoliciting health plans and providers to deliver these health care services,purchasers can ask bidders to specify what care coordination practices theyrequire of their clinicians, and how the organization supports clinicians andmeasures care coordination. When awarding contracts, purchasers canclarify in contracts with health care plans their expectations for informa-tion sharing, collaboration, and coordination. In addition, purchasersshould allow primary care providers to bill for the M/SU treatment servicesthey provide, a practice now under way in some MBHO settings (Feldmanet al., 2005). Doing so will allow consumers and their primary care provid-ers to determine jointly, as they do for other medical conditions, whenspecialty consultation and care are appropriate; enable coordination of careCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Quality Oversight Practices Many purchasers delegate their attention to care coordination and other quality-related issues by accepting the quality-of-care determinations madeby expert quality oversight organizations, such as accrediting bodies. Fourmain organizations accredit M/SU health care organizations (and some-times individual providers). The National Committee for Quality Assur-ance (NCQA) accredits managed care organizations, MBHOs, and diseasemanagement programs and recognizes physician practices through otheroversight programs. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of HealthcareOrganizations (JCAHO) accredits hospitals and specialty behavioral healthcare organizations. The Commission on Accreditation of RehabilitationFacilities accredits a wide variety of behavioral health programs and ser-vices. Finally, the Council on Accreditation for Children and Family Ser-vices, Inc. accredits a wide variety of counseling and other M/SU programsand services, as well as EAPs. These accrediting bodies generally performtheir quality oversight activities either through review of an organization'sstructures and operational practices or through measurement of anorganization's or provider's clinical care processes and outcomes. Clinicalcare processes and outcomes are generally evaluated through performancemeasures (discussed in Chapter 4). Organizational structures and processessuch as the linking strategies recommended above are typically reviewedthrough evaluation of compliance with the established structural and pro-cedural standards that make up an organization's accreditation standards. Although the accreditation standards of each of the above four organi- zations address care coordination and collaboration to some extent (CARF,2005; COA, 2001; JCAHO, 2004; NCQA, 2004), accreditation standardsfor care coordination could be improved. For example, NCQA's MBHOaccreditation standards address care coordination between M/SU and gen-eral health care in Standard QI 10, \"Continuity and Coordination betweenBehavioral Health and Medical Care,\" which states (NCQA, 2004:91): The organization collaborates with relevant medical delivery systems or primary care physicians to monitor and improve coordination between behavioral health and medical care. However, the following note is appended to this standard:Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 245 Note: If the organization does not have any formal relationship with the medical delivery system through contracts, delegation, or otherwise, NCQA considers this standard NA. (NCQA, 2004:91). NCQA's customersupport line clarifies that \"NA\" means \"Not Applicable.\" 20 Collaboration and Coordination in Policy Making and Programming Throughout this report, the committee emphasizes the need for col- laboration and coordination in mental, substance-use, and general healthcare policy making and programming that parallels desired collaborationand coordination at the care delivery level\u2014for example, in the dissemina-tion of information on innovations in new treatments (see Chapter 4), inthe measurement of the quality of M/SU care (see Chapter 4), and in thedevelopment of information technology for M/SU care (see Chapter 6).Such attention to coordination and collaboration at the policy and pro-gramming represents an opportunity for federal, state, and local officials tomodel and promote the coordination and collaboration needed at the clini-cal level\u2014across M/SU health care and across providers of these specialtyhealth care services and general health care. The importance of seizing thisopportunity is emphasized in the IOM report Leadership by Example: Coordinating Government Roles in Improving Health Care Quality . That report, commissioned by Congress to examine and recommend qualityimprovement activities in six major federal programs, 21 concluded that the federal government must assume a strong leadership role in qualityimprovement: By exercising its roles as purchaser, regulator, provider of health services, and sponsor of applied health services research, the federal governmenthas the necessary influence to direct the attention and resources of the health care sector in pursuit of quality. There is no other stakeholder with such a combination of roles and influence. (IOM, 2002: x) Because coordination of care is one dimension of quality, the federal government needs to exercise leadership and model coordination and col-laboration in general, mental, and substance-use health care. This coordi-nation and collaboration should be practiced across the separate Centers 20Conversation with NCQA Customer Support on July 22, 2005. 21Even this initiative represents a missed opportunity for collaboration and coordination. Congress charged the IOM with examining the roles of Medicare, Medicaid, the IndianHealth Service, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Department of Defense's TRICARE program, and the program of the Veterans Health Administration in enhancing health care quality, but not the role of federal M/SU programs administered by SAMHSA.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html246 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Center for Mental Health Services within SAMHSA, across SAMHSA and other operatingdivisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), acrossDHHS and other departments, and across the public and private sectors. A strong example of such leadership in coordination and collaboration is found in the federal action agenda, Transforming Mental Health Care in America, formulated to implement the recommendations of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. This action agenda is thecollaborative product of 12 DHHS agencies (the Administration on Aging,Administration for Children and Families, Agency for Healthcare Researchand Quality, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medi-care and Medicaid Services, Health Resources and Services Administration,Indian Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Office for Disability,Office for Civil Rights, Office of Public Health and Science, and SAMHSA),five other departments (Education, Housing and Urban Development, Jus-tice, Labor, and Veterans Affairs), and the Social Security Administration.To guide the implementation of this agenda, DHHS is leading an intra- andinteragency Federal Executive Steering Committee composed of high-levelrepresentatives from DHHS agencies and other federal departments thatserve individuals with mental illnesses (SAMHSA, 2005). This strong modelof collaboration and coordination could be strengthened by including onthe action agenda items addressing the substance-use problems and illnessesthat so frequently accompany mental illnesses, and by including more ex-plicitly in implementation activities the SAMHSA centers and state agenciesresponsible for planning and arranging for care for co-occurring substance-use illnesses. Similarly engaging key private-sector entities, especially thosein the general health sector who deliver much care for mental illnesses,would strengthen this collaborative approach and help break down theseparations discussed earlier in this chapter between mental and substance-use illnesses, between specialty M/SU and general health care, and betweenthe public and private sectors. New Mexico provides one example of processes now under way to achieve such coordination and collaboration at the state level (see Box 5-1).While the fruits of this initiative are not yet known, these efforts are testi-mony to the critical need for such coordination and collaboration at thepolicy level and the importance of high-level leadership in meeting thisneed.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 247 BOX 5-1 New Mexico's Behavioral Health Collaborative: A Case Study in Policy Coordination In 2003 the Governor of New Mexico identified as a major policy issue the fact that New Mexico's behavioral health system (like others across the United States) re-flected the problems cited in the report of the President's New Freedom Commis- sion: insufficient and inappropriate services, uneven access and quality, failure to maximize resources across funding streams, duplication of effort, higher adminis-trative costs for providers, and overall fragmentation that makes service systems difficult to access and manage effectively. After consultation with key cabinet sec- retaries, the governor announced a new approach to address these problemsthrough the creation of a high-level policy collaborative. This executive-level body was charged specifically with achieving better access, better services, and better value for taxpayer dollars in mental and substance-use health care. This group, consisting of 17 members including the heads of 15 agencies, was established in law by the New Mexico legislature effective May 2004 and charged with creating a single behavioral health (mental and substance-usetreatment) delivery system across multiple state agencies and funding sources. The vision that guided this effort, based on months of public participation, was that this single system must support recovery and resiliency so that consumerscan participate fully in the life of their communities. The agencies forming the collaborative reflected these broad goals and included those responsible for such areas as housing, corrections, labor, and education, as well as primary healthand human services agencies. To ensure that this broad perspective would be reflected in the collaborative's actions, the group decided that decisions would be made whenever feasible byconsensus, but that if votes were required, each agency would have a single vote regardless of its budget or size. The group is cochaired by the secretary of Human Services and (in alternating years) the secretary of Children, Youth, and Familiesor the secretary of Health. Such a broad policy vision clearly also required that the collaborative develop coordinated structures for the efficient management of a broad range of funds and services. Therefore, a request for proposals was issued,and a contractor was selected as the single statewide entity to manage approxi- mately $350,000,000 in cross-agency funds for the first phase of the change pro- cess. In addition, the collaborative has formed senior-level coordination teams,including one focused specifically on cross-cutting policy issues. A single Behav- ioral Health Planning Council has also been established to form an ongoing part- nership with consumers, families, providers, and state agencies in keeping thesystem on track. In addition, local collaboratives are being formed with cross- agency state assistance across all of the state's 13 judicial districts, as well as in its Native American communities, to ensure strong feedback and coordination in-volving stakeholders at the local level as a guide for collaborative state policies and actions. The overall transformation also is being carefully evaluated by multi- ple groups to help guide future work of this broad policy nature.

Recommendation 5-1. To make collaboration and coordination of pa- tients' M/SU health care services the norm, providers of the servicesshould establish clinically effective linkages within their own organiza-tions and between providers of mental health and substance-use treat-ment. The necessary communications and interactions should take placewith the patient's knowledge and consent and be fostered by: Routine sharing of information on patients' problems and phar- macologic and nonpharmacologic treatments among providers ofM/SU treatment. Valid, age-appropriate screening of patients for comorbid mental, substance-use, and general medical problems in these clinical set-tings and reliable monitoring of their progress. Recommendation 5-2. To facilitate the delivery of coordinated care by primary care, mental health, and substance-use treatment providers,government agencies, purchasers, health plans, and accreditation orga-nizations should implement policies and incentives to continually in-crease collaboration among these providers to achieve evidence-basedscreening and care of their patients with general, mental, and/orsubstance-use health conditions. The following specific measures shouldbe undertaken to carry out this recommendation: Primary care and specialty M/SU health care providers should transition along a continuum of evidence-based coordinationmodels from (1) formal agreements among mental, substance-use,and primary health care providers; to (2) case management ofmental, substance-use, and primary health care; to (3) collocationof mental, substance-use, and primary health care services; andthen to (4) delivery of mental, substance-use, and primary healthcare through clinically integrated practices of primary and M/SUcare providers. Organizations should adopt models to which theycan most easily transition from their current structure, that bestmeet the needs of their patient populations, and that ensureaccountability.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlCOORDINATING CARE 249 DHHS should fund demonstration programs to offer incentives for the transition of multiple primary care and M/SU practicesalong this continuum of coordination models. Purchasers should modify policies and practices that preclude pay- ing for evidence-based screening, treatment, and coordination ofM/SU care and require (with patients' knowledge and consent) allhealth care organizations with which they contract to ensure ap-propriate sharing of clinical information essential for coordina-tion of care with other providers treating their patients. Organizations that accredit mental, substance-use, or primary health care organizations should use accrediting practices that as-sess, for all providers, the use of evidence-based approaches tocoordinating mental, substance-use, and primary health care. Federal and state governments should revise laws, regulations, and administrative practices that create inappropriate barriers to thecommunication of information between providers of health carefor mental and substance-use conditions and between those pro-viders and providers of general care. With respect to the need for purchasers to modify practices that pre- clude paying for evidence-based screening, treatment, and coordination ofhealth care for mental and substance-use conditions, the committee callsparticular attention to practices that prevent primary care providers fromreceiving payment for delivery of the M/SU health services they provide andthe failure of some benefit plans to cover certain evidence-based treatments. Recommendation 5-3. To ensure the health of persons for whom they are responsible, M/SU providers should: Coordinate their services with those of other human services and education agencies, such as schools, housing and vocational re-habilitation agencies, and providers of services for older adults. Establish referral arrangements for needed services. Providers of services to high-risk populations\u2014such as child welfare agencies, criminal and juvenile justice agencies, and long-term carefacilities for older adults\u2014should use valid, age-appropriate, and cul-turally appropriate techniques to screen all entrants into their systemsto detect M/SU problems and illnesses. Recommendation 5-4. To provide leadership in coordination, DHHS should create a high-level, continuing entity reporting directly to thesecretary to improve collaboration and coordination across its mental,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

DHHS also should implement performance measures to monitorits progress toward achieving internal interagency collaboration andpublicly report its performance on these measures annually. State gov-ernments should create analogous linkages across state agencies. With respect to recommendation 5-4, the committee notes that this recommendation echoes the call made in the report Leadership by Ex- ample: Coordinating Government Roles in Improving Health Care Qualityfor Congress to consider directing the Secretary of DHHS to produce anannual progress report \"detailing the collaborative and individual efforts ofthe various government programs to redesign their quality enhancementprocesses\" (IOM, 2002:11).

To meet this need, majorpublic- and private-sector collaborations are under way to developthree essential components of a National Health InformationInfrastructure (NHII): (1) electronic health record (EHR) 1 systems with decision support for clinicians, (2) a secure platform for theexchange of patient information across health care settings, and(3) data standards that will make shared information understandableto all users (IOM, 2004). Efforts also are under way in thepublic sector to create information systems for mental and substance-use health care. Ensuring that the developing NHII serves consumersof health care for mental and/or substance use (M/SU) conditionsas well as it does those with general health care needs is essentialto improving the quality of M/SU health care. However, M/SU health care currently is not well addressed by NHII initiatives, nor are separate public-sector efforts aimed 1EHRs have a variety of names, including automated medical record, computer-based pa- tient record, electronic medical record, electronic patient record, and others (Brailer and Terasawa, 2003).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html260 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS at creating information systems for M/SU health care well coordinated with NHII initiatives. M/SU health care also lags behind generalhealth care in its use of information technology (IT). To realizethe potential of the NHII for consumers of M/SU health care,NHII initiatives and public-sector efforts to develop specializedinformation systems for M/SU health care need to take advantageof each other's expertise and capabilities. Doing so will ensurethat the NHII provides relevant information to M/SU health careconsumers, providers, payers, and oversight organizations, andthat providers serving in both the public and private sectors donot face redundant or conflicting information demands. The committeerecommends actions to (1) coordinate the activities of the NHIIand public-sector M/SU IT initiatives, (2) bring M/SU expertiseto the development of the NHII, and (3) support individualM/SU clinicians in their use of IT. A STRONG INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS VITAL TO QUALITY Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001) and several preceding and subsequent reports from the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the federal gov-ernment, and leading private-sector organizations (IOM, 2004; NationalCommittee on Vital and Health Statistics, 2001; Thompson and Brailer,2004) emphasize the vital role of information technology (IT) in the safety,effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity ofhealth care. These organizations and many others find that a strong ITinfrastructure is crucial to: Supporting consumers in illness self-management and marketplace choices. Supporting providers in the delivery of evidence-based clinical care. Coordinating care across clinicians, settings, and time. Facilitating performance and outcome measurement. Educating clinicians. An example of the role of IT in achieving improved quality of care is presented in Box 6-1. In addition to its uses in coordinating care, IT has begun to be used to support the delivery of treatment for mental and substance-use conditions\u2014over the World Wide Web, by e-mail, and through other technology-mediated interactions (Flanagan and Needham, 2003) (see Chapter 7).

He lived with his parents until they died 2 years ago and has since lived with his brother Sam and Sam's family. Hehas not worked recently, but he volunteers at a local library and lives off his military pension. Recently he enrolled in EQUIP, a project aimed at improving care for people with schizophrenia by applying illness management principles effective intreating other chronic illnesses. EQUIP uses the VA's electronic health record (EHR) enhanced by an information system that supports management of care, structured psychiatric evaluations, and secure messaging between clinicians. As aresult, Mark's treatment team was alerted to several emerging problems that might have been missed with the old paper chart system. The old paper charts included handwritten notes that were sometimes illegible and typically did not include useful psychiatric assessment data. The charts often arrived after a scheduled appointment, or not at all, and whether Mark had sched- uled or kept medical appointments was unknown to his treatment team. With theenhanced EHR, Mark's psychiatrist was able to review Mark's full, up-to-date record, including the team nurse's routine assessments of Mark's symptoms and other problems. These assessments indicated chronic medical problems, includ-ing diabetes, a heart problem, a possible seizure disorder, obesity, and smoking. Several problems needing immediate attention were highlighted. With the EHR and information system, the team received a list of previously scheduled and upcoming appointments. It was clear that Mark had missed multiple visits and was at risk for severe medical complications. The information system also indicated serious problems at home. With the previous paper charts, contactinformation and Mark's preferences regarding family contact were not docu- mented. Now, this information was easily at hand, and his brother was called. He told the team that Mark was having daytime sleepiness that led to his missedappointments and that Mark was awake late at night, disturbing the family, and overeating. Most disturbing was that he was irritable and combative when con- fronted by Sam about these problems. Sam wanted to help Mark and had prom-ised their parents to care for him. But he did not know what to do. Previously, communication among the team took place only when someone remembered to bring a patient up at the weekly team meeting. Now, team mem-bers received a regular report on the clinical status of each of the patients under their care. They used a secure electronic messaging system to discuss Mark's problems. The team implemented a comprehensive behavioral program address-ing sleep scheduling, caloric intake, exercise, and missed visits. Clinicians used the messaging system to update each other and ensure that their advice and in- structions to Mark were consistent at each visit. The computer screen displayedupdated messages when each clinician looked at Mark's medical record. A clini- cian also reviewed a weekly EQUIP-automated appointment report and used it to remind the family about upcoming appointments. Mark began making it to his appointments regularly. Sam was included in med- ication change decisions. He ensured that the new medications were taken cor- rectly and reported any changes to the team. With time, Mark began to express aninterest in living more independently and working for pay. By the end of the project, (continued on next page)Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001:165) found that IT \"must play a central role in the design ofhealth care systems if a substantial improvement in health care quality is tobe achieved\" and recommended that: Congress, the executive branch, leaders of health care organizations, pub- lic and private purchasers, and health informatics associations and ven-dors should make a renewed national commitment to building an infor- mation infrastructure to support health care delivery, consumer health, quality measurement and improvement, public accountability, clinical andhealth services research, and clinical education. This commitment should lead to the elimination of most handwritten clinical data by the end of the decade. The remaining sections of this chapter address (1) activities under way to build the National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII), (2) theneed for attention to mental and/or substance-use (M/SU) conditions in theNHII, (3) health information infrastructure and technologies under devel-opment for M/SU health care in the public sector, (4) issues affecting theadoption of IT by individual M/SU clinicians, and (5) recommendations forintegrating health care for M/SU conditions into the NHII. ACTIVITIES UNDER WAY TO BUILD A NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE Strong commitment has emerged in both the public and private sectors to working together to develop an NHII for the United States. The NHIIwill consist of (1) electronic health record (EHR) systems with decisionsupport for clinicians, (2) a secure platform for the exchange of patientinformation across health care settings, and (3) data standards that willmake shared information understandable to all users (IOM, 2004).he had moved to a residential group home, developed a better relationship with his family, improved his sleep habits, lost 10 pounds, and cut down his smoking.

All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlTHE NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE 263 There also is consensus that although creating the NHII requires a partnership of public- and private-sector leaders, the federal governmentneeds to play a leadership role in several ways, including promulgatingcertain data and other IT standards (IOM, 2004; Thompson and Brailer,2004). The federal government also needs to provide financial support inthree main areas. First, federal funds should support the development ofcritical components of the NHII that are unlikely to receive support fromprivate-sector stakeholders. These include the establishment of a secureplatform for the exchange of data across all providers and maintenance ofa process for ongoing promulgation of national data standards. Second, thefederal government should provide financial incentives to stimulate private-sector investment in EHR systems through the use of special loans, paymentincentives to providers, or other mechanisms. Finally, federal funding ofsafety net providers is needed to support their adoption of IT (IOM, 2004). Development of the NHII is expected to take many years, perhaps as long as a decade (Thompson and Brailer, 2004). 2 To jump-start the process, in 2004 the President established the Office of the National Coordinatorfor Health Information Technology (ONCHIT), charged with the follow-ing (DHHS, 2005b): Serving as the senior advisor to the President and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) on allhealth IT programs and initiatives. Developing and maintaining a strategic plan to guide the nation- wide implementation of interoperable EHRs in both the public andprivate health care sectors. Coordinating the spending of approximately $4 billion for health IT programs and initiatives across the federal government. Coordinating all outreach activities to private industry and serving as the catalyst for health industry change. Three months later, ONCHIT's National Coordinator put forth a framework for strategic action, The Decade of Health Information Tech- nology: Delivering Consumer-centric and Information-rich Health Care , which included a 10-year plan to develop the NHII in partnership with theprivate sector. This plan addresses the development of EHRs, data stan-dards, and interoperable technologies for the exchange of patient dataacross providers and settings of care (Thompson and Brailer, 2004). 2In this regard, the NHII is not unlike other ground-breaking health care initiatives, such as the mapping of the human genome.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html264 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Subsequently, in June 2005, DHHS announced the establishment of the American Health Information Community (AHIC), a commission of mem-bers from the public and private sectors, to advise the Secretary concerningefforts to develop IT standards and achieve interoperability for health IT. Inparticular, the AHIC is expected to develop recommendations for thefollowing: Protecting health information through appropriate privacy and secu- rity practices. Achieving ongoing harmony of industrywide health IT standards. Achieving a nationwide, Internet-based health information network that includes information tools, specialized network functions, andsecurity protections for interoperable exchange of health information. Accelerating the adoption of interoperable EHRs across the broad spectrum of health care providers. Developing compliance certification and inspection processes for EHRs, including the infrastructure components through whichEHRs can interoperate. Identifying health IT standards for use by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in an information processingstandards-setting process relevant to federal agencies.

Electronic Health Records 3 An EHR system encompasses (1) the longitudinal collection of elec- tronic information pertaining to an individual's health and health immediate electronic access\u2014by authorized users only\u2014to person- andpopulation-level information; (3) provision of knowledge and decision sup-port to enhance the quality, safety, and efficiency of patient care; and(4) support for efficient processes of health care delivery (IOM, 2003). As noted in Chapter 5, although still a minority, increasing numbers of hospitals and ambulatory practices are investing in EHRs, although this 3In addition to the development of EHRs, architects of the NHII are calling for the estab- lishment of personal health records (PHRs)\u2014an electronic, lifelong resource of health infor- mation needed by consumers to make health decisions. Consumers/patients own and manage the information in their PHR, which comes from health care providers and the patient. ThePHR is maintained in a secure and private environment, with the patient determining who has the right to access it. The PHR does not replace the legal record of any provider (AHIMA e-HIM Personal Health Record Work Group, 2005).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Many hospitals have made progress in adopting certainEHR components, such as automated laboratory results. Use of EHRs ishigher in ambulatory settings\u2014approximately 5 to 10 percent of physicianoffices\u2014but there is much variation in their content and functionality (IOM,2004). The federal strategic framework identifies the total cost of EHRs(purchase price + implementation costs + maintenance costs + impact onoperations) as the primary impediment to their more widespread adoption(Thompson and Brailer, 2004). The federal government's NHII strategic framework calls for the adop- tion of interoperable EHRs within 10 years (Thompson and Brailer, 2004).Several activities are under way to help achieve this goal. The IOM hasprovided a framework that should prove useful to accreditation organiza-tions in establishing standards for EHR systems, as well as to providers inselecting vendors to design such systems (IOM, 2004). Standards for EHRsare under development by Health Level 7, the leading private-sectorstandards-setting organization (Thompson and Brailer, 2004). Three lead-ing associations in health care information management and technology\u2014the American Health Information Management Association, the HealthcareInformation and Management Systems Society, and the National Alliancefor Health Information Technology\u2014have jointly launched the Certifica-tion Commission for Healthcare Information Technology to create a mecha-nism for the certification of health care information technology products, inparticular EHRs (CCHIT, 2004). The Veterans Health Administration has used an EHR system (VistA) for over two decades for its physicians, clinics, and hospitals. VistA is in thepublic domain, and in September 2005 Medicare released an evaluationversion of the system (Vista-Office) for use by private physicians' offices incomputerizing their medical practices. This evaluation version will be as-sessed to determine the extent to which physician offices can implement thesoftware effectively. The evaluation phase will also allow software vendorsto improve upon the system and develop a version that meets any standardsfor EHRs (CMS, 2005). Medicare will provide doctors with lists of compa-nies that have been trained to install and maintain the system. Because somany doctors participate in Medicare, the distribution of Vista-Office isviewed as a significant development in the advancement of EHRs (Kolata,2005). Data Standards In addition to cost factors, efforts of both the public and private sectors to invest in IT are hampered by the lack of nationwide standards for theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In particular, standards are needed in three areas: Terminologies \u2014the terms and concepts used to describe, classify, and code health care data and the processes that describe the relationshipsamong the terms and concepts (see the discussion of needed improvementsto coding for M/SU health care in Chapter 4). Data interchange \u2014standard formats for electronically encoding health care data elements and structuring the data elements as they areexchanged, and information models that define the relationships amongdata elements. Several standards for electronic data interchange have beenendorsed by the Secretary of DHHS, including those for the exchange ofclinical and administrative data. However, there remains a need to updatethese standards and create implementation guides, tests for conformance,and certification procedures to ensure that the standards actually work andare being used as intended (IOM, 2004). Knowledge representation \u2014methods for electronically represent- ing health care literature, clinical guidelines, and similar sources of infor-mation for decision support so that they can be called upon automaticallyfor the practitioner in response to triggers embedded in the EHR or otherelectronic clinical or administrative document (IOM, 2004). Standardizing these data and processes requires not just a one-time effort, but an ongoing, permanent process for updating the standards asscientific knowledge, clinical practices, and information needs change. InOctober 2001, the federal government established the Consolidated HealthInformatics interagency initiative to adopt interoperability data standardsfor federally operated and funded health care providers. Given that thefederal government represents more than 40 percent of health care expendi-tures in the United States, this action is viewed as a powerful means ofestablishing such standards nationally across the public and private healthcare sectors (IOM, 2004). As of May 2004, the Consolidated HealthInformatics initiative had approved 20 standards for adoption by the fed-eral Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Ser-vices, State, Education, Energy, and Justice, as well as the Social SecurityAdministration, General Services Administration, Office of Managementand Budget, and Environmental Protection Agency (Anonymous, 2004). In response to a request from the federal government to undertake a study of standards for health care safety reporting systems, the IOM(2004:12) made the following recommendation: Congress should provide clear direction, enabling authority, and financial support for the establishment of national standards for data that supportCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Various government agencies will need to assume major new responsibilities, and additional support will be required. Specifically: The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) should be given the lead role in establishing and maintaining a public- private partnership for the promulgation of standards for data that support patient safety. The Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) initiative, in collabo- ration with the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS), should identify data standards appropriate for nationaladoption and gaps in existing standards that need to be addressed. The membership of NCVHS should continue to be broad and di- verse, with adequate representation of all stakeholders, includingconsumers, state governments, professional groups, and standard- setting bodies. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in col- laboration with the National Library of Medicine and others should (1) provide administrative and technical support for the CHI and NCVHS efforts; (2) ensure the development of imple-mentation guides, certification procedures, and conformance test- ing for all data standards; (3) provide financial support and over- sight for developmental activities to fill gaps in data standards;and (4) coordinate activities and maintain a clearinghouse of in- formation in support of national data standards and their imple- mentation to improve patient safety. The National Library of Medicine should be designated as the responsible entity for distributing all national clinical terminolo- gies that relate to patient safety and for ensuring the quality ofterminology mappings. The IOM also recommended that, after allowing a reasonable time for health care organizations to comply with national standards identified bythe Consolidated Health Informatics initiative, the major government healthcare programs, including those operated by DHHS, the Veterans Adminis-tration, and the Department of Defense, should immediately incorporatethese data standards into their contractual and regulatory requirements(e.g., Medicare conditions of participation). A Secure Interoperable Platform for Exchange of Patient Information Across Health Care Settings Sharing patient data across providers and settings of care requires an interoperable infrastructure to provide clinicians with access to criticalhealth care information at the time of care delivery. To meet this need, thestrategic framework for the NHII calls for (1) fostering of regional collabo-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Several initiatives are now under way to develop regional collabora- tions for the creation of this interoperable infrastructure. First, the HealthResources and Services Administration (HRSA) has a cooperative agree-ment with the Foundation for eHealth Initiative to administer the Connect-ing Communities for Better Health program. The $2.3 million programprovides seed funding and support to multistakeholder collaboratives withincommunities (both geographic and nongeographic) for the implementationof health information exchanges, including the formation of regional healthinformation organizations (Thompson and Brailer, 2004). Second, inOctober 2004, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)awarded $139 million in grants and contracts to promote the use of healthinformation technology through the development of networks for sharingclinical data, as well as to support projects for planning, implementing, anddemonstrating the value of IT (AHRQ, 2004). Finally, Connecting forHealth, a public-private collaborative of more than 100 diverse organiza-tions, has launched a prototype electronic national health information ex-change based on common, open standards that will allow authorized usersof three very different health information networks located in California,Massachusetts, and Indiana to share health information both within andamong their local regions and communities. Teams in Mendocino, Boston,and Indianapolis will work with one another and with Connecting forHealth to launch prototype networks that will connect the diverse tech-nologies within each region's health network and accommodate the differ-ing social and economic profiles of the various communities (Markle Foun-dation, 2005). In general, however, the committee finds that information needs per- taining to health care for M/SU conditions have not been well addressed inthese initiatives. NEED FOR ATTENTION TO MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS IN THE NHII There is evidence that health care for M/SU conditions could be better addressed in the many efforts under way to develop the NHII. For example,in the \"comprehensive catalogue of identifiable federal health informationtechnology programs\" included in the framework for strategic action sub-mitted to the President by the National Coordinator for Health Informa-tion Technology, the listing of IT initiatives by DHHS agencies identifiesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlTHE NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE 269 those of AHRQ, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health(NIH), the Indian Health Service (IHS), HRSA, and the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC), among others. There is no listing for theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)and its IT initiatives (Thompson and Brailer, 2004). A subsequent July2005 update still contained no listing of SAMHSA's IT initiatives(ONCHIT, 2005). Moreover, although SAMHSA is listed as a partner inthe federal government's Consolidated Health Informatics initiative, it isnot listed as a member of any of the work groups consisting of staff frommany federal agencies, including CMS, ARHQ, IHS, CDC, NIH, the De-partment of Defense, the National Library of Medicine, the National Aero-nautics and Space Administration, the Social Security Administration, theEnvironmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Agency for International Devel-opment, and the National Center for Health Statistics, that have establishedvocabularies and standards for demographic, diagnosis and problem list,encounter, medication, interventions and procedures, billing, and othertypes of data (OMB, undated). In addition, health care for M/SU conditions was not strongly repre- sented among either the applicants or awardees in AHRQ's 2004 awards of$139 million in grants and contracts to promote the use of health IT throughthe development of networks for sharing clinical data, as well as to supportprojects for planning, implementing, and demonstrating the value of IT. Ofthe nearly 600 applications for funding, only \"a handful\" had any sub-stantial behavioral health content, and of the 103 grants awarded, only1specifically targeted M/SU health care. 4 Finally, leaders of SAMHSA's predominantly public-sector Mental Health Statistics Improvement Project (MHSIP) initiative (discussed below) notethat MHSIP has not been \"at the table\" when broader data initiatives havebeen developed (Smith et al., 2004). Moreover, SAMHSA has identifiedimportant features of health care for mental conditions that are not cap-tured in datasets approved under the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act (HIPAA). SAMHSA plans to address these issuesthrough its Decision Support 2000+ (DS 2000+) initiative (Manderscheidand Henderson, 2003). Alternatively, these issues could be brought beforethe standards-setting groups referenced in the HIPAA legislation and usedto inform the development of HIPAA-approved datasets that would serveboth the private and public sectors. Moreover, because primary care pro-viders are increasingly providing care for mental conditions, these impor- 4Conversation with Scott Young, MD, Director of Health Information Technology, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, November 1, 2004.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The committee concludes that mental and substance-use health care systems and treatment providers in both the public and private sectorsshould have a strong voice in efforts to create the NHII, including thecreation of data standards, regional and community health informationnetworks, and EHRs. Their participation will ensure that the characteristicsof mental health and substance-use services with unique implications forthe NHII will be addressed in its design, and that the benefits of the NHIIwill accrue to consumers of M/SU health care. Substantial expertise existswith regard to the clinical data needs for quality M/SU health care and theinformation systems required for M/SU clinical care, performance measure-ment, policy planning, and research. This expertise should be brought tobear in the various initiatives to build the NHII. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES FOR HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL/SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Efforts to create components of an information infrastructure for men- tal and substance-use health care have been under way for some time\u2014predominantly in the public sector under the auspices of SAMHSA. Theknowledge and networks of experts generated by these activities should beinvaluable resources in the development of the NHII. This section reviewsthese initiatives, as well as two issues pertinent to development of the NHIIwith respect to M/SU health care: the need to balance privacy concerns withdata access, and the delivery of care for M/SU conditions by non-healthcare sectors, which may also be users of the NHII. Information Infrastructure Initiatives for Health Care for M/SU Conditions SAMHSA InitiativesMental health Decision Support 2000+ and statistics improvement pro- gram SAMHSA's Decision Support 2000+ (DS 2000+) initiative is develop- ing an integrated set of mental health data standards and informationinfrastructure to collect data on community health and population charac-teristics, enrollment in insurance programs, clients' utilization of servicesand encounters, providers' use of evidence-based practices, patient out-comes, and other performance measures. Work is nearly complete on coredata standards for enrollment and encounter data; drafts of core datasetsexist for the other data domains; and three parallel stakeholder-specificCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

SAMHSA envisions that most of the data elementsin the core person/enrollment, encounter, and financial datasets will bebased on required HIPAA data elements; those not based on the HIPAAdata elements will be \"value added\" DS 2000+ data elements. SAMHSAplans to implement these standards by embedding them into web-basedsoftware, which will be made available to the industry. SAMHSA haspartnered with the Software and Technology Vendors' Association(SATVA), which serves behavioral health and human services organiza-tions, to implement the DS 2000+ data standards and develop a nationalonline decision-support infrastructure. DS 2000+ will differ from the NHIIin that it is envisioned to contain no individually identifiable data; instead,aggregate data will be deidentified at the provider or state level(Manderscheid and Henderson, 2003; Smith et al., 2004). DS 2000+ is in part a product of the long-standing and ongoing activities of MHSIP. Sponsored initially by the National Institute of Mental Health andnow by SAMHSA, MHSIP's structure consists of an ad hoc policy group thatprovides national leadership, direction, and consensus development aroundissues related to mental health data collection, and of regional users groups thatinclude all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 6 U.S. territories. Over thepast 25 years, MHSIP has produced data standards and standardized toolssuch as report cards and consumer surveys that are in wide use across all states'public mental health systems. MHSIP's FN-10 data standards serve as thefoundation for many state mental health data systems. Various aspects of itsConsumer-Oriented Mental Health Report Card are being implemented bymore than 45 states and territories. The MHSIP Consumer Survey also iswidely used in the public sector. This instrument served as part of the basis forthe Experience of Care and Health Outcomes Survey developed by HarvardUniversity and adapted by the National Committee for Quality Assurance(NCQA) for use as part of the Healthplan Employer Data and Information Set(HEDIS) performance measure set. Implementation of MHSIP's standards andproducts is facilitated by the voluntary participation of staff from all statemental health agencies and by states' receipt of federal grants that have pro-moted the development of their data system infrastructures (Smith et al., 2004). State data infrastructure grants SAMHSA has supported states in applying IT to improve health care for mental conditions through its State DataInfrastructure Grant program. Through this program, states are adoptingcommon data and information technology standards, with a focus on im-proving information from local providers so that states can report data onthe characteristics and performance of their mental health systems. As of2005, 58 states and territories had received these grants, and the resultingdata are being reported to the federal government (SAMHSA, 2005a).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The work group shares itstopical expertise on data standards in behavioral health care, apprises rel-evant groups in the behavioral health care field of activities and trends innational data standards, facilitates and coordinates efforts to influence na-tional data standards, and supports the implementation of data standardsin the behavioral health care field. Uniform Reporting System (URS) for block grant reporting under perfor- mance partnership grants SAMHSA's Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), in collaboration with state mental health agencies, developed theURS\u2014a set of 23 performance measures for the states derived from admin-istrative data and consumer surveys. Through the State Data InfrastructureGrants, the infrastructure needed to report these performance measures isbeing built. The 10 national outcome measures (see Chapter 5) defined bySAMHSA as critical performance measures for all agency grantees are asubset of the URS measures. 5 EHRs and personal health records CMHS is currently implementing a con- tract to develop prototypes of an EHR and a personal health record (PHR)for consumers of mental health services. As an initial phase of this work,the contractor is reviewing work already under way in the field in both thepublic and private sectors. The direction of the EHR work is toward a coreset of common data standards and interoperability among ongoing sys-tems. The PHR work will center on consumer-operated websites for nego-tiating and evaluating local systems of care, as well as on collaborationwith consumer and family groups to develop the content for a PHR. Thecontractor is also examining examples of the local health information in-frastructure necessary to operate such systems. 6 Substance abuse information system The Services Accountability Improve- ment System (SAIS) of SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment(CSAT) is an online, web-based information system used by all of SAMHSA'ssubstance abuse treatment grantees to input data about their projects thatcan be used for improved project oversight. In addition, training and tech-nical assistance are provided to grantees on the collection of GovernmentPerformance and Results Act (GPRA) data, with SAIS serving as a data 5Personal communication, Ronald Manderscheid, Chief, Survey and Analysis Branch, CMHS, SAMHSA, on July 27, 2005. 6Personal communication, Ronald Manderscheid, Chief, Survey and Analysis Branch, CMHS, SAMHSA, on July 27, 2005.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Moreover, SAIS currently serves as a data repository for more than 600 grantees, giving CSAT the capacity toreport on populations served; types and locations of activities supported;effectiveness across programs for particular populations; and the charac-teristics and effectiveness across programs of activities related to national,subpopulation, and geographic area data and trends. The SAIS data alsohelp improve clinical treatment programs and inform decisions on the in-tensity of monitoring, technical assistance needs, and funding requests. Thefeedback grantees receive from the system helps them evaluate and en-hance their performance. In addition, the system is able to report on em-ployment, involvement in the criminal justice system, and living situationamong substance users; social, behavioral, and psychological consequencesof drug and alcohol use; and other, related performance data. 7 Drug Evaluation Network System (DENS) DENS (Carise et al., 1999), initially funded through the Office of National Drug Control Policy, wasdesigned to serve as a national electronic treatment-information system,providing practical and timely clinical and administrative information onpatients entering into substance-use treatment throughout the nation. Thesystem also was designed to serve individual treatment programs by per-forming an electronic, standardized clinical admission assessment on everyclient entering treatment at the site. The questions within DENS are fromthe Addiction Severity Index (ASI), since it has been well tested and vali-dated in many settings, and it is in the public domain and available withoutcharge or restriction. Program staff administer the ASI interview and recordthe answers given on a lap-top computer. The raw ASI data are automati-cally transformed into a Joint Commission on Accreditation of HealthcareOrganizations (JCAHO)-approved assessment, biopsychosocial narrative,and treatment plan for use by the program counselors (saving about 3hours of work), and the raw data are automatically transmitted (withoutpersonal identifiers) to a server. Program-level summary reports are alsoavailable for directors on a quarterly basis. DENS has been in continuousoperation at more than 100 experimental sites since 2003 and is nowoperational in more than 250 other sites. The Department of VeteransAffairs and many state and city systems use DENS.

Private-Sector Initiatives Mental Health Corporations of America This industry trade association for more than 100 leading community behavioral health organizations na-tionwide is working with SATVA in a joint effort to develop best-practiceguidelines for selecting software, contracting with software vendors, andimplementing information systems and EHRs. The Davies Award This award is given annually by the Health Information Management Systems Society to a small number of organizations in recog-nition of their outstanding efforts to implement EHRs. In 2000, the awardwas extended to include behavioral health care organizations. Since thattime, one such organization has received an honorable mention and anotherhas won the award. Unique Characteristics of M/SU Services with Implications for the NHII As discussed in Chapter 2, M/SU health care has several features that distinguish it from general health care. Two of these features have implica-tions for the development of the NHII: the particular importance of privacyconcerns (discussed more fully in Chapter 5) and the fact that much care forM/SU conditions is delivered by or through the auspices of entities that arenot primarily health care organizations, such as schools and child welfareagencies (also discussed in Chapter 5). Need to Balance Privacy Concerns with Data Access The privacy of M/SU treatment data is a sensitive issue, in part because of the stigma and discrimination described in Chapter 3. More broadly, thisissue is grounded in people's common inclination to regard their mostpersonal and intimate experiences, thoughts, and feelings as private and notreadily shared outside of trusted relationships. Consequently, and as dis-cussed more fully in Chapter 5, consumer data pertaining to M/SU treat-ment services are more protected than most general and other specialtyhealth care data. These protections are reflected in federal and state regula-tions governing the disclosure of information related to health care formental or substance-use conditions (detailed in Appendix B). While theseCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Public policy must balance the sometimes competing pri-orities of respect for data privacy and facilitation of appropriate data accessto support care coordination. Many privacy regulations address the exchange of paper-based infor- mation, although some, such as those contained in HIPAA, address data inelectronic formats. However, none of these regulations explicitly addressthe more recently proposed and innovative components of the NHII,such as: Regional health information organizations (RHIOs) that will pro- vide electronic networks containing data elements essential to care coordi-nation and accessible by diverse participating health care organizations in adefined geographic region. PHRs that are consumer controlled, incorporate selected data ele- ments from existing health records, and include data a consumer maychoose to add for service providers' attention. Work is under way on formulating, developing, and implementing RHIOs (such as the Connecting for Health Initiative discussed above) and PHRs ascomponents of the NHII. The National Committee on Vital and HealthStatistics has received testimony on the new types of privacy challenges thatwill be generated by the NHII and on how these challenges should beaddressed (Newman, 2005). Care Delivered by or Through Non-Health Care Sectors As discussed in Chapter 5, much M/SU health care is delivered by or through agencies not typically considered part of the health care sector. Inparticular, the education system delivers the majority of mental healthservices to children. The welfare and criminal justice systems also are in-volved in the delivery of much M/SU health care. How are services deliv-ered in schools to be captured in the NHII? Will the NHII capture data onlyon services that generate a claim or encounter form? Should schools haveaccess to the clinical information on the NHII about their students? Whatspecial confidentiality provisions might apply to children served throughthe welfare system? Can or should the welfare system have access to dataon the NHII? These and similar questions need to be addressed in thedesign of the NHII so it will capture the data needed for effective carecoordination while protecting patient privacy.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The lesswell developed IT infrastructure among M/SU health care clinicians andorganizations, the small size of many M/SU clinicians' practices, the morediverse M/SU workforce, and financial considerations are likely to impedethe ability of these providers to participate in the NHII and must beaddressed. Less Use of Information Technology Among M/SU Providers M/SU health care generally has less well developed information systems compared with general health care (Trabin and Maloney, 2003). SATVAtestified to the committee that more complex billing, reimbursement, andregulatory reporting requirements for M/SU health care have required treat-ment providers (individual clinicians, group practices, community mentalhealth centers, and treatment facilities) to focus the use of IT on billing andother functions unrelated to quality of care (Paton, 2004). With respect to substance-use treatment providers, telephone inter- views conducted in 2003 with a random sample of 175 directors of inpa-tient/residential, outpatient, and methadone maintenance programs acrossthe nation revealed that approximately 20 percent of programs had noinformation services of any type, e-mail, or even voice mail for theirphone systems. Fifty percent had some form of computerized administra-tive information system for billing or administrative record keeping, buttheir information services were typically available only to administrativestaff. Thirty percent of the programs\u2014mostly those that were part of alarger hospital or health systems\u2014had seemingly well-developed informa-tion systems; however, only 3 of the 175 treatment programs had anintegrated clinical information system for use by the majority of theirtreatment staff (McLellan et al., 2003). Part of the problem is the manyM/SU clinicians practicing independently or as part of small group prac-tices, as discussed below. The size of health care provider organizationshas been shown to be related to the uptake of IT. As noted earlier, forexample, use of EHRs is typically found in larger health care organiza-tions (Brailer and Terasawa, 2003).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlTHE NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE 277 Many Mental Health and Substance-Use Clinicians in Solo or Small Practices Many mental health clinicians report that \"individual practice\" is ei- ther their primary or secondary8 employment setting (Duffy et al., 2004) (see Chapter 7). This has substantial implications for these clinicians' up-take and use of IT. A 2000-2001 nationally representative telephone surveyof physicians involved in direct patient care in the continental United States,for example, found wide variation in IT adoption across physician prac-tices, with practice setting, especially size, being a much more importantdeterminant of adoption than age of provider, practice location (metropoli-tan or nonmetropolitan area), or type of specialty. In examining IT adop-tion for five clinical functions\u2014obtaining treatment guidelines, exchangingclinical data with other physicians, accessing patient notes, generating treat-ment reminders for physicians, and writing prescriptions\u2014the survey foundthat the vast majority of patients were treated in physician practices lackingsignificant IT support for patient care. One-quarter of all physicians were inpractices with no computer or other form of IT support for any of the fivefunctions, and another quarter had IT support for just one function. Amongthe five functions examined, physicians were most likely to report that ITwas used in their practice to access treatment guidelines (53 percent) (Reedand Grossman, 2004). The survey further found that nearly 60 percent of physicians in tradi- tional practice settings\u2014solo, small groups with up to 50 physicians, orpractices owned by hospitals\u2014reported that their practice used IT for nomore than one of the five clinical functions. Highest levels of IT support forpatient care were found in staff- and group-model health maintenanceorganization (HMO) practices, followed by medical school faculty prac-tices and large group practices. IT support varied to a lesser extent amongprimary care and medical and surgical specialists; some differences remainedafter controlling for practice setting, location, and physician age. Psychiatrists as a group had statistically significant lower rates of IT support for patient care compared with all physicians, although psychia-trists practicing in hospitals, in staff/group HMOs, in medical schools, or aspart of large (>50) group practices had significantly higher IT support thanthose in traditional practice settings. 9 The authors theorize that the differ- 8Many mental health practitioners work in multiple settings. For example, 60 percent of full-time psychiatrists reported working in two or more settings in 1998, as did 50 percent of psychologists, 20 percent of full-time counselors, and 29 percent of marriage/family therapistsin 2002. Rates were higher for part-time counselors (Duffy et al., 2004). 9E-mail communication, Joy Grossman, PhD, Center for Studying Health System Change, on November 4, 2005.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html278 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS ences in adoption by practice setting can be explained by larger groups' and HMOs' readier access to capital and administrative support staff, the abil-ity to spread acquisition and implementation costs among more physicians,and active physician leadership in IT adoption (Reed and Grossman, 2004). Data and observations from experts in the use of information systems among managed behavioral health care organizations support this premise.With respect to administrative (as opposed to clinical) IT applications, smallerproviders in behavioral health care have lagged behind in use of electronicclaims submission (Trabin and Maloney, 2003). Consistent with this obser-vation, the survey of substance-use treatment providers described above foundthat although approximately 20 percent of surveyed programs had no infor-mation services of any type, e-mail, or even voice mail for their phone system,most of those that were part of larger hospital or health systems (approxi-mately 30 percent of the sample) had access to well-developed clinical infor-mation systems, e-mail, and Internet services (McLellan et al., 2003). The Center for Studying Health System Change has suggested that be- cause barriers to IT adoption appear to be greatest for smaller practices,policy incentives for the uptake of IT may need to pay particular attention tothose barriers. According to the center, direct grants or loans to acquire ITand strategies to lower the cost of IT may be especially successful approachesfor smaller practices; some have advocated a government-sponsored fundingmechanism, similar to the Hill-Burton Act for hospitals, to provide capital forIT to physicians and other providers (Reed and Grossman, 2004). Diverse Types of Health Care Providers Crossing the Quality Chasm notes that the health care workforce overall is highly variable in terms of IT-related knowledge and experience, and prob-ably also in terms of receptivity to learning or acquiring these new skills(IOM, 2001). This is likely to be equally or more so the case with respect toM/SU clinicians because of their greater variability in education and training(see Chapter 7). Information system executives at six major managed behav-ioral health organizations and one HMO interviewed in 1999 reported awide gap between their organization's interest in and readiness to adopt ITand that of their providers, as well as low acceptance of various technologiesamong clinical providers. For example, the managed behavioral health orga-nizations and HMO reported that they could not require electronic transmis-sion of claims and other forms because too few providers had the necessaryskills and equipment to comply (Trabin and Maloney, 2003). Varied Reimbursement and Reporting Requirements Treatment providers, many of whom, as noted, are in solo or small group practices, must respond to varied and complex reimbursement andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlTHE NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE 279 reporting requirements. With respect to substance-use treatment providers, for example, the telephone interviews conducted in 2003 with a randomsample of 175 directors of inpatient/residential, outpatient, and methadonemaintenance programs across the nation found that most of the programshad contracts with multiple managed care organizations and state agencies(e.g., justice, welfare), each requiring different data. Several programs re-ported that the data requirements of all these agencies required 2-4 hoursof data collection per admission, and these administrative data were theonly information collected by 30 percent of programs. Programs furtherindicated that \"almost none\" of these administrative data were clinicallyuseful or employed in program planning. Staff described their collection as\"just paperwork\" (McLellan et al., 2003). Simplifying these requirements will necessitate action across states\u2014by insurers and/or by multiple state agencies. The committee calls attention tothe need for a mechanism to examine variations in billing and reportingrequirements and for efforts to reduce this variation to the extent possibleacross states and localities. Financial Issues Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001) notes that deployment of IT requires a significant financial investment. Capital is needed by providers topurchase and install new technology (typically accompanied by temporarydisruptions in patient care); specialized training and education are neededas well. With respect to EHRs, in two recent reports (IOM, 2003, 2004) theIOM has recommended that both public- and private-sector purchasersconsider linking provider incentives to the acquisition of EHRs that possessthe capabilities outlined by the IOM. The strategic framework developed by the federal government also proposes three strategies for countering financial barriers to the adoption ofEHRs: incentivizing the adoption of EHRs, reducing the risk of EHR in-vestment, and supporting EHR diffusion in rural and underserved areas.Potential incentive mechanisms identified in the framework include incor-porating support for EHRs in grants or contracts to regions, states, andcommunities for local IT infrastructure; making available low-interest loansfor IT adoption; reimbursing for the use of EHRs; and incorporating EHRuse in pay-for-performance projects (Thompson and Brailer, 2004). INTEGRATING HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS INTO THE NHII The committee concludes that strong actions are needed to involve M/SU health care organizations, systems of care, and treatment providersquickly and directly in efforts to create the NHII, including initiatives to (1)Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html280 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS develop EHR systems with decision-support capabilities, (2) design a secure platform for the exchange of patient information across health care set-tings, and (3) develop data standards that will make shared informationunderstandable to all users. To this end, the committee makes the followingrecommendations. Recommendation 6-1. To realize the benefits of the emerging National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) for consumers of M/SUhealth care services, the secretaries of DHHS and the Department ofVeterans Affairs should charge the Office of the National Coordinatorof Health Information Technology and the Substance Abuse and Men-tal Health Services Administration to jointly develop and implement aplan for ensuring that the various components of the emerging NHII\u2014including data and privacy standards, electronic health records, andcommunity and regional health networks\u2014address M/SU health careas fully as general health care. As part of this strategy: DHHS should create and support a continuing mechanism to en- gage M/SU health care stakeholders in the public and private sec-tors in developing consensus-based recommendations for the dataelements, standards, and processes needed to address unique as-pects of information management related to M/SU health care.These recommendations should be provided to the appropriatestandards-setting entities and initiatives working with the Officeof the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology. Federal grants and contracts for the development of components of the NHII should require and use as a criterion for makingawards the involvement and inclusion of M/SU health care. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration should increase its work with public and private stakeholders tosupport the building of information infrastructure componentsthat address M/SU health care and coordinate these informationinitiatives with the NHII. Policies and information technology infrastructure should be used to create linkages (consistent with all privacy requirements) amongpatient records and other data sources pertaining to M/SU ser-vices received from health care providers and from education, so-cial, criminal justice, and other agencies. Recommendation 6-2. Public- and private-sector individuals, including organizational leaders in M/SU health care, should become involved in,and provide for staff involvement in, major national committees andinitiatives working to set health care data and information technologyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlTHE NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE 281 standards to ensure that the unique needs of M/SU health care are designed into these initiatives at their earliest stages. Recommendation 6-3. National associations of purchasers\u2014such as the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors,the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors,the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, the NationalAssociation of County Behavioral Health Directors, the AmericanManaged Behavioral Healthcare Association, and the national BlueCross and Blue Shield Association\u2014should decrease the burden of vari-able reporting and billing requirements by standardizing requirementsat the national, state, and local levels. Recommendation 6-4. Federal and state governments, public- and private-sector purchasers of M/SU health care, and private foundationsshould encourage the widespread adoption of electronic health records,computer-based clinical decision-support systems, computerized pro-vider order entry, and other forms of information technology for M/SUcare by: Offering financial incentives to individual M/SU clinicians and organizations for investments in information technology neededto participate fully in the emerging NHII. Providing capital and other incentives for the development of vir- tual networks to give individual and small-group providers stan-dard access to software, clinical and population data and healthrecords, and billing and clinical decision-support systems. Providing financial support for continuing technical assistance, training, and information technology maintenance. Including in purchasing decisions an assessment of the use of in- formation technology by clinicians and health care organizationsfor clinical decision support, electronic health records, and otherquality improvement applications. With regard to recommendation 6-1, calling for the implementation of a plan to ensure that the emerging NHII will address health care for mentaland substance-use conditions as fully as it does general health care, thecommittee again (see Chapter 5) calls attention to the diverse confidential-ity laws created by states pertaining to the sharing of patient informationon mental health care and to federal laws governing the sharing of informa-tion on substance-use diagnosis and treatment. These laws have substantialimplications for the sharing of electronic information, just as they do forthe sharing of information in other media. The committee therefore under-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

To make collaboration and coordination of pa- tients' M/SU health care services the norm, providers of the servicesshould establish clinically effective linkages within their own organiza-tions and between providers of mental health and substance-use treat-ment. The necessary communications and interactions should take placewith the patient's knowledge and consent and be fostered by: Routine sharing of information on patients' problems and phar- macologic and nonpharmacologic . . . Recommendation 5-2. To facilitate the delivery of coordinated care by primary care, mental health, and substance-use treatment providers,government agencies, purchasers, health plans, and accreditation orga-nizations should implement policies and incentives to continually in-crease collaboration among these providers to achieve evidence-basedscreening and care of their patients with general, mental, and/orsubstance-use health conditions. The following specific measures shouldbe undertaken to carry out this recommendation: . . . Federal and state governments should revise laws, regulations, and administrative practices that create inappropriate barriers to thecommunication of information between providers of health carefor mental and substance-use conditions and between those pro-viders and providers of general care. The committee also emphasizes that developing an effective mechanism to engage M/SU treatment stakeholders in the public and private sectors inthe development of consensus recommendations for the entities and initia-tives working with ONCHIT will require an ongoing commitment of re-sources from DHHS. This commitment will enable an ongoing processwhereby the M/SU field can identify informatics needs pertaining to M/SUhealth care whose inclusion in the evolving IT initiative is important. Someof this work may already be under way. Following up on the President'sNew Freedom Commission on Mental Health, in July 2005 SAMHSA an-nounced plans to develop a strategy for implementing innovative technol-ogy in the mental health field. SAMHSA plans to convene a consensusdevelopment work group, including ONCHIT and other public- andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlTHE NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE 283 private-sector experts and stakeholders, to review the current status of telemedicine, information technology, Internet technology, and electronicdecision-support tools in health care; examine the current status of imple-mentation of these tools in mental health; and prepare key recommenda-tions for immediate next steps in technology support for mental healthservices. SAMHSA also plans to explore the creation of a Capital Invest-ment Fund for Technology to work with states in the design and implemen-tation of an EHR and information system (SAMHSA, 2005b). These effortsshould ensure the inclusion of both public- and private-sector issues andsubstance-use as well as mental health care in the ongoing IT initiative. With respect to the recommendation that public- and private-sector individual and organizational leaders in health care for M/SU conditionsbecome involved in national initiatives to set health care data and informa-tion technology standards, the committee notes that several public- andprivate-sector organizations and initiatives could illuminate key informa-tion and technology needs for M/SU health care that should be incorpo-rated in the NHII. The 25 years of experience of the MHSIP and its regionalusers groups is an invaluable resource that can inform the NHII initiative. REFERENCES AHIMA e-HIM Personal Health Record Work Group. 2005.

This has longbeen the case and has been persistently resistant to change despiterecurring acknowledgments of the problems and repeatedrecommendations for major improvements to address them. Although similar to those that afflict the general health care workforce, these problems require special attention in the M/SUworkforce not only because of the high prevalence and seriousconsequences of M/SU problems and illnesses (see Chapter 1),but also because of the great variation in the types of clinicianslicensed to diagnose and treat M/SU conditions and substantialvariations in their training. In contrast to general health care, inwhich the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions are typicallyprovided by physicians, individuals licensed to diagnose and treatM/SU problems and illnesses include a wide range of practitioners\u2014psychologists, psychiatrists, primary care and specialist physicians,social workers, psychiatric nurses, marriage and family therapists,addiction therapists, and a wide variety of counselors (e.g.,psychosocial rehabilitation, school, addiction, and pastoral counselors),many of whom are licensed to provide M/SU services in independentCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlINCREASING WORKFORCE CAPACITY FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT 287 practice. These practitioners are trained apart from each other\u2014 in different schools by different faculties, with curriculumsencompassing few if any core competencies and little interdisciplinarytraining. Further, despite the wide variety of theories and therapiesthat have been developed to deal with M/SU problems and illnesses(see Chapter 4), there are no mechanisms in place to ensure thatany given clinician has been adequately educated and trained tooffer any specific therapy. Such a process is essential to the provisionof safe, effective, and efficient care. The wide variety of providertypes and treatments makes it difficult to provide consumers ofM/SU health care with information on the competencies of anyparticular practitioner and to assist them in finding the rightclinician for help, a key element of patient-centered care. Variationsin state licensing requirements further complicate efforts to reduceinappropriate variations in care. There is a long history of short-lived and unheeded commissions, expert panels, reports, and recommendations to improve the capacityand quality of the M/SU workforce. Reports dealing with thegeneral health care workforce typically have failed to address theunique issues in M/SU health care. Those that have done so haveaddressed either mental health or substance use, but not both.Substance use, despite its magnitude and high rate of comorbiditywith mental health problems, is often neglected in the professionaltraining of all the major mental health disciplines and the trainingreceived by primary health care practitioners as well. Trainingdoes not sufficiently emphasize the advances made in evidence-based practice for treatment of mental and substance-use conditions,nor does it include enough content on self-help groups, communitysystems of support, and social services. Teaching methods acrossall the schools in which the M/SU disciplines are trained varysubstantially as well, reflecting little cognizance of the advancesthat have been made in evidence-based teaching methods andlifelong learning. Past recommendations calling for changes in the curriculums and methods for educating and training M/SU practitioners havetypically been ignored. As a result, there continues to be a largegap between what is known, what is taught, and therefore whatis done in practice. Sustained, multiyear attention and resourceshave been applied successfully to the education and training ofphysicians and nurses through the Council on Graduate MedicalEducation and the National Advisory Council on Nurse Educationand Practice.

CRITICAL ROLE OF THE WORKFORCE AND LIMITATIONS TO ITS EFFECTIVENESS Previous reports of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and other authori- tative bodies have documented the critical roles played by the health careworkforce in the delivery of high-quality health care. Crossing the Quality Chasm identifies the health care workforce as the health system's most important resource, and critical to improving the quality of care (IOM,2001). All of the recommendations of the previous chapters\u2014providingpatient-centered, safe, effective, and coordinated care and taking advan-tages of the opportunities offered by information technology\u2014require aworkforce sufficient in numbers, with the necessary competencies, and en-abled by the environments in which they practice to deliver care consistentwith these competencies. However, the entire health care workforce\u2014including those who provide care for mental and substance-use conditions\u2014faces numerous obstacles to delivering high-quality care. These include ashortage and geographic maldistribution of workers (see Box 7-1), workenvironments that thwart clinicians' delivery of quality health care (AHRQ,2003; IOM, 2004b), a lack of ethnic diversity and cultural expertise (IOM,2004a) (see Box 7-2), outdated education and training content and methods(IOM, 2003), state-to-state variation in scopes of practice and assurance ofcompetency, and concerns about legal liability (IOM, 2001). Although the M/SU health care workforce faces all of the same prob- lems as the health care workforce overall, building its capacity to deliverhigher-quality care for M/SU conditions is particularly problematic becauseof the greater variety of types of M/SU health care providers and an evengreater variation in how they are educated, licensed, and certified/creden-tialed for practice. While recognizing the importance of such problems asworkforce shortages, geographic maldistribution, and insufficient diversitythat afflict the M/SU and general health care workforces alike, this chapterfocuses on the special problems resulting from the greater diversity of theM/SU health care workforce, their varying education and training, and thedifficulties of delivering high-quality patient care in the solo practices thatare more typical among those who treat M/SU conditions.

All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlINCREASING WORKFORCE CAPACITY FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT 289 BOX 7-1 Workforce Shortages and Geographic Maldistribution Shortages and maldistribution of M/SU treatment professionals, as in the general health care workforce, are a major and long-recognized problem. In 1999, theSurgeon General's report on mental health stated: \"The supply of well-trained mental health professionals is inadequate in many areas of the country, especially in rural areas. Particularly keen shortages are found in the numbers of mentalhealth professionals serving children and adolescents with serious mental disor- ders, and older people\" (DHHS, 1999:455). Echoing this statement, in 2003 the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health reported: \"In rural andother geographically remote areas, many people with mental illnesses have inad- equate access to care [and] limited availability of skilled care providers. . .\" (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003:51). Despite recognition of the problem and various attempts to motivate people to work in underserved areas, however, little progress has been made. In the east south central region of the United States (Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, andTennessee), for example, there are 8.2 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, com- pared with 22.1 per 100,000 in the mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania). Similarly, there are 53.0 psychologists per 100,000 people inNew England, compared with 14.4 per 100,000 in the west south central states, such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas (Duffy et al., 2004). Shortages of clini- cians with expertise in caring for certain groups, such as children and adolescents(Koppelman, 2004) and older adults (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003), also persist nationwide. This variation reflects the historical tenden- cy of highly skilled professionals to locate in urban areas (Morris et al., 2004). Similar problems in the substance-use treatment workforce have been docu- mented. Low salaries are accompanied by high turnover rates in both managerial and clinical positions (McLellan et al., 2003). This situation can compromise con-tinuity of care for patients and also threatens to leave the field without a leadership infrastructure through which advances in care can be infused. Moreover, the stigma experienced by individuals with substance-use illnesses is sometimes feltby their treatment providers (Kaplan, 2003). and illnesses, include licensed clinicians; unlicensed, paid providers (both certified and uncertified); volunteers; and the patient's family and informalsupports. The roles of patients and their families in care and illness manage-ment, as well as those of individuals in recovery who offer peer and recov-ery support services, are addressed in Chapter 3. In this chapter we focus onthe role of the licensed M/SU treatment workforce. 1 1Although the role of unlicensed and voluntary care providers is substantial and important, the committee focuses here on licensed caregivers because the education and oversight struc- tures for unlicensed voluntary caregivers are less well developed at present. Moreover, the committee believes that a well-trained and -educated licensed and credentialed workforce,through its leadership and modeling of best-care practices such as patient-centered care, can do much to strengthen the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the unlicensed workforce and volunteer supports.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

At thebeginning of the 1900s, only one of every eight Americans identified himself or herself as a race other than \"white.\" At the end of the century, one of four did so, as the white population grew more slowly than every other racial/ethnic group.Increasing diversity accelerated in the latter half of the century. From 1970 to 2000, the population of races other than \"white\" or \"black\" grew considerably, and by 2000 was comparable in size to the black population. The black populationrepresented a slightly smaller share of the total U.S. population in 1970 than in 1900, while the Hispanic population more than doubled from 1980 to 2000. The racial/ethnic composition of the U.S. population according to the 2000 census wasas follows: 75.1 percent white, 12.3 percent black, 3.6 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 0.9 percent American Indian or Alaska Native, 5.5 percent claiming a race other than those already cited, and 2.4 percent claiming two or more races.Individuals (of any race) claiming Hispanic origin constituted 12.5 percent of the U.S. population (Hobbs and Stoops, 2002). Despite this increasing diversity and decades of concern about the failure of the health care workforce to reflect it, there are still far too few minority M/SU professionals. The 2001 supplement to the Surgeon General's report on mental health, Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity , stated: \"Racial and ethnic minorities continue to be badly underrepresented, relative to their proportion of the U.S. population, within the core mental health professions\u2014psychiatry, psychol- ogy, and social work, counseling, and psychiatric nursing\" (DHHS, 2001:167). ThePresident's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health echoed that observation: \"Racial and ethnic minorities are seriously under-represented in the core mental health professions [and] . . . many providers are inadequately prepared to serveculturally diverse populations, and investigators are not trained in research on minority populations\" (New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003:50). Similarly, members of the substance-use treatment workforce do not reflect thegender, racial, and ethnic composition of those they treat (Mulvey et al., 2003). As noted above, clinicians licensed to diagnose and treat M/SU prob- lems and illnesses are uniquely varied. Although the diagnosis and treat-ment of general health conditions are typically limited to physicians,advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants, 2 M/SU health care clini- cians include psychologists, psychiatrists, other specialty or primary carephysicians, social workers, psychiatric nurses, marriage and family thera-pists, addiction therapists, psychosocial rehabilitation therapists, sociolo-gists, and a variety of counselors with different education and certifications 2Dentists, chiropractors, and podiatrists also are licensed to diagnose and treat, but typi- cally within prescribed domains.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The effect on clinical practice of this variation in provider types and in the corresponding education and training is unknown; however, variationin the education and training of different types of physicians who delivercare for mental illnesses has been shown to result in variations in the qualityof care (Young et al., 2001). Also, although many different therapies havebeen developed for M/SU problems and illnesses (see Chapter 4), there is nomechanism in place to ensure that any given clinician has been adequatelyeducated and trained to offer any specific therapy. Such a process is essen-tial to the delivery of safe, effective, and efficient care. The wider variety ofprovider types also has implications for the ability to provide consumerswith the information they need to select a clinician to help them\u2014a keyelement of patient-centered care\u2014as it is difficult to provide consumerswith information on the competencies of any individual practitioner and toguarantee a uniform, safe level of abilities across all types of clinicians. In spite of this, no mechanisms exist for routinely capturing adequate information on the characteristics of the M/SU workforce comparable to,for example, the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses regularlyconducted by the National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Prac-tice. Moreover, administrative data routinely collected as part of healthcare claims or billing do not include a code for provider type. Although itmay not be necessary to capture this information in general health care, inwhich the great majority of billing clinicians are physicians, the failure todo so for M/SU services neglects a substantial opportunity to learn aboutthe M/SU workforce and its patterns of care. The Substance Abuse andMental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has organized periodicefforts to collect data on mental health practitioners (see Table 7-1) (Duffyet al., 2004), but the information collected is incomplete, collected inconsis-tently across professions, and insufficient for policy and workforce analy-sis. This and the few other available data sources provide only limitedinformation about specialty and general health care clinicians providingM/SU treatment services. Specialty Mental Health Providers Specialty mental health providers include psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses possessing formal graduate degrees in mental health.They also include social workers, counselors, nurses, and therapists whoeither have received additional, specialized training in treating mental prob-lems and illnesses prior to their professional practice, or have chosen topractice in a mental health care setting and gained advanced knowledge intreating mental problems and illnesses through experience (West et al.,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html292 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS 2001). Individuals with more severe mental illnesses are more likely to receive care from specialty mental health providers (Wang et al., 2000).Psychiatrists, for example, are likely to treat individuals with illnesses suchas schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (West et al., 2001). SAMHSA's mostrecent estimates of the numbers of clinically trained and clinically active 3 mental health personnel are shown in Table 7-1. Specialty Substance-Use Treatment Providers Data on the specialty substance-use treatment workforce overall are sparse; no database systematically collects such data (Kaplan, 2003).SAMHSA's 1996-1997 Alcohol and Drug Services study (Phase I) pub-lished in 2003 (SAMHSA, 2003) collected data on the credentials of staffworking in a national inventory of hospital, residential, and outpatientsubstance-use treatment facilities and programs (Mulvey et al., 2003). How-ever, subsequent national surveys of substance-use treatment services have notcollected data on staff licensure and certification (SAMHSA, 2004), and instudies of the health care workforce overall, \"the addiction treatment work-force is generally overlooked\" (McCarty, 2002:1). Experts also note thepaucity of data on the preparation of this workforce (Morris et al., 2004). 3\"Clinically trained\" personnel include those who, because of formal training and experi- ence, could provide direct clinical care for mental health conditions, whether or not they do so. \"Clinically active\" personnel are those actively providing such care.TABLE 7-1 Estimated Number of Clinically Active (CA) or Clinically Trained (CT) Mental Health Personnel and Rate per 100,000 Civilian Population in the United States, by Discipline and Year Rate per 100,000 U.S. Civilian Reporting Discipline Number Population Year Counseling 111,931 (CA) 49.4 2002 Psychosocial Rehabilitation 100,000 (CT) 37.7 1996Social Work 99,341 (CA) 35.3 2002 Psychology 88,491 (CT) 31.1 2002 Marriage and Family Therapy 47,111 (CA) 16.7 2002Psychiatry a38,436 (CT) 13.7 2001 School Psychology (CT) 11.4 2003 Psychiatric Nursing 18,269 (CT) 6.5 2000Pastoral Counseling Data not available aBased on clinically active psychiatrists in the private sector; excludes residents and fellows.

In 1998 approximately half of the staff delivering substance-use treatment services in about 13,000 outpatient clinics was licensed assubstance-abuse counselors. The remainder were about equally composedof unlicensed counselors and \"other\" professionals who were predomi-nantly master's-level social workers, mental health counselors, marriageand family therapists, and psychologists with no certification or licensure assubstance-use treatment providers; these \"other\" professionals also includedpsychiatrists and specialty-certified primary care physicians and nurses(Harwood, 2002). A more recent 2003 survey of 175 directors of inpatient/residential, outpatient, and methadone maintenance programs across thenation also found that apart from counselors, very few professional disci-plines were represented among the treatment staff of these programs. Withrespect to program directors, 15 percent had no college degree; 58 percenthad a bachelor's degree, and 20 percent had a master's degree. One pro-gram was under the direction of a physician (McLellan et al., 2003). General Medical/Primary Care Providers M/SU problems and illnesses are also treated by general internists, family medicine physicians, pediatricians, other medical specialists, andadvanced practice nurses who have not been certified as mental health orsubstance-use treatment specialists and are delivering primary or specialtyhealth care in office-based practices, clinics, acute general hospitals, andnursing homes. These providers are often the first point of contact for manyadults with mental problems or illnesses. There is also some evidence thatthey are consumers' preferred point of first contact for care: the majority ofconsumers initially turn to their primary care providers for mental healthservices (Mickus et al., 2000), and use of general medical providers fortreatment of M/SU problems and illnesses increased more than 150 percentbetween 1990-1992 and 2001-2003\u2014a significant shift away from othersectors of care (Kessler et al., 2005). An equal (DHHS, 1999) or greater(Wang et al., 2000) number of adults with M/SU problems and illnessesreceive care from general medical providers relative to specialty mentalhealth providers in a given year. Primary care physicians and physicianspecialists other than psychiatrists also prescribe the majority of psychotropicmedications (Pincus et al., 1998). However, there also is evidence that thecare provided by general, primary care physicians is less often consistentwith clinical practice guidelines than that provided by psychiatrists(Friedmann et al., 2000; Young et al., 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html294 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS The diversity of professions and disciplines within the M/SU workforce has implications for quality of care. First, it is difficult forconsumers to know which type of clinician has the best knowledge andskills to provide them with the safest, most effective, and most efficient care. This might not be a problem if all types of practitioners had aminimum level of competency and the special added competencies of thedifferent types of clinicians were reliably known. This however, is not thecase, as discussed in the next section. Professional licensure and ongoingassurance of competencies in specific therapies involve many differentbodies. Experts in the education of the M/SU workforce report thatprelicensure education is uneven, as are licensure standards and the use ofpostlicensure competency evaluation mechanisms (Daniels and Walter,2002; Hoge, 2002; Hoge et al., 2002). PROBLEMS IN PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING 4 Providers in the above multiple disciplines, many of whom are licensed to practice independently, differ in the amounts of education and trainingthey receive prior to professional practice. The content of the educationthey receive and the places in which they are educated also differ. Thissection reviews these variations, as well as deficiencies in the professionaleducation of the M/SU workforce overall. Variation in Amounts and Types of Education Psychiatry Eligibility for board certification in psychiatry requires 4 years of col- lege, 4 additional years of medical education leading to a medical degree,followed by a minimum of 4 years of residency training. Psychology Although the doctoral degree in psychology is the standard educational path for independent clinical practice, individuals with a master's degree inpsychology also can practice under the direction of a doctorally prepared 4This section incorporates content from a paper commissioned by the committee on \"Work- force Issues in Behavioral Health,\" by John A.

To become alicensed clinical psychologist, graduates from doctoral programs also mustcomplete supervised postdoctoral training (Olvey and Hogg, 2002). Prac-ticing as a school psychologist requires a minimum of a master's degree,followed by additional training leading toward certification or licensure atthe state level or nationally by the National Association of School Psycholo-gists (Morris et al., 2004). Social Work Although social workers can practice with a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree, the Master of Social Work (MSW) is considered theroutine degree for practitioners and is the most common academic re-quirement for licensure. Obtaining an MSW degree usually requires 2years of postundergraduate study and field placements/practica (Morris etal., 2004). Psychiatric Nursing Individuals may become a registered nurse (RN) through three different educational pathways: a 2-year program leading to an associate's degree(AD) in nursing, a 3-year program (usually hospital-based) leading to adiploma in nursing, or a 4-year college or university program leading to abachelor's degree in nursing. Those completing all of these programs areeligible to take the RN licensing examination after graduation. Psychiatricnurses may have this basic level of education or a graduate degree. Specialtycertification for psychiatric nurses at all levels is provided by the AmericanNurses Credentialing Center. Psychiatric nurses are certified at both thebasic (\"C\" after RN) and advanced (\"CS\" or \"BC\" after RN) levels. Themajority of psychiatric nurses are prepared at the basic level of education;advanced-level certification requires that the nurse have either a master's ordoctoral degree. Many nurses working in psychiatric settings do not haveadvanced certification in psychiatric nursing (Morris et al., 2004). Counseling The master's degree is the most common practice degree in counseling and enables licensure as a counselor. Accredited graduate programs requirea minimum of 72 quarter hours or 48 semester hours of postundergraduatestudy leading to a master's degree. Doctoral degree programs usually re-quire a minimum of 2 additional years of study (Morris et al., 2004).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html296 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Marriage and Family Therapy Marriage and family therapists are trained in three different ways: master's degree (requiring 2-3 years of 3-5 years of postundergraduate training); or apostgraduate clinical training program following training in psychology,psychiatry, social work, nursing, pastoral counseling, or education (Morriset al., 2004). Pastoral Counseling Persons credentialed as clinical pastoral counselors are either ordained or otherwise recognized by identified groups of religious faith and havecompleted a course of study approved by the Association for Clinical Pasto-ral Counseling. There are only 2,812 certified pastoral counselors nation-wide, making them one of the smallest specialty provider groups in mentalhealth (Morris et al., 2004). Psychosocial Rehabilitation Psychosocial rehabilitation is an approach to working with individuals with severe mental illnesses to teach them the skills they need to achievetheir goals for living in the community. This type of care typically includessome combination of residential services, training in community living skills,socialization services, crisis services, case management, vocational rehabili-tation, and other related services. Educational options for psychosocialrehabilitation workers are diverse and range from training following highschool to an associate's, bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in psycho-social rehabilitation. Recent statistics indicate that 2 percent of theseworkers have a doctoral degree, 24 percent a master's degree, 13 percentsome college or an associate's degree, and 22 percent a high school diploma(Duffy et al., 2004). Substance-Use Treatment Counseling As described above, most of the substance-use treatment workforce consists of counselors. The composition of this workforce is shifting fromthose whose expertise is experience-based (from their personal experiencewith substance-use problems or illnesses and recovery) to those with moreformal education at the graduate level (McCarty, 2002). However, a repre-sentative survey of all state-recognized substance-use treatment programsfound that 26 percent of counselors did not have a bachelor's degree, 32percent possessed a bachelor's degree only, and 42 percent possessed aCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlINCREASING WORKFORCE CAPACITY FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT 297 master's degree (none possessed a doctoral degree). And 39 percent of these counselors were clinically supervised by individuals who themselves lackeda graduate degree. This survey did not distinguish between counselors withand without a license/certification (Mulvey et al., 2003). A 1998 survey ofstaff delivering substance-use treatment services in approximately 13,000outpatient clinics nationally found that 54 percent of unlicensed counselors had fewer than 4 years of college; in contrast, a master's degree waspossessed by 56 percent of licensed counselors and 82 percent of \"otherbehavioral health professionals\" (Harwood, 2002). This higher level offormal education may not necessarily provide greater knowledge and ex-pertise in providing effective care, however. Graduate programs in socialwork and psychology, for example, often do not provide specialized train-ing in treatment of alcohol- and other drug-use problems and illnesses(Straussner and Senreich, 2002) and have a number of other limitations. Deficiencies in Professional Education The education of all health professionals is deficient in a number of areas and has not kept pace with advances in knowledge and changes in thedelivery of health care (IOM, 2001, 2003), despite an IOM call that: All health professionals should be educated to deliver patient-centered care as members of an interdisciplinary team, emphasizing evidence-based practice, quality improvement approaches, and informatics (IOM,2003:3). Leaders in the education of clinicians to treat M/SU conditions testify that the educational preparation of this workforce does not address manyof these areas adequately. For example, not all M/SU clinicians are edu-cated about evidence-based care or receive training in the use of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (Manderscheid et al., 2001). Without edu-cation in the use of such guidelines, these clinicians may be more committedto schools of practice than to providing the best therapy for a given patient(Jackim, 2003). The varying education of the different provider types dis-cussed above results in differences in clinicians' theoretical orientations andtherapeutic approaches, as well as in the professional journals they readand the professional organizations to which they belong. The result is littlecross-fertilization of knowledge and skills across provider types, and fewcommon standards of care and agreed-upon core competencies that tran-scend the borders of the separate schools of thought in which M/SU healthcare clinicians are trained. Experts in the education of M/SU clinicians also report that graduate education is inadequately grounded in the scientific evidence base for treat-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Similarly, despite the need forinterprofessional collaboration described in Chapter 5, graduate training inM/SU health care continues to be conducted in single-discipline silos withlittle interdisciplinary coordination. Multispecialty training, such as thatinvolving both mental health and primary care providers, also remainsinfrequent (Hoge et al., 2002). Further, available information shows that there is no agreed-upon level of competency within any profession (or across professions) with respect toproviding M/SU health care. Graduate training has not kept pace withchanges in health care delivery, and the achievement of expected educa-tional outcomes has not been demonstrated (Hoge et al., 2002). Recentchanges in the licensing examination for nurses have decreased the contentdevoted to psychosocial issues, which some fear will encourage nursingschools to weaken mental health content in their curriculums (Poster, 2004).There also is strong evidence that education of all clinicians inadequatelyaddresses substance-use problems and illnesses despite their high rates ofco-occurrence with mental problems and illnesses. Little Assurance of Competencies in Discipline-Specific and Core Knowledge A primary concern regarding M/SU clinicians' education and training is the general absence of clearly specified competencies that students are todevelop and a process for routinely assessing whether those competencieshave actually been achieved. Leaders in the education of M/SU health careclinicians cite a historical reluctance in some professional education andtraining programs to require students to demonstrate competence in spe-cific treatments, and note that general M/SU graduate education does notguarantee competence in advanced or specialized skills. As a result, it isrecommended that training programs specify the minimum competenciesexpected of their graduates and verify that these competencies have beenachieved (Hoge et al., 2002). Multiple organizations are in various (mainly early) stages of develop- ing discipline-specific, population-specific, or subject matter-specific com-petencies for clinicians providing health care for mental or substance-useconditions. However, these competencies have not yet been adopted asstandards of professional practice, and together represent a not-yet-finished\"patchwork quilt\" of competencies. Moreover, still less attention has beendirected to developing and implementing strategies for assessing the extentCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlINCREASING WORKFORCE CAPACITY FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT 299 to which students and current members of the workforce possess or prac- tice these competencies (Hoge et al., 2005a). Leaders in M/SU education and clinical care also have called for certain knowledge, skills, and attitudes (i.e., core competencies) to be addressed bythe education of all clinicians providing M/SU health care. Such competen- cies include, for example, detecting co-occurring mental and substance-useproblems and illnesses, and avoiding the stigmatizing attitudes and prac-tices of health care providers that obstruct patients' self-management oftheir illness and recovery, as described in Chapter 3. Several initiatives havebeen undertaken to develop and implement core competencies, includingtwo for those treating substance use and one for those treating mentalconditions. But these initiatives (described below) have not yet fully takenhold. Addiction Counseling Competencies: The Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes of Professional Practice In 1995, the National Curriculum Committee of the Addiction Technology Transfer Center program, a nationwide trainingsystem supported by SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment(CSAT), reached agreement on core competencies for addiction counselingacross professional groups that may treat people with substance-use prob-lems and illnesses. The resulting document, Addiction Counseling Compe- tencies: The Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes of Professional Practice, iden- tifies the basic knowledge and attitudes required for all disciplines in theaddiction field, as well as those necessary for the professional practice ofaddiction counseling (clinical evaluation; treatment planning; referral; ser-vice coordination; counseling; client, family, and community education;documentation; and professional and ethical responsibilities, each with itsown set of competencies). The goal is for every addiction counselor andevery specialty treatment facility to possess every competency, regardless ofsetting or treatment model (Addiction Technology Transfer Centers Na-tional Curriculum Committee, 1998; Hoge et al., 2005a). Interdisciplinary Project to Improve Health Professional Education in Sub- stance Abuse This 5-year cooperative project of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Association for Medical Educationand Research in Substance Abuse (AMERSA), and CSAT produced (1) astrategic plan for interdisciplinary faculty development to prepare the gen-eral health professions workforce to provide care for substance-use prob-lems and illnesses, (2) an interdisciplinary faculty development program toimprove the educational curriculums for general health care professionals,and (3) an infrastructure to support faculty development in substance-usetreatment. The initiative also produced a set of core and discipline-specificknowledge, attitudes, and competencies needed by health professionals toCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Transmission of this setof knowledge, attitudes, and competencies to the workforce was initiatedby the Multi-Agency INitiative on Substance abuse TRaining and Educa-tion for AMerica (Project MAINSTREAM), which provided trainers totrain interdisciplinary faculty (Samet et al., 2006). The students trained bythese faculty enter the workforce with the knowledge and skills needed toprovide care for individuals and communities dealing with substance-useproblems and illnesses. Annapolis Coalition on Behavioral Health Workforce Education The Annapolis Coalition on Behavioral Health Workforce Education (Annap-olis Coalition) grew out of a 2001 conference convened by the AmericanCollege of Mental Health Administration and the Academic BehavioralHealth Consortium, with funding from SAMHSA and the Agency forHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The Annapolis Coalitiondistilled recommendations from a substantial number of peer-reviewedpublications addressing the need for training reform in the M/SU treat-ment field and subjected those recommendations to further vetting byexperts in the field by preparing and distributing for comment of a seriesof review papers (Daniels and Walter, 2002; Hoge et al., 2002), as wellas discussing the recommendations at a national summit of experts onworkforce development (Hoge and Morris, 2002). The result was a seriesof 10 recommended best practices for improving the quality and rel-evance of workforce education (Hoge et al., 2005a). Paucity of Content on Substance-Use Care Despite the frequency of co-occurrence of general medical, mental, and substance-use problems and illnesses, many providers in each of these areasreceive little or no education in the others and their effects on the presentingcondition. According to the congressionally mandated study of the preven-tion and treatment of co-occurring substance-use and mental conditions(SAMHSA, undated:15), \"Perhaps one of the most significant program-level barriers, noted by consumers and family members as well as byproviders. . .is the lack of staff trained in treating co-occurring disorders.\"The limited content of substance-use education in most health professionsis evidence of this. Physician education Medical students can be educated about substance- use problems and illnesses in a variety of settings. During the first 2 yearsof medical school, however, the subject is often integrated into standardcoursework; and separate courses on addiction medicine are rarely taught.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlINCREASING WORKFORCE CAPACITY FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT 301 During the final 2 years of medical school, students also may have some experience with substance-use health care during required or elective clini-cal rotations in internal medicine, family medicine, neurology, or psychia-try. Overall, however, dedicated training in substance-use problems andillnesses is rarely offered in medical schools. A 1998-1999 survey of theLiaison Committee on Medical Education found that of the 125 accreditedU.S. medical schools, 95 percent provided training in substance-use healthcare as part of a larger required course, 8 percent had a separate requiredcourse, and 36 percent offered an elective course (Haack and Adger, 2002).This current level of exposure of medical students to substance-use healthcare issues has not given recent medical school graduates the confidence toscreen, assess, or provide needed interventions for these patients (Miller etal., 2001; Saitz et al., 2002; Vastag, 2003). With respect to residency training, a 1997 national survey of residency program directors found that the percentage of programs with requiredtraining in care for substance-use problems and illnesses ranged from 32percent in pediatrics to 95 percent in psychiatry, with an average of 56percent across all emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine,obstetrics/gynecology, osteopathic medicine, pediatrics, and psychiatry resi-dency programs. However, the survey found that even when there wasrequired curriculum content in substance-use health care, the median num-ber of curriculum hours dedicated to the subject varied greatly, rangingfrom 3 (emergency medicine and obstetrics/gynecology) to 12 (family medi-cine). Psychiatry residency programs reported an average of 8 hours de-voted to substance-use health care in their curriculums (Isaacson et al.,2000). Even in preventive medicine residency training, most of the alcohol-,tobacco-, and other drug-use training focuses solely on tobacco (AbramsWeintraub et al., 2003). Psychologist education Psychologists typically receive very little training in or preparation for dealing with substance-use problems and illnesses.Results of a 1994 survey indicated that although 91 percent of psycholo-gists encountered substance-use problems or illnesses in their daily work,74 percent had received no formal undergraduate or graduate courseworkin the subject, and slightly more than half (54 percent) had received notraining in substance-use conditions during their internships. Although fewhad received such training as part of their formal education, 86 percentsubsequently acquired training in substance-use conditions through work-shops, supervision, and other sources (Aanavai et al., 1999). Social work education The Interdisciplinary Project to Improve Health Professional Education in Substance Abuse found that most schools ofsocial work failed to provide students with a basic knowledge of alcohol-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html302 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS and drug-use issues. Moreover, when graduate schools of social work of- fered a concentration or elective courses in the treatment of alcohol- anddrug-use problems and illnesses, most students did not take these courses,and only a few schools of social work offered postgraduate training pro-grams covering services for substance use. A significant factor contributingto this is that the Council on Social Work Education, the national policy-making body for social work education, does not mandate that curricu-lums contain substance-use content (Straussner and Senreich, 2002). Nursing education Data on the amount of education in substance-use health care provided to nurses use are highly limited. The report of the Interdisci-plinary Project to Improve Health Professional Education in SubstanceAbuse (Naegle, 2002) includes only information from two surveys con-ducted in 1987. The first found that undergraduate nursing curriculumstypically offered 1-5 hours of instruction in substance-use problems andillnesses over 2-4 years of study, usually combined with other coursecontent, and focused primarily on definitions and descriptions of the phe-nomena surrounding substance use and their health consequences. Thesecond study likewise found little content on substance-use problems andillnesses incorporated into psychiatric nursing programs. A systematic re-view of studies of chemical dependency training within schools of nursing,covering the period 1966-1996, also found only a small number of studies,which frequently were methodologically flawed. Despite these shortcom-ings, the investigators concluded from the available data that schools ofnursing generally provided minimal exposure to important concepts relatedto alcohol and drug dependence. Few classroom hours were dedicated toalcohol and drug issues, and individual courses devoted to substance-useproblems and illnesses were rare. Clinical training also was neglected.\"Neither the scope nor intensity of clinical instruction was sufficient toensure that graduating nurses could effectively intervene with chemicallydependent patients\" (Howard et al., 1997:54). Counselor education Even among substance-use treatment counselors, the duration and content of preprofessional training received by certifiedsubstance-use counselors varies widely. A large proportion of alcohol andother drug treatment counselors report receiving their counseling educa-tion through associate's degree and certificate programs at 2-year commu-nity colleges. Little information exists on the quality of these programs, oron programs offering higher levels of education. These programs typicallyoperate with little or no external review and accreditation (McCarty, 2002).However, a 2000-2001 review of undergraduate programs based on pub-lished catalogues and Internet sites found 260 programs listed on thewebsite of the National Association of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counse lorsCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Approximately 55 percent of theseprograms were at the community college or 2-year level, 13 percent at thebachelor's degree level, and 32 percent at the graduate level. Undergraduateprograms varied in their titles, the types of degrees awarded, the numbersof credits and courses required for a degree, and in whether program gradu-ates are prepared to function as counselors and be certified by states(Edmundson, 2002). Inadequate Faculty Development Training health professionals to provide them with the knowledge and skills needed to treat M/SU problems and illnesses requires not just strongcurriculum content, but also high-quality faculty to present that curriculumwho are well trained and knowledgeable about current effective M/SUtherapies, contemporary practice, and interdisciplinary care (Haack andAdger, 2002; Hoge et al., 2002). Yet past deficiencies in the education ofthose serving in faculty positions, particularly generalist clinicians (e.g.,physicians, nurses), have resulted in insufficient numbers of qualified gener-alist faculty to teach about M/SU health care issues even when curriculumsconcerning these issues exist. The Career Teachers Program (1972-1982), sponsored by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute onDrug Abuse, was one of the first multidisciplinary faculty developmentprograms in substance use health care for health professionals (Galanter,1980). Over the course of this program's existence, 59 career teachers(faculty in medical and public health schools) were challenged to enhancesubstance-use treatment education within their own professional schools.This program was followed by faculty development programs sponsored byfederal agencies for medical, nursing, social work, public health, and psy-chology faculty. Projects associated with these programs enriched the cur-riculums of their respective schools and demonstrated that training pro-viders, either community clinicians or emergency medicine residents, couldincrease the extent to which they addressed patients' unhealthy alcohol use(D'Onofrio et al., 2002; Saitz et al., 2000). The continuing need for facultytraining programs is evident in the ongoing faculty development efforts ofthe Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse(Samet et al., 2006). Summary The above discussion illustrates that even when well-developed sets of competencies (such as those of the Interdisciplinary Project to ImproveCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Licensing and credentialing are twomechanisms used to assure the public that health care professionals arecompetent to deliver services once they have completed their preprofessionaleducation. However, many of the core and discipline-, subject matter-, orpopulation-specific professional competencies discussed above have notbeen adopted or incorporated into training programs, licensing standards,or certification requirements. Until this happens, the promulgation of com-petencies is likely to have limited impact (Hoge et al., 2005a). The variationin competencies resulting from differences in preprofessional education iscompounded by state-to-state variation in licensing and credentialing, dis-cussed next. VARIATION IN LICENSURE AND CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS Licensing standards for the health professions are set by the states and typically specify minimum standards for competency. In addition, the differ-ent health professional associations, such as NAADAC\u2014the Association forAddiction Professionals, and the American Nurses Association, frequentlyestablish independent certification or credentialing processes that formallyrecognize an individual's knowledge or competency in a specialized area. Thelatter standards often go beyond the requirements for state licensure, al-though there is some overlap as some states mandate credentialing as a partof licensure for certain professions (IOM, 2003). Taking psychologists as an example, all but four states require a doctoral degree to practice clinical psychology independently; Alaska, Oregon, Ver-mont, and West Virginia also license master's-level clinicians to practiceindependently. All states except California and Pennsylvania require degreesto be from schools accredited by regional accrediting bodies; the two excep-tions accept degrees recognized by state law. Mississippi and Oklahomarequire the degrees to be from programs accredited by the American Psycho-logical Association. All states further require supervised experience prior toindependent practice, but the number of hours required varies. Most statesrequire 1,500-2,000 postdoctoral hours, but Delaware requires 3,000 andMichigan and Washington 4,000 (Olvey and Hogg, 2002). Moreover, thereare variations in how individuals with a master's degree in psychology canpractice across states. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia do notlicense master's-level psychologists to practice independently. In the otherstates, licensed master's-level psychologists are variably restricted in theirscope of practice and amount of required supervision. Titles used in the statesfor these licensed and master's-prepared clinicians also vary; they includeCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The amount of supervision re-quired varies from none to supervision of all practice activity. Requirementsfor supervised experience pre- and postlicensure also vary (Association ofState and Provincial Psychology Boards, 2000). Considerable variation exists as well in the certification of specializa- tions provided by professional associations. Only a few state certificationboards, for example, use SAMHSA's addiction counseling competencies asthe basis for their education and training requirements (Hoge et al., 2005a).Although a number of states (e.g., New York, New Mexico, Arizona) aremoving toward the establishment of a required basic level of competencyfor M/SU treatment providers who are offering integrated services, thereremain no uniform standards of competency across states. The above variations in licensure standards and credentialing processes contribute to the varying capacity of the M/SU workforce to deliver high-quality health care. INADEQUATE CONTINUING EDUCATION Beyond the variations in education, licensing, and credentialing discussed above, the rapidly expanding evidence base and broad range of specializedpopulations and treatment settings make it unlikely that all clinicians (espe-cially those newly licensed) will come to their place of employment possessingthe knowledge and skills needed to practice at a high level of expertise (Hogeet al., 2002). Prelicensure or preemployment education cannot provide suffi-cient frequency and diversity of experience (and sometimes offer no experi-ence) in the performance of every therapeutic intervention appropriate forevery clinical condition seen in patients, especially as the breadth of knowl-edge and technology expands. Practitioners, therefore, come to their initialplace of employment as novices without certain skills and knowledge\u2014theirlimited skill and expertise reflecting the limitations of time and experience intheir academic education and the sheer number of effective therapies. More-over, it is obviously impossible for prelicensure education to teach studentsabout diagnostic and therapeutic advances not yet invented (IOM, 2004b).Many of the health professions are thus grappling with the need to ensure thecontinuing competency of licensed health professionals (IOM, 2003). Likeprofessional practice education, however, continuing education for healthprofessionals has been found lacking in content, methods, financing, andorganizational support.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html306 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Content Continuing education focuses on refining existing and developing new skills, as well as mastering changes in the knowledge base and treatmentapproaches. Unlike preservice education, which is organized around a formalcurriculum, continuing education is commonly self-directed by the practition-er, who selects areas of interest to pursue (Daniels and Walter, 2002). Few standards or guidelines govern the continuing education content that providers choose to study. Continuing education requirements are setprincipally by licensing and certification bodies, many of which are con-trolled by the states. These requirements are generally nonspecific, outlin-ing only the number of hours of continuing education that must be com-pleted during a specified number of years in order to maintain licensure orcertification. While some states and disciplines mandate continuing educa-tion in specific content areas, such as professional ethics (Daniels andWalter, 2002), \"the general absence of standards or guidelines regardingcontent raises concern that many practitioners may never become educatedabout critical, emerging issues in the field, such as patient safety\" (Morris etal., 2004:18), illness self-management (see Chapter 3), or the Chronic CareModel (see Chapter 5). A 2001 survey of the continuing education requirements for M/SU disciplines set by the states for licensure renewal found a striking lack ofconsistency in the requirements for a given professional discipline acrossstates, as well as in the requirements for different mental health disciplineswithin states. The requirements for psychologists, for example, range fromzero hours of continuing education (11 states), to 12 hours per year(Alabama), to 50 hours per year (Kansas) (Daniels and Walter, 2002). Methods As usually provided (i.e., in single-session events such as conferences, lectures, workshops, and dissemination of written materials), continuingeducation has been found to have little effect in changing clinical practice(Davis et al., 1999). Teaching adult learners clearly requires different ap-proaches; moreover, research has shown that not everyone learns the sameway. While many individuals learn well through reading, for example,others learn better through approaches that allow them to use their motorskills. Clinicians also can benefit from being taught individually, ratherthan in a group, at a pace suited to their particular learning style (Lazear,1991). Empirical support exists as well for education strategies such asinteractive sessions (role playing, discussion groups, and experiential prob-lem solving); academic detailing, in which trained experts meet with pro-viders in their practice setting; audit and feedback (Morris et al., 2004); useCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The IOM's report on health professions education (IOM, 2003) identi- fies utilizing information technology to communicate, manage knowledge,mitigate error, and support decision making as a core competency thatshould be possessed by all health professionals. Proficiency in using IT canalso be an effective vehicle for continuing education. CD-ROM-based andtext-based programs can be used to provide individualized learning duringtimes when the clinician is not involved in direct patient care. Online learn-ing also presents new opportunities for continuing education, and manystate licensing boards accept completion of online courses as satisfying atleast part of the continuing education requirements for license renewal(Flanagan and Needham, 2003). Learning can take place as well through clinical decision-support soft- ware that integrates information on individual patients with a computer-ized knowledge base to generate patient-specific assessments or recommen-dations, thereby helping clinicians or patients make clinical decisions. Ingeneral health care, clinical decision-support systems assist clinicians inapplying new information to patient care through the analysis of patient-specific clinical variables. These systems vary in complexity, function, andapplication; some but not all are computer based. According to AHRQ'sevidence-based report Making Health Care Safer: A Critical Analysis of Patient Safety Practices , the preponderance of evidence suggests that these systems are at least somewhat effective, especially with respect to the pre-vention of medical errors (Trowbridge and Weingarten, 2001). Althoughsuch software is common in general health care, however, it is not highlydeveloped or widely available in M/SU health care (Morris et al., 2004).Other decision supports (some \"low tech\") include using memory/cognitionaids, such as protocols and checklists, and clinical pathways. Financing The financing of continuing education for M/SU practitioners has been identified as a critical issue (Daniels and Walter, 2002). Pharmaceuticalcompanies have been a major source of funding for continuing education inM/SU health care, but that support is being curtailed. Provider organiza-tions, which historically have financed a large share of the continuing edu-cation for their employees, also have substantially scaled back their trainingdepartments, staff, and programs, as well as travel support for continuingeducation conferences, as a result of severe budgetary pressures (IOM,2004b; Morris et al., 2004). The IOM report Keeping Patients Safe: Transforming the Work Envi- ronment of Nurses shows that the issue of continuing worker educationCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html308 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS and training is not unique to the health care industry. In many industries, the ongoing acquisition and management of knowledge by employees isincreasingly recognized as an essential responsibility of the employing orga-nization. Organizations need to play an active role in managing their learn-ing process and transferring knowledge quickly and efficiently to theiremployees. This organizational role is critical to supporting the continuinggrowth of clinicians' knowledge and skills (IOM, 2004b). In general health care, for example, hospitals with high retention of nurses in the face of nursing shortages (\"magnet hospitals\") are characterizedby the provision of high levels of postemployment training and education ofnursing staff, beginning with orientation and lasting several weeks to months(McClure et al., 2002). Developing and managing human skills and intel-lect\u2014more than managing physical and capital assets\u2014is increasingly recog-nized as a dominant concern of managers in successful companies (Quinn,1992). Given the career-long need for clinicians to maintain competencythrough the acquisition of new knowledge and skills and the essential role ofhealth care organizations in helping to meet this need, Keeping Patients Safe recommends that all health care organizations routinely dedicate a definedportion of budgetary resources to support for staff in their ongoing acquisi-tion and maintenance of knowledge and skills (IOM, 2004b). Organizational Support Extensive research has demonstrated that an individual's possession of required competencies by itself is not sufficient for safe and effective perfor-mance in the workplace (IOM, 2004b). When the organization in which anindividual works does not support and reward competency, the worker isnot likely to display competency on an ongoing basis (Hoge et al., 2005b;IOM, 2004b). In patient care, what matters is the clinician's performance , rather than the possession of necessary competencies. In the performance of clinical competencies, organizational characteristics are equally or moreinfluential than individual education, training, and other characteristics(IOM, 2004b). Advances in education for M/SU clinicians therefore need tobe coupled with efforts to help the organizations in which they work pro-vide the culture and other practice supports that allow and promote compe-tent performance (Hoge et al., 2005b). In addition to the many problems discussed above, M/SU clinicians' ability to provide high-quality care is compromised by their frequent isola-tion from their peers and colleagues from other disciplines as a result ofworking in individual, or solo, practices (discussed next). Solo practice doesnot facilitate building the infrastructure needed to take up new knowledgeand store, collect, and share the clinical information required to deliverhigh-quality collaborative patient care.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlINCREASING WORKFORCE CAPACITY FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT 309 MORE SOLO PRACTICE Many mental health clinicians report that individual practice is either their primary or secondary5 employment setting (Duffy et al., 2004) (see Table 7-2). Solo practice may impede the uptake of evidence-based practices and other changes needed in treatment settings. For example, as discussed inChapter 6, the size of health care organizations has been shown to berelated to the uptake of IT. Use of electronic health records (EHRs), forinstance, is typically found in larger health care organizations (Brailer andTerasawa, 2003), and the size of a practice has been found to be the maindeterminant of IT adoption for five clinical functions\u2014obtaining treatmentguidelines, exchanging clinical data with other physicians, accessing patientnotes, generating treatment reminders for physicians, and writing prescrip-tions. Indeed, physicians in solo or two-person practices are more thanthree times likelier to have limited IT support for patient care comparedwith large group practices of more than 50 physicians (Reed and Grossman,2004). Observations from experts in the use of information systems bymanaged behavioral health care organizations support this conclusion. With respect to administrative (as opposed to clinical) IT applications, smaller M/SU providers lag behind in the use of electronic claims submis-sion (Trabin and Maloney, 2003). Likewise, a random sample of 175 direc-tors of inpatient/residential, outpatient, and methadone maintenance pro- 5Many mental health practitioners work in multiple settings. For example, 60 percent of full-time psychiatrists reported working in two or more settings in 1998, as did 50 percent of psychologists, 20 percent of full-time counselors, and 29 percent of marriage/family therapistsin 2002. Rates were higher for part-time counselors (Duffy et al., 2004).TABLE 7-2 Percentage of Clinically Trained Specialty Mental Health Personnel Reporting Individual Practice as Their Primary or Secondary Place of Employment Primary Secondary Reporting Discipline Employment Employment Year Psychiatry 37.0 18.0 1998 Psychology 38.0 28.0 2002 Social work 18.5 27.1 2000Counseling 15.1 21.6 2002 Marriage/family therapy 34.9 28.5 2000 SOURCE: Duffy et al., 2004.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In contrast, most of those that were part of largerhospital or health systems had access to well-developed clinical informationsystems, e-mail, and Internet services (McLellan and Meyers, 2004). Mostpublic and private substance-use treatment programs are outside the pur-view of medical facilities where such technology might be more available.To the extent that other M/SU clinicians also provide care in solo or smallgroup practices, low adoption of IT to support clinical care may also bepresent. Differences in IT uptake are theorized to reflect differences inprovider size: larger groups and health maintenance organizations (HMOs)have readier access to capital and administrative support staff and theability to spread acquisition and implementation costs among more provid-ers (Reed and Grossman, 2004). Knowledge uptake and application require other resources for timely identification of scientific advances and innovations. For example, asdescribed in Chapter 4, SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-basedPrograms and Practices contains such information, but if no one in thecare delivery organization has the time or responsibility to review thisregistry of effective practices and provide the information to the organi-zation, improvements in care delivery are less likely to occur. Largeorganizations may have more capital resources and greater ability tocreate mechanisms for carrying out such activities; solo or smaller prac-tices may need to band together to achieve the economies of scale re-quired for this purpose (Berwick, 2003). In a study of the adoption ofclinical practice guidelines for treatment of attention deficit hyperactiv-ity disorder (ADHD), for example, having a solo practice was found tobe associated with a reduced likelihood of adopting the practice guide-lines (Rushton et al., 2004). Evidence shows that an organization will assimilate innovations more readily if it is large, mature, functionally differentiated (i.e., divided intosemiautonomous departments and units), and specialized, with foci of pro-fessional knowledge; if it has flexible resources to channel into new projects;and if it has decentralized decision-making structures. Size is almost cer-tainly a proxy for these characteristics (Greenhalgh et al., 2004). USE OF THE INTERNET AND OTHER COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR SERVICE DELIVERY In addition to the telephone, communication technologies such as video conferencing and the Internet are increasingly being used to evaluate, diag-nose, and provide M/SU services to people who lack face-to-face access tosuch services (Benderly, 2005) or prefer these other approaches. At a mini-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Like consumers of general health care services (Baker et al., 2003), many consumers of M/SU health care are already turning to the Internet toobtain information and support from peers to help them manage theirM/SU problems and illnesses (Lamberg, 2003). Indeed, the Internet may beespecially useful to consumers of M/SU health care as a source of clinicaltreatment. As some assert, \"while face-to-face contact with patients is cer-tainly desirable, the primary medium of treatment, psychotherapy, requiresno direct physical contact; many assessment and treatment services couldpotentially be delivered, at least in part, over the Internet\" (Flanagan andNeedham, 2003:312). However, use of the Internet to deliver M/SU health care carries sev- eral risks. One is the issue of the privacy and confidentiality of informa-tion transmitted by patients over the Internet\u2014information that, whentransmitted face to face and incorporated into the patient's health record,is subject to greater privacy protections than exist for general health care(see Chapter 5 and Appendix B). Other concerns relate to questions aboutthe safety and effectiveness of Internet-based therapy compared with tra-ditional face-to-face therapy, especially since the practitioner is unable toobserve the physical behaviors of the patient, which can inform experi-enced clinicians. Moreover, practitioners providing face-to-face care mustbe licensed by the state in which they practice\u2014typically the same state inwhich the patient resides. If a counselor in California delivers care to anindividual in Mississippi over the Internet, how is such a provider to becredentialed\u2014by the state in which he or she resides, in which the patientresides, or both? The Internet makes delivery of services by a single prac-titioner to individuals in all 50 states feasible. Should licensing berequired in all 50 states (Copeland and Martin, 2004; Flanagan andNeedham, 2003)? At present, \"consumers are able to find licensed, andfor that matter unlicensed, professionals offering therapy. . .online\" (Flan-agan and Needham, 2003:313). Despite these issues, there is no question that the communication tech- nology exists to provide M/SU care and that people are willing to use it. Forthe Internet, as for the telephone and video conferencing, providing carethat is clinically appropriate, therapeutically productive, and socially sup-portive requires that practitioners address issues of the technological pa-rameters of electronic service delivery, requisite systems for credentialingand credential verification, and the appropriate balance between face-to-face and electronic communications.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

They have also been thesubject of many short-lived, ad hoc initiatives that overall have failed toprovide the sustained leadership, attention, resources, and collaborationnecessary to resolve them. A chronology of these efforts is provided below.In the next section, the committee calls for a sustained, multiyear, collabo-rative initiative to address these issues, modeled after those created for thephysician and nursing workforces. 1956. The American Psychiatric Association Committee on Medical Education proposes a curriculum for teaching psychiatry in medical schoolsand recommends that physician training develop \"well-rounded physicians,who, in their relationships with all patients, recognize the importance ofunconscious motivation, the role of emotional maladjustment in the ideol-ogy and chronicity of illness, the emotional and personality problems en-gendered by various illnesses; and who habitually see the patient in hisfamily and general environmental setting\" (APA Committee on MedicalEducation, 1956:128). The committee also recommends that during thefirst 2 years, all medical students be exposed to themes of personalitygrowth, development, structure, and integration; adaptive needs; social andcultural forces affecting personality and behavior; the role of languageand mentation; the role played by emotions and physiological functioning;and psychopathology. 1961. In the final report of the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health, titled Action for Mental Health , the commission makes the following recommendation: \"Child specialists offer a considerable poten-tial for helping emotionally disturbed children, but in many cases lacksufficient psychiatric orientation to capitalize on this potential. The Na-tional Institute of Mental Health should provide support for resident train-ing programs in pediatrics that make well-designed efforts to incorporateadequate psychiatric information as a part of the pediatrician's graduatetraining. It should also provide stipends for pediatricians who wish to takepost-graduate courses in psychiatry. The aim is not to convert pediatriciansinto psychiatrists, but to increase the mental patient care resources of thecommunity in which the pediatrician practices\" (Joint Commission onMental Illness and Health, 1961: xiii). 1972. The National Association of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counse- lors is founded, in part to begin a national credentialing/certification pro-gram for addiction counselors (NAADAC, 2005). 1972-1982.

The Association for Medical Education and Research in Sub- stance Abuse (AMERSA) is created to expand education in substance-usehealth care for all health care professionals (Samet et al., 2006). 1976-1982. The National Institute of Mental Health Staff College is created to enhance the effectiveness of the leaders of federally funded com-munity mental health centers across the United States. It closes with achange in administrations in Washington. 1978. The President's Commission on Mental Health points out prob- lems in the M/SU workforce and recommends several actions to addressthem, including more systematic training for all mental health professionsin the social structures, beliefs, value systems, and patterns of various sub-cultures, and how to work with individuals from these subcultures intherapy. The commission also recommends multidisciplinary training toaddress what it identifies as \"problems of role-blurring, rivalries, and turfbattles\" (President's Commission on Mental Health, 1978:459). In addi-tion, the commission reaffirms the need to provide training in administra-tion in both the basic and continuing education curriculums of all mentalhealth professionals. 1978-1986. A 5-year doctorate in mental health at the University of California-Berkeley and the University of California-San Francisco Medi-cal School is initiated. The program aims to develop a new professioncombining three main areas of knowledge\u2014biological science, psycho-logical science, and social science\u2014in a clinical curriculum, with the goalof unifying the way behavioral health professionals are trained (Waller-stein, 1991). 1979. NIAAA initiates a State Manpower Development Program to provide categorical grant funding to each of the state alcoholism authoritiesfor the development of a manpower plan and training of treatment provid-ers. The program ends in 1982 when its funding is incorporated into blockgrants to states (IOM, 1990). 1984. NIAAA publishes core competencies and credentialing standards for counselors treating alcohol dependence (Birch and Davis Associates,1984). 1990. The IOM documents the \"serious lack of accurate, timely data at the national level\" on the workforce treating alcohol-use problems andillnesses and notes: \"This lack of data compromises efforts to plan forfuture training and professional needs. Fundamental questions for each ofthe disciplines involved cannot be answered. . . .As a consequence it is notpossible to formulate a forward-looking workforce training policy\" (IOM,1990:131).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General again docu- ments the inadequate supply of well-trained mental health professionals,especially those serving children and adolescents and individuals with se-vere mental illnesses, and those providing specific forms of psychotherapyeffective for many types of mental illnesses (DHHS, 1999). 2000. SAMHSA's National Treatment Plan Initiative for Improving Substance Abuse Treatment calls for a National Workforce DevelopmentOffice to secure valid, nationwide workforce data to guide policy makingand support development of the substance-use treatment workforce at thenational level. That office's efforts would address the implementation ofcore competency guidelines, credentialing standards, and other educationand training activities (SAMHSA, 2000). 2001-2002. The American College of Mental Health Administration (ACMHA) and the Academic Behavioral Health Consortium (ABHC) ini-tiate the Annapolis Coalition on Behavioral Health Workforce Educationto build national consensus on the nature of the problems facing the M/SUtreatment workforce and improve the quality and relevance of their educa-tion and training. The coalition's findings and recommendations are pub-lished in 2002 (Adams and Daniels, 2002; Daniels and Walter, 2002; Hoge,2002; Hoge and Morris, 2002; Hoge et al., 2002). 2002. The HRSA-AMERSA-SAMHSA/CSAT Interdisciplinary Project to Improve Health Professional Education in Substance Abuse issues astrategic plan to enable the nation's health professions workforce to carefor individuals with substance-use problems and illnesses. The plan makes12 recommendations for the Secretary of DHHS, the U.S Surgeon General,other federal agencies, and agencies and organizations in the public andprivate sectors, calling for, in part, the creation of a Secretary's AdvisoryCommittee on Health Professions Education on Substance-Use Disorders; aSurgeon General's report on the state of substance abuse prevention andtreatment, similar to the Surgeon General's report on mental health; theconvening of a national forum on health professions education onsubstance-use disorders; the creation of national centers of excellence forleadership in interdisciplinary faculty development; and other mechanismsto strengthen workforce competencies in substance-use health care (Haackand Adger, 2002). 2003.

This lack of education,training, or supervision leads to a workforce that is ill-equipped to use thelatest breakthroughs in modern medicine\" (p. 70). The commission furtherstates that the mental health field needs \"a comprehensive strategic plan toimprove workforce recruitment, retention, diversity, and skills training\"and calls on DHHS to \"initiate and coordinate a public-private partnershipto undertake such a strategy\" (p. 75). 2004. The Annapolis Coalition on Behavioral Health Workforce Edu- cation convenes a national meeting that generates 10 consensus recommen-dations to guide the development of M/SU health care workforce compe-tencies (Hoge et al., 2005a). 2005. SAMHSA contracts with the Annapolis Coalition on the Behav- ioral Health Workforce to develop a national strategic plan on workforcedevelopment by December 2005. NEED FOR A SUSTAINED COMMITMENT TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE Some changes have taken place as result of the initiatives described above. In general, however, M/SU health care professionals are trained theway they have been for many years, and problems such as maldistributionand the lack of representation of minorities in the workforce have improvedonly slightly, if at all. Despite significant efforts, attempts to train non-psychiatric physicians to do a better job of caring for people with M/SUproblems and illnesses have not been particularly effective. Broader effortsto bring about similar changes in the M/SU treatment workforce overallhave had similar results. The committee finds, as others have before, that without a properly trained, culturally relevant, and appropriately distributed M/SU health careworkforce, significant improvements in the quality of care are not likely.The committee further finds that the problems that attenuate the effective-ness of the M/SU health workforce in America are so complex that theyrequire an ongoing, priority commitment of attention and resources, asopposed to the short-term, ad hoc initiatives that have often characterizedresponses to the problem in the past. As noted above, the committee recom-mends that the approach used to educate and train other key providers(physicians and nurses) in the health care workforce, as described below, beemployed to marshal the sustained attention, collaboration, and resourcesneeded to produce a stronger M/SU health care workforce.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Council members include \"representatives of practicingprimary care physicians, national and specialty physician organizations,international medical graduates, medical student and house staff associa-tions, schools of medicine and osteopathy, public and private teachinghospitals, health insurers, business, and labor. Federal representation in-cludes the Assistant Secretary for Health, the U.S. Department of Healthand Human Services (DHHS); the Administrator of the Centers for Medi-care and Medicaid Services; and the Chief Medical Director of the VeteransAdministration.\" COGME advises and makes recommendations to the Sec-retary of DHHS; the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor andPensions; and the House of Representatives Committee on Commerce. The charge to COGME is broader than its name implies. Its authoriz- ing legislation requires its advice and recommendations to address the fol-lowing (HRSA, 2002): The supply and distribution of physicians in the United States. Current and future shortages or excesses of physicians in specialties and subspecialties. Related federal policies, including the financing of undergraduate and graduate medical education programs and the types of medical educa-tion and training in the latter programs. Efforts to be carried out by hospitals, educational institutions, and accrediting bodies with respect to these matters, including changes in un-dergraduate and graduate medical education programs. Improvements needed in databases concerning the supply and dis- tribution of, and postgraduate training programs for, physicians in theUnited States and steps that should be taken to eliminate those deficiencies. COGME periodically studies and issues reports on these issues that have been influential in health care policy arenas. While these reports have some-times been controversial (Phillips et al., 2005), they have been successful infocusing national attention on the issues and stimulating policy responses. National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice The National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice (NACNEP) was established as the Advisory Council on Nurse Training in1964 and renamed in 1988. It similarly advises the Secretary of DHHS andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Amongits reports are the following: Basic Registered Nurse Workforce , National Informatics Agenda for Nursing Education and Practice , Collaborative Education to Ensure Patient Safety , A National Agenda for Nursing Work- force Racial/Ethnic Diversity , Federal Support for the Preparation of the Nurse Practitioner Workforce through Title VIII , and Federal Support for the Preparation of the Clinical Nurse Specialist Workforce through TitleVIII. The efforts of COGME and NACNEP have resulted in a number of accomplishments in workforce development. With respect to furtheringinterdisciplinary education and practice, for example, the two workedtogether to produce the report Collaborative Education to Ensure Patient Safety (COGME and NACNEP, 2000), which makes recommendations pertaining to faculty development, quality improvement, interdisciplinarycollaboration, and competency development. These recommendations fos-tered cooperative agreements with public and private nonprofit entities thatwere cosponsored by HRSA's nursing and medicine divisions (NACNEP,2002). Recommendations To secure sustained attention and resources for the development of the M/SU treatment workforce similar to what has been accomplished for thephysician and nurse workforces, the committee makes the following recom-mendations: Recommendation 7-1. To ensure sustained attention to the develop- ment of a stronger M/SU health care workforce, Congress should au-thorize and appropriate funds to create and maintain a Council on theMental and Substance-Use Health Care Workforce as a public-privatepartnership. Recognizing that the quality of M/SU services is depen-dent upon a highly competent professional workforce, the councilshould develop and implement a comprehensive plan for strengtheningthe quality and capacity of the workforce to improve the quality ofM/SU services substantially by: Identifying the specific clinical competencies that all M/SU pro- fessionals must possess to be licensed or certified and the compe-tencies that must be maintained over time. Developing national standards for the credentialing and licensure of M/SU providers to eliminate differences in the standards nowCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html318 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS used by the states. Such standards should be based on core com- petencies and should be included in curriculums and educationprograms across all the M/SU disciplines. Proposing programs to be funded by government and the private sector to address and resolve such long-standing M/SU workforceissues as diversity, cultural relevance, faculty development, andcontinuing shortages of the well-trained clinicians and consumerproviders needed to work with children and the elderly; and ofprograms for training competent clinician administrators. Providing a continuing assessment of M/SU workforce trends, is- sues, and financing policies. Measuring the extent to which the plan's objectives have been met and reporting annually to the nation on the status of theM/SU workforce. Soliciting technical assistance from public-private partnerships to facilitate the work of the council and the efforts of educationaland accreditation bodies to implement its recommendations. Recommendation 7-2. Licensing boards, accrediting bodies, and pur- chasers should incorporate the competencies and national standardsestablished by the Council on the Mental and Substance-Use HealthCare Workforce in discharging their regulatory and contracting re-sponsibilities. Recommendation 7-3. The federal government should support the de- velopment of M/SU faculty leaders in health professions schools, suchas schools of nursing and medicine, and in schools and programs thateducate M/SU professionals, such as psychologists and social workers.The aim should be to narrow the gaps among what is known throughresearch, what is taught, and what is done by those who provide M/SUservices. Recommendation 7-4. To facilitate the development and implementa- tion of core competencies across all M/SU disciplines, institutions ofhigher education should place much greater emphasis on interdiscipli-nary didactic and experiential learning and should bring together fac-ulty and trainees from their various education programs. The committee calls particular attention to two components of recom- mendation 7-1. First, the recommendation calls for a public-private part-nership to address the problems plaguing the M/SU workforce. Federalleadership can provide sustained national policy attention to these prob-lems and unique influence with the educational institutions and theirCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, the committee strongly recommends thatthe council seek out AMERSA and the Annapolis Coalition as partners inthis process. Second, with respect to the portion of recommendation 7-1 that calls for the Council on the Mental and Substance-Use Health Care Workforceto provide \"an ongoing assessment of M/SU workforce trends, issues, andfinancing policies,\" the committee underscores the paucity of comprehen-sive and reliable data on the M/SU workforce that it encountered in con-ducting this study. Thus the committee strongly recommends the inclusionof a mechanism or mechanisms for collecting better data on the M/SUworkforce as a part of the process for assessing workforce trends andissues.

The feasibility of manyof these changes depends on how accommodating the marketplaceis to them, particularly with respect to the ways in which purchasersof mental and/or substance-use (M/SU) health care exercise theirmarketplace roles. The M/SU health care marketplace has some unique features that distinguish it from the general health care marketplace. Theseinclude the dominance of government (state and local) purchasers,the frequent purchase of insurance for M/SU health care separatelyfrom that for other health care (i.e., the use of \"carve-out\"arrangements), the tendency of the private insurance marketplaceto avoid covering or to offer more-limited coverage to individualswith M/SU illnesses, and government purchasers' greater use ofdirect provision and purchase of care rather than insurancearrangements. Attending to these differences is essential if themarketplace is to promote quality improvement in M/SU healthcare. The committee recommends four ways of strengthening themarketplace to this end.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This section reviews the key features of the market-place for M/SU health care that distinguish it from that for other types ofcare. Dominance of Government Purchasing Recent estimates suggest that payment for roughly 63 percent of mental health care and 76 percent of substance-use treatment is made by publicsources (Mark et al., 2005). Figure 8-1 shows the distribution of spendingfor M/SU care by major sources of payment as of 2001.

For substance-use treatment, a larger majority (68percent) of spending is on direct government grants and contracts withproviders. The implication is that payments for substance-use services aremost frequently allocated outside of markets. When private spending is alsoconsidered, approximately 56 percent of all payments for mental healthcare are made through insurance mechanisms, as opposed to out-of-pocketpayments, grants, donations, and other sources of private financing. Incontrast, only 27 percent of private payments for substance-use treatmentflows through insurance arrangements. Again, this suggests a somewhatlesser impact of insurance market failure on substance-use care. The implication of these figures is that choices about the level and composition of spending on M/SU health care are affected by a mix ofmarket and political forces and that these forces differ for health care formental and substance-use conditions. The willingness to pay for treatmentfor M/SU problems and illnesses is expressed through private markets forhealth insurance; political decisions about the design of public insurance;and the categorical program budgets of federal, state, and local agenciescharged with providing such treatment. Purchase of M/SU Health Insurance Separately from General Health Insurance Insurance for M/SU health care is governed by a distinctive set of arrangements. Although the proportion has been declining in recent years,most Americans (64 percent in 2002) under the age of 65 continue toreceive health care through insurance provided by either their own em-ployer or that of a family member (Fronstin, 2003). The terms under whichindividuals choose insurance and under which health plans compete toprovide it are defined by organizations that purchase the insurance in themarketplace. Employers, state governments as administrators of Medicaidprograms, and the federal government through the Medicare program alldefine the rules under which markets for health insurance operate. Larger employers allow employees and their dependents to choose among a number of insurers and products (e.g., preferred provider organi-zation, health maintenance organization) in competitive insurance markets.Smaller employers frequently offer only a single insurance plan to theiremployees. Some large employers focus special attention on M/SU coverageand spending. In these cases, employers separate the insurance risk forM/SU treatment from that for other health insurance, and create what havebecome known as managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO)carve-out contracts (Frank and McGuire, 2000). Under such circumstances,an employee has no choice of coverage for M/SU health care since theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html328 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS benefit is managed by a single organization, regardless of the options avail- able for general health care. Approximately 20 percent of privately insuredpeople are covered under such a carve-out arrangement. For most of theremaining 80 percent, their private general health plan enters into a subcon-tract with a carve-out MBHO to manage its M/SU care benefit. In this case,employees and their dependents can choose among both general and M/SUhealth care benefits across a set of health plans. Finally, some health plansoffer M/SU coverage that is integrated with the rest of the health insurancerisk; such plans represent a modest share of the private market. Medicaid, the federal-state government program that focuses on the poor and disabled, includes managed care arrangements and insurance thatfollows the principles of fee-for-service-indemnity health insurance. UnderMedicaid managed care, the use of MBHO carve-outs mirrors the approachtaken by private insurance. Roughly 16 states have direct payer carve-outcontracts with MBHOs (CMS, 2004). Most Medicaid managed care plansnot operating in environments where the Medicaid program has a directcarve-out have subcontracts with carve-out vendors. More Limited Insurance Coverage While nearly all private insurance plans offer some coverage for treat- ment of M/SU illnesses, the coverage is often substantially more limitedthan that for other medical conditions (Barry et al., 2003). In 2002, 96percent of people with employer-based coverage had inpatient M/SU cover-age, and 98 percent had outpatient coverage; these figures represent a smallincrease over the proportion of insured covered for these treatments in1991. M/SU services are typically subject to limits on the number of annualreimbursable outpatient visits and inpatient days. Approximately 74 per-cent of covered employees have limits on outpatient visits and 65 percentlimits on inpatient days. The fee-for-service component of Medicaid pays for a range of mental health services. Because there is little reliance on consumer cost sharing, how-ever, rationing of supply is common. This is a side effect of below-marketpayment rates for providers, especially providers of ambulatory care. Theresult is low participation rates in Medicaid among office-based clinicians, suchas psychiatrists and psychologists. Coverage for substance-use care under Med-icaid is considerably more limited than that for mental health services (McCartyet al., 1999). Inpatient care for mental illnesses in adults under the age of 65 is limited to general hospitals under the so-called Institutions for Mental Disease(IMD) exclusion provisions of the original enabling Medicaid legislation. Thusthe breadth of providers available is limited to a subset of those that supplyinpatient psychiatric and substance-use treatment (for a detailed discussion andhistory of the IMD provisions, see HCFA, 1992).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

A small portion (about 14 percent) of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled inmanaged care plans that contract with the Medicare program to offer servicesto Medicare beneficiaries (CMS, 2005). Traditional Medicare (the indemnity component) covers M/SU care. Outpatient coverage carries relatively highcost sharing (50 percent), except for medication management (20 percent).Inpatient coverage is largely on the same basis as that for other medicalconditions, with one exception: treatment in specialty psychiatric hospitals islimited to 190 days over an individual recipient's lifetime. Also, psychiatriccare is covered under a form of prospective payment that differs from thecase-based diagnosis-related group (DRG) system used in Medicare generally. Frequent Direct Provision and Purchase of Care by State and Local Governments A unique feature of the structure of service delivery for M/SU health care is the large role assigned to public hospitals and clinics and to non-insurance-based purchase of services by state and local governments. In theUnited States, state and local governments directly deliver or purchase thebulk of M/SU services. Thus, financing relies on state and local tax revenuesinstead of individual consumer premiums or federal government funding,although the federal government plays a larger role in funding the directpurchase of substance-use treatment services through the federal blockgrants to states. Further, nearly all states operate under balanced-budgetstatutes. As a result, the political competition for funding of public servicesis intense. Funding for M/SU services is frequently pitted against that forroads, schools, and prisons in state budgeting processes. State and localgovernments pay for direct provision of M/SU services through networks ofcommunity-based providers that commonly serve a catchment area with adefined population. These community-based providers are most often pri-vate nonprofit organizations and are generally long-time incumbents intheir service delivery role. Public M/SU services therefore resemble a monopolyarrangement whereby state and local governments grant a franchise to anonprofit care provider agency. Thus, the delivery of M/SU care in the United States is organized and financed through a patchwork of insurance and direct provision of services.In some cases, markets play a prominent role in resource allocation; inothers, government and administrative practices are central in shaping whatservices are delivered and which people are served. In all cases, powerfulinstitutions are involved in the purchase of the services. Understanding howthese approaches to purchasing operate and what effects they have on themarketplace may help in identifying ways to facilitate improvements in thequality of care for people with M/SU problems and illnesses.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Purchase Through Competitive Insurance Markets: Competition for Enrollees One common approach to the purchase of insurance is for an employer or a state Medicaid program to select a group of health plans that will bepermitted to compete for its enrollees. The payer first establishes a set ofcriteria that plans wishing to compete for its enrollees must meet. Suchcriteria typically address benefit design, performance, and cost. Programsthat meet these criteria are then permitted to compete for enrollees, who areoffered information on benefit structure and some quality indicators foreach plan offered. In most cases, enrollees face premiums that are subsi-dized (zero in the case of Medicaid). In theory, payments made by the payerto the plan create incentives for efficient provision of services. Competitionfor enrollees should be less oriented toward price because of the subsidyand thus should promote consumer choice based on quality. The combina-tion of capitation payments and quality competition among plans shouldlead to a reasonable balance between cost and quality. However, competition for enrollees in the presence of risk-based premi- ums (e.g., capitation) also has some well-known drawbacks (Cutler andZeckhauser, 2000; IOM, 1993). This type of purchasing creates financialincentives for health plans to adopt policies that discourage high-cost indi-viduals from enrolling. These incentives also may result in uneven coverageacross therapeutic areas and potentially uneven quality. Ideally, health plans would ration care so that the incremental contri- butions to health of spending on each type of service (e.g., cancer care,heart disease treatment, and mental health) would be equal. This approachwould guarantee the maximum level of health for a population given afixed budget (as is implied by capitation payments). Under a fixed-paymentarrangement, however, competitive health plans have incentives to departfrom such an ideal allocation strategy. Specifically, since people with M/SUillnesses are more costly to insure and payments to health plans do notrecognize those differences, plans have an incentive to avoid enrolling per-sons with such illnesses. An example comes from recent analyses of theMedical Expenditure Panel Survey (Anderson and Knickman, 2001; Drusset al., 2001) showing that per capita health spending for people with mooddisorders is more than four times that for individuals without such illnesses.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlUSING MARKETPLACE INCENTIVES TO LEVERAGE NEEDED CHANGE 331 Incentives to avoid enrolling these people create a serious threat to quality of care through health insurance. In insurance markets where M/SU services are part of the general risk pool, competition is reoriented to avoiding \"bad risks.\" One result is thatplans limit coverage for conditions, such as M/SU illnesses, that attracthigh-cost enrollees. Low-cost individuals gravitate toward health plans of-fering limited insurance coverage at a lower premium, leaving the sickestenrollees in plans with relatively generous coverage. If premiums do notreflect differences in the enrolled population, plans offering more generouscoverage will lose money; the result can be a so-called \"death spiral\" incoverage for treatment of M/SU illnesses. The Federal Employees HealthBenefit Program (FEHBP) during the 1980s and 1990s offers an importantcase study of this phenomenon. In 1980, the FEHBP was viewed as modelfor mental health coverage; at that time, 7.8 percent of the program'sspending was devoted to treatment of mental illnesses. By 1997, the cover-age offered had deteriorated to involve high levels of cost sharing and strictlimits on inpatient days and outpatient visits. Observed spending on mentalhealth as a share of total health spending had declined to 1.9 percent (Footeand Jones, 1999; Padgett et al., 1993). Quality of care can be affected by the same market dynamics as those associated with selection incentives. In the era of managed care and itsoffshoots, those same competitive incentives can result in markets for healthinsurance supplying insufficient levels of service and quality of care forM/SU illnesses. The hallmark of the modern health plan is that a variety ofnew rationing mechanisms\u2014including provider payment strategies, priorauthorization programs, and the design of provider networks\u2014are substi-tuted for traditional demand-side cost-sharing features. Miller and Luft(1997:20) highlight this point: Under the simple capitation payment arrangements that now exist, plans and providers face strong financial disincentives to excel in the care for the sickest and most expensive patients. Plans that develop a strong repu-tation for excellence in quality of care for the sickest will attract new higher-cost enrollees. . . . The implication is that health plans can use administrative mechanisms to compete to avoid \"bad risks.\" Rationing so as not to offer the best qualityof M/SU health care in a market represents one method of trying to avoid agroup of high-cost enrollees. Nothing in the modern market for health insur-ance has diminished the incentives to avoid enrolling high-cost individuals.Moreover, the evidence of market outcomes consistent with selection incen-tives for people with M/SU illnesses is strong (Cao, 2003; Cao and McGuire,2003; Deb et al., 1996; Ellis, 1985; Frank et al., 2000; Normand et al., 2003).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html332 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS There are two means by which a health plan can affect the intensity of rationing of M/SU health care when it (rather then the employer or othergroup purchaser) carves out behavioral health care: through the level atwhich it sets the carve-out health plan's budget (via the capitation rate) andthrough the performance requirements specified in a contract. It is commonto see capitation rates of $2.00 or less per member per month, a figuregenerally viewed as being consistent with a minimal level of care. Direct Purchase of Carve-Out Services by Group Payers A second prominent approach to purchasing insurance coverage for M/SU health care is for the payer to purchase carve-out services directly.This approach involves separating the risks associated with care for theseillnesses from general health care risks and entering into specific contractsfor coverage of M/SU care. Such direct purchase of carve-out services isused by approximately one-third of large employers (5,000 employees ormore), 5 percent of midsized employers, and about 16 state Medicaid pro-grams (Hodgkin et al., 2000; CMS, 2004). This method of purchasingremoves M/SU health care from competition for enrollees, thereby attenu-ating the selection incentives concerning coverage and quality discussedabove. However, use of such carve-out arrangements has implications forcare coordination (see Chapter 5). Direct purchase of carve-out M/SU services by group health care payers uses competition as the means of awarding contracts for these services.That is, a payer will frequently solicit proposals and bids from MBHOcarve-out vendors to manage the M/SU health care for a defined popula-tion. The requests for proposals specify the areas of performance on whichthe contract will be awarded. The most common areas of performance arecosts, responses of the utilization management system (e.g., speed of tele-phone response to member calls, speed of referral to a provider), and planmember satisfaction. There is, of course, considerable variation in the spe-cifics, with some payers developing relatively elaborate measures of accessand quality. However, the typical contract specifies few indicators of clini-cal quality, such as depression medication measures. State Medicaid programs typically operate under state procurement regulations that place great emphasis on pursuing the lowest-cost bid if it is\"technically acceptable\" to reviewers of the proposal. It should be notedthat many states include consumers of M/SU services as advisers to the statein the procurement of MBHO carve-out services. Private payers commonlyuse consultants as advisers in their procurement process. The market for MBHO carve-out services consists of several large national vendors (e.g., United Behavioral Health, Magellan, and Value-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlUSING MARKETPLACE INCENTIVES TO LEVERAGE NEEDED CHANGE 333 Options), several smaller national firms (e.g., CIGNA Behavioral Health, PacifiCare Behavioral Health), and numerous smaller regional vendors (e.g.,Beacon Health Strategies in the northeast). Competition for contracts isvery intense, resulting in aggressively priced bids. In both the public andprivate sectors, disproportionate weight is usually placed on the cost por-tion of the proposal. States in particular are reluctant to deviate fromawarding contracts to organizations other than the lowest-cost bidder.While private purchasers have greater flexibility in selecting vendors, they,too, commonly place heavy emphasis on price in awarding a contract. Thisemphasis on price, together with the limited use of quality measures in mostprocurements, creates an incentive for MBHO carve-out vendors to geartheir care management practices to meet cost goals, possibly at the expenseof quality. Payers are left to rely on complaints and highly visible indicatorsof quality deficits to identify a quality-of-care problem. Widespread evidence shows that MBHO carve-out programs reduce spending on both mental health and substance-use treatment (Frank andLave, 2003; Frank et al., 1995; Sturm, 1999), although the evidence to dateon the impact on quality of care is limited and mixed (Barry et al., 2003; seeFrank and Lave, 2003, for a recent review). Studies of early programstypically showed no differences in quality (Busch, 2002; Dickey et al.,1998; Merrick, 1998). Findings of two more recent studies, however, sug-gest that people with severe mental illnesses may be especially disadvan-taged under MBHO carve-out arrangements in the context of state Medic-aid programs. Manning and colleagues (1999) compared outcomes forpatients with schizophrenia enrolled in a capitated carve-out program withthose for similar patients whose care was paid for under fee-for-servicearrangements. They found that people with schizophrenia in the carve-outprogram showed less improvement than those in fee-for-service arrange-ments (Manning et al., 1999). Busch and colleagues used data from onestate Medicaid program to study indicators of the quality of care based onthe schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) recommenda-tions. Their comparison of a capitated MBHO carve-out and a primarycare case management system found comparable quality of medicationmanagement under the two approaches, but substantially lower quality ofpsychosocial treatment under the capitated carve-out arrangement (Buschet al., 2004). The above evidence suggests how MBHO carve-out arrangements alter the quality of care relative to fee-for-service arrangements. The more gen-eral question is whether existing levels of quality of care are sufficient. Theevidence from several studies is that levels of care under both arrangementsare lower than desired (Lehman and Steinwachs, 1998; McGlynn et al.,2003; Young et al., 2001).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html334 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Purchase of Services by Carve-Out Organizations Carve-out vendors operate under very specific contracts. These con- tracts specify the benefit structure within which the MBHO carve-out hasresponsibility for managing care. They also specify the responsibilities ofthe carve-out vendor with respect to the services being managed. Paymentarrangements, risk bearing, and performance standards are all established,as is the structure of the provider network. Virtually all carve-out contractsexclude prescription drugs from the services managed by the MBHO, aswell as from the budget that is to be managed. The implication is that carve-out contracts are not \"economically neutral\"; that is, there are economicincentives favoring the use of medications over other components of treat-ment. In effect, psychotropic drugs are \"free\" to carve-out vendors, whilethey must pay market prices for hospital care and professional services. Indeed, empirical analyses of treatment patterns show that patients treated for particular illnesses (e.g., depression) under a carve-out arrange-ment are more likely to be treated with medication\u2014and medication alone\u2014than are otherwise similar patients whose care is not managed under such acontract (Berndt et al., 1997; Busch, 2002). Other studies have shown thatfollowing implementation of a carve-out arrangement, spending on psycho-tropic drugs has increased, other factors being held constant (Ling et al.,2003; Norton et al., 1999). The result is that savings from carve-out pro-grams come from reduced use of inpatient and outpatient specialty M/SUcare. Increases in prescription drug spending serve to reduce some of thesavings otherwise realized by the group purchaser. In modern health care markets, it is rare for a single health plan to cover 30 percent of insured patients in a market. When individual healthplans account for 5-20 percent of patients, a typical provider or profes-sional may literally do business with dozens of plans. Thus, a physician mayface a dozen formulary arrangements, many sets of clinical guidelines, anarray of compensation arrangements, and numerous reporting requirementsfor any particular condition. In such cases, the impact on provider behaviorof financial incentives or other directives specified in any one health planwill be quite diluted. Research has shown that physician practices appear tomanage their operations in a manner that is responsive to the overall com-position of their payer arrangements (e.g., the most frequent incentivescheme). This means that in general, an individual health plan has littleability to influence provider behavior if its approach differs from that com-monly encountered in a practice (Glied and Zivin, 2002). The MBHO carve-out market has consolidated notably since the early 1990s. At that time, there were nearly a dozen significant national vendors;today there are three or four. The implication is that in local markets forM/SU health care, individual carve-out companies may account for a largerCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

It is relatively common for a carve-out vendor to account for 30-50 percent of a market.This means carve-out vendors have the potential to affect the delivery ofM/SU health care in a manner that health plans alone cannot. The consoli-dation of the carve-out marketplace serves to increase the potential bar-gaining power of the larger carve-out vendors. That bargaining power isachieved because a carve-out vendor can direct patients away from provid-ers that offer prices or other dimensions of performance not consistent withthe vendor's economic and clinical aims. The result is a considerable amountof power not only in setting prices, but also potentially in establishingstandards of care. To date, the MBHO carve-out industry has used its power to (1) in- crease access to care (as measured by utilization rates), (2) reduce utiliza-tion of inpatient care for both mental health and substance-use care, (3)reduce provider payments, and (4) reduce the duration of some ambulatoryepisodes of treatment. The exertion of pricing power on the one handcontributes to cost control. However, excessive price reductions can de-crease the effective supply of providers that are willing to participate inmanaged behavioral health care networks. This in turn creates the appear-ance of a shortage for enrollees and managers of those plans, even thoughthere is no shortage in the aggregate. Low prices can result as well in anundersupply of quality (to be discussed further in the context of Medicaid).Yet the consolidation of the market also creates an opportunity to influenceprovider behavior in the service of quality improvement. The possession ofmarket power with respect to providers means that efforts to improvequality will be less diluted than is typical in the health sector generally.Some managed behavioral health care initiatives have used this marketpower to both reduce costs and improve quality. When the MassachusettsMedicaid program instituted a managed behavioral health care carve-outprogram in the early 1990s, the number of inpatient providers supplyingcare to Medicaid enrollees with M/SU illnesses was reduced by about 30percent. Hospitals were eliminated from the program based in part onhistorical performance on quality, as well as price (Callahan et al., 1995;Frank and McGuire, 1997). The result was reduced inpatient spending andconstant or improved quality of inpatient care. The implication is thatnetwork design can be used to exert economic power not only to controlspending, but also to improve quality. Purchase of Services in Traditional Medicaid Programs State Medicaid programs typically cover and pay for a wide range of services for the treatment of mental illnesses. Coverage for treatment ofsubstance-use illnesses is far less consistent across the states (McCarty et al.,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html336 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS 1999). On the mental health side, the array of services covered by Medicaid is consistent with the provision of evidence-based treatment. This is oftennot the case for treatment of substance-use illnesses. Traditional Medicaidprograms purchase ambulatory services on a fee-for-service basis. States usea variety of arrangements to pay for hospital services. These range fromprospective per diem rates, to per case prospective payment, to the occa-sional use of prospective budgets. Prescription drugs are paid for under a\"most favored nation\" arrangement, whereby Medicaid is guaranteed thebest private price (Scott-Morton, 1997). Under the traditional Medicaidstructure, a state's ability to use cost sharing to control costs and utilizationis minimal. Thus traditional Medicaid relies on setting prices for ambula-tory services at rates below market levels. Those prices reduce providerwillingness to accept reimbursement and participate in the program. Pay-ment levels are therefore low, and the quantity of care is constrained by theavailable supply. Data from the mid-1990s show that among physicians,psychiatrists had the lowest rate of Medicaid participation (Perloff et al.,1995). Only about 28 percent of psychiatrists were full participants inMedicaid, compared with 56 percent of all specialists and 36 percent ofprimary care physicians. These low rates of payment and participation aregenerally thought to be consistent with lower-quality care (Rowland andTallon, 2003). Hospital payment rates have also tended to be somewhatlower than market rates; as a result of congressional action and litigation,however, the differential is smaller than is the case for ambulatory services(MEDPAC, 2003). Publicly Budgeted Systems of Care The ways in which publicly budgeted M/SU services are organized and funded varies greatly across the 50 states (Lutterman and Hogan, 2001).Substance-use treatment services are far more reliant on direct fundingthrough state and local government than is mental health care (Figure 8-1).Yet while there is tremendous variation in the details of how intergovern-mental transfers are designed and organized within both the public mentalhealth and substance-use treatment systems, some common features ger-mane to the analysis of quality are found with considerable frequency. First, organizations that receive funds directly from state and local government for the treatment of substance use are frequently responsiblefor geographic catchment areas that serve a defined population. In the caseof community mental health centers, nearly 60 percent of revenues repre-sent direct grants and contracts from federal, state, and local government(DHHS, 2002). This figure tends to be even higher for agencies that supplyprimarily substance-use treatment (Tabulations from the National DrugAbuse Treatment System Survey). Within a defined population, these agen-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Some are \"insured\" by Medicaid, but many are uninsured (e.g., 20 percent of people with severemental illness [McAlpine and Mechanic, 2000]). State and local mental health budgets have been under great pressure for some time. In the first years of the new century, a recession and statebudget crises forced cuts in most social service programs. A longer-termproblem on the mental health front is that an increasing share of stategeneral fund allocations for mental health services is being allocated to thestates' Medicaid matching obligations (Frank et al., 2003). In the substance-use area, modest growth rates in the funding of the federal block grants tostates have further stressed states' abilities to fund local agencies servingpoor people with substance-use illnesses. For example, from 2003 to 2004,the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant grew by just1.4 percent (www.samhsa.gov/budget/B2005/spending/cj_12.aspx). The fact that publicly funded M/SU treatment providers typically are (1) well-established nonprofit agencies with exclusive responsibility for pro-viding treatment for low-income, uninsured populations and (2) fundedthrough grant mechanisms or prospectively set budgets with volume re-quirements (Alexander et al., 2002; Frank and Goldman, 1989) createsincentives that can conflict with the provision of high-quality care. In effect,these agencies commonly face fixed budgets, excess demand for services (asevidenced by waiting lines), and no competition. Moreover, because agen-cies are responsible for serving defined populations, there tend to be con-sumer-based and political pressures to minimize waiting lists and serve asmany people as possible (see Lindsay [1976] and Michael [1980] for ex-amples of economic models of public provision of general and mentalhealth care). The result is that economic and political forces reinforce anemphasis on maximizing the number of people served, possibly at the ex-pense of investments in quality. State and local governments have littleleverage in such cases even if their goals differ because the agencies are ineffect monopoly franchises. Thus, state and local governments concernedabout quality levels cannot easily direct consumers to other providers. PROCUREMENT AND THE CONSUMER ROLE The purchasing arrangements described above shape the role of the consumer of M/SU treatment services. They also affect the market out-comes stemming from active consumerism. The modern consumer movement in health care dates back to the 1960s, when President Kennedy set forth a consumer bill of rights in his\"Consumer Message\" of 1962 (Tomes, 1999). This action coincided withthe deinstitutionalization movement in mental health and widespread dis-satisfaction with institutional psychiatry. The result was an energized pa-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

It was during the 1960s and 1970sthat people who used M/SU treatment services began to call themselvesconsumers (Chu and Trotter, 1972). Yet the notion of consumerism in theM/SU sector went beyond that of individuals empowered to exercise choicein the marketplace; rather, it involved the exercise of \"voice.\" That is,through the strategic use of lawsuits and active lobbying, federal and stategovernments began to directly address the concerns of patients and theirfamilies (Tomes, 1999). In recent years, however, the fragmentation offinancing for treatment of M/SU illnesses has made it more difficult to focusthe consumer's voice. For example, the state mental health agency is nolonger the primary payer and regulator of mental health services in moststates; Medicaid now has that responsibility (Frank et al., 2003). The consumer role also involves a more commercial or market-oriented set of activities whereby consumers seek to obtain services that offer themix of price and quality that best suits their needs. This role typicallyinvolves obtaining and processing information on the cost and quality ofvarious health care services, including health insurance. Privately insured people frequently have a choice of health insurance plans. However, evidence to date suggests that consumers make little use ofinformation on quality and frequently focus primarily on price. In the caseof those with M/SU illnesses, the selection incentives described earlier leadto the troubling result that greater choice and consumerism tend to com-promise the coverage and quality of services offered by health plans. Thisholds true for Medicaid managed care arrangements that rely on healthplans competing for enrollees. The presence of payer carve-outs diminishesconsumer choice in coverage for M/SU treatment coverage and focuseschoice on providers. In traditional Medicaid programs, there is no insur-ance choice as is the case in traditional Medicare (Parts A and B). Insured consumers of treatment for M/SU problems and illnesses (and those covered by Medicare) commonly have a good deal of choice amongproviders. Like all health care consumers, however, those seeking help forM/SU illnesses must choose among a large number of providers that arehighly heterogeneous with respect to training, therapeutic orientation, tech-nical capabilities, and expertise in specific types of problems (see Chap-ter 7), and there is little consistent information on provider performance ina typical consumer's choice set. Furthermore, these choices must be made inthe context of complex coverage and payment arrangements. It is commonfor a privately insured person to have coverage for mental health care thatinvolves a deductible, coinsurance, and then a limit on coverage after aspecific number of visits or days of care. In addition, some providers are \"innetwork\" while others are \"out,\" which means that coinsurance rates willdiffer. Also, as discussed previously, consumers of M/SU treatment servicesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Finally, M/SU illnesses can affect aconsumer's outlook and attitude toward treatment (e.g., pessimism amongthose with depression), thereby influencing the ability to exercise commer-cial aspects of the consumer role. Consumers who rely on traditional Medicaid or providers that are directly funded by state and local governments have very limited choices ofproviders. Because budgeted systems are most often organized as franchisesthat cover catchment areas, consumerism does not play a role in determin-ing the quality or price of services. These are the types of providers thathave been the focus of lobbying by advocacy groups and lawsuits by publicinterest lawyers. Thus consumerism in this subsector has come to mean theexercise of voice. Without fundamental change in the organization of caredelivery, the existing consumer role will persist for these individuals. TheMedicaid program in theory allows for a broad choice of providers; how-ever, rationing by paying providers fees that are below market rates resultsin a limited supply of providers willing to treat Medicaid recipients withM/SU illnesses. The end result is that most Medicaid recipients have a verylimited choice of providers for M/SU treatment. EFFECTS OF MARKET AND POLICY STRUCTURES ON QUALITY The above discussion identifies several key forces that affect the quality of M/SU care according to the main types of funding arrangements (com-petitive insurance, direct carve-out), under differing methods of organizingthe financing of services (carve-out networks, traditional Medicaid), andwith differing sources of payment (direct government, Medicaid, privateinsurance). Each of the main structures identified offers a potential targetfor policy intervention. Quality Distortions in the Purchase of Health Plan Services Through Competition for Enrollees When a group purchaser offers its enrollees more than one health plan from which to choose, most private insurance and many state Medicaidprograms create competitive markets in which health plans compete toenroll members. In these cases, incentives to avoid enrolling high-cost indi-viduals may cause distortions in insurance coverage for and the quality ofM/SU care. These incentives arise because people with M/SU illnesses gen-erally incur higher health care costs that persist over time relative to othersegments of an insured population. Such distortions in private insuranceCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html340 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS coverage can be addressed by mandating minimum levels of coverage for M/SU care. \"Parity\" legislation is an example of such measures. As notedearlier, however, managed care tactics can substitute for demand-side cost-sharing policies (e.g., copayments, limits) to control costs. Under paritylaws, health plans continue to have an incentive to avoid enrolling high-costindividuals. By applying the tools of managed care to M/SU services morestringently, plans can affect aspects of the quality of care they provide (e.g.,convenience and availability of providers) and make themselves less attrac-tive to potential enrollees who anticipate availing themselves of M/SU treat-ment services. Thus parity laws appear to be necessary but not sufficient toaddress selection incentives that distort coverage and quality of care (Franket al., 2001). Two approaches to stemming adverse selection incentives in M/SU care are currently in use. The first is payer carve-out of M/SU health care ser-vices, whereby the employer or other group purchaser separates M/SUhealth care from the remainder of insurance risk and eliminates its manage-ment as a competitive strategy (see the discussion earlier in this chapter).Coverage and rationing for M/SU health care are arranged directly by thepayer with the carve-out vendor through a contract. The payer's procure-ment process and the terms of the contract thus become the determinants ofrationing (as discussed below). Carve-outs carry their own disadvantages,including relatively high administrative costs, potential difficulties in coor-dination of care between general medical care and specialty behavioralhealth providers, and incentives to shift costs and responsibility for careacross insurance segments (e.g., pharmacy benefits). It is important to noteas well that most carve-out arrangements in private health insurance arenot payer carve-outs but are implemented by an individual health plan;these arrangements do not affect selection-related incentives. There is alsoanecdotal evidence suggesting that some large insurers are shifting awayfrom the carve-out approach to managing M/SU care, as exemplified byAetna's recent decision to \"carve back in\" M/SU health care instead ofcontracting out for these services. The second approach to reducing selection incentives is risk adjust- ment, a strategy consistent with either integration of the risk associatedwith M/SU health services with other medical risks or a health plan carve-out structure. The idea behind risk adjustment is that if health plans arepaid more for enrolling high-cost individuals, they will be less inclined totry to avoid doing so. Most risk adjustment systems rely on patient demo-graphics and clinical information, such as diagnoses, to create clusters ofpotential enrollees according to the intensity and complexity of past treat-ment (Weiner et al., 1996). These clusters are used to predict costs. Ifindividuals choose plans based in part on predictable expenses, the riskadjustment approach can be used to adjust plan payments so as to diminishCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

However, risk adjustment systems in general explain only about 7 percent of variations in spending. Ettner and colleagues com-pared the performance of several risk adjustment systems for M/SU servicesin private insurance and Medicaid. They found that no existing risk adjust-ment classification system displayed strong predictive ability for spendingon M/SU care (Ettner, 2001; Ettner et al., 1998). Thus existing risk adjust-ment approaches appear to be limited in their ability to stem selection-driven distortions in quality affecting those at risk for using M/SU treat-ment services. Organizational strategies can also be used to address selectionincentives. Direct Public Purchase of Behavioral Carve-out Services in Medicaid Currently, approximately 16 states and territories (or substate units) contract directly with carve-out vendors for some M/SU health care ser-vices. As discussed earlier, this approach to the purchase of coverage andmanaged care for M/SU treatment offers the advantage of attenuating dis-tortions in quality of care that may result from selection-related incentives.Yet the procurement process for these contracts is frequently structured sothat performance with respect to contract costs may be overemphasizedrelative to performance on quality of care. If costs and quality are positivelycorrelated, the implication of this procurement structure is that there willbe a tendency to choose lower-cost, lower-quality contract proposals. Oneis reminded of the remarks of astronaut Allen Shepard, who just prior tobeing launched into space expressed concern that he would be aboard thespacecraft that had been built by the lowest-cost bidder. One approach to addressing this concern would be to reorient the procurement process toward a two-step procedure. In the first step, stateswould engage in a rate-finding process. They would collect information onthe outcomes of contracting processes in other states and in the privatesector and interview potential vendors concerning the costs of their ser-vices. They would then analyze these data to determine the \"reasonable\"costs of providing MBHO services to the state's Medicaid population. Alevel of reasonable costs would be selected and announced as the contract\"price.\" In the second stage of the procurement, interested vendors wouldsubmit competing proposals. The proposals would be judged solely on theproposed quality of services, access to care, and ability to coordinate withother systems of care (general medical care, social services, housing, andincome support). With the procurement process structured in this way,competition would be reoriented toward offering innovative approaches toimproving the quality of clinical services and developing mechanisms forcoordination of care with relevant components of the health and humanservice sectors that offer complementary services. The incentive would beCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Private Payer Direct Procurement of Carve-Out Services Private direct purchasers of carve-out services operate in a somewhat different economic and regulatory environment relative to public directpurchasers. First, private payers are not usually as constrained to choosethe lowest-cost bidder. In addition, the Employee Retirement Income Secu-rity Act (ERISA) constrains the use of risk-based payments to vendors.Second, employers compete in labor markets for employees; one importantdimension of this competition is the nature and value of the fringe benefitspackage. Thus, there are typically weaker incentives driving employersto select vendors solely on the basis of the lowest price. Nevertheless,cost pressures in American business are strong, so that some of the sameprinciples noted in the Medicaid case above could be applied to privatepurchasers. Traditional Medicaid Programs Two core features of traditional Medicaid programs impede high- quality M/SU health care. One is the reliance on setting prices for servicesbelow market rates to constrain supply; the result is low participationrates by providers and lower-quality service. The other is extremely lim-ited coverage for substance-use treatment services by some state Medicaidprograms. While raising the prices of ambulatory M/SU treatment serviceswould likely serve to increase quality, it is impractical to expect suchchange under current fiscal conditions in the states. Thus there is littleopportunity to ameliorate matters in the context of a system of disaggre-gated office-based providers. Instead, the best option within the Medicaidprogram is to create contracts with organizations that can manage bud-gets for treating groups of patients (the underlying presumption beingthat a substantial volume of services is currently being allocated ineffec-tively). These contracts in the extreme might expand use of managed care.Alternatively, specific disease management contracts for illnesses such asdepression, schizophrenia, or heroin dependence might be procured. Spe-cialty clinics might also receive contracts for organizing care for particu-lar patient groups. In each case, the ability to reorganize services andmanage care might permit sufficient funds to be aimed at treating indi-vidual cases so as to improve the quality of care.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlUSING MARKETPLACE INCENTIVES TO LEVERAGE NEEDED CHANGE 343 Budgeted Systems of Care It is difficult to introduce change into budgeted systems of care from the top down. The basic economics of the public system are at odds withshifts from well-established practices. The grant-based financing systemand the franchise nature of most local public delivery systems for M/SUhealth care tend to inhibit change. Given existing budget levels, introduc-ing competition appears to be impractical. A more practical candidate forpolicy attention is the content of the grant-based financing system. Pay-for-performance principles could be introduced into such an environmentwithout creating undue disruption. For example, to ensure some financialstability, the majority of funding could continue to be guaranteed viacontracts or grants; however, performance criteria would be used to allo-cate the remainder (e.g., 25-30 percent) of historical funding levels, alongwith future increases (distribution of inflation or other budgetaryincreases). There are, however, numerous challenges to implementing pay for per- formance in public M/SU treatment systems. First is the primitive state ofperformance measurement with respect to both the development of mea-sures and the ability of states to implement such measures (Lutterman et al.,2004). In addition, there is concern that pay for performance would distortquality improvement efforts to focus only on those areas in which measureshave been developed and payments are made (teaching to the test). There isalso little understanding of how such payment might be structured to maxi-mize quality improvement across, say, a state substance-use treatment sys-tem. Finally, it was found that in the substance-use sector, use of treatmentoutcome as a performance indicator created an incentive to treat the leastproblematic clients presenting for care (Lu, 1999). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The incentives created by competitive insurance arrangements, whereby health plans compete to enroll individuals, can be especially deleterious toinsurance coverage for and quality of M/SU health care. Because peoplewith M/SU illnesses are more costly to care for than other types of enrolleesand because the costs of treating these illnesses persist over time, healthplans have economic incentives to avoid enrolling these individuals\u2014a phe-nomenon known as adverse selection. These selection incentives result indistorted terms of insurance coverage for M/SU services, as well as distor-tions in the quality of care. The end result is that competitive insurancemarkets (private or public) tend to generate quality levels for M/SU carethat are too low. The committee recognizes that none of the measures recommended below will fully address the powerful incentives to avoid enrolling peopleCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html344 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS with M/SU illnesses in competitive health plans and that each measure involves a unique set of costs, benefits, and practical considerations thatmay make it more or less attractive to an individual purchaser. However,the committee is persuaded by the strength of existing evidence that ad-dressing selection-related incentives is central to improving the quality ofcare for M/SU illnesses in the context of competitive health insurancemarkets. Recommendation 8-1. Health care purchasers that offer enrollees a choice of health plans should evaluate and select one or more available tools foruse in reducing selection-related incentives to limit the coverage andquality of M/SU health care. Risk adjustment, payer \"carve-outs,\" risk-sharing or mixed-payment contracts, and benefit standardization acrossthe health plans offered can partially address selection-related incentives.Congress and state legislatures should improve coverage by enacting aform of benefit standardization known as parity for coverage of M/SUtreatment. The committee also believes that special attention must be given to state procurement processes, as states are the funders of most M/SU healthcare. State government procurement regulations typically emphasize choos-ing the lowest-cost of those contractors submitting proposals that are tech-nically acceptable. Currently, about 16 states choose to purchase behav-ioral health care carve-out services directly from specialty managedbehavioral health care vendors on behalf of their Medicaid programs.Among these states are some that delegate procurement to substate authori-ties (e.g., counties, regions). A review of state requests for proposals indi-cates infrequent use of performance measures related to clinical quality instate procurement processes, in part because of the limited availability ofwell-constructed performance indicators. Performance measures that arespecified in requests for proposals frequently focus on administrative ser-vices such as telephone response times, claims payment speed, and networksize. Taken together, the emphasis on choosing the lowest-cost vendor andthe limited use and availability of performance indicators result in an al-most exclusive focus on price in the competitive selection of specialty man-aged behavioral health care carve-out vendors. The result is that vendorshave powerful incentives to offer products and services that permit attrac-tive price offers and little counterbalancing incentive to offer high-qualityservices. Recommendation 8-2. State government procurement processes should be reoriented so that the greatest weight is given to the quality of careto be provided by vendors.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlUSING MARKETPLACE INCENTIVES TO LEVERAGE NEEDED CHANGE 345 The committee notes that a number of approaches could be taken to implement this recommendation. A few states have recently adopted approachesthat give greater weight to quality. Such a reorientation can likely be accom-plished with little risk of incurring \"runaway costs\" because there is nowabundant experience with state procurement of managed behavioral healthcare services. The range of prices is well known, so that price bids can to someextent be bound in the procurement process. Promising examples of reorientedprocurement approaches include assigning relatively low weight to price-relateddimensions of a bid and relatively higher weight to proposal features thataddress quality of care and other aspects of service. A second approach is toengage in a rate-finding process for proposals that sets a price for bids and thenfocus the competition on the quality and service dimensions of performance. The committee recognizes that procurement processes in which price is overemphasized at the expense of quality considerations are not limited topublic-sector purchasing of managed behavioral health care services, al-though approaches to purchasing in the private sector are more heteroge-neous. Nevertheless, we believe the principles set forth in recommendation8-2 apply to a substantial segment of private-sector purchasers. Moreover, a substantial proportion of public M/SU treatment services are purchased through government grants to local providers. These provid-ers are frequently private nonprofit organizations that serve the populationof a particular geographically defined catchment area, and are typicallywell-established organizations having long-standing relationships with stateand local governments. Services are purchased most commonly through asystem of grants. The grants are awarded subject to the provider's meetinglicensing standards and achieving specified service levels. Funding is fre-quently set at levels that result in patient queues\u2014indicating excess demandfor services. There are few quality-of-care standards forming a basis foraccountability for these organizations. Moreover, pressures from excessdemand create incentives for local providers to expand the volume of treat-ment even if doing so results in reduced quality. The committee recognizes the difficult circumstances within which pro- viders that receive the bulk of their funding directly from state and localbudgets operate. Health care for substance-use conditions is especially reli-ant on these purchasing methods and will be affected more strongly. At thesame time, we note that there are currently few inducements for theseprovider organizations to focus on improving quality of care and adoptingevidence-based practices. Recommendation 8-3. Government and private purchasers should use M/SU health care quality measures (including measures of the coordi-nation of health care for mental, substance-use, and general healthconditions) in procurement and accountability processes.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html346 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Recommendation 8-4. State and local governments should reduce the emphasis on the grant-based systems of financing that currently domi-nate public M/SU treatment systems and should increase the use offunding mechanisms that link some funds to measures of quality. The committee acknowledges the underdeveloped state of performance measurement in M/SU health care (see Chapter 4). However, there is anadequate knowledge base to permit state and local governments to redesigngrant-based financing systems incrementally so as to incorporate somesimple and meaningful performance indicators. The Washington CircleGroup measures for substance-use health care are a case in point. Thecommittee envisions that initial efforts in this regard would tie either newfunds or a small percentage of existing budgets to performance indicatorsas a means of reorienting the management of public M/SU treatment provi-sion toward quality improvement. In this way, the refocusing of account-ability would not result in budgetary instability. Over time, as performancemeasures improved and providers altered their management practices, per-formance measures might be given greater weight in budget allocations.

Nonetheless, as discussedthroughout this report, gaps remain in our knowledge\u2014for example,with regard to providing care in some clinical situations and forsome populations, as well as ensuring that the treatments producedby research are actually received by and effective for the peoplewho need them. In particular, as discussed in Chapter 4, researchthat has identified the efficacy of specific treatments under rigorouslycontrolled conditions has been accompanied by almost no researchidentifying how to make these same treatments effective whendelivered in usual settings of care and in the presence of commonconfounding problems, such as comorbid conditions and socialstressors, and when administered by service providers withoutspecialized education in the therapy. In addition, there are manygaps in knowledge about effective treatment, especially for childrenand adolescents. Also noted in Chapter 4 is the paucity of informationabout the most effective ways of ensuring the consistent applicationof research findings in routine clinical practice. To fill these knowledgegaps, the committee recommends the formulation of a coordinatedresearch agenda for quality improvement in M/SU health care,along with the use of more-diverse research approaches. Implementing these research recommendations, as well as undertaking the multiple actions recommended in previous chapters,will require concerted efforts on the part of participants at everyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This chapterconcludes by presenting those recommendations separately foreach party. From this latter perspective, the recommendationsform an agenda that can be pursued at each level of the healthcare system to improve the quality of M/SU health care. KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN TREATMENT, CARE DELIVERY, AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT Previous chapters of this report have identified gaps in our knowledge about how best to treat certain mental and/or substance-use (M/SU) prob-lems and illnesses; how best to treat these conditions when the patient's andtreating provider's resources and environments do not match those of theresearchers developing the treatment; and how to ensure that evidence-based practices identified through research are applied uniformly to allthose patients for whom they are appropriate. Filling these knowledge gapswill require that the finite available research dollars be used strategicallyand coordinated across funders. Also necessary will be a thoughtful ap-proach to the more rapid generation of valid and reliable evidence of prac-tical use to treating clinicians in their usual settings of care. Gaps in Treatment Knowledge The numerous gaps in our knowledge about how to treat M/SU prob- lems and illnesses encompass effective treatments, effective delivery ofknown treatments, and ways to improve care quality. A few examples ofeach of these knowledge gaps are discussed below. Gaps in Knowledge About Effective Treatments Treatment of multiple conditions Despite the high degree of comorbidity of mental and substance-use conditions, as described in Chapter 5, and thegreat strides made in understanding the relationship between co-occurringmental and substance-use problems and illnesses, little is known about theetiology and temporal ordering of these comorbidities (SAMHSA, undated).There also is a substantial lack of knowledge about effective treatment forindividuals with certain complex comorbidities, such as schizophrenia andconcurrent mood disorders (Kessler, 2004) and comorbid general healthconditions (Kane et al., 2003).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html352 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Optimal pharmacotherapy for psychosis Unanswered questions include which antipsychotic medication should be the first line of therapy, whatconstitutes a sufficient period of time to determine whether a new medica-tion is effective, how to handle poor response to the initial prescribedmedication (Kane et al., 2003), and how the dosing of combination anti-psychotics should be managed in the presence of increased symptoms orside effects. Moreover, multiple antipsychotic medications are used in theabsence of evidence on their combined efficacy (Miller and Craig, 2002). Medication treatments for certain substance dependencies No medications have yet shown effectiveness in the treatment of amphetamine or mari-juana dependence. The prevention and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Al- though PTSD has been recognized for centuries as a frequent consequenceamong those engaged in warfare (often under different names, such as\"shell shock\"), high rates of trauma and its adverse mental health sequelaealso are experienced by significant portions of the general population\u2014forexample, as a result of childhood neglect and abuse; rape and other physi-cal assaults or acts of personal violence; life-threatening or other seriousaccidents; and mass trauma affecting populations, such as through acts ofterrorism, war, and natural disasters (Mueser et al., 2002; National Centerfor Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, 2005). Some types of psychotherapy(i.e., trauma-focused cognitive behavioral/exposure therapy for individualsand groups, and stress management) have been found to be effective intreating PTSD (Bisson and Andrew, 2005), as have some medications (Steinet al., 2005). Nonetheless, gaps remain in our knowledge of how to pre-vent PTSD from developing after trauma, what the risk factors are forPTSD (Rose et al., 2005; Work Group on ASD and PTSD, 2004), and howto treat the condition once it develops. With respect to treatment, forexample, more knowledge is needed about what drugs and drug classes aremost effective; which patients will respond best to medication (Stein et al.,2005); how best to combine pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy; andhow to relieve some specific symptoms, such as insomnia or nightmares, bythemselves and in the presence of other symptoms requiring medication(Work Group on ASD and PTSD, 2004). Moreover, although cognitiveand behavioral therapies have demonstrated efficacy in treating victims ofsexual assault, interpersonal violence, and industrial or vehicular accidents,their effectiveness in treating PTSD in combat veterans and victims of massviolence requires further study (Work Group on ASD and PTSD, 2004). Therapies for high-prevalence childhood conditions While there has been an impressive increase in the number and quality of studies of effectiveCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAN AGENDA FOR CHANGE 353 therapies for children, major gaps remain in our knowledge in this area. For example, despite the increasing use of psychotropic medications, littleis known about the effect of multiple medications on children's outcomesor about the efficacy of different therapies for severe conditions (e.g., bipo-lar disorder, childhood depression) (Kane et al., 2003). Insufficient evi-dence exists to guide follow-up and long-term management of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), despite its being considered achronic condition (Stein, 2002). There also is very limited knowledge abouttreatments for co-occurring conditions in childhood. Therapies for other population subgroups There is little evidence on the effec- tiveness of treatment modalities for certain subgroups of patients, such asracial and ethnic minorities, as well as the frail elderly (Borson et al., 2001). Relative effectiveness of different treatments (alone and in combination) More than 550 psychotherapies are currently in use for children and ado-lescents, but little helpful information exists for clinicians or consumers ontheir comparative effectiveness (Kazdin, 2004). As in other areas of health care, the Food and Drug Administration's drug approval rules offer littleincentive for head-to-head clinical trials (Pincus, 2003), and there is a lackof substantial capital investment in the development and testing of psycho-social approaches. Moreover, our knowledge about the optimal use ofcombination treatments (e.g., medications and psychotherapies) is limited. Prevention studies Large gaps remain in our knowledge about how to prevent M/SU illnesses. Gaps in Knowledge About Effective Care Delivery In addition to the above gaps in our knowledge of effective treatments, there is a profound lack of knowledge on the effective delivery of treat-ments already known to be efficacious. Chapter 4 describes the efficacy-effectiveness gap that exists in M/SU health care. That discussion dem-onstrates that there has been more research on the efficacy of specific treatments than on how to make these treatments effective when delivered in usual settings of care (Essock et al., 2003; Kazdin, 2004). Other chaptersof this report identify gaps in our knowledge about additional health caredelivery issues that affect the ability to make effective use of what is alreadyknown, as well as the ability to meet the quality aims and apply the rules forcare set forth in the Quality Chasm report (IOM, 2001) (see Chapter 2). Providing patient-centered care Knowledge is lacking about what factors contribute to patient recovery; how to prevent discrimination in healthCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html354 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS care and related social programs; how best to support patients' decision- making abilities; and how best to implement illness self-management pro-grams for individuals with M/SU conditions (see Chapter 3). Preventing unintentional discrimination by health care providers Research is needed on practitioner attitudes toward patient-centered care, how tonurture supportive attitudes in professional training, and how languageand wording used to describe M/SU illnesses may contribute to stigmatiz-ing attitudes (see Chapter 3). Potential modification of certain public policies Research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of polices such as those that restrict access tostudent loans and impose a potential lifetime ban on food stamps andTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits as a result ofdrug convictions, in particular their effect on patient recovery and subse-quent drug use (see Chapter 3). Coercion into treatment Research is needed on how determinations of com- petence and dangerousness are made, and on how best to minimize the useof coercion and use it most effectively when it is unavoidable. In mentalhealth care, \"little hard information exists on the pervasiveness of the vari-ous forms of mandated treatment for people with mental disorders, howleverage is imposed, or what the measurable outcomes of using leverageactually are\" (Monahan et al., 2003:37). With respect to the use of coercionin substance-use treatment, research is likewise needed to determine the ef-fects, both positive and negative, of various mechanisms of coercion, of drugcourts, and of the use of treatment conditions in probation and parole.Empirical data will not answer questions about the legitimacy of these ap-proaches, but to the extent that their consequences are known, such data caninform normative discussions. Data may also be useful in identifying meansof avoiding involuntary interventions, whether by improving services thatcan be accessed voluntarily or working collaboratively with patients to iden-tify acceptable alternative interventions (see Chapter 3). Understanding decisional capacity among people with substance-use ill- nesses The available data on decisional capacity among persons suffering from substance-use illnesses are meager; however, recent years have seen amove to reverse that trend. There is a need for research using standardizedinstruments, such as the Mac-CAT-T, that take into account the possibleeffects of associated physical and mental (e.g., depression, delirium) ill-nesses and involve repeat assessments during periods of sobriety. A carefulevaluation of decisional capacity to consent to treatment is warranted inthese patients.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAN AGENDA FOR CHANGE 355 Demonstrations of illness self-management program sDemonstrations of programs for illness self-management for individuals with M/SU illnessesare needed (see Chapter 3). Gaps in Knowledge About How to Improve Quality As discussed in Chapter 4, many published reports on successful qual- ity improvement initiatives clearly show that it is possible for organizationsto improve the quality of their health care (Shojania and Grimshaw, 2005).Yet little evidence exists about the most effective ways to ensure the consis-tent application of research findings in routine clinical practice (Shojania etal., 2004). Still less evidence exists about how to do so across the diverseclinicians, organizations, and systems delivering M/SU health care. Shortcomings in Public Policy Gaps in knowledge about treatment, the effectiveness of care delivery, and mechanisms and processes for improving quality all lead to shortcom-ings in public policy for the management of M/SU care. These shortcomingsare reflected throughout this report and need to be redressed. Thus researchto fill the knowledge gaps described above must result in an agenda thatsupports and informs policy. Improved treatment models that support patient-centered care by in- volving patients in treatment choices (see Chapter 3) will necessitate changesin the structure and delivery of M/SU care. Purchasing decisions that arebased on established and common outcomes, guided by market incentives,and driven by quality measures (see Chapters 4 and 8) will also serve asleverage for the needed changes. The structure of public policy will beimpacted as well by efforts to address the M/SU workforce issues discussedin Chapter 7. Thus while the committee recommends a coordinated research agenda and a diversity of research approaches (see below), a central theme mustalso be the impact on public policy. In addition, research must continuallyaddress the shortcomings in public policy noted above and inform thepurchasing, management, and delivery of systems of care. This need isapplicable at all levels, including patients and families, microsystems ofcare, health care organizations, and the larger health care environment(Berwick, 2002). STRATEGIES FOR FILLING KNOWLEDGE GAPS The committee concludes that a coordinated and broadened program of research is needed to fill the gaps in knowledge and inform public policyCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html356 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS with regard to M/SU health care. Many public and private funders of research on M/SU health care have their own research portfolios andpriority-setting processes. Unless these efforts are coordinated, importantknowledge gaps and policy shortcomings may persist. A similar problemwas addressed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) when the incom-ing director convened a series of meetings in 2002 to chart a roadmap formedical research in the 21st century. The purpose was to identify majoropportunities and gaps in biomedical research that no single institute atNIH could tackle by itself, but that required coordinated action by multipleinstitutes to best improve the progress of medical research. The resultingroadmap for research provides a framework of the priorities NIH as awhole must address to optimize its entire research portfolio and sets forth avision for a more efficient and productive system of medical research (NIH,undated). A similar process cutting across health services and translationalresearch conducted by the multiple public and private funders of M/SUresearch efforts could also be beneficial. Concern has been raised that much of the research on M/SU that is funded, while methodologically pure, may be minimally relevant to thosewho shape much of M/SU health care delivery (Feldman, 1999). Fundedresearch is at risk of continuing to generate more and more knowledgeabout efficacious treatments, but failing to examine implementation strate-gies for facilitating the delivery of these treatments to patients. While prac-tical clinical trials have been encouraged in some of the NIH institutes, theyoften have focused on a limited set of conditions, rather than addressing thebroader issues of quality improvement for a range of M/SU conditions. Asa result, public policy practices, reimbursement arrangements, and otherenvironmental factors that influence how care is delivered are not alignedso as to promote the delivery of effective care. Thus in addition to clinical research, translational research and demon- stration projects and activities are needed, for example, to: Synthesize, develop, and demonstrate effective clinical practices for use in usual settings of care delivery on the basis of known efficacious treatments identified through clinical trials. Explore and develop processes for providing M/SU expertise in general health specialist settings (e.g., cancer, cardiac, geriatric centers) toaddress general health and M/SU comorbidities. Demonstrate and evaluate processes and procedures for providing appropriately coordinated and comprehensive care involving M/SU health care specialists; general health care specialists; patients and family mem-bers; and representatives of related social, educational, criminal justice, andother systems.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAN AGENDA FOR CHANGE 357 Test effective and reliable processes for disseminating to the broader health care field findings on practice guidelines, processes, and proceduresthat result from translational research activities. Inform public policy; continually examine the overall impact of research findings on the purchasing, management, and delivery of care; andmonitor fidelity with the findings of this report and the principles of theQuality Chasm report. The committee believes the timely and efficient production of the evi- dence needed to address such a broad range of issues will require a researchagenda that makes appropriate use of experimental, quasi-experimental,and observational approaches. Research Designs As discussed in Chapter 4, while well-designed, randomized controlled trials are recognized as the gold standard for generating sound clinicalevidence, the sheer number of possible pharmacological and nonpharma-cological treatments for many M/SU illnesses makes relying solely on suchtrials to identify evidence-based care infeasible (Essock et al., 2003). More-over, some features of mental health care make the use of such trials meth-odologically problematic (Tanenbaum, 2003). For these reasons, behav-ioral and social science research has often used quasi-experimental as wellas qualitative research designs (National Academy of Sciences, undated);indeed, some assert that quasi-experimental studies often are more useful ingenerating practical information about how to provide effective mentalhealth interventions in some clinical areas (Essock et al., 2003). Consistentwith this point of view, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force notes that awell-designed cohort study may be more compelling than a poorly designedor weakly powered randomized controlled trial (Harris et al., 2001). Ob-servational studies also have been identified as a valid source of evidenceuseful in determining aspects of better quality of care (West et al., 2002).However, others note the comparative weakness of these study designs incontrolling for bias and other sources of error and exclude them fromsystematic reviews of evidence for the determination of evidence-basedpractices. Many researchers and methodologists already are consideringstrategies for addressing these difficult issues (Wolff, 2000). As this study was under way, the National Research Council had estab- lished a planning committee to oversee the development of a broad, multi-year effort\u2014the Standards of Evidence-Strategic Planning Initiative\u2014toidentify critical issues affecting the quality and utility of research in thebehavioral and social sciences and education (National Academy of Sci-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html358 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS ences, undated). The committee believes such discussions are critical to strengthening the appropriate use of all of the above types of research inbuilding the evidence base on effective treatments for M/SU illnesses. How-ever, the committee also believes that the methodologically sound use ofthese different research designs can produce empirical evidence useful forguiding initiatives to improve the delivery of M/SU care. The committeenotes that care will continue to be delivered even in the absence of empiricalevidence on the best (or better) ways of doing so; until further funding ismade available for more rigorous (and more expensive) research designs,quasi-experimental and observational studies in usual settings of care canhelp inform improvements in care and its delivery. Consistent with these conclusions, the committee makes the following recommendations. Recommendation 9-1. The secretary of DHHS should provide leader- ship, strategic development support, and additional funding for re-search and demonstrations aimed at improving the quality of M/SUhealth care. This initiative should coordinate the existing quality im-provement research efforts of the National Institute of Mental Health,National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute on AlcoholAbuse and Alcoholism, Department of Veterans Affairs, SubstanceAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency forHealthcare Research and Quality, and Centers for Medicare andMedicaid Services, and it should develop and fund cross-agency ef-forts in necessary new research. To that end, the initiative shouldaddress the full range of research needed to reduce gaps in knowledgeat the clinical, services, systems, and policy levels and should establishlinks to and encourage expanded efforts by foundations, states, andother nonfederal organizations. Recommendation 9-2. Federal and state agencies and private founda- tions should create health services research strategies and innovativeapproaches that address treatment effectiveness and quality improve-ment in usual settings of care delivery. To that end, they should developnew research and demonstration funding models that encourage localinnovation, that include research designs in addition to randomizedcontrolled trials, that are committed to partnerships between research-ers and stakeholders, and that create a critical mass of interdisciplinaryresearch partnerships involving usual settings of care. Stakeholdersshould include consumers/patients, parents or guardians of children,clinicians and clinical teams, organization managers, purchasers, andpolicy makers.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAN AGENDA FOR CHANGE 359 With respect to the above recommendation for the creation of research partnerships between researchers and stakeholders, the committee tooknote of some research-community partnerships already under way that canserve as models. Two such partnerships are described below. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Integrated Delivery System Research Network In 2000, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) initiated the Integrated Delivery Systems Research Network (IDSRN) as a field-based research strategy to link the nation's top researchers with someof the largest health care systems for the conduct of research on cutting-edge issues in health care on an accelerated timetable. IDSRN was devel- oped to capitalize on the research capacity of and opportunities occurringwithin integrated delivery systems. The network creates, supports, and dis-seminates scientific evidence on what does and does not work in terms ofdata and measurement systems, organizational best practices related to caredelivery, and diffusion of research results. It also provides a cadre ofdelivery-affiliated researchers and sites to test ways of adapting and apply-ing existing knowledge. Each of the nine IDSRN partners has three unique attributes that make it particularly suited for time-sensitive researchprojects: Data availability\u2014 IDSRN partners collect and maintain adminis- trative, claims, encounter, and other data on large populations that areclinically, demographically, and geographically diverse. Research expertise \u2014IDSRN partners include some of the country's leading health services researchers, with proficiency in quantitative andqualitative methodologies and expertise in emerging delivery system issues. Management authority to implement a health care intervention \u2014 IDSRN partners have responsibility for managing delivery systems and arein a position to implement financial and organizational strategies with anevaluation component. From 2000 through 2004, AHRQ's commitment totaled nearly $20 million for 75 IDSRN projects (AHRQ, 2002). Although IDSRN is a modelof a research network involving large, technologically rich health care orga-nizations, it is instructive in considering how to develop a research networkfor M/SU health care. Many managed behavioral health care organizationshave similar capacity with regard to data availability, research expertise,and management authority. Some already engage in partnerships with re-search organizations to address questions pertaining to such issues as utili-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment The Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment, described in Chapter 4, is a university-treatment provider consortium that involvessmaller and less technologically rich organizations. This model also couldbe replicated as a community laboratory for the conduct of translationalresearch on M/SU care. REVIEW OF ACTIONS NEEDED FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AT ALL LEVELS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM The committee's recommendations call for action on the part of clini- cians, health care organizations, purchasers, health plans, educational insti-tutions, federal and state legislators and executive agencies, and many oth-ers. These recommendations are organized according to the entities chargedwith their implementation in Tables 9-1 through 9-8. Note that becausemany of the recommendations are relevant to multiple parties, they appearin more than one table. Also identified are the aims and rules from theQuality Chasm report supported by each recommendation.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Overarching Recommendation 2. The aims, rules, and strategies for redesign set forth in Crossing the Quality Chasm should be applied throughout M/SU health care on a day-to-day operational basis, but tailored to reflect thecharacteristics that distinguish care for these problems and illnesses fromgeneral health care. Recommendation 3-1.a Clinicians providing M/SU treatment services should support the decision-making abilities, and preferences for treatment andrecovery, of individuals with M/SU problems and illnesses by:Incorporating informed, patient-centered decision making throughouttheir practices, including active patient participation in the design andrevision of patient treatment and recovery plans, the use of psychiatricadvance directives, and (for children) informed family decision making.To ensure informed decision making, information on the availabilityand effectiveness of M/SU treatment options should be provided.Rule 5. Evidence-based decision making\u2014Patients should receive care based on the best available scien-tific knowledge. Care should not vary illogically fromclinician to clinician or from place to place. Rule 8. Anticipation of needs\u2014The health system should anticipate patient needs, rather than simplyreacting to events. All six aims and ten rules. Aim of patient-centered care\u2014Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patientpreferences, needs, and values and ensuring that pa-tient values guide all clinical decisions. Rule 2. Customization based on patient needs andvalues\u2014The system of care should be designed to meet the most common types of needs, but have thecapability to respond to individual patient choices andpreferences.(continued on next page)Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Maintaining effective, formal linkages with community resources tosupport patient illness self-management and recovery. Recommendation 3-2. Coercion should be avoided whenever possible. When coercion is legally authorized, patient-centered care is still applicable andshould be undertaken by:Making the policies and practices used for determining dangerousnessand decision-making capacity transparent to patients and theircaregivers. Obtaining the best available comparative information on safety, effec-tiveness, and availability of care and providers, and using that informa-tion to guide treatment decisions. Maximizing patient decision making and involvement in the selection oftreatments and providers. .Recommendation 4-2. Clinicians providing M/SU services should : Increase their use of valid and reliable patient questionnaires or otherpatient-assessment instruments that are feasible for routine use to assessthe progress and outcomes of treatment systematically and reliably. Use measures of the processes and outcomes of care to continuouslyimprove the quality of the care provided.Rule 3. The patient as the source of control\u2014Patients should be given the necessary information and theopportunity to exercise the degree of control theychoose over health care decisions that affect them.The health system should be able to accommodatedifferences in patient preferences and encourageshared decision making. Aim of patient-centered care, and Rules 2(customization based on patient needs and values) and3 (the patient as the source of control) (see above). Rule 7. The need for transparency\u2014The health care system should make available to patients and theirfamilies information that allows them to makeinformed decisions when selecting a health plan,hospital, or clinical practice, or choosing among alter-native treatments. This should include informationdescribing the system's performance on safety,evidence-based practice, and patient satisfaction. Aim of effectiveness\u2014Providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit andrefraining from providing services to those notlikely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse,respectively).

To make collaboration and coordination of patients' M/SU health care services the norm, providers of the services should establishclinically effective linkages within their own organizations and between pro-viders of mental health and substance-use treatment. The necessary communi-cations and interactions should take place with the patient's knowledge andconsent and be fostered by:Routine sharing of information on patients' problems and pharmaco-logic and nonpharmacologic treatments among providers of M/SUtreatment. Valid, age-appropriate screening of patients for comorbid mental,substance-use, and general medical problems in these clinical settingsand reliable monitoring of their progress. Recommendation 5-2. To facilitate the delivery of coordinated care by pri- mary care, mental health, and substance-use treatment providers:Primary care and specialty M/SU health care providers should transitionalong a continuum of evidence-based coordination models from (1)formal agreements among mental, substance-use, and primary healthcare providers; to (2) case management of mental, substance-use, andprimary health care; to (3) collocation of mental, substance-use, andprimary health care services; and then to (4) delivery of mental, sub-stance-use, and primary health care through clinically integrated prac-tices of primary and M/SU care providers. Organizations should adoptmodels to which they can most easily transition from their currentstructure, that best meet the needs of their patient populations, and thatensure accountability.Rule 4. Shared knowledge and the free flow of infor-mation\u2014Patients should have unfettered access to their own medical information and to clinical knowl-edge. Clinicians and patients should communicateeffectively and share information. Rule 8. Anticipation of needs (see above). Rule 10. Cooperation among clinicians\u2014Clinicians and institutions should actively collaborate and com-municate to ensure an appropriate exchange of infor-mation and coordination of care. Rules 4 (shared knowledge and the free flow of infor-mation) and 10 (cooperation among clinicians) (see above).(continued on next page)Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

To ensure the health of persons for whom they are responsible, M/SU providers should:Coordinate their services with those of other human services and educa-tion agencies, such as schools, housing and vocational rehabilitationagencies, and providers of services for older adults. Establish referral arrangements for needed services. Recommendation 6-2. Public- and private-sector individuals, including orga- nizational leaders in M/SU health care, should become involved in, andprovide for staff involvement in, major national committees and initiativesworking to set health care data and information technology standards toensure that the unique needs of M/SU health care are designed into theseinitiatives at their earliest stages.Rules 4 (shared knowledge and the free flow of infor-mation) and 10 (cooperation among clinicians) (see above).

The committee gathered evidence and conducted its analysesbetween April 2004 and June 2005. During the seven meetings it heldduring this period, the committee received testimony from people withmental or substance-use illnesses and their advocates; health purchasers; professional associations; federal, state, and local governments; and others presenting evi-dence about the quality of mental and substance-use health care and recom-mendations for its improvement. (See the acknowledgements section in thefront of this report for a listing of those providing testimony.) During this period, the committee also reviewed leading reports in the mental health and substance-use fields, such as the 1999 Surgeon General'sreport on mental health, the 2003 report of the President's New FreedomCommission on Mental Health, and the Substance Abuse and Mental HealthServices Administration's (SAMHSA) report Changing the Conversation\u2014 Improving Substance Abuse Treatment: The National Treatment Plan Initia-tive. The committee also relied on the efforts of several experts in health care for mental and substance-use conditions who prepared commissioned papersproviding the committee with in-depth reviews of several key issues: The impact of mental and substance-related illnesses on decision- making capacityCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html392 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Consumer-directed mental health services Statutory, regulatory, administrative, and other barriers to consumer-directed mental health care Issues in measuring the quality of care for adults and children with mental and substance-use problems and illnesses The experience of the Veterans Health Administration in measur- ing the quality of care for mental and substance-use conditions The safety of health care for mental and substance-use conditions Legal, policy, and programmatic considerations in patient-centered and self-directed care School-based mental health services Treatment services for mental and substance-use conditions for children involved in child welfare Health care for mental and substance-use conditions and the crimi- nal justice system Improving treatment services for mental and substance-use condi- tions for children and adolescents in juvenile justice systems Workforce issues in health care for mental and substance-use conditions Constraints on sharing information on treatment for mental and substance-use conditions imposed by federal and state medical records pri-vacy laws The authors of these papers are listed in the acknowledgements section in the front of this report. During this time, the committee also performed additional evidence review and analysis pertaining to its charge. Some of the extensive evidencereviewed by the committee came from the specialty mental health andsubstance-use health care fields, some from health services research andother empirical evidence from general health care, and some from otherdisciplines. The committee's interdisciplinary review of the evidence wascompleted in June 2005. A draft report containing the committee's recom-mendations was completed in July 2005 and was sent for external review inAugust 2005. The committee finalized the report in October 2005. With respect to the organization of this report, although the committee used the aims and rules of the Quality Chasm report as its analytic frame- work, it was not possible to fully organize this report according to those aimsor rules, for several reasons. First, there is a great deal of overlap among theaims and rules, as would be expected. The aims are the goals to be achieved;the rules are recommended strategies for achieving those goals. As a result,the rules were often more useful as an analytic approach than were the aims.For example, the aims are silent on the issue of care coordination, whereascare coordination and collaboration are explicitly discussed in the rules.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX A 393 Second, many of the problems that the committee members identified, which became the focus of the report, fit equally well under more than one aim (e.g.,lack of care coordination affects the effectiveness, safety, timeliness, effi-ciency, and even patient-centeredness of care\u2014five of the six aims). Althoughit was relatively easy to separate out the issues most closely related to patient-centered care (as the committee did in a separate chapter), this did not holdtrue for the rest of the issues addressed by the committee. More problematic,the solutions to the problems also often addressed more than one aim or rule(e.g., better dissemination of evidence affects effective care, as well as safe andtimely care). As a result, organizing the report's chapters by the rules or aimswould have resulted in a great deal of redundancy.

L. No. 104-191) have had a tremendousimpact on health care providers. One of the less studied aspects of thisstatute, however, is the constraints that exist on the sharing of treatmentinformation among mental health treatment providers when it is applied intandem with other state and federal medical records confidentiality laws.This paper examines the interaction between these bodies of law, reviewingthe federal HIPAA regulations, state statutes that govern mental healthmedical records privacy, and the federal statute governing confidentiality ofsubstance abuse records. The study is based primarily on information regarding state privacy statutes obtained from the state law database of the Health Privacy Project,www.healthprivacy.org. In most instances, the information regarding statelaws found in this database was confirmed and updated through state-specific Westlaw searches. Like the Health Privacy Project database, thisstudy is limited to state statutes and does not include information on stateadministrative regulations, attorney general opinions, licensure board opin-ions, or court decisions, all of which might contain further information onmedical records privacy. This report should not be seen, therefore, as acomprehensive legal analysis of all the issues raised by the law of each state.Rather it is intended to identify the major issues raised by the interactionbetween the laws of the various states and federal law.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html406 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS THE HIPAA PRIVACY REGULATIONS Section 264 of HIPAA required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to implement national standards to protect the privacy of individu-ally identifiable health information that was transmitted electronically. Thefinal HIPAA regulation was published in the last minutes of the ClintonAdministration on December 28, 2000. That rule was extensively amendedin August of 2002 (with further amendments in 2003), and appears at finalform at 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164. Under the final HIPAA rules at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.502, covered entities, including health care providers, can disclose protected health informationfor treatment purposes without patient consent; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.506(c) (1)and (2) permit both the use and disclosure of information for treatmentpurposes. The rules at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.501 define treatment to mean: . . . the provision, coordination, or management of health care and related services by one or more health care providers, including the coordinationor management of health care by a health care provider with a third party; consultation between health care providers relating to a patient; or the referral of a patient for health care from one health care provider toanother. One exception to this general rule of permitting the sharing of treatment information without consent is that \"psychotherapy notes\" may only be dis-closed with authorization (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.508(a)(2)) except insofar as theyare used by the originator of the notes or for a covered entity's supervisedmental health education and training purposes. Psychotherapy notes are aspecial form of treatment information: Psychotherapy notes means notes recorded (in any medium) by a health care provider who is a mental health professional documenting or analyz- ing the contents of conversation during a private counseling session or agroup, joint, or family counseling session and that are separated from the rest of the individual's medical record. Psychotherapy notes excludes med- ication prescription and monitoring, counseling session start and stoptimes, the modalities and frequencies of treatment furnished, results of clinical tests, and any summary of the following items: diagnosis, func- tional status, the treatment plan, symptoms, prognosis, and progress todate (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.501). Authorization is a special and rigorous form of consent, which must include a description of the information to be disclosed, the identity of theperson or class of persons who may disclose the information and to whomit may be disclosed, a description of the purpose of the disclosure, anexpiration date for the authorization, and the signature of the person au-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In general, the individual signing the authorization may revoke it at any time, a provider cannotcondition treatment on the willingness of an individual to sign an authori-zation for the release of psychotherapy notes, and an authorization for therelease of psychotherapy notes must be a separate and independent docu-ment (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.508(b) and (c)). THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY LAWS The HIPAA statute also provides that: A regulation promulgated under paragraph (1) shall not supersede a con- trary provision of State law, if the provision of State law imposes require- ments, standards, or implementation specifications that are more strin-gent than the requirements, standards, or implementation specifications imposed under the regulation (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320d-2(c)(2)). Accordingly, the HIPAA regulations provide that they preempt state laws that are less stringent than HIPAA, but they are in turn preempted bystricter state laws, which, in the context of information disclosure, are moreprotective of privacy (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.203(b)). Some types of mental health records are also independently governed by the federal substance abuse treatment confidentiality law, 42 U.S.C.\u00a7290dd-2. This statute provides: Records of the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of any patient which are maintained in connection with the performance of any program or activity relating to substance abuse education, prevention, training, treatment, rehabilitation, or research, which is conducted, regulated, ordirectly or indirectly assisted by any department or agency of the United States shall, * * * be confidential and be disclosed only for the purposes and under the circumstances expressly authorized under subsection (b) ofthis section (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290dd-2(a)). The only statutory exception identified in subsection (b) relevant to treatment information is (b)(2)(A), which authorizes disclosure of informa-tion to medical personnel in a \"bona fide medical emergency.\" The regula-tions recognize further exceptions, however, insofar as they provide: (3) . . . The restrictions on disclosure in these regulations do not apply to communications of information between or among personnel having aneed for the information in connection with their duties that arise out ofCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html408 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS the provision of diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment of alcohol or drug abuse if the communications are (I) Within a program or(ii) Between a program and an entity that has direct administrative con- trol over the program (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.12(c)(3)). The regulations also provide: (4) . . . The restrictions on disclosure in these regulations do not apply to communications between a program and a qualified service organization of information needed by the organization to provide services to the pro- gram (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.12(c)(4)). \"Qualified service organizations\" are defined to include organizations that provide support services such as billing and data processing, but the defini-tion seems broad enough to include some consultations. Information canalso be disclosed with patient consent (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.33). With respect to preemption of state law, the substance abuse regula- tions state at \u00a7 2.20: The statutes authorizing these regulations do not preempt the field of law which they cover to the exclusion of all State laws in that field. If a disclosure permitted under these regulations is prohibited under State law,neither these regulations nor the authorizing statutes may be construed to authorize any violation of that State law. However, no State law may either authorize or compel any disclosure prohibited by these regulations. Though the HIPPA privacy regulations do not expressly address their relationship to the substance abuse confidentiality laws, the preamble to theprivacy regulations recognizes the constraints of the substance abuse confi-dentiality law. It states that (1) in general the privacy law and substanceabuse law do not conflict, and (2) wherever one is more protective ofprivacy than the other, the more restrictive should govern (65 Fed. Reg.82462, 82482-82483). In summary, The HIPPA regulations permit broad sharing of treatment informa- tion without consent. However, the HIPPA regulations only permit sharing of psycho- therapy notes with authorization. Moreover, the substance abuse confidentiality law does not permit sharing of records relating to substance abuse treatment or rehabilitationorganizations conducted, regulated, or funded by the federal government,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Whenever a state law is more protective of privacy than either the federal HIPAA regulations or the federal substance abuse confidentialitystatute and regulations, the state law governs. STATE MEDICAL RECORDS CONFIDENTIALITY LAWS To understand the actual effect of the HIPAA regulations or federal substance abuse statute or regulations, therefore, one must understand statelaw. Each of the 50 states (and the District of Columbia) has a number ofstatutes governing medical record confidentiality. In particular, each hasstatutes specifically governing some aspect of mental health records, andmost have laws governing substance abuse records. The coverage and re-quirements of these laws vary widely, however. A number of states have comprehensive medical record statutes that attempt to govern all issues pertaining to medical record confidentiality,much like HIPAA. California is one such state (see Cal. Civil Code D. 1,Part 2.6), although California also has a special statute governing therecords of patients in mental facilities (Calif. Welf. and Inst. Code \u00a7 5328)and also specifically prohibits the release of information by psychothera-pists specifically relating to \"the patient's participation in outpatient treat-ment.\" Montana has a general health care records statute, which permitsdisclosure of health information \"to a person who is providing health careto the patient\" (Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 50-16-529). New York's general medi-cal records statute (N.Y. Pub. Health L. \u00a7 18(6)) permits disclosure ofgeneral medical records to \"practitioners or other personnel employed byor under contract with the facility.\" Virginia has a general law governingthe records of all providers and practitioners. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 32.1-127:03(D) permits disclosure of information when necessary for the care ofa patient. Finally, Washington has a comprehensive statute, which permitsdisclosure \"(a) to a person who the provider reasonably believes is provid-ing health care to the patient\" (Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 70.02.050(1)(a)). STATE LAWS GOVERNING MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS It is more common for a state to have several specific statutes governing different types of medical records and information. Every state has someform of legislation governing mental health records. These generally takefour forms. First, many states have laws governing the records of patients instate mental hospitals or mental health programs. These are in some in-stances part of general statutes governing state health records (See IdahoCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html410 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Code \u00a7 9-340C(8) and (13)) and are sometimes specific to mental hospitals (see N.Y. Mental Hygiene Law 33.13; N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 122C-55). Second, a number of states have laws governing the records of specific mental health practitioners, most commonly psychologists, social workers,and counselors. Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 12-43-218, for example, requirespatient consent for any disclosure by a psychologist or psychotherapist,with no treatment exception. Massachusetts law (Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 112\u00a7 129A) provides that the records of psychologists are confidential, andmakes no exception for sharing of information for treatment. Missouri law(Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 337.636) contains similar provisions governing psycholo-gists, social workers, and professional counselors, as does Wyoming (Wyo.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 33-38-109). Nebraska law imposes an absolute obligation ofconfidentiality on \"mental health practitioners,\" but allows the Board ofMental Health Practice to define regulatory exceptions (Neb. Rev. Stat.\u00a7 71-1,335(1)). New Mexico law also seems to impose an absolute obliga-tion of confidentiality on any \"counselor and therapist practitioner\" (N.M.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 61-9A27). Utah law permits disclosures \"made under a gener-ally recognized professional or ethical standard that authorizes or requiresthe disclosure\" (Utah Code. Ann. 58-61-602(2)(c)). The obligations im-posed by these laws may pose the most substantial threat to the broadsharing of treatment information contemplated by HIPAA. Third, a number of states have specific statutes governing the records of patients who are involuntarily committed to mental institutions (see IdahoCode \u00a7 66-348; Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 71-961; Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 71.05.390).These statutes recognize, presumably, that patients who are involuntarily com-mitted to institutions might have a special claim to privacy, though these lawsalso usually make provision for the use of records in the commitment process.The Tennessee Code, for example, has a special provision for sharing of infor-mation for mandatory outpatient treatment in section 33-6-601: If (1) a person with mental illness or serious emotional disturbance was committed involuntarily under chapter 6, part 5 of this title, AND (2) the hospital staff determines preliminarily that: (A) the person will need to participate in outpatient treatment on discharge, and (B) there is a likeli-hood that the discharge will be subject to the outpatient treatment obliga- tion of this part, AND (3) the person refuses to give consent to disclose information which is legally confidential under this title to the proposedoutpatient qualified mental health professional, THEN (4) the hospital and qualified mental health professional may exchange information as necessary to carry out this part. Fourth and finally, most states have statutes that generally govern the records of all mental patients. The Alabama Code, \u00a7\u00a7 22-56-4(b)(6) andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX B 411 22-56-10, provides that mental patients have rights to privacy, but not beyond the rights of other patients. Louisiana law provides that mentalpatients may not be deprived of their right to privacy, whatever thatmeans (La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28.171(A)). The treatment exceptions dis-cussed below are all found in such general mental health confidentialitystatutes. STATE LAWS GOVERNING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE RECORDS Most states also have statutes governing substance abuse records. These in general roughly approximate the federal statute in their terms (see Cal.Health & Safety Code, \u00a7 11845.5; Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 397.501(7)) and some-times specifically refer to federal law (e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 111E\u00a7 18). They may govern facilities not governed by the federal law (becausethe facilities receive no federal funding) but may also lack the flexibilityfound in the federal regulations. Some states have specific laws governingsubstance abuse counselors as a licensed profession and forbid disclosure ofrecords without consent, with no treatment exception (e.g., La. Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 37:3390.4). Several states, on the other hand, permit broader disclosure of sub- stance abuse information than does the federal law. Kansas law providesthat disclosure of substance abuse records can be made \"upon the soleconsent of the head of the treatment facility who has the records if the headof the treatment facility makes a written determination that such disclosureis necessary for the treatment of the patient or former patient\" (Kan. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 59-2979). Mississippi law (Miss. Code. Ann. \u00a7 41-30-33) providesfor disclosure without consent \"to treatment personnel for use in connectionwith his treatment.\" New Hampshire law (N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 172:8-a)provides confidentiality for substance abuse records, but also says they maybe used for a rehabilitation or medical purpose without consent. Theseprovisions would presumably be preempted as to facilities governed by thefederal statute. Some state substance abuse statutes, on the other hand, seem to be more narrow. Pennsylvania law, for example, only authorizes disclosure ofsubstance abuse information to medical personnel with consent (see Pa.Cons. Stat. Ann. tit. 71 \u00a7 1690.108). Michigan law (Mich. Comp. Laws\u00a7333.6112) only provides disclosure of substance abuse records for treat- ment with the consent of the patient. New Jersey, on the other hand (N.J.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 26:2B-20), only permits disclosure with a court order. Mis-souri has a special law (Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 191.731) governing substanceabuse treatment for pregnant women that promises absolute confidentiality.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 394.4615 and Wash Rev. Code Ann.\u00a7 71.05.630). Michigan law (Mich. Comp. Laws. \u00a7 330.1748) provides fordisclosure only with consent outside of a treating facility. Most state laws governing medical records or mental health records, however, make some provision for sharing of information for treatmentpurposes. The wording of these statutes varies from state to state. Some arequite limited, only permitting sharing within a single facility or among statetreatment programs. See 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 110/8-110/12.2. The Dela-ware mental health statute allows disclosure of treatment information to\"Departmental contractors to the extent necessary for professional consul-tation or services\" (Del. Code. Ann. tit. 16, \u00a7 5161(13)(f)). The District ofColumbia mental health law is even more restrictive, only allowing disclo-sure to other employees within a facility or to participating providers in theorganized mental health system, and then only \"when and to the extentnecessary to facilitate the delivery of professional services to the client\"(D.C. Code \u00a7 7-1203.01). Some states permit disclosure of mental healthinformation for treatment without consent only in an emergency. Iowa lawprovides that \"mental health information may be transferred at any time toanother facility, physician, or mental health professional in cases of a medi-cal emergency or if the individual or the individual's legal representativerequests the transfer in writing for the purposes of receipt of medical ormental health professional services\" (see Iowa Code \u00a7 228.2(3)). The Kansasstatute allows for disclosure of mental health records in an emergency, aswell as for \"communication and information between or among treatmentfacilities regarding a proposed patient, patient or former patient for pur-poses of promoting continuity of care between the state psychiatric hospi-tals and the community mental health centers\" (Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 65-5603(5) and (13)). Nebraska law provides for disclosure of mental healthrecords to \"the department, * * * and any public or private agency undercontract to provide facilities, programs, and patient services\" (Neb. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 83-109(1)). Ohio permits disclosure for treatment only of limited mental health information and then only to a limited group of providers: Hospitals and other institutions and facilities within the department of mental health may exchange psychiatric records and other pertinent infor- mation with other hospitals, institutions, and facilities of the department, and with community mental health agencies and boards of alcohol, drugaddiction, and mental health services with which the department has aCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Records and information that may be released pursuant to this division shall be limited to medica- tion history, physical health status and history, financial status, summaryof course of treatment in the hospital, summary of treatment needs, and a discharge summary, if any (Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 5122.31(c)). The South Carolina statute permits exchange of mental health informa- tion among facility staff, but only \"on a need to know basis\" (S.C. CodeAnn. \u00a7 44-22-90(A)(1)). South Carolina also permits mental health provid-ers to disclose \"in the course of diagnosis, counseling, or treatment, confi-dences necessary to promote care within the generally recognized and ac-cepted standards, practices, and procedures of the provider's profession\"(S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 19-11-95(c)(5)). Texas law only permits the disclosure ofinformation by mental health professionals \"to other professionals andpersonnel under the professionals\" direction who participate in the diagno-sis, evaluation, or treatment of the patient\" (Tex. Health and Safety Code\u00a7611.004(a)(7)). The Illinois statute permits disclosure of therapists records to \"the therapist's supervisor, a consulting therapist, members of a staffteam participating in the provision of services, a record custodian, or aperson acting under the supervision and control of the therapist\" (740 Ill.Comp. Stat. \u00a7 110/9(1)). The California mental health law requires that\"the consent of the patient, or his or her guardian or conservator shall beobtained before information or records may be disclosed by a professionalperson employed by a facility to a professional person not employed by thefacility who does not have the medical or psychological responsibility forthe patient's care\" (Cal. Welf. and Inst. Code \u00a7 5328(a)). the Okla-homa statute provides that mental health information \"shall only be avail-able to persons actively engaged in the treatment of the patient or in relatedadministrative work. The information available to persons actively engagedin the treatment of the consumer or in related administrative work shall belimited to the minimum amount of information necessary for the person oragency to carry out its function\" (Okla. Stat. tit. 43A \u00a7 109(A)(2)). Other statutes are more broadly worded. The Alaska Code, for example, allows sharing of the records of mental patients with \"a physician or a pro-vider of health, mental health, or social and welfare services involved in caringfor, treating, or rehabilitating the patient\" (Alaska Stat. \u00a7 47.30.845(1)).The Arizona statute similarly permits disclosure of mental health records to\"physicians and providers of health, mental health or social and welfareservices involved in caring for, treating or rehabilitating the patient\" (Ariz.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 36-509). The Colorado mental health statue allows disclosure\"in communications between qualified professional personnel in the provi-sion of services or appropriate referrals\" (Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 27-10-120(1)(a)). Indiana law permits disclosure of mental health records to indi-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The Minnesota statute, which governs health recordsgenerally, provides for disclosure \"to other providers within related healthcare entities when necessary for the current treatment of the patient\" (Minn.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 144.335 (3a)(b)(2)). Mississippi provides for disclosure \"when necessary for the continued treatment of a patient\" (Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-97). Missouri law pro-vides for disclosure without consent \"to persons or agencies responsible forproviding health care services to such patients, residents or clients\" (Mo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 630.140(3)(2)). Montana law provides for disclosure of recordspertaining to \"the seriously mentally ill\" \"in communications between quali-fied professionals in the provision of services or appropriate referrals\" (Mont.Code Ann. 53-21-166(1)). New Jersey law (N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30:4-24.3)provides that the confidentiality requirements that apply in state mentalhealth facilities do not prohibit \"the professional staff of a communityagency under contract with the Division of Mental Health Services in theDepartment of Human Services, or of a screening service, short-term careor psychiatric facility * * * from disclosing information that is relevant to apatient's current treatment to the staff of another such agency.\" The NewYork Mental Hygiene Code, \u00a7 33.16(a)(1) permits disclosure to \"practitionersas part of a consultation or referral during the treatment of the patient orclient.\" The Pennsylvania mental health statute (50 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 7111) permits disclosure to \"those providing treatment to the person.\" The RhodeIsland statute (R.I. Gen. Laws. \u00a7 40.1-5-26(b)(2)), on the other hand, per-mits disclosure \"in communications among qualified medical or mentalhealth professionals in the provision of services or appropriatereferrals\"(though Rhode Island only permits disclosure of mental healthtreatment in community residences within the same residence (R.I. Gen.Laws \u00a7 40.1-24.5-11). Vermont goes even further, allowing for disclosureof information, \"upon proper inquiry to the patient's family, clergy, physi-cian or health care agent\" (Vt. Stat. Ann. tit 18 \u00a7 7103). Finally, Washing-ton permits disclosure of mental health records: (e) To qualified staff members of the department, to the director of re- gional support networks, to resource management services responsible for serving a patient, or to service providers designated by resource manage-ment services as necessary to determine the progress and adequacy of treatment and to determine whether the person should be transferred to aCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The information shall remain confidential. (f) Within the treatment facility where the patient is receiving treatment,confidential information may be disclosed to individuals employed, serv- ing in bona fide training programs, or participating in supervised volun- teer programs, at the facility when it is necessary to perform their duties.(g) Within the department as necessary to coordinate treatment for mental illness, developmental disabilities, alcoholism, or drug abuse of individu- als who are under the supervision of the department.(h) To a licensed physician who has determined that the life or health of the individual is in danger and that treatment without the information contained in the treatment records could be injurious to the patient'shealth. Disclosure shall be limited to the portions of the records necessary to meet the medical emergency. (i) To a facility that is to receive an individual who is involuntarily com-mitted * * * or upon transfer of the individual from one treatment facility to another. The release of records under this subsection shall be limited to the treatment records required by law, a record or summary of all somatictreatments, and a discharge summary. The discharge summary may in- clude a statement of the patient's problem, the treatment goals, the type of treatment which has been provided, and recommendation for future treat-ment, but may not include the patient's complete treatment record (Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 71.05.630). The North Carolina mental health statute is one of the most compre- hensive statutes, providing over a dozen different contexts in which infor-mation regarding mental patients may be disclosed (N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann.\u00a7122C-55). It is too complex to summarize here and is attached as an appendix. The Wisconsin statute (Wis. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 51.30), not reproducedhere, is nearly as complex. A number of states require some sort of special determination before records can be released to other treatment providers. The Georgia mentalhealth code, for example, states: \"When the chief medical officer of thefacility where the record is kept deems it essential for continued treatment,a copy of the record or parts thereof may be released to physicians orpsychologists when and as necessary for the treatment of the patient\" (Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 37-3-166(a)(1)). The Hawaii statute similarly provides fordisclosure as it \"may be deemed necessary by the director of health or bythe administrator of a private psychiatric or special treatment facility tocarry out this chapter\" (Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 334-5. See, similarly, N.D. Cent.Code \u00a7 25-03.1-43). The Maryland law provides for disclosure withoutconsent: (I) To the medical or mental health director of a juvenile or adult deten- tion or correctional facility if: 1.

After a review of the medical record, the health care provider who is the custodian of the recordis satisfied that disclosure is necessary for the proper care and treatment of the recipient (Md. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-307(j)). Nevada law permits disclosure \"to a qualified member of the staff of a division facility, an employee of the Division * * *, when the Administratordeems it necessary for the proper care of the client\" (Nev. Rev. Stat.\u00a7433A.360). Nevada law (Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 433.482(8)) also provides that a patient may refuse access to his records to persons without a court orderor authorization who are not members of facility staff, and permits thesealing of clinical records of patients who are released from a mental healthfacility as recovered (Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 433A.703, 433A.711). The Nevadastatute further provides, however, \"if, after the sealing of the records, thepetitioner is being treated by a physician or licensed psychologist, the phy-sician or psychologist may obtain a copy of the petitioner's records fromthe hospital or facility. Any records so obtained must be used solely for thetreatment of the petitioner\" (Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 433A.711). At least one state has a provision for obtaining, as opposed to dis- closing, the medical records of mental patients. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 135-C:19-a(II) provides: when the medical director or designee determines that obtaining informa- tion is essential to the care or treatment of a person admitted pursuant to [the mental health commitment statute] a designated receiving facility may request, and any health care provider which previously provided servicesto any person involuntarily admitted to the facility may provide, informa- tion about such person limited to medications prescribed, known medica- tion allergies or other information essential to the medical or psychiatriccare of the person admitted. Prior to requesting such information the facility shall in writing request the person's consent for such request for information. If the consent cannot be obtained, the facility shall informthe person in writing of the care providers who have been requested to provide information to the facility pursuant to this section. The facility may disclose such information as is necessary to identify the person andthe facility which is requesting the information. Several states provide for the transfer of mental health records with a patient. Nevada law provides that when a patient is transferred from apublic medical facility, the patient's records must be forwarded to the newfacility (Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 449.705, 433.332). Oregon and Pennsylvaniahave similar laws (see Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 179.505(6); Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. tit.50, \u00a7 4602). Tenn. Ann. \u00a7 33-3-105 provides for disclosure if \"aCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 43-1-19). See also N.M. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 32A-6-15 (making similar provision for child patients). At least one state permits disclosure for treatment but requires that the patient be notified of the disclosure (Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-146f). Severalothers require that an accounting be kept of disclosures (see, e.g., Wash.Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 71.05.420). Finally, some state statutes contain exceptions that do not clearly cover treatment, but may be construed to do so in some situations. Ky. Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 210.235(2), for example, allows disclosure as \"necessary to carryout the provisions for the Kentucky Revised Statutes, and the rules andregulations of cabinets and agencies of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\"Maine law provides for disclosure of information by the Department ofMental Health \"to carry out any of the statutory functions of the Depart-ment\" (Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34B \u00a7 1207(1)(B)). CONCLUSION In sum, state laws vary widely in terms of authorizing the disclosure of mental health records without consent for treatment purposes. Many ofthem are, or could be interpreted as being, more restrictive than the HIPAAregulations. A few may even be more restrictive than the substance abuseconfidentiality statute. These laws could in many cases stand in the way ofcoordinated treatment of persons with mental illness. This is an issue thatthe Department of Health and Human Services should consider in anyrevision of the HIPAA privacy regulations. State legislatures should alsoreview their state statutes to assure that a proper balance is reached be-tween the need for keeping mental health records confidential, on the onehand, and the need to share information among treatment providers toassure proper treatment on the other.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Treatment of MH/SA in VA In 2003, 1.2 million veterans received a MH/SA diagnosis in VA, about 25% of all VA users. While they were a diagnosticallymixed, Global Assessment of Functioning scores averaged 53,suggesting poor functioning, and 19% were dually diagnosed.VA is a cabinet-level agency with many important stakeholders.Concern about war-related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)and homelessness among veterans have given mental health issuesgreater prominence in the VA community in recent years. In1995, a major reform was initiated which closed most MH/SAinpatient beds, nearly doubled outpatients treated, and emphasizedaccountability and performance measurement. Linkage of VA with the Department of Defense (DoD) and Other Mental Health, Medical, and Social Service Systems There has been great interest recently in smoothing the transition from DoD to VA, although the integration of information systemshas yet to take place. Most VA patients get all of their MH/SAand medical services from VA. Although there has been concernthat with extensive recent bed closures, VA patients would beforced to seek care in other health systems and might experience anincreased risk of incarceration or suicide, empirical studies conductedthus far have not shown a significant increase in these problems. Development of MH/SA Quality Measurement and Quality Management in VA During the past 20 years there have been two notable phases in the development of VA MH/SA services. The first was initiatedby the leader of mental health programs in VA central officefrom 1985-1994 and involved expansion of specialized mentalhealth programs such as Assertive Community Treatment, homelessCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The second was initiated in 1995 by the undersecretary for Health and brought changes inmental health service delivery as part of a major system-wideshift from operating as a hospital-based system of care to a communityor population-based system of care. In both phases quality andperformance measurement were crucial tools in guiding organizationalchange. A third phase, characterized by system-wide focus onbuilding MH/SA quality is evolving in response to the recent reportof the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Quality of VA MH/SA Care The assessment of quality requires comparison of providers with standards or benchmarks, with risk adjustment for factors thatmay confound these comparisons. Evaluation of the quality ofMH/SA care at VA facilities has been based on comparisons with:(1) VA system average performance, (2) VA performance in prioryears, (3) the performance of other systems of care, and (4) comparisonof care received by minorities with the majority population. Methodsof quality measurement and benchmarking in VA are demonstratedfor six aims highlighted in a previous Institute of Medicine (IOM)report: safety, effectiveness, person-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency,and equitability. Front-Line Experience Performance management in health care is sometimes experienced ambivalently by front line managers and clinicians. While theyoften feel empowered by access to data and find it allows themto improve the care they provide, there is also concern that measuresare imperfect; that they do not take account of differences acrossfacilities in case mix and in available community resources; thatmeasures can be manipulated or \"gamed,\" resulting in unfaircomparisons; and that managerial pressure to improve performancesometimes creates an atmosphere of personal criticism more thanjoint problem solving. Conclusion The complexity and uncertainty of the health care enterprise must be managed through comprehensive quality monitoring systemsused by creative and committed leaders in competent organizations.VA has embraced this challenge.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

One can imagine building a bridge from one side of a chasmto the other, from both sides toward the middle, or even from a scaffoldingerected on the floor in the center of the chasm out to both sides. But it isvirtually impossible to imagine bridging a chasm if one were blocked fromeither viewing or accessing even one of its banks. The situation faced bythose who would seek to bridge the many quality chasms in mental healthcare in the United States is in many respects like that of an engineer bridginga complex system of chasms with access to only one of its banks. Peoplewith serious mental illness often have needs for diverse services includingpsychiatric care, substance abuse care, primary and specialty medical care,and numerous social services including income supports, employment, edu-cation, and housing assistance, as well as help negotiating with the criminaljustice system. And yet each of these needs is addressed by a different set ofagencies at different levels of government. The advantage of this decentral-ized approach is that it increases local control, responsiveness, and flexibility(Peterson, 1995; Smith and Lipsky, 1993). The disadvantage is that agenciestend to compete for sources of funding, carefully guard their independence,and are often wary of sharing information on individual clients, let alonereleasing systematic data on their overall operation. Mental health systemengineers in America thus often find themselves trying to bridge systemchasms while only being able to obtain information on the small patch ofground under their own feet. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is a notable exception to this pattern. In most areas of U.S. social or health care policy, programs areoperated at state or local levels by private or nonprofit providers, and therole of the federal government is limited. In contrast, the national govern-ment takes direct responsibility for providing comprehensive, lifelong, medi-cal and social services to Veterans of the Armed Forces. National defense isthe least contested area of federal dominance in the American system ofgovernment; as a result, the federal government has been given responsibil-ity for the health and social welfare of military personnel, both on activeduty and, for an increasingly large segment of veterans, after their period ofmilitary service is over. The VA thus represents the unusual case in whichone agency accepts responsibility, at the national level, for providing com-prehensive long-term care for a well-defined segment of the population.Mental health care provided by the VA may thus offer a uniquely informa-tive, if atypical, opportunity to examine mental health performance moni-toring and management in the American context. Taking a broad view, this presentation will: (1) describe the veteran population of the United States, compare the mental health needs (includ-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

It will then (2) present an overview of theVA health care system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)\u2014andspecifically its delivery of mental health and substance abuse services, pay-ing special attention to the most prominent needs of the treated population,basic organizational structures, and notable changes in the delivery of thoseservices in the past decade. (3) Next, data on the linkages between VA andnon-VA mental health and social welfare systems will be presented to allowevaluation of the level of self-containment of VA mental health care and thenature of its linkages with other systems. The next section (4) describes theorganizational processes through which quality management has been de-veloped in VA mental health and substance abuse care in recent years.Having presented the context of mental health performance management,in the next section (5) we present evidence concerning the safety, effective-ness, person-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency and equitability of VAmental health and substance abuse care as it has changed in recent yearsand as it compares to other health care systems. Finally, (6) we touch on anarea that has received virtually no systematic attention, the sometimes am-bivalent reactions of front-line health system managers and clinicians to theimplementation of performance management systems. I. AMERICA'S VETERANS: MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE STATUS AND USE OF VA SERVICES America's Veterans In 2001, the national Survey of Veterans (SOV) conducted detailed interviews with a nationally representative sample of 20,000 veterans iden-tified through VA administrative records and random digit dialing (USVA,2004). Population estimates derived from the survey were based on anoverall estimate of 25,196,036 living veterans in 2001, which included12.4% of all U.S. adults and 24.5% of men 18 years or older (U.S. CensusBureau, 2001) (see column 1 of Table 1). The two most distinctive charac-teristics of the veteran population is that it is overwhelmingly male (94%)and that its age distribution is shaped by defense manpower needs andparticularly wartime recruitment, rather than by the natural rate of popula-tion growth. Veterans are older than other Americans, first, because eligibility for military service begins at 18. In addition, and perhaps more important,World War II, the Korean conflict, and the Vietnam conflict, spanning 34years from 1941 to 1975, were fought by far larger forces than have servedin the 28 years since 1975. Altogether 30 million troops served during theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html428 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS three major war eras from 1941 to 1975 while only 5.7 million living veterans entered military service since 1975 (U.S. Census Bureaus, 2001).Thus 46% of veterans are 60 years old or more as compared to only 16.6%of the general population and 14.5% of men. A detailed characterization ofthe U.S. veteran population based on the 2001 SOV is presented in the firstcolumn of Table 1. Veterans do not differ markedly from the rest of theU.S. population in racial composition, education, or employment althoughthere are somewhat fewer blacks and Hispanics and educational levels aresomewhat higher among veterans, most likely due to the availability ofspecific veterans' educational benefits. Mental Health and Substance Abuse Disorders Among Veterans and Nonveterans in the General Population Self-report data from the SOV show that 6.6% of veterans report having received services for a MH/SA problem in the past year, but thesedata do not allow comparison with the MH/SA status of the general popu-lation. The most useful study for comparing MH/SA problems of veteranand nonveteran men is a secondary analysis of data from the EpidemiologicalCatchment Area (ECA), which surveyed the mental health status of 18,572Americans, including 10,954 men, and oversampled older Americans, infive locations in 1980 (Norquist et al., 1990). ECA data reveal no differences in lifetime prevalence of mental health disorder among veterans of World War II or either the Korean or Vietnamconflict eras and age-matched nonveteran men. In contrast, veterans of thepost-Vietnam era (the initial period of the All Volunteer Force [AVF]) showa greater prevalence of lifetime mental disorder (54.6% of veterans vs. 40.9% of nonveterans [p <.0001]). Data on 6-month prevalence of mental disorder show a similar pattern, although World War II era veterans had asignificantly lower overall prevalence of mental disorder than nonveterans(11.8% vs. 17.7%, p <.01). Examination of specific lifetime disorders shows that World War II era veterans had lower prevalences of any nonsubstance abuse disorder thannonveterans (12.2% vs. 18.5%, p <.01); Vietnam era veterans had lowerprevalence of schizophrenic disorders (0.8% vs. 2.2%, p <.05) and affectivedisorders (4.4% vs. 8.3%, p <.01); and post-Vietnam veterans had higher lifetime prevalence of substance abuse disorders (47.4% vs. 30.6%, p <.01,including both alcohol and drug disorders) and antisocial personality dis-order (14.9% vs. 5.8%) but lower prevalence of schizophrenic disorderthan nonveterans (0.3% vs. 1.5%, p <.01). Findings of greater rates of mental illness and especially substance abuse among veterans of the AVF are consistent with several studies show-ing greater substance use among military personnel in the immediate post-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The increased risk of homelessness is completely absent or notstatistically significant among veterans of earlier eras in which the draftguaranteed a more representative military force. Thus a major issue in thepsychiatric epidemiology of U.S. veterans appears to be the shift from thedraft to the AVF. There have been far fewer veterans since the end of theVietnam conflict, but they appear to have a greater risk of MH/SA prob-lems, not because of the hazards of military service, but because of self-selection processes among those who volunteer. Findings from the ECA are also consistent with the results of the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS) (Kulka et al.,1990), a major epidemiologic study of representative samples of Vietnamera veterans and a matched sample of nonveterans. While the NVVRSfound higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among veteransexposed to high levels of combat than among other veterans who were notand civilians; rates of other mental disorders did not differ between veteranand nonveteran populations. A recent analysis of data from 12,480 male respondents aged 25-60 in the National Household Drug Abuse Surveys from 1994, 1997, and 1998showed veterans reported greater rates of near-daily alcohol use in the pastyear (22.9 vs. 19.2%, p <.001) but lower rates of illicit drug use (10.0% vs.12.9%, p <.001) (Tessler et al., in press). Similarly, an epidemiologic studythat compared homeless veteran and nonveteran men in Los Angeles foundthat veterans were less likely to have nonsubstance abuse mental healthdisorders (47.5% vs. 65.2%, p <.01) but more likely to meet criteria foralcohol abuse or dependence (72.3% vs. 59.8%, p <.05) (Rosenheck andKoegel, 1993). Both these studies involve representative samples of theveteran population, not those involved in treatment. MH/SA Status Among Veteran and Nonveteran Users of Mental Health Services Three studies have compared veteran and nonveteran men who were using MH/SA services (Desai et al., in press-b; Rosenheck et al., 2000a;Tessler et al., 2002). These studies generally have found veterans to beolder, less likely to be minorities, better educated, and with higher incomes,and analyses were adjusted for these differences in comparisons of mentalhealth status. The Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) study of representative samples of patients treated for schizophrenia in Ohio andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html430 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS Georgia included an over-sampling of VA patients to allow adequate power for comparison of VA-non-VA male service users (N = 466 VA patientsand 279 non-VA male patients) (Rosenheck et al., 2000a). After adjustingfor age and race differences, no significant differences were found on mea-sures of psychosis, depression, or substance abuse. A comparison of 1,252 veteran and 3,236 nonveteran men treated at 18 sites in the ACCESS demonstration of service system integration forhomeless people with severe mental illness also found no differences be-tween veterans and nonveterans on psychiatric or drug problems, althoughveterans had somewhat more severe alcohol problems as measured by theAddiction Severity Index (Tessler et al., 2002). Finally, the Connecticut Outcome Study compared 196 VA patients and 337 non-VA patients treated at nearby state-operated CommunityMental Health Centers and also found no significant differences in mea-sures of psychiatric symptoms or substance abuse, after adjustment for age,race and income (Desai et al., in press). Use of VA Services Data from the 2001 SOV show that 20.5% of veterans reported using any VA services (i.e., not specifically MH/SA services) in the past year and34.4% in their lifetimes. These figures are substantially higher than thoserecorded in a similar national survey conducted in 1987. In that survey,only 5.8% reported VA service use in the past year and 21.2% lifetime(Rosenheck and Massari, 1993). These substantial changes reflect at leastthree factors. First, eligibility for VA services was vastly expanded in 1996from those who receive VA compensation or pension benefits or have lowincomes, estimated to have represented only 9.4 million veterans (Kizer,1999), to the entire population of 25 million veterans. In addition, majorchanges in the configuration of VA facilities have made services far moreaccessible. In the 1990s major reductions in inpatient beds allowedexpansion of outpatient care and the establishment of over 500 accessiblecommunity-based outpatient clinics (GAO, 2001). In 2003, the averageveteran lived 12.2 miles from the nearest VA facility as compared to 32.0miles in 1994 (Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2003; Rosenheck and Cicchetti,1995). In addition, the increasing numbers of uninsured Americans and thegrowing cost and importance of prescription drugs have also contributed tothe growing demand for virtually free VA services. In spite of the changes in eligibility, veteran characteristics that are associated with use of VA services have changed little since 1987. Columns2 and 3 in Table 1 show the proportions of veterans in each subgroup whoused VA services in the past year and in their lifetimes. Both recent andlifetime VA service use is associated with greater age, minority status, lowCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Table 2 presents a logistic regression analysis of factors that predict recent and lifetime VA service use to illustrate both the independent and therelative magnitude of the effects of each factor. The fourth and seventhcolumns rank the absolute value of the magnitude of these effects (bothpositive and negative) and show the strongest correlates of VA service useto be receipt of VA compensation, low income, lack of private insurance,poor health, age less than 30, African American race, Prisoner of Warexperience, and mental health service use and related disability. These fac-tors are virtually the same as those identified in the 1987 SOV (Rosenheckand Massari, 1993). Use of VA Mental Health Services SOV data further reveal that 6.6% of all veterans used mental health services in the previous year, and 2.7% used VA mental health services(41% of those who used any mental health services) (Columns 4 and 5 ofTable 1). Among mental health service users, too, those who used VAservices are older, more likely to be minority group members, had lesseducation and lower incomes, lacked private insurance, had poorer health,and received VA compensation (see also Table 3 for logistic regressionanalysis and ranking). It is notable that veterans who sought services forPTSD were especially likely to have used VA mental health services, repli-cating a finding from a previous analysis of the NVVRS data (Rosenheckand Fontana, 1995) and showing that, contrary to what was once popularbelief, veterans with PTSD related to their military service do not avoidusing VA mental health services. The PORT survey of the treatment of schizophrenia in Ohio and Geor- gia allows further comparison, with the group of severely mentally ill veter-ans, of those who used VA services (N = 350) and those who used non-VAservices (N = 170) (reanalysis based on data in Rosenheck et al., 2000a).Stepwise logistic regression showed veterans who used VA services to be2.7 times more likely to be receiving VA compensation, 3.0 times morelikely to be living in a supervised residence, 37% less likely to be black, andto have used fewer emergency services and have had less severe symptoms. A study that focused on administrative data from state mental hospitals in eight states between 1984 and 1989 (Desai and Rosenheck, 2000) foundthat from 7 to 27% of men in these non-VA facilities were veterans ascompared to 29-34% in the general male population, suggesting that veter-ans are less likely to use non-VA service than other men. In comparisonwith other state hospital patients, veterans were older, more like to havealcoholism and bipolar disorder, and perhaps of greatest interest: (a) livedCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Thus, inaddition to personal characteristics, both residential remoteness from a VAfacility and scant supply of VA services in relation to non-VA services increasedveterans' use of non-VA services. A study of the proportion of veterans in each U.S. county who use VA MH/SA services similarly found distance from veterans' residences to thenearest VA facility to be the strongest predictor of VA MH/SA services use,along with the relative local supply of VA and non-VA services (Rosenheckand Stolar, 1998). In fact, VA service use among veterans service connectedfor psychoses was specifically reduced in association with a high supply ofstate and county mental hospital resources, while VA use among non-psychotic veterans was negatively associated with the supply of non-Federalgeneral hospital resources. The impact of the supply and proximity of VAservices has also been demonstrated in a sample of homeless mental healthservices users (Gamache et al., 2000). II. TREATMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN THE VA: PATIENTS, ADMINISTRATION, RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES, STAKEHOLDERS, AND CHANGES SINCE 1995 The VA is a cabinet level federal department that includes two major subdivisions that provide services to people with mental illness: (1) TheVHA, which delivered health care services to approximately 5 millionveterans in fiscal year (FY) 2003 at 162 medical centers and more than 850facility and community based clinics; and (2) the Veterans Benefits Admin-istration (VBA), which provided income benefits to over 2.5 million veteransin FY 2003 in addition to rehabilitation and educational support and hous-ing loan guarantees (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2003). Of the 2.5million veterans who received compensation from VBA in 2003, 481,000received compensation for mental illness, and of these 47% used VA mentalhealth services (Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2004a). VA Patients Diagnosed with Mental Health and Substance Abuse Disorders Administrative workload data from the VHA show that in FY 2003, 1,218,327 veterans (about 25% of all those who received VA healthservices) received a mental health or substance abuse (MH/SA) diagnosis(ICD-9 codes 290.00-312.99) during an inpatient, nursing home, residen-tial, or outpatient encounter (Table 4).Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX C 433 The most frequent MH/SA diagnoses (Table 4, numbered column 2) were dysthymia (41%), PTSD (20%), anxiety disorder (20%), and a drug diagnosed. Altogether, 38% received VA compensa-tion for medical or psychiatric problems, almost four times that in thegeneral population. Among veterans who received a MH/SA diagnosis, 930,098 (76%) received a primary diagnosis for MH/SA (Table 4, numbered column 3),meaning that the MH/SA diagnosis was the primary focus of at least onecontact during the year; and 705,209 of these received treatment in a MH/SA specialty program (numbered column 4) (76% of those who received aprimary MH/SA diagnosis and 57% of those who received any primary orsecondary MH/SA diagnosis). An additional 89,372 veterans received ser-vices in a specialty mental health program but did not receive a primarymental health diagnosis (not shown on table), for a total of 794,581 or17% of all VA patients who received mental health services in a specialtyclinic setting (Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2004a). The most frequent MH/SA diagnoses among veterans treated in specialty clinics (Table 4, numbered column 5) were also dysthymia (43%), PTSD(31%), anxiety disorder (22%), and major depressive disorder (24%), with26% receiving a substance abuse diagnosis (20% alcohol abuse/dependenceand 16% drug abuse/dependence), and 18% were dually diagnosed. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores based on a single item rating scale ranging from 0 to 100, which is a standard part of the psychi-atric diagnosis, average 41.8 (s.d. = 13.1) among inpatients at the time ofdischarge and 53.3 (s.d. = 11.3) among outpatients (Greenberg andRosenheck, 2004a). A GAF score of 50 is often used as a cutoff for severemental illness. Thus although fewer than 15% of VA patients with MH/SAdiagnoses have the most severe illnesses such as schizophrenia or bipolardisorder, there is considerable functional impairment among these patients.It is also noteworthy that although only 76% of veterans with a primaryMH/SA diagnosis receive care in specialty clinics, 95% or more of thosewith the most serious illnesses (schizophrenia, major depressive disorder,bipolar disorder, or PTSD) receive care in MH/SA specialty clinics, and45% receive VA compensation. Annual surveys conducted from FY 1995 (Rosenheck et al., 1996c) to FY 2000 (Seibyl et al., 2001) showed that almost 30% of VA psychiatricinpatients, and almost 50% of those in inpatient substance abuse programs,had been homeless at the time of admission. Over 100,000 MH/SA outpa-tients are identified as homeless each year, about 12% of the total, which ismost likely a substantial undercount, since coding for homelessness is notuniform in the outpatient files.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In the 1950s, VA established acommunity foster care program that represented one of the early efforts totransfer severely mentally ill patients from the hospital to the community(Linn et al., 1977). In the 1960s and 1970s, day hospitals (Linn et al., 1979)and day treatment centers were established as alternatives to hospitaliza-tion along with specialized inpatient and outpatient substance abuse pro-grams and a transitional employment program that offered veterans theopportunity to work, first in workshop settings and subsequently at com-munity jobs. More recently, specialized programs have been established totreat military-related PTSD; to conduct outreach and provide residentialtreatment for homeless veterans; to provide residential rehabilitation incommunity settings and to deliver specialized services to veterans withsubstance abuse problems. Table 5 summarizes workloads in specializedVA inpatient and outpatient MH/SA programs. While it appears that asmany as 400,000 may receive treatment in specialized programs, these figuresare not unduplicated counts and a substantial number of veterans are treatedin more than one program. More will be said about the development,management, and monitoring of specialized VA MH/SA programs, below. Administrative Organization The VHA is led by the undersecretary for Health, a presidential appoin- tee approved by the Senate. Line authority for operations devolves throughthe deputy undersecretary for operations and management to the directorsof 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), the regional unit ofadministration in VHA. VISN directors are responsible for supervision ofthe directors of each of the 152 local VA Medical Centers (VAMCs), about130 of which operate specialty mental health programs. VISNs serve anaverage of 231,000 veterans per year with an average of 8,671 Full TimeEmployee Equivalents (FTEE) and consist of 4-8 medical centers, which eachserve an average of 37,554 veterans per year with an average of 1,437 FTEE. The lead mental health expert in VA Central Office (VACO) is the chief consultant of the Strategic Health Care Group for Mental Health, whoprovides staff support to the chief of Patient Care Services and through thatposition to the deputy undersecretary for Health. Thus, the national leaderof mental health has no direct line or budgetary authority and acts as a staffadvisor, several levels below top VHA leadership. The national Office ofQuality and Performance (OQP) in VACO is responsible for designingnational performance measures and does so with extensive input from theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The director of OQP reports directly to the deputy undersecretary for Health. While there is some variability in organization across VISNs and VAMCs, most have a mental health service line manager, most often apsychiatrist or psychologist, who is responsible for coordinating the deliv-ery of mental health care by all the involved professions at that facility. Atpresent, mental health service line managers do not have budgetary authorityand appeal to VISN or VAMC leaders for resources in competition with theleadership of other medical specialties. Quality management and prepara-tion for Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations(JCAHO) and Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities(CARF) accreditation are VISN and VAMC responsibilities, in which themental health service line managers are responsible for the performance ofthe mental health programs. Relationships with Other Federal Departments Collaboration to facilitate the transition from Department of Defense (DoD) to VA care has been of growing interest in recent years. Staff of theVBA counsel military personnel about their VA benefits as they leave mili-tary service, but there has been no ongoing sharing of medical records orother information. Specific efforts are now being made to facilitate elec-tronic information exchange between the agencies, especially in response tothe concern about the new generation of veterans now returning from Iraq.The position of deputy Secretary for Health for Health Policy Coordinationwas created 2 years ago to lead interagency program development and toserve as the principle liaison between VA and the Department of Healthand Human Services. VA participates actively in joint activities with otherfederal agencies, as in the Interagency Counsel on Homelessness and thePresident's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, and has con-ducted joint service and evaluation projects with Housing and Urban Devel-opment (Rosenheck et al., 2003a) and the Social Security Administration(Rosenheck et al., 1999b, 2000a), among others. VA differs from mostother federal agencies in that it is a direct provider of services rather than achannel for funds, and thus collaboration in service delivery is uncommonbut may grow with DoD. Stakeholders The primary external stakeholders in the operation of VA are the Con- gress, and especially the Veterans Affairs Committees, and the VeteransService Organizations (e.g., the Paralyzed Veterans of America, DisabledVeterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Perhaps because issues of PTSD and homelessness among veteranshave been prominent in recent years, these stakeholders appear to haveshown greater interest in mental health issues over the past 15 years, andparticularly in the quality and funding of VA mental health care. Congressalso established a committee with VHA, the undersecretary for Health'sSpecial Committee on Treatment of Severely Mentally Ill Veterans (the SMIcommittee), charged with making recommendations for of improving MH/SA care and monitoring maintenance of MH/SA capacity. The SMI com-mittee is required to submit an annual report to the Congress. Changes in MH/SA Service Delivery Since 1995 In 1995, Kenneth Kizer, MD MPH, was appointed undersecretary for Health and initiated an extensive reform of VHA. Kizer encouraged a shiftto a population-based preventive and primary care focus rather than ahospital, specialty care focus. He vigorously promoted a reduction in inpa-tient service utilization and championed an expansion of outpatient treat-ment, in part through the development of community-based outpatientclinics, small satellite clinics located closer to where veterans lived. Thesegoals were reinforced through a capitated system of resource allocation andby placing major emphasis on accountability through the use of perfor-mance measures (Kizer, 1999). Although his focus was not specific to MH/SA, during these years VA mental health underwent a substantial transformation. Between 1995 and2003, 66% of all general psychiatry inpatient beds and 96% of all inpa-tient substance abuse beds were closed. The number of long-term psychi-atric patients, that is, those hospitalized for more than a year, declined by 81% and the number with psychiatric diagnoses on inpatient medicalunits declined by 93%. Inpatient length of stay dropped 43%, from anaverage of 27.8 days to 15.8 days, allowing more patients to use theremaining beds. As a result, the number of episodes of inpatient caredeclined by only 44%. With the pressure of a capitated resource allocation system and population- based planning, the total number of mental health outpatients increased by44.7%, or 5.6% per year, from 545,004 to 788,502. Perhaps to allow timeto serve this increasing workload, the average number of annual visits perveteran declined from 15.1 to 12.8 (15%). Specialized outpatient substance abuse (SA) services initially (FY 1995- FY 1998) followed this general trend, with 3% annual growth in the numberof patients treated, but from FY 1998 to FY 2003 the number of veteranswho received specialized outpatient substance abuse services declined by 19% (3.7%/year). Since there was no reduction in need of SA services in theCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

III. LINKAGE OF VETERANS WITH THE DOD AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH, MEDICAL, AND SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEMS As noted in the Introduction, VA is unique in American mental health care as an integrated national system providing comprehensive services to adesignated population. There are, however, no restrictions that preventveterans who use VA services from using other systems of care. In thissection we examine the involvement of VA patients with other systems bothto better understand the context of VA care and to assess how self-containedVA and its service users actually are. Issues of confidentiality often complicate examination of service use across systems. While it is occasionally possible to merge data using identi-fiers such as social security numbers, there are two other approaches thatdo not require common identifiers. In the first approach, VA patients canbe surveyed about their use of non-VA services. In the second, populationscan be matched probabilistically on the basis of the degree of overlap in thefrequency distribution of birthdates. The greater the overlap in the distribu-tion of birthdates, the greater the likelihood of an overlap in populations(Pandiani et al., 1998). Transition from DoD to VA There has been only one study of the flow of mental health patients from DoD to VA. In that study (Mojtabi et al., 2003), records of patientsdischarged from military service for schizophrenia or bipolar or majoraffective disorder were merged with VA service use data. Only 52% ofdischarged veterans had contact with the VA system. Notably, neitherwomen nor minorities were any less likely than other veterans to find theirway to the VA. It is unknown whether those who did not contact VA hadadequate access to service elsewhere or had been discouraged, somehow,from using VA services. Cross MH/SA System Use Several studies have examined use of non-VA MH/SA services by VA patients. First, a number of recent clinical trials have collected detailed costdata on VA and non-VA service use. Data from a study of supported housingfor homeless veterans, most of whom had SA problems, found that 23% ofall health costs over a three-year period were from non-VA sourcesCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In contrast, two studies of the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia found less than 7% of annual health care costswere attributed to non-VA services (Rosenheck et al., 1997a, 2003d). A study based on merged administrative data from VA and from virtu- ally all public providers of public mental health services in Philadelphiacounty found that over a six year period from 1988-1993, 17% of VA MH/SA service users used any non-VA MH/SA services in at least 1 year, with7% using non-VA services in the final year (Desai et al., 2001). In thatstudy there were no differences in cross system use between mental health(MH), SA, and dually diagnosed veterans. Cost data from a related analysisof a subset of Philadelphia veterans suggest that only 4% of total costsamong VA MH/SA users were attributable to non-VA service use. A similar study of 10,950 VA MH/SA users in Colorado from 1995 to 1997 found only 7.7% used services of the state mental health agency overthese three years, although annual rates increased from 2.9 to 5.9% overthe years (Desai and Rosenheck, 2002). Veterans most likely to use non-VAservices had made more extensive use of VA services, resided further awayfrom the nearest VA facility, and lived closer to the nearest non-VA facility. Finally, two studies examined whether VA inpatient bed closures dur- ing the 1990s resulted in greater use of non-VA mental health services. Thefirst study, based on merged data from three large cities in Connecticut withboth VA and state mental health agency facilities, found that closure of80% of VA mental health beds in the state in 1996 resulted in a statisticallysignificant but small increase in the proportion of VA patients who usedstate mental health services, from 2.7 to 3.6%, but that the proportion oftotal costs borne by the state ranged from 5.7 to 9.6% over the yearsstudied (1993-1998) and did not increase significantly. The second study (Rosenheck et al., 2000c) used population probabil- ity sampling to compare rates of admission to non-VA inpatient units innorthern New York State in association with closure of 37% of VA mentalhealth beds in the region. While finding no significant time trend, the studyreported greater risk of admission among VA inpatients than outpatientsand greater rates of admission to non-VA hospitals among dually diag-nosed and SA patients than among mental health patients. Primary Care and Specialty Medical Services It might be expected that in an integrated system that provides both MH/SA and general medical services, access to medical services might besuperior. However, two studies that used survey data to compare access tomedical services among severely mentally ill patients in VA and non-VAMH systems failed to find any significant differences (Desai et al., in press-b;Rosenheck et al., 2000a). In addition, a randomized controlled trial thatCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX C 439 compared medical care quality and outcomes in a sample of severely men- tally ill veterans when treated in standard VA medical clinics and in anintegrated primary care clinic colocated within the mental health clinic areafound that both quality and outcomes were significantly increased in thecolocated clinic (Druss et al., 2001). Analysis of data on homeless veteranshas also identified substantial barriers to accessing primary care services inVA (Desai et al., 2003). On the other hand, data on quality of preventive services, diabetes care, post-MI care and health and nutrition counseling in VA show that MH/SAveterans who received at least three primary medical care visits had aquality of care that was similar to other veterans but superior to similarmeasures from non-VA systems (Desai et al., 2002a,b,c; Druss et al., 2002).It seems that some veterans with MH/SA problems have difficulty accessingprimary care services, but those who do receive services have access to high-quality care. Criminal Justice Involvement There has been considerable concern, and substantial speculation, that VA bed closures have resulted in increased incarceration among former VApatients. Using the population probability matching method (Rosenheck etal., 2000d), incarceration rates among VA patients in northern New YorkState were not found to have increased over four years during which 37%of mental health beds were closed. Over these years, incarceration amongveterans with MH problems alone ranged from 1.3 to 8.0%, as compared12-15% among substance users, and 8-16% among dually diagnosed vet-erans. The overall incarceration rate among VA MH/SA patients of 11.6%was quadruple that of the general population (2.5%) but less than thatfound among general hospital patients (23%) or state hospital populationsin northern New York (22%), in part, because veterans were older. Some VA homeless outreach programs have undertaken active out- reach to veterans with MH/SA problems in jails. A study of one suchprogram in Los Angeles (McGuire et al., 2003), showed veterans in the L.A.jail to have substantial health problems, most prominently with drug abuse.Outreach to these veterans did not result in substantially increased serviceuse or costs as compared to outreach to other homeless veterans, althoughthe benefit of this type of intervention has not been evaluated. Collaborative Relationships with Other Agencies There has been substantial emphasis on integrating systems of care, especially for homeless people with mental illness. In 1993, VA initiated theCommunity Homelessness Assessment, Local Education, and NetworkingCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Through CHALENG, all agencies concerned with services for homeless veterans are invited tomeet at the local VAMC to review the unmet needs of homeless veteransand to plan collaborative interventions to address those needs. Analysis ofdata gathered at these meetings has suggested that interorganizational rela-tionships are strongest where VA has invested funds in contracts with non-VA providers (McGuire et al., 2002). As noted previously, VA has conducted successful demonstration proj- ects with demonstrable benefits to veterans in housing and quality of life, incollaboration with HUD (Rosenheck et al., 2003a) and the Social SecurityAdministration (Rosenheck et al., 1999b, 2000b). These specifically tar-geted interventions stand in notable contrast to more global efforts at orga-nizational integration, which have not demonstrated benefits to clients eventhough they brought about changes in intraorganizational interactions(Goldman et al., 2002; Rosenheck et al., 2002). IV. DEVELOPMENT OF MH/SA QUALITY MEASUREMENT AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN VA Discussions of quality and/or outcomes improvement not uncommonly focus on the problem of real-world measurement. Such discussions oftenseem to assume that the numbers cannot only speak for themselves, but canalso change the behavior of people whose efforts they reflect. Performancedata, however, have little meaning or usefulness when taken out of theirorganizational context (Rosenheck, 2001a,b), and any meaningful qualitymonitoring effort must have a manager or, more abstractly, an agent whowants to use the data to accomplish some goal or goals. In addition, theagent must (1) have adequate authority and must be able to (2) identifyappropriate target audiences, (3) communicate with those audiences, (4)generate credibility and legitimacy for the enterprise, and (5) have access toadequate analytic capacity\u2014in short, the agent needs a well-functioningorganization. It is also important to recognize that one cannot assume that the goal of performance measurement is the improvement of performance. In a famouspaper, sociologists Meyer and Rowan (1977) pointed out that while theschools and school administrators they studied collected immense amountsof data from their students in the form of test scores, they rarely used thosescores to change their educational methods. More generally, they con-cluded, organizational activities are often maintained less because of theirgoal-furthering functions than because they become institutionalized, self-legitimating activities in and of themselves. Organizational actors, thus,often do things merely because they are \"the thing to do.\" In the absence ofCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX C 441 leadership committed to change and development, MH/SA performance data may serve this more limited legitimizing function. VA is a large and complex organization, with almost 200,000 em- ployees and at least 9 hierarchical levels separating the undersecretary for Health from the veteran. There are active agents concerned about manag-ing quality of care at every level of every organization. Once the bridgingof quality chasms is understood as an organizational process, it becomesclearer that it is impossible for any individual to comprehensively graspthe MH/SA quality improvement activities of VA in its entirety. We live ina world that is driven increasingly by networks rather than hierarchies (Castells, 2000), and this account will no doubt overemphasize initiativesin which I have been involved. The goal is thus not to present a compre-hensive view of MH/SA quality management in VA, but to present onebroad national perspective that will identify informative experiences andperspectives. Evaluation and Monitoring of Specialized VA MH/SA Programs As noted above, one of the basic approaches to improving the quality of MH care in VA, as elsewhere, has been through the establishment ofspecialized programs or treatment units. However, while funds for theseprograms have typically been distributed from VA Central Office in Wash-ington, through the mid-1980s, there was no systematic monitoring ofprogram performance other than mandatory workload reporting, althoughsome specialized programs had been evaluated by VA researchers (Linn etal., 1977, 1979). In 1985, Paul Errera, MD, professor of psychiatry at Yale and chief of psychiatry at the West Haven VAMC, was appointed chief of what wasthen called the Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences Service in VACO(Errera, 1988) (full disclosure: I have worked closely with Dr. Errera for thepast 30 years and was involved in the evaluation of many of his initiatives).While applying for this position he read a book on program implementa-tion by two Berkeley political scientists (Pressman and Wildavsky, 1971).Progress in government, they argued, was only possible if plausible initia-tives were not assumed to be effective, but rather were taken as learningopportunities, to be evaluated with the tools of science. Errera took thisexhortation to heart and in the final negotiations obtained agreement thathe would use his Yale colleagues to evaluate new programs he might ini-tiate. The VA's Northeast Program Evaluation Center (NEPEC) grew outof these evaluations. Errera had two objectives: first, to expand the capacity of VA to deliver community-based MH/SA care, and second, to prevent what he saw as thesteady erosion of MH/SA resources (Tomich, 1992). In his experience at aCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html442 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS university-affiliated VAMC, resources targeted at MH/SA programs often were diverted to more prestigious medical specialties, and he had beenfrustrated at his inability to staunch the loss of resources for a highlystigmatized and politically weak group of veterans. His strategy was incre-mental and opportunistic\u2014he sought any small step forward where anopportunity arose. He also realized that most medical experts thoughtpsychiatry lacked a scientific base and that its outcomes could not be mea-sured. Performance data, he reasoned, could increase the credibility andlegitimacy of his initiatives, supporting their preservation and expansion. Inpart because of the new availability of desk-top computers (the West HavenVA had purchased it first Apple II-E computer the year before Errera wentto Washington), it had become possible to monitor the performance andclinical outcomes of hundreds of programs relatively cheaply and flexibly. The strategy was effective in one additional, unexpected way. Imple- menting new programs with built-in performance monitoring systemsturned out to be a useful approach to training because it clearly communi-cated to staff and supervisors what the expectations were for both treat-ment process and outcome. It was also effective in winning legitimacy forthe programs in VA and in the Congress, which began to require annualreports on newly funded initiatives. During Errera's nine years in Washing-ton, Congress funded hundreds of new programs for Vietnam veterans withPTSD; outreach and residential treatment for homeless veterans; both inpa-tient and outpatient substance abuse treatment; and community-orientedwork restoration programs. In partnership with one of VA's Regional Di-rectors, he initiated a 10-site pilot program of Assertive Community Treat-ment, following the model developed by Stein and Test in Wisconsin (Steinand Test, 1980). Ironically, it was not Errera but the Regional Director whowanted and funded an experimental cost-effectiveness evaluation. Theevaluation study showed the approach to be cost-effective in the VA setting(Rosenheck and Neale, 1998), and it was expanded during Errera's tenureto 30 sites, and currently operates at almost 80 sites (Neale et al., 2003).Performance data on all of these programs are provided to each site inquarterly installments with a comprehensive Annual Report. Front-line stafffind these reports useful in communicating the nature of their activities andaccomplishments (most of which take place out of institutional sight incommunity settings) to their local leadership. In addition, most of the programs are initiated through training confer- ences that focus on both clinical concepts and evaluation procedures. Theseare followed by monthly telephone conference calls at which emergentissues are discussed and clinical experiences are shared. Even with 50 ormore program sites on the line, conversational engagement has been achiev-able, especially when many of the participants have met each other face-to-face at the training conferences. Evaluation reports are reviewed on theseCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

When a national Outlook-based VA intranete-mail system was established, conference call communication was supple-mented by continuous program-wide e-mail chatter. Through this processparticipants join in the formation of a nonhierarchical learning communitythrough which local experiences and lessons learned can be widely shared.All reports identify sites by name so that those who were performing poorlycould identify and learn from those who were performing well. While Errera's initiatives were positively received, the \"fencing\" of funds for new MH/SA programs (i.e., diversion to other uses was prohib-ited) was experienced as an undue constraint by managers responsible forthe full range of VA medical programs, MH/SA and otherwise (Tomich,1992). After 7 years, fencing was eliminated, with some resultant stafflosses and program closures at some sites. Although performance monitor-ing and management of clinical practice runs counter to norms of profes-sional autonomy, it seems to be accepted. Constraints on the fundingdecisions of local managers, however, especially over extended periods oftime, have been far less acceptable. In addition, some MH/SA managers complained that the new programs sometimes distanced themselves from other local MH/SA programs becauseof their special national involvement and followed national practice modelstoo rigidly, as \"stovepipes,\" \"chimneys,\" or \"silos.\" The conflict betweenadherence to evidence-based practice standards and local flexibility seemsto be an intrinsic feature of centrally guided dissemination. Perhaps the principal lesson of these experiences is that meaningful and effective performance measurement and management are most likely tooccur in a well-developed, goal-directed organizational context. The num-bers do not speak for themselves. Expansion of Quality Management in the \"New VA\" after 1995 When Kenneth W. Kizer, MD, MPH, took over as VA undersecretary for Health in 1995, he considered the future of the agency to be in jeop-ardy. In response, he initiated what he described as \"the most radicalredesign since the system was created in 1948.\" (Kizer, 1999:3), with theoverall goal of increasing health care value, defined as quality of care perdollar spent\u2014the return to the taxpayer. He laid out his values, principalsand specific plans in explicit detail in a number of widely circulatedreports (Kizer, 1995, 1996; Kizer and Garthwaite, 1997) and described afirst phase of operational transformation and second phase of qualitytransformation. In the first phase, VHA was reorganized into Veterans Integrated Service Networks \"premised on funding care for populations rather thanCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html444 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS facilities, with a concomitant shift in the primary focus of care from hospitals to ambulatory and community-based settings\" (Kizer, 1999:6).The restructuring of VHA was thus designed to change basic values andorientations\u2014and it did. Between 1994 and 1998, 52% of all VHA bedswere closed, the proportion of patients enrolled in primary care wentfrom 10 to 80%, the proportion of outpatient surgeries increased from35 to 75%; and 216 community- based outpatient clinics were established to improve access. Kizer also promoted the passage of legislation thatwould expand eligibility for VA services to all veterans, a change that, by FY 2002, would result in vast increases in enrollment, especially amongolder veterans seeking low-cost prescription drugs that were not availablefrom Medicare. In the second phase, in addition to these structural changes, an exten- sive program of national performance measurement was initiated, whichsystematically assessed patient satisfaction and which resulted in docu-mented improvements in standard indicators reflecting, among otherthings, the delivery of preventive primary care (including screening fordepression), care of chronic disease, and palliative care (Jha et al., 2003).VA also exceeded Medicare on most measures, but data on rates of screen-ing for depression were not available from Medicare for comparison.Data reports were circulated widely, with detailed information on theperformance of each VISN and VAMC. The goals for this effort wereboth internal and external: (1) to improve the quality of care and establishan overall culture of accountability and quality improvement in VHA,and (2) to demonstrate to the taxpaying public that VA health care was agood investment. Kizer also developed an overall management strategy for fostering qual- ity improvement that consisted of dual systems of: (1) central regulationand (2) competition and rewards. He developed a personal performancecontract with each VISN director each year and encouraged them to dolikewise with their subordinates. He also established systems of bonuses forhigh-performance leaders and awards for exceptional accomplishment. Although MH/SA care was not one of the principal areas of Kizer's initial attention, it was profoundly affected by the emphasis on reducinginpatient care, with substantial reductions in bed capacity. While reduc-tions in general psychiatry inpatient beds were similar to those in non-MHspecialties, almost all of the SA inpatient beds were closed. To providealternative care, residential rehabilitation and domiciliary programs wereexpanded, and residential treatment for homeless veterans was purchasedthrough contracts with local providers. While Errera's initiatives had beenlimited, for the most part, to establishing special programs on the peripheryof the VA MH/SA system, Kizer's reforms were far more extensive andaffected the core.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX C 445 The new emphasis on local decision making and primary care seemed, to some, to pose a threat to the centrally designed and monitored programsErrera had fostered. In response to such expressions of concern, Kizerissued a directive (VHA Directive 96-051), which established a series ofmonitors that addressed both the performance of these special emphasisprograms as well as service delivery to the broader population they weredesigned to serve. He also issued a directive (VHA Directive 99-030) statingthat no MH/SA program could be substantially altered without approvalfrom VACO\u2014a directive that was inconsistent with the emphasis on localdecision making and that was variably adhered to. Similarly, Congress, outof concern that extensive changes might sweep away the special programs ithad funded, passed legislation (P.L. 104-262 section 104) requiring VA tomaintain its capacity to provide specialized treatment within distinctprograms or facilities to disabled veterans with mental illness and severalother conditions. VA constructed a definition of capacity with the limitedavailable data that addressed both the number of patients seen and totalMH dollars spent on their care. This definition has proved controversial(Mulligan, 2002). Among his initial proposals in Vision for Change (Kizer, 1995), Kizer mandated the development of a National Mental Health Program Perfor-mance Monitoring System to be developed by the Northeast Program Evalu-ation Center, which has continued to monitor the programs begun duringErrera's tenure. The \"VA mental health report card\" (Rosenheck Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2004a) addresses all VA inpa-tient and outpatient service delivery and, in concept, also includes the re-ports on the special programs. Many of the performance measures devel-oped initially for these specialized programs have been incorporated intothe national performance measurement system as it has evolved under theleadership of the OQP in recent years. A third phase, characterized by a system-wide emphasis on building MH quality, is emerging in response to the recent report of the President'sNew Freedom Commission on Mental Health (President's New FreedomCommission on Mental Health, 2003). The deputy secretary for Health forHealth Policy Coordination was actively involved in work of the Commis-sion and a national action agenda for implementing the New Freedomcommission recommendations has been developed. This document will bethe foundation of a national strategic planning initiative for VA MH/SAcare that has involved SMI Committee members among others. Meyer and Rowan describe institutions, at one extreme, in which ac- tivities akin to quality management in health care become ritualized for-malities with little actual impact on productive behavior.

We began this discussion with the observationthat performance information may have little meaning when extracted fromits organizational context. We conclude by pushing this thought further insuggesting that such information may play its most important role whenused in service of a broad agenda for change. Health care organizations,with their extensive reliance on autonomous professional employees, havenever operated as simple top-down hierarchies. Leaders who make the mosteffective use of performance data are able to facilitate the development oflearning communities of peers who can enhance and support each other inpursuit of innovative professional and organizational objectives. Not onlydo the numbers not speak for themselves, they speak most forcefully whenput to the most ambitious of purposes. V. QUALITY OF VA MH/SA CARE Even reliable and valid performance measures form an inadequate basis for action in the absence of a standard for comparison. To answer thequestion, \"Is this care good enough?\" requires either an absolute criterionof acceptability, based on expert consensus, or a salient reference conditionfor comparison. Even when there is expert consensus on a standard ofpractice, 100% compliance is usually not justified, since in clinical practicethere are almost always clinical exceptions (Walter et al., 2004). Bench-marking to the actual performance of a relevant comparison program isoften the most credible approach. Four types of benchmark that have com-monly been used in the evaluation of VA MH/SA programs are: The system average or median , based on the premise that every program should be able to achieve the current average or some standardabove or below it (such as one standard deviation). A historical standard , on the assumption that even if we don't know what the right level of performance should be, deterioration in qual-ity is unjustifiable. The performance of some other system of care , on the premise that VA care should be equal to that of other systems. A majority subgroup , on the assumption that ethnocultural minori- ties should have equitable care in comparison to the majority subgroup. A major problem with each of these comparisons is that some of the measured differences in performance may be attributable to uncontrollabledifferences in either the nature of the populations being compared or toother constraints that are beyond the control of caregivers or health systemCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX C 447 managers. Numerous studies of VA MH/SA care have shown that risk adjustment can substantially alter the evaluation of performance of clinicalunits (Busch et al., 2004; Fontana et al., 2003; 2003;Weissman et al., 2002). While statistical methods for evening the playingfield and ensuring fair comparison will not be reviewed here, their impor-tance cannot be overemphasized, and perfect risk adjustment is unlikely tobe attainable (Walter et al., 2004). Whether \"good enough\" risk adjust-ment can be attained probably varies from case to case. The remaining sections present examples of VA MH/SA measures that address the six aims for health system improvement identified in Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001), that is, the safety, effectiveness, person- centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equitability of VA MH/SA care,using each of the four benchmarks. The Appendix presents a more compre-hensive set of program-specific measures used at the Northeast ProgramEvaluation Center to monitor and evaluate VA MH/SA care. Safety Suicide is perhaps the most serious safety risk in MH/SA care and is the eighth leading cause of death among men aged 45-64 nationally in theUnited States, with 22.4 deaths per 100,000 annually (U.S. Census Bureau,2001). Suicide is difficult to monitor because it is, fortunately, a rare eventand most health care systems do not treat enough patients to make stable oraccurate estimates of the suicide rate among their patients. As an integratednational system, VA is among the few large systems of care in the UnitedStates in which suicide rates can be meaningfully measured and comparedacross facilities (Desai et al., 2005). Using mortality records from theNational Death Index, all suicides that occurred within 12 month of dis-charge among 121,000 veterans discharged from VA MH inpatient unitsbetween 1994 and 1998 were identified. The suicide rate in this severely illsample was 445/100,000, (increasing over the years but not significantly),and 13.5% of VAMCs had rates significantly higher than the average acrossall facilities, after risk adjustment. Time trends were also examined to see ifpostdischarge suicide rates had increased in association with bed closuresor shortened lengths of stay. While there was a trend toward increasedsuicide in recent years, it was not statistically significant. Although it wasimpossible to externally benchmark the VA inpatient suicide rate becauseno comparable data are available from other institutions, it is notable thatAfrican Americans had significantly lower rates of suicide than whites. Aneffort was made to examine the relationship of quality indicators, especiallycontinuity of care, and suicide. While individual patients with poor conti-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Risk adjustment is especiallyimportant in comparisons of suicide rates across facilities because risk variessubstantially across both sociodemographic and diagnostic characteristicsand even with indicators of community social capital (i.e., civic participa-tion, trust, and cooperation) measured at the county level. Further analyses focusing on gun suicide, an especially important issue among veterans, found that veterans living in states with lower rates of gunownership, more restrictive gun laws, and higher social capital were lesslikely to commit suicide with a firearm (Desai et al., in press). Inter-facilitycomparisons would clearly need to adjust risk for these environmentalfactors since they are far beyond managerial control. In a major study of mortality rates among VA patients during the later 1990s, Ashton et al. (2003) found no increase in mortality for severalchronic conditions in VA including schizophrenia and major depressivedisorder in spite of dramatically reduced inpatient utilization. However, all-cause mortality is an imprecise measure of the quality of MH care. Another safety issue that has been systematically monitored in VA is the use of excessive doses of antipsychotic medication and antipsychoticpolypharmacy, both of which pose increased risk of side effects. An annualreport on antipsychotic pharmacotherapy in VA presents risk-adjusted com-parison data on each VA facility (Leslie and Rosenheck, 2003a), and com-parisons with data from the MarketScan \u00ae data base (a compilation of claims from private insurance plans) have shown prescription quality in VAto be similar to that among privately insured patients treated for schizo-phrenia (Leslie and Rosenheck, 2003b). Because of the VA's large data bases, its administrators have an un- usual capacity to rapidly evaluate safety risks associated with newer medi-cations. VA studies were among the first to demonstrate an increased riskof diabetes with atypical antipsychotics (Sernyak et al., 2002, 2003) andhave also been the first to quantify the attributable risk of incident diabetesdue to atypicals (about 0.54%) and the additional cost (about $11 pertreated patient per year) (Leslie and Rosenheck, 2005). Effectiveness Effective care is care that improves health status and health-related quality of life. The effectiveness of treatments is most rigorously determinedthrough formal research, especially randomized clinical trials, but alsothrough clinical experience in the case of treatments that have yet to bestudied and direct measurement of outcomes. Since randomized clinicaltrials and even observational outcome studies cannot be used to evaluatereal-world practice in an ongoing way (because of both prohibitive cost andCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX C 449 unavailability of control groups), the effectiveness of routine care is typi- cally assessed either by determining whether evidence-based practices are inuse and/or by directly measuring outcomes (see, for example, the definitionof effectiveness in IOM, 2001). Pharmacologic evidence-based practicesthat have been monitored across the VA system include use of atypicalantipsychotics (Rosenheck et al., 2001a) (see Appendix: section VI, p. 482);antidepressants in both depression (Busch et al., 2004) and alcoholism(Petrakis et al., 2003a); naltrexone in alcoholism (Petrakis et al., 2003b)and methadone in heroin addiction (Rosenheck et al., 2003c). Use ofatypicals in schizophrenia and antidepressants in alcoholism is quite exten-sive, but only 1% of veterans with alcoholism receive naltrexone (in spite ofseveral positive clinical trials, although a large VA trial found no benefit[Krystal et al., 2001]). Two further studies examined whether more expensive medications (atypical antipsychotics and methadone) were less accessible at fiscallystrained facilities and found that they were not (Leslie and Rosenheck,2001; Rosenheck et al., 2003c). However, in the case of atypical anti-psychotics, patients at more fiscally strained facilities were more likely to beprescribed less expensive atypicals. Psychosocial interventions that are usedin VA and whose fidelity to evidence based-practices is carefully monitoredinclude Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) (called Mental Health In-tensive Case Management in VA) (Neale et al., 2003); Supported Housing(Kasprow et al., 2004); Transitional Employment (Seibyl et al., 2003), andSupported Employment (Rosenheck et al., 2003b). Adherence is somewhatvariable but performance is poorest on resource- sensitive measures such asstaff:patient ratios. Many MH/SA interventions and programs have not been subject to rigorous evaluation, and operational criteria for implementing effectivepractices have yet to be developed. For example, while clinical practiceguidelines have been developed within VA for treatment of PTSD, they arebroadly worded and not subject to empirical fidelity assessment. Further,while there is broad agreement on the need for case management andresidential treatment for homeless people with mental illness (especially ifdirect placement in permanent housing is not available), operational guide-lines for the duration and intensity of such services have not been devel-oped. In addition, in managing costly programs like ACT, administratorsmay not be satisfied with information showing high levels of fidelity toevidence-based models. In these cases, direct outcome assessments may beneeded that demonstrate clinical improvement using psychometrically soundinstruments. There are three substantial challenges to implementing real-world out- comes monitoring. First of all, it is costly, especially if data are to becollected by independent evaluators. Second, since appropriate comparisonCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html450 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS groups are hard to identify, it is difficult to differentiate improvement that is attributable to effective intervention from improvement that reflects thenatural waxing and waning of chronic illness. Third, assessment biases maybe introduced if clinicians make ratings on their own patients or programs,and even when patients complete self-report questionnaires, since they mayknow that the data will be used to evaluate programs that they have cometo depend on. As a result of the high cost of high quality data, to paraphraseAbraham Lincoln, \"You can get some of the data on all of the people, andall of the data on some of the people, but you can't get all of the data on allof the people.\" In VA, outcome assessment of mental health programs is selectively directed at programs that treat high-cost, high-risk patients, for example,those that receive ACT services or intensive PTSD services. Symptom andfunctional improvements among the more than 3,000 veterans participat-ing in ACT in VA each year have generally improved over the years, andannual reports detail a broad array of outcome measures for each programfor each year (Neale et al., 2003) (see Appendix to this paper, section III, p.479). Measures address symptoms, quality of life, capability for self-care,employment, housing, substance use, inpatient utilization, and satisfactionwith services. A system-wide outcomes monitoring evaluation of VA SAtreatment similarly showed that veterans who received specialized treat-ment and more intensive treatment had better outcomes than those whoreceived treatment in general medical or MH clinics (Moos et al., 2000). PTSD outcome data have proved especially useful in addressing contro- versies about changes in the intensity of VA care. A study completed in themid-1990s showed that long-term, intensive inpatient PTSD treatment wasno more effective than short-term $18,000 more perpatient/year (Fontana and Rosenheck, 1997a). In part, as a result of thisstudy, but also because of wider changes in VA, many long-term inpatientprograms were transformed into less costly short-term inpatient or halfwayhouse programs. Stakeholders expressed concern about deterioration in thequality of VA PTSD treatment. To address these concerns, outcome moni-toring data from over 6,000 episodes of care between 1993 and 2000 werereanalyzed and showed that outcomes had not changed significantly forPTSD symptoms, SA, violent behavior, and employment (Rosenheck andFontana, 2001) and that the maintenance of effectiveness applied specificallyto blacks and Hispanics as well as to whites (Rosenheck and Fontana,2002). The monitoring of outcomes of residential treatment for homeless vet- erans poses a bigger challenge, since over 10,000 episodes of residentialtreatment are provided each year, through several different programs, atover 100 VA medical centers. Because of the magnitude and complexity ofthese services, a simpler system is used to document outcomes\u2014a standard-Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX C 451 ized discharge summary records objective outcomes such as housing (40% are independently housed) and employment status (about 35% in competi-tive employment) at the time of discharge, as well as linkage with aftercareservices, and more subjective (and thus less reliably measured) outcomessuch as clinical improvement. These data are risk-adjusted using baselineinformation obtained at intake, and site-specific reports are circulated quar-terly and summarized in an annual report to Congress. On the largest scale, VA instituted systematic documentation of GAF ratings for all MH/SA patients in 1999. While the reliability and validity ofthese ratings is uncertain, annual analyses of outcome data for over 250,000veterans have shown plausible discriminant validity and highly consistentresults across medical centers over a 3-year period. The largest improve-ment over the six month evaluation period is observed for dischargedinpatients (6.5 GAF points, s.d. = 14.4) followed by newly admitted out-patients (1.4 GAF points, s.d. = 8.7). Long-term outpatients show littleimprovement (0.4 GAF points, s.d. = 8.6) (Greenberg and Rosenheck,2004a). Three studies have collected virtually the same outcome data from patients treated in VA and in non-VA systems, allowing benchmarking ofVA effectiveness against that of other systems. Because the Center forMental Health Services' ACCESS demonstration, which served homelesspeople with severe mental illness, was conducted by VA's Northeast Pro-gram Evaluation Center, measures were similar to those used in studies ofVA homeless programs, thus facilitating comparison of 8-12 month out-comes. These outcomes (addressing psychiatric symptoms, SA, housing,employment, and receipt of benefits, among others) were similar in mostdomains (Kasprow et al., 2002). Two other studies, the Schizophrenia Careand Outcomes Program and the Connecticut Outcome Study, traced out-comes in symptoms, community adjustment, and medication side effectsamong severely mentally ill patients treated at the VA Connecticut Health-care system, and in local community mental health centers. VA and non-VAoutcomes and were not substantially different. Patient-Centered Care The dimensions of patient-centered care described in Crossing the Qual- ity Chasm (IOM, 2001) are well-represented on the inpatient satisfaction measure developed by the Picker Institute, which has been used in VHAsince 1995. Subscales address coordination, information, timeliness, cour-tesy, emotional support, responsiveness to preferences, family contact,physical comfort, and transition to home and are highly intercorrelated,with bivariate coefficients ranging from 0.49 to levels on 0-1 subscales scales,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.html452 HEALTH CARE FOR MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE-USE CONDITIONS where 0 indicates no satisfaction and 1 indicates complete satisfaction, range from 0.56 for family involvement to 0.75 for respect for personalpreferences, with few significant differences across VISNs or VAMCs(Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2004a). Subjective satisfaction and the respon-siveness of VA MH/SA care has been the subject of intensive scrutiny sinceDr. Kizer initiated systematic satisfaction screening in the VA (Druss Hoff et al.,1997b). A number of studies have demonstrated that levels of satisfactionbear little relationship to outcomes and seem to be more strongly influencedby the process and intensity of care than by its effectiveness (Fontana andRosenheck, 2001; Fontana et al., 2003). Risk adjustment is especiallyimportant and virtually reversed the results of one study of six-year timetrends in satisfaction with VA inpatient MH care (Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2004b). Recovery orientation has received increasing emphasis in MH care in recent years and can be characterized by general satisfaction with life,hopefulness, knowledge about MH care, and empowerment. A comparisonof VA and non-VA patients using PORT data found no differences on thesemeasures except that VA patients felt they knew less about MH care(Resnick et al., 2004a). Peer education groups for mental illness, anotheremphasis of the recovery movement in MH, have also begun to take hold inthe VA setting (Resnick et al., 2004b). Alcoholics Anonymous meetingshave been held on VA campuses for many decades. Timeliness Although detailed data on waiting times for VA MH/SA care are not available, extensive information is available on contact with outpatientMH/SA services within 30 days of discharge from an inpatient stay. Thismeasure, originally developed for Health Employer Data Information Set(HEDIS) (HEDIS, 1999) was implemented as a national performance mea-sure by the OQP in 1998. Between 1998 and 2003, the percentage ofveterans meeting this standard increased from 72 to 77%, well above 61%among Medicare patients and even exceeding the HEDIS performance of74% from managed care companies. A specific comparison of VA andprivate sector MarketScan \u00ae data showed that VA patients were 10% less likely to receive care within 30 days of discharge but only 2% less likely tohave received care by 180 days. A measure of overall continuity of carefavored VA, and readmission rates were similar (Leslie and Rosenheck,2000). The Mental Health Report Card (Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2004a) presents risk-adjusted data on these measures for each VAMC and VISNeach year and also addresses access to general medical care in the 30 daysCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

While the HEDIS measure has been widelyused in VA, and has substantial face-value, efforts to demonstrate its rela-tionship to improved outcomes on clinical measures have shown weak andmixed results (Greenberg et al., 2002, 2003; Rosenheck et al., 1999a). Efficiency Dramatic reductions in reliance on inpatient care have yielded substan- tial efficiencies in VA MH/SA care. Even without adjustment for inflation,per capita costs for all inpatient and outpatient mental health care declinedby 28%, from $3,560 in FY 1995 to $2,562 eight years later, in FY 2003.With inflation adjustment, the reduction in per capita cost would approach70%. A study of the cost of treating dually diagnosed patients from 1993 to1997 showed VA costs to be about 10% greater than those of a privatesector MarketScan \u00ae sample, while costs for patients not dually diagnosed were about 35% greater, although diagnostic severity was far greater in theVA sample (Leslie and Rosenheck, 1999). Efficiency can be a double-edged sword, whose darker side is repre- sented by reduced treatment resources. While 16% of VA medical centerdollars were expended on mental health care in FY 1995, only 11.2% ofdollars went to mental health care in FY 2003. Although, in the abstract,increased efficiency cannot be distinguished from reduced service delivery,evidence presented above is generally reassuring since outcomes, wheremeasured, have not deteriorated; there has been no increase in suicide or inVA patients seeking services in other health care systems or becomingincarcerated, and some evidence-based services like the use of atypicalantipsychotics and ACT have been expanded in VA. A detailed review ofhow data were used to guide the transformation of PTSD treatment in VAdemonstrates a reasoned approach to system change (Rosenheck andFontana, 1999). However, the steady decline in the number of veteranswho receive specialized SA services from VA, accompanied as it has been byreduced expenditures on SA treatment (Chen et al., 2001), in the presenceof epidemiologic data showing no reduction in need (Tessler et al., 2005),has generated expressions of concern among stakeholders (Mulligan, 2003). Equity Minorities While there has been widespread documentation of inequities in access and quality of health care to minorities in the US, an extensive series ofstudies has found little evidence of such inequities in VA, perhaps because,by statute, VA provides cost-free care to all veterans who enroll for 2003; Leda and Rosenheck, Academy of Sciences.

However, a 1995 study of over 5,000 veterans treated for PTSDfound that on some measures, when African American patients were treatedby African American clinicians, they were less likely to drop out of treatmentprematurely than when treated by white clinicians (Rosenheck et al., 1995). Female Veterans While there has been growing concern that the increasing number of female veterans are reluctant to use VA services, there is evidence that theyuse VA service at rates equal to or greater than males (Hoff and Rosenheck,1997, 1998a,b) (in part because of the generally greater inclination ofwomen to use health services). Female veterans express greater or equallevels of satisfaction with VA services (Hoff et al., 1998). In recognition of the problems of military sexual trauma (and the possible discomfort of women in the virtually all-male VA setting), VAestablished four Womens Stress Disorder Treatment Teams, which havedocumented high levels of trauma among women served by these teams(Fontana and Rosenheck, 1997b, 1998). Outcome evaluation found rela-tively high levels of comfort with the VA setting among traumatized womenand no relationship between levels of comfort in VA and outcomes (Fontanaand Rosenheck, 2002). Screening for military sexual trauma has recentlybeen introduced as a system-wide performance indicator by OQP. VI. FRONT-LINE EXPERIENCE Although there has been no systematic survey of the experiences of front line VA managers and clinicians with the implementation of perfor-mance management for MH/SA programs, this account would be incom-plete if it did not include at least a few examples of their sometimes ambiva-lent reactions. On the one hand, clinicians and their supervisors often report feeling empowered by access to information on both their clinical interventionsand on client outcomes. In the past only top medical center managementhad access to performance data\u2014and the available data were limited inboth detail and in quality. In the absence of good data, as Errera observed(Tomich, 1992), decisions tended to reflect the structure of traditionalpower hierarchies\u2014hierarchies in which MH/SA programs fall toward thebottom. With the increased availability of higher quality information, MH/SA supervisors and clinicians have direct access to information themselvesand can more effectively shape and advocate for their programs on the basisof available factual information.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11470.htmlAPPENDIX C 455 On the other hand, clinicians sometimes complain that gathering data takes time away from patient care and that many measures: (1) are toocrude to reflect the complexity of their work, (2) are applied indiscrim-inantly to highly variable populations (i.e., without risk adjustment fordifferences in patient characteristics or differences in service environments);and (3) address outcomes over which clinicians feel they have little control,such as treatment dropouts, housing people who are homeless, or evenreducing symptoms. Satisfaction surveys, some have complained, in VA aselsewhere, often have quite low response rates and are typically presentedwithout risk adjustment. A recent study of VA performance measurementin JAMA (Walter et al., 2004) presents a set of very sophisticated examples of such problems, elegantly documented by the staff at one VA hospital.While appreciative of the value of performance monitoring, in principle,these investigators identify a number of problems with current practice,largely reflecting application of standards to patients for whom they areclinically inappropriate, (e.g., cancer screening among those who alreadyhave terminal illnesses), and it is not hard to imagine that this sophisticatedscientific paper had its birth in the discontent of professionals who feel theirwork has been unfairly judged. Managers and clinical staff also have observed that many performance measures can be manipulated, and some complain that sites that producebetter performance scores have merely been more energetic or inventive inchanging various program codes so that patients who do worst are notincluded in the measure. It is difficult to evaluate these complaints. Paradoxically, but not surprisingly, it also appears that: (1) the more performance data are used to evaluate high-level managers (and to deter-mine their annual bonuses), (2) the more aggressively middle managers arepressured to get their staffs to improve the scores (often regardless of theavailability of new treatments or resources to accomplish these goals),(3) the more likely staff are to feel exploited by their superiors' quest forbonuses and to look for ways to \"game\" the system, that is, to improvetheir numbers without actually changing the care that is given. In manysituations, it appears, the limitations of the data are appreciated, and clini-cians and managers use them, as intended, to identify ways of improvingthe care they provide, as best they can. In others, however, it seems theremay be more browbeating than joint problem solving. Reports of falsified or fabricated research data are not unheard of, even in well-funded studies conducted by experienced researchers who have asophisticated understanding of the importance of adhering to establisheddata collection protocols. It would be na\u00efve to imagine that such activitiesdo not occur among clinical staff who are under pressure to produce thedesired results by supervisors who are in a position to influence their futureCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Use of objective measures, not subject to manipulation, is the best response to this problem. It must also be noted that even where data or evidence-based practices are well-measured and credible, they do not necessarily determine whichway decisions will go. As Paul Errera observed, resource decisions tend totrump performance data. The intensive PTSD program with the best out-comes in the nation was among the first to be closed because it was judgedto be inefficient; and monitoring of intensive case management programslike ACT or supported housing shows that the staff/patient ratio (the mostresource sensitive measure) is typically the evidence-based performance cri-terion with the lowest rate of adherence. There is no way of knowing how widespread these problems are, or to what extent they affect the integrity of performance management in VAMH/SA programs or elsewhere. It seems important to remind ourselves,however, that performance management is ultimately a human process, andthat it is affected by the skills, incentives, and integrity of the those whosebehavior it seeks to shape. CONCLUSION Health care even for a single family or a small clinic can be character- ized by both daunting complexity and uncertainty. In a health care systemas large as VA, complexity and uncertainty are increased by many orders ofmagnitude. Every American deserves the best health care possible each timehe or she seeks help, and high-quality health care can only be achieved bycreative management of the inherent complexity and uncertainty of bothillness and health service delivery. Such management demands comprehen-sive quality monitoring, used by creative and committed leaders, in compe-tent organizations. It is intrinsic to the challenge posed that this work willnever be finished, and we probably cannot even know how far along theway we are toward the ideal of improving health outcomes with data. Whatcan be said is that we have made a beginning and we must continue movingforward. REFERENCES Ashton CM, Souchek J, Petersen NJ, Menke TJ, Collins TC, Kizer KW, Wright SM, Wray NP. 2003.
