There have been over 14 exotic disease outbreaks in the last 10 years including foot and mouth di sease, avian influenza and bluetongue. The costs of disease outbreaks range from \u00a32 million to over \u00a33 billion with knock-on effects in other economic sectors. 1.2 Contingency planning is part of the spec trum of work to ens ure that the long term good health of livestock and the livestock industry is maintained. 1.3 This plan is for stakeholders to understand Defra's response to a notifiable exotic disease outbreak and for operational partners to understand where their work fits in to the bigger picture. It is arranged in chronologic al order from preparedness to recovery. Detailed operati onal instructions are maintained by each work area and are not included here. 1.4 Disease prevention work on legal and ill egal imports; surveillance in the UK and elsewhere in the world; farm health pl anning; biosecurity; livestock movement controls and keeper vigilance do much to decrease the risk of exotic diseases occurring and spreading in England. Ther e will inevitably be future disease challenges. These will best be met by working in partnership across government and with animal keepers and non-governmental organisations. 1.5 When disease does strike, Defra will act swiftly and decisively to: Eradicate the disease and regain disease free status; Protect public health and safety; Safeguard the health and safety of thos e involved directly in controlling the outbreak; and Minimise the burden on the taxpayer and public as well as the economic impact of the outbreak on industry. 1.6 Defra will endeavour to: Keep to a minimum the number of animals that have to be humanely destroyed either for disease control purposes or to safeguard animal welfare; and Minimise adverse impacts on animal welfare, the rura l and wider economy, the public, rural communiti es and the environment. 1.7 Defra's capacity and capability for dealin g with a disease outbreak is regularly tested in local and national exercises. A UK-wide exercise \"Silver Birch\" in November 2010 tested the response to a foot and mouth disease outbreak. The lessons from this and other exercise are in corporated into this plan. The full report \"Exercise Silver Birch 2010 - National Foot and Mouth Disease Ex ercise, Evaluation and Lessons Identified\" can be viewed and downloaded fr om the Animal Health website: www.defra.gov.uk/animalhealth 11.8 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland al so maintain contingency plans; taken together the four plans and published diseas e control strategies meet the UK's obligations to the European Commision and Offi ce International de s Epizooties (OIE) (The World Organisation for Animal Health). 1.9 Additionally a GB& No rthern Ireland plan [insert lin k] has been drawn together from the country plans to demonstrate the unified respon se to exotic notifiable diseases of animals within the UK. 22 Preparedness 2.1 This section highlights the activities and processes that ensure there is a high level of preparedness for an outbreak of ex otic notifiable disease of animals. 2.2 Defra's Exotic Disease Policy Response Team (EDPRT) leads the exotic disease policy response and is responsible for developing and interpreting disease control policy. 2.3 Animal Health and Veterinary Laborat ory Agency (AHVLA) takes the lead in the operational aspects of preparing for, containing and controlling an outbreak of exotic diseases of animals within GB. AHVLA has a s pecialist Contingency Planning Division (CPD) that co-ordinates this area of work. 2.4 Defra and AHVLA work closely with Welsh Assembly Government (WAG), Scottish Government (SG) and a variet y of other agencies, organisations and operational partners such as Local Author ities, Local Resilience Forums (LRFs), Department for Communities and Local Govern ment (DCLG) Sub-national Resilience Teams, the Health Protection Agency (H PA), the Police, the Environment Agency (EA) and the reference laborator y the Institute of Animal He alth (IAH) to ensure that any response is well planned, integrat ed and coordinated, and involves the appropriate specialists. Preparedness Roles and Responsibilities Exotic Disease Policy Response Team 2.5 EDPRT is responsible for developing and implementing control strategies for the main exotic diseases in preparati on for an outbreak. This has involved developing a more risk based approac h to policy development and ensuring consistent use of evidence and expertise, as well as using cost / benefit analysis to inform policy decisions. It ensures there is an appropriate legislative framework in place to allow a swift and effective respons e to disease outbreaks. It develops and maintains key stakeholder relationships and promotes the sharing of responsibility through core groups of stakeholders. This is in addition to working closely with delivery agents and devolved administrations. 2.6 The team has in place trained res ources to respond to a disease emergency and undergoes regular testing of its response. AHVLA Regional Operations Directors (RODs) 2.7 Each of AHVLA's offices is responsible for ensuring that AHVLA is prepared to respond to an outbreak or incident of exot ic diseases of animals. The Regional Operations Director (ROD) is the individual responsible for ensurin g that plans are in place and that their staff are suitably trained. 32.8 The ROD has responsibility for lo cal preparedness to deal with disease outbreaks which might be small and localised or part of a much larger (National or International) disease emergency. They are also responsible for building and maintaining effective local relationships with the local livestock/food chain sector as well as other parts of the public sector delivery chain (e.g. LRFs, Police, LAs, the HPA, Natural England and EA). 2.9 Between outbreaks RODs have an important role informing policy development - through feeding back into the centre, intelligence on local issues/practices which could impact on disease preparedness, risks and handling. AHVLA Regional Resilience Managers (RRMs) 2.10 Each AHVLA region in England has an AHVLA Regional Resilience Manager (RRM). The RRM is responsible for supporting the preparation of local contingency and emergency plans, so that AHVLA mainta ins a continuous state of emergency readiness and resilience. 2.11 The response plans are closely al igned with the well established civil emergency response structur es and AHVLA works closely with Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) and DCLG Sub-national Res ilience Teams to ensure that disease control policies and strategies are fully understood and that the necessary multi-agency plans are in place. 2.12 The primary role of the RRM is to support the ROD in ensuring that their region is always at the requi red state of readiness and has the resilience to deal with emergencies caused by animal diseases and also to deal with situations where animal health or welfare may be compromis ed as a consequence of other types of emergencies. Their primary responsibilities are as follows: To ensure that the region has in place a contingency plan that complements the Defra Contingen cy Plan and AHVLA instructions and arrangements to ensure readiness. This state of readiness is regularly assessed using the Emergency R eadiness Management Assurance Scheme (ERMAS) tool; To ensure that the region has in pl ace business continuity plans to deal with incidents that may interrupt the delivery of services; To build effective networks wit h neighbouring regi ons, with AHVLA Contingency Planning Division (CPD) and with other RRMs to share best practice and to ensure that the regi on's contingency plans and processes are consistent with nati onal policies and procedures; In liaison with CPD to assess current coverage and capability of locally based contingency contracts and where necessary to propose additional contractors and thereafter to keep these under continuous review; To work with the ROD and other staf f in the region to plan, organise and deliver local exercises as set out in the AHVLA Programme of local exercises; and To support the ROD planning, establishing and managing the Local Disease Control Centre (LDCC). 4 Local Emergency Planning 2.13 AHVLA is fully engaged in all aspe cts of emergency planning and incident response related to outbreaks of exotic dise ases of animals. The key objectives of this work is to ensure that there is a complete understanding of roles and responsibilities, and that the disease cont rol structures and pr ocesses are aligned with the well-established em ergency response structures that may be required to manage the wider consequences of an animal disease outbreak. 2.14 The principal mechanism for mu lti-agency co-operation under the Civil Contingencies Act is through Local Resili ence Forums (LRFs). Although AHVLA is not a responder under the provisions of the Civil Contingencies Act, in practice LRF membership often expands to include re levant responders, and AHVLA is keen to further improve the strong lin ks that it has developed. 2.15 The Local Resilience Forum (LRF) is a statutory process for bringing together all the Category 1 and 2 responders (res ponders with specific duties defined under the Civil Contingencies Act) within a local po lice area for the purpose of facilitating co-operation in fulfilment of their duties under the Civil C ontingencies Act. They do not have a separate legal personality, powers to direct their members, or an incident management role, although the LRF chair oft en becomes the chair of the Strategic Co-ordinating Group (SCG) if one is formed. LRFs and SCGs have an important role in managing the wider consequences of animal diseases. 2.16 The purpose of the LRF is to ensure effective delivery of those duties under the Act that need to be developed in a mult i-agency environment. In particular, the LRF process should deliver: The compilation of agreed risk profile s for the area, through a Community Risk Register; A systematic, planned and co-ordi nated approach to encourage Category 1 responders, according to their functi ons, to address all aspects of policy in relation to: o Risk; o Planning for emergencies; and o Planning for business continuity management. Publishing information about risk assessments and plans; Arrangements to warn and inform the public; Other aspects of the civil protecti on duty, (including the promotion of business continuity management by local authorities; and Support for the preparation, by some or all, of its memb ers of multi-agency plans and other documents, including protocols and agreements and the co-ordination of multi-agency exer cises and other training events. 2.17 The National Risk Register, which is available online at (www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/national-risk-register ), provides further details of the zoonotic (animal diseases that can be transmitted between, or are shared by, animals and hum ans) and non-zoontics (those t hat are not transferable between animals and humans) animal disease out break risks for which LRFs need to 5review and assess the local impacts. The risks assessed as being significant will need to be included within the local community risk registers. In many areas, AHVLA is fully engaged in this process and c an help with information on the density of livestock and with assessing the impacts on local communities. Operational Instructions 2.18 AHVLA and Defra have well developed O perational Instructions that are used by staff involved in the response to an outbreak of exotic disease of animals. They provide guidance on the many tasks involved in the outbreak response, ensuring that there is a consistent approach taken. The Operational Inst ructions reflect the policies and response strategies set out in this Plan. 2.19 Operational Instructi ons are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary and reflect current best practice in rela tion to disease outbreak response. Contingency Contracts 2.20 In the event of an outbreak of exotic notifiable disease of animals it is important that services needed for the re sponse can be accessed rapidly. Defra Procurement and Commercial Function (PCF) and AHVLA have arranged national and local contingency agreem ents and supply contingency arrangements to meet anticipated needs in an outbreak of exotic notifiable disease. The suppliers are vetted and subjected to regular review by PCF and AHVLA to ensure their ongoing suitability for use in an outbreak. 2.21 The current agreements and arrangement s cover all the relevant supply chains and include on-farm culling (including catchers and licensed slaughtermen); carcase transportation; carcase dispos al (rendering and incineration); and the provision of specialist services and equipment for undertaking cleansing and disinfection. 2.22 The Defra Procurement Emergen cy Response Team (PERT) will be responsible for negotiating robust contract s with any other suppliers should the extent of the outbreak r equire additional supply. 2.23 RODs and RRMs liaise with AHVLA's Procurement & Contract Management Unit and PCF to ensure timely, scaleable and appropriate supply arrangements in the event of an outbreak of an animal disease covered by this plan. Equipment and stores Provisions of stores and e quipment at National level 2.24 AHVLA Weybridge has stor es of equipment to enable the Agency to carry out its routine duties within defi ned time limits. The normal stocking levels at AHVLA 6 Local minimum stocking levels 2.25 Each office is required to hold or have immediate access to sufficient equipment to deal with up to 10 disease ca ses in the first 48 hours, including provision for equipping up to 20 additional veterinary personnel. Stock levels are managed by designated local staff, who have day to day responsibility for monitoring availability and serviceability of stores. A stock control system is being developed to provide visibility of stock held by AHVLA allowing for mutual support across offices. Laboratory Capacity 2.26 The Disease Emergency Response Committee (DERC) has a specific remit to ensure that sufficient laboratory facilities fo r the diagnosis and surv eillance for exotic notifiable animal diseases are availabl e during outbreaks and other surges in demand. The committee is constituted from representatives from AHVLA, IAH and Defra's Food and Farming Group. 2.27 AHVLA Weybridge provides the diagnostic and surveillance testing service for a number of notifiable diseases and is the National Reference Laboratory for Newcastle Disease, Avian Influenza, R abies, Classical Swine Fever, Equine Infectious Anaemia, Equine Encephalomyeli tis, West Nile Virus, Dourine Glanders. 2.28 IAH Pirbright is the National Refe rence Laboratory for FMD, African Swine Fever, Swine Vesicular e, Peste des petits ruminants, Rinderpest, several ruminant poxviruses and African Horse Sickness. 2.29 Test surge capacity, in the event of a disease outbr eak, is provided by AHVLA Weybridge. Serological testing capacity is provided on a contingency basis of up to 120,000 samples per week. The laborator y would be ready to start contingency surge capacity testing within three weeks of notification with an initial capacity of 7,000 tests per week, 20,000 tests in the second week, 40,000 in the third week and building to full capacity of 120,000 tests per week at week 10. Staff Resourcing for Outbreaks Veterinary Resources 2.30 Veterinary staff from AHVLA, Defra and other government departments will provide the initial emergency response capability. Non-Government Veterinary Personnel - Contingency Official Veterinarians 2.31 Contingency Official Veterinarians (COVs) have an important role between outbreaks as well as during an actual inci dent or outbreak. In the event of an 7outbreak of exotic diseases of animals COVs would be called upon immediately to undertake roles that would otherwise be un dertaken by permanent AHVLA Veterinary staff. The roles could include: Providing veterinary expertise to team s within the LDCC, e.g. to prioritise tracings or job allocations; Providing veterinary expertise that can take account of the local situation, e.g. husbandry, geography, mark eting, movements etc; Advising on the disease situation to incoming staff; Approval of licence applications for permitted movements; and Acting as a point of contact and mentor for casual or temporary veterinary staff undertaking work in the field, e.g. veterinary inquiries, supervision of culling, assessment of dangerous contacts, etc. 2.32 It is not the intention that they will undertake routine field work. Other veterinary surgeons will provide this resource. 2.33 In addition to providing advice to the local community on disease prevention, suspicion etc, these staff can act as t he Department's ears, eyes and mouthpiece, listening to local concerns, and providing intelligence and other feedback to the ROD and explaining the Department's policies and views. Non-Government Veterinary Personnel - Temporary Staff 2.34 Non-Government veterinarians may be engaged on temporary contracts. This may include retired Government vete rinarians and veterinary practitioners. Non-Government Veterinary Personnel - Overseas Government Veterinary and Technical Personnel 2.35 The International Animal Health Emergency Reserve (IAHER) agreement was signed in 2004 with Ireland, USA, Canada, Au stralia and New Zealand to provide veterinary and technical staff in the event of an outbreak of dis ease. Assistance may also be sought from other EU Member States and is arranged by means of contact between Chief Veterinary Officers (CVOs). General Field, Technical and Administrative Staff 2.36 Staff from AHVLA, Defra and other government departments will provide the initial emergency response capability. If necessary, during an outbreak of exotic diseases of animals, the Chief Executiv e of AHVLA will seek Defra Emergency Management Board authority to require the re lease of further st aff from Defra and Defra Agencies to work on emergen cy duties. As appropriate, the Emergency Management Board will provide clear directi on to Divisions, Agencies and work groups, in order that non-essential staff c an volunteer their services and be released quickly. Defra has an Emergen cy Volunteers Register which is one of the principal ways of identifying the people who could prov ide assistance to an emergency. Those who have left the Department but have said they would wish to assist in the event of an emergency may also be contacted. 82.37 AHVLA have additionally established a Rapid Support Team (RST) who would provide immediate, short-term assistance at LDCCs and Forward Operations Bases (FOBs) at the start of a disease outbreak if required. Member s of this team have appropriate skills and experienc e of disease outbreaks. 2.38 AHVLA Human Resources (HR), in conjunction with Defra Strategic HR and Shared Services Directorate, will lead on coordinating staff deployments in response to needs. 2.39 The Department will also make use of the central Memorandum of Understanding on Mutual Aid and the Redeployment of Human Resources, which will be triggered if necessary. This relates to the loan of staff fr om other government departments. Training AHVLA Field Veterinary staff 2.40 All new field veterinary entrants attend a 4-day cour se on notifiable diseases, which includes exotic viral diseases, at t he Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright and AHVLA Weybridge. This is in addition to the general and specific training related to other work areas including training in notif iable disease procedures which is provided locally. Veterinary staff also have access to disease profiles on the D2R2 database and to AVIS (Advanced Veterinary Informati on System) giving disease specific information on 11 high impact exotic diseas es. Selected individuals attend specific relevant Continuing Profe ssional Development training, e.g. in Epidemiology. Courses are held, as required, to ensur e an adequate resource of trained staff. AHVLA Technical staff 2.41 All new technical staff receive backg round in animal disease awareness which covers the specific roles they may perfo rm in a disease outbreak. There has been a major programme of practical and classr oom based training for technical staff identified to take on the role of Case Office r, including training for those involved in Poultry Culling. AHVLA staff involved in finance or procurement 2.42 Finance staff are trained to use all appropriate systems to support the financial management of the outbreak from the initial financial decisions, including setup of the LDCC, and all the subsequent financial information. 2.43 They are also trained to set up th e appropriate files to capture financial information that will support any claim to both the European Union (EU) and HM Treasury and also provide timely, financial management information to senior management. 92.44 Defra's Procurement a nd Contraction Function (PCF) provide regular training sessions for procurement staff who may be required to be part of a Procurement Emergency Response Team (PERT) or LDCC. AHVLA Administrative staff 2.45 Staff are involved in a local stru ctured programme of training designed to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide administrative support during an outbreak situation and to support the requirements for Finance and Management Information. Additiona lly, there is local and national level exercising of the contingency plan. AHVLA Key Administrative, Field & Technical Staff 2.46 The National Disease Control Centre (NDCC) and LDCCs will require staff who are able to take up key positions on confirmation of disease. Key posts have been identified in the NDCC & LDCCs, together with responsibilities and working instructions. 2.47 Staff based in an office in which an LDCC is being established, and in AHVLA more widely, will be the first to be call ed upon if disease is confirmed. Key administrative, field and technical personnel ta ke part in contingency exercises. This is part of their job description and work objectives Contingency Official Veterinarians 2.48 On appointment there is a specific training programme for COVs, this includes: A similar induction to that of new Veterinary Officers (VOs); Awareness and use of the AHVLA Operations Manual; Establishment of LDCC/Forward Operations Base (FOB) and roles the COV would fill; and Involvement in local exercises. 2.49 Emergency Preparedness: As the COVs become familiar with their roles the amount of such preparatory tr aining that is required will decrease. Involvement in exercises is still required but it is likely that there will be a number of days for which the COVs are available for other activi ties (assuming a commitment of 3 days per year). 2.50 The COVs can be used on these \"spar e\" days on tasks that lead to an improvement in the wider context of local emergency preparedness. 10Exercises and Assurance Local Exercises 2.51 AHVLA undertakes an annual progra mme of coordinated animal disease exercises for local offices in order to refine and demonstrate the Agency's emergency preparedness to deal effectively with outbreaks of exotic diseases of animals. Each office takes part in at least one full-scale exercise in a two-year cycle which will usually involve the participation of Operational Partner s and stakeholders. 2.52 Each exercise is assessed and an exercise evaluation repor t produced. These reports are used by Conti ngency Planning Division (CPD) to highlight and promote best practice and lessons learned and are used to review and update contingency plans as appropriate. National Exercises 2.53 The EU FMD Directive 9474/03 requires Member States to exercise their FMD contingency plans twice within a five-year period although there is derogation allowing one of these real-t ime exercises to be for another \"major epidemic disease affecting terrestrial animals \" (Annex XV11 par. 11.2.3). 2.54 Exercise Silver Birch held in 2010 wa s the United Kingdom's national Foot and Mouth Disease exercise involving Defra, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government, Department for Ag riculture and Rural Development Northern Ireland, AHVLA and their associated Oper ational Partners and Stakeholders. 2.55 The exercise included a field oper ational element, table top exercises, simulated strategic meetings and exerci se briefings, and concluded with a two day live exercise involving participants from across the United Kingdom. 2.56 Exercise Silver Birch enabled the UK Government to effectively test its contingency plans in the event of an out break of Foot and Mouth Disease and valuable lessons have been identified. 2.57 The full report \"Exercise Silver Birch 2010 - National Foot and Mouth Disease Exercise, Evaluation and Lessons Identified\" can be viewed and downloaded from the AHVLA website: www.defra.gov.uk/animalhealth Emergency Readiness Management Assurance Scheme (ERMAS) 2.58 ERMAS is a framework tool used to enable AHVLA to monitor and confirm the extent to which the Agency's Regiona l, Divisional and Corporate teams can effectively mount an initial response to disease outbreaks. There are two components: ERMAS1 - measures the readiness of AHVLA's regional and divisional offices to operate in response to an animal disease emergency, to effect 11the transition to the status of a f unctional LDCC and to sustain operations at a reinforced level thereafter; and ERMAS2 - measures the readiness of AHVLA's Headquarter Business Units (involved in an outbreak) to suppor t the actions of the local offices during the initial stages of an outbreak. 2.59 ERMAS reviews occur annually, this nec essitates an annual review of the framework tool to account for key changes to business processes or delivery models. 123 Organisational Structures for Control & Co- ordination 3.1 Upon confirmation of an exotic notifi able disease of animals, or where pending confirmation of disease, the suspicion of disease is strong and a decision has been taken to undertake disease control activiti es, this plan together with the GB and NI Framework Response Plan is invoked. Clear command and control structures are put in place to direct, coordinate and s upport the disease control response. 3.2 Three levels of command may be establis hed operating at a st rategic, tactical or operational level. Deta ils of roles and responsibil ities are provided below. 3.3 As it is important that there should be flexibility and proportionality in the delivery of the response, during smaller outbreaks or incidents, it may not be necessary to establish all the structures r equired for a major event. Although most of the activities and functions delivered through the response structures will still need to be delivered, there may be variati ons on how they are delivered. 3.4 Unlike most other major incidents and emergency responses Defra is not only the Lead Government Department but together with it s executive agencies is directly responsible for both the lo cal and national disease cont rol response. Defra and AHVLA will however ensure a multi-agency response, that operational partners are represented at all levels of the command and control struct ures and that these are aligned with emergency response structur es established to manage any wider consequences of the disease outbreak. Strategic Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) 3.5 The United Kingdom maintains the c apability to respond to the range of hazards and threats facing the country thro ugh the activation of central response arrangements within the Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR). The COBR mechanism facilitates cross-government dec ision-making and ensures Ministers and senior officials are provided with time ly, coordinated and quality advice to enable quick and efficient decision making during times of national crisis. 3.6 COBR arrangements bring toget her Defra (the Lead Government Department), other Governm ent departments, international partners and other response organisations where appropriate to maintain a common understanding of the latest situation and provide advice on strategic issues to Ministers. It consists of a Ministerial decision group (Nat ional Security Council (Threats, Hazards, Resilience and Contingencies) (NSC(THRC)) and a number of supporting elements which ensure they have access to coordinated, timely, well-balanced advice. COBR is designed to be a flexible mechanism that can be adapted to t he circumstances. The support cells will always include a situati on cell that will coordinate the production and maintenance of a Commonly Recognised Information Picture (CRIP). Other possible support cells include: policy and new s coordination cells and a Scientific 13Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE). SAGE will coordinate scientific and technical advice to inform cross-Government decision making. 3.7 The decision to activate COBR in re sponse to an exotic disease outbreak in animals would be taken by the Cabinet Office , Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS), in conjunction with Defra and No. 10. Once activated, CCS is responsible for running the COBR mechanism to co-ordinate t he cross Government response to the outbreak in support of the lead government department. The decision to activate SAGE would be taken by Defra, Chief Scientific Advisers (CSAs) and CVOs in consultation with CCS and the Government's CSA. Secretary of State (SoS) for En vironment, Food and Rural Affairs 3.8 The SoS's involvement will be dependent on the size and scale of the outbreak. Their involvement is likely to be greater in a national scale outbreak with regional spread of disease, or an instance of zoonotic disease with implications for human health. The SoS may be required to decide if emergency vaccination is to be implemented for disease control purposes . The decision must be justified to Parliament and will be based upo n epidemiological and scientif ic advice provided by Chief Veterinary Officer UK and SAGE (if acti ve). The SoS may be required to brief Parliament, the Cabinet and No. 10 about cu rrent risks and disease control measures and brief the media when appropriate, al though the CVO UK will normally be the main spokesperson for the media. Minister of State for Food, Farming and the Environment 3.9 During an outbreak of exot ic disease in animals, lead Ministerial responsibility will rest with the Minister of State for Food, Farming and the Environment. If considered necessary, the Minister may attend meetings of the Defra Emergency Management Board (EMB) and the NDCC birdtabl e. The Minister will respond to Parliamentary Questions concerning the di sease outbreak and chai r meetings of the NSC(THRC) if sitting. The Minister may also brief the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) select committee and the m edia when appropriate although the CVO UK will normally be the main spokesperson for the media. Defra Permanent Secretary 3.10 The Permanent Secretary is responsible for all strategic decisions taken within Defra and accountable, through the Chief Ex ecutive AHVLA and Defra Director of Finance, for ensuring the financial integrity of the control and recovery operations by establishing proper procurement, finance and audit procedures, in liaison with HM Treasury and the National Audit Office (NAO). 3.11 Upon confirmation of disease, the Pe rmanent Secretary or their deputies, will notify Defra Ministers and t he Secretary of State that disease has been confirmed, convene the Defra Emergency Management Board (EMB) as appropriate and, should EMB recommend it, notify the Gove rnment Security and Intelligence Co- ordinator at the Civil Conti ngencies Secretariat (CCS) th at the NSC(THRC) should be convened. The Permanent Secretary will also activate the National Disease Control Centre if the CVO UK and the Chief Executive of AHVLA are unavailable to do so. 14 3.12 During the outbreak, the Permanent Secretary will contact CCS if additional staffing is required, in order to trigger the protocols set out in the Central Memorandum of Understanding on Mutual Aid and the Redeployment of Human Resources, work with the Secretary of St ate to ensure that No .10 is appropriately engaged and informed and horizon scan fo r wider government issues. 3.13 The Permanent Secretary will also ensur e that Deputy Directors with key roles to play are clear about their roles and res ponsibilities and appoint suitable deputies as necessary. Chief Veterinary Officer UK (CVO UK) 3.14 The CVO UK is responsible for the confirmation of disease in England, the National Disease Control Centre and the interface between the policy and operational functions, ownership of animal disease control policy and any associated risks, the provision of animal disease cont rol policy advice to Ministers and other senior government officials, briefing t he media on current animal disease control policy and acting as Defra's main spokesper son in this respect, strategic planning and setting of objectives and responding to any questions about test results and the timing of their delivery. Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer (DCVO) 3.15 The DCVO will deputise for the CVO UK where necessary and is responsible for liaison with the European Union Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH), other Member States and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The DCVO will notify thes e upon confirmation as well as the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), the British Veterinary Association (BVA) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). 3.16 Throughout the disease control operati on the DCVO will ensure that veterinary staff in core Defra are alerted and deploy ed where required, make recommendations to the Animal Disease Policy Group (ADPG), horizon scan for tactical risks and issues, attend weekly stakeholder meeti ngs and chair the National Experts Group. Defra Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) and Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser (DCSA) 3.17 The Defra CSA is responsible for cha llenge to scientific advice provided for or to the Defra Animal Disease Policy Group and for communicating with the Government's CSA (GCSA) and strategic bodies such as the NSC(THRC). If SAGE is active it is likely that the Defra CSA or DCSA would chair SAG E or co-chair it with the GCSA. 3.18 The CSA and DCSA represent scienc e and the department at high level meetings, public fora, and communicate with the media on the science underpinning Defra matters as appropriate. The DCSA is a ccountable for challenges to all scientific advice relating to a disease outbreak given to Ministers. 153.19 Upon confirmation of disease the CSA or DCSA will consider the activation of the government's Science Advisory Gr oup for Emergencies ( SAGE) and during the disease control operation, the CSA or their represent ative will horizon scan for strategic issues, attend media briefings, weekly stakeholder group meetings and other meetings as necessary and prov ide regular briefing to the GCSA. Tactical 3.20 Unlike most other major incidents and emergency responses Defra is not only the Lead Government Department, but together with its executive agencies is largely directly responsible for the delivery of both the local and nati onal disease control response. 3.21 The tactical response in GB is co-ordinated through a National Disease Control Centre (NDCC) appropriate to the level required to handle the outbreak/incident. 3.22 In England, the NDCC brings together policy functions provided by Defra with operations functions provided by AH VLA and other operat ional partners. 3.23 Figure 1 sets out t he structure of the NDCC in England. The main responsibilities are: Policy: o To develop, determine and interpre t policy within the legislative and wider strategic framework; o To advise Ministers and other strategic decision makers; o To set the overall objectives for the disease control operation; and o To work in partnership with stakeholders. Operations: o To co-ordinate and direct the delivery of the disease control operation in partnership with stakeholders. 3.24 A framework for decision making during outbreaks has been established which is clear, transparent, timely and audi table and adheres to the principle of subsidiarity (the organising principle that matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralised authority). 16 Figure 1 - NDCC stru cture in England 3.25 A description of the role s and responsibilities follows. NDCC Policy Functions Director General Food and Farming Group 3.26 The Director General Food and Farming Gr oup is responsible for ensuring that the business as usual work of the F ood and Farming Group continues as far as possible, reprioritising work and assisti ng the Chief Veterinary Officer UK as necessary in the disease outbreak effort.

They will also chair stakeholder meetings and the Animal Disease Policy Group (ADPG), liaise with the Devolved Administrations on Animal Health and Welfare policy issues and horizon scan for strategic issues and shape of future policy. 17Exotic Disease Policy Lead 3.28 The Exotic Disease Policy Lead is responsible for ensuring that policy advice and briefing is available to Ministers and other strategic decision makers. If appropriate, they will put in place Tempor ary Control Zones during suspicion and upon confirmation of disease, will draft a Declaration or Decl aratory Order, as required by legislation, in order to establish the boundaries of the infected area. They will ensure that robust and approp riate policies are in place to support the operational response and make appropriate legislation and declarations. Exotic Disease Policy Response Team (EDPRT) 3.29 The Exotic Disease Policy Response Team leads the exotic disease policy response and is responsible for developing and interpreting disease control policy, agreeing policies with Ministers, working wi th lawyers to establish control zones within England and co-ordinati ng briefing material for Mi nisters, officials and stakeholders on all disease related policy issues. 3.30 The team works with t he Devolved Administrations, the Animal Disease Policy Group (ADPG) and stakeholders to develop po licies that are, where possible, complementary across GB/UK and that are practical and ta ke due account of issues on the ground. The team also sets up and manages a disease free status programme that provides historical ti melines and articulates exit strategies. 3.31 The Communication cell within the Ex otic Disease Policy unit (EDP) will work closely with Defra's Communication Team and Devolved Administrations to ensure the correct and timely in formation is provided 3.32 The logistics cell embedded in the EDP, in conjunction with team leaders, monitors staff resources required and can if required utilise a pool of emergency volunteers with the right policy and support skills that have been pre-identified as being available to be immediately seconded to the NDCC response teams in the event of a disease outbreak. Regional Policy Liaison Function (RPLF) 3.33 RPLF are officials who are i dentified and trained between outbreaks and support the Regional Operat ions Director (ROD) and the Regional Veterinary Lead (RVL) on disease control policy related issu es. RPLF are responsible for ensuring that AHVLA and other delivery part ners understand and advocate the policy objectives and help collect intelligence on whether the policy objectives are being delivered and if not offer opinions on why and what needs to change to ensure they can be in future. Veterinary Exotic Notifiable Diseases Unit (VENDU) 3.34 VENDU is a division within AHVLA, res ponsible for veterinary advice to policy makers on the control of the disease. VENDU receives reports of suspected disease from the field, ensures that disease investigations are un dertaken effectively and that notifications are distributed and acted upon, co-ordinates sample test results from the 18laboratory, considers the opt ions for control, makes recommendations as appropriate and acts as a central co-ordination point to collate, refine and present up-to-date information on disease reports. 3.35 If appropriate during an outbreak / in cident, VENDU may delegate some or all of their responsibilities relating to that outbreak/incident to an NDCC Disease Reporting Team (DRT). VENDU will retain functional management of the DRT and continue to handle report cases for other exotic diseases of animals. Disease Reporting Team (DRT) 3.36 When established, the DRT takes on so me or all of the role of VENDU for those reports from the fiel d of suspected disease that relate to the current outbreak/incident. VENDU retain f unctional management of the team. 3.37 The decision to establish a DRT will be made by the Head of VENDU in consultation with the NDCC Director of Op erations and the Head of the Joint Co- ordination Centre (JCC). The JCC will be re sponsible for the staffing of the Disease Reporting Team and designated AHVLA vets will be called in as additional resources as will the Head of DRT at an agreed ti me. A decision will also be made on the DRT's level of authority for disease confirmation. Export Policy and Official Feed and Food Controls (OFFC) 3.38 Export Policy and Official Feed and Food Controls (OFFC) are responsible for policies to prevent the transmission of dis ease to other countries by controlling the export of susceptible commodities.

Animal Demography and Disease Informatics (ADDI) 3.41 The Animal Demography and Disease Informatics portfolio is responsible for providing an analytical information support se rvice to the Strategic, Tactical and Operational response. In the event of an outbreak of exotic disease, the NDCC Data Analysis and Mapping team (the Rapid Analysis and Dete ction of Animal-Related 19Risks (RADAR) team in non-outbreak times) is responsible for the information on the distribution and numbers of livestock access ed via the RADAR data warehouse. This includes the provision of maps and statistics to suppor t risk assessments, disease control operations and require ments to the EU, provision of population information to modellers, and drawing up official zones and production of maps in relation to imposing restrictions for England, Scotland and Wales. The ADDI portfolio also provides the Secretariat resources for t he National Expert Group (NEG) and Tactical Advisory Groups (TAGs), which provide advice on specific issues including scientific, technical and disease control measures issues in disease incident/ outbreak situations. Animal Welfare 3.42 The Animal Welfare Policy Team is re sponsible for providing policy advice on animal welfare on farm and during culling. During a disease outbreak the team will be responsible for providing policy advice on matters affecting the welfare of livestock including the need to protec t the welfare of animals affected by movement restrictions. The team will also seek Mini sterial approval of killing methods used for disease control purposes where this is r equired by the legislation. When appropriate they will work with the Livesto ck and Livestock Products Hub. Livestock and Livestock Products Hub 3.43 The movements team within this hub wil l provides advice on a return to normal movements policy during the recovery phase. It will also provide advice on identification of animals as any compens ation is usually dependent on animals being properly identified. 3.44 The products team will advise on t he impact on the food supply markets of disease control policies (e.g. culling, movem ent restriction, stam ping of meat from restricted areas, impact of vaccination on exports, etc). The team will also engage with the European Commission (DG Agri) on any market intervention measures; advise on any compensation levels for cull ed livestock; work with Animal Welfare on welfare; and advise on disposal of animal by-products. Communications Directorate 3.45 The Communications Directorate is re sponsible for ensuring that Defra has a robust and proportionate communications strat egy in place in order to meet the demands of a disease outbreak situation.

JCC Administration and Forward Planning 3.62 The Administration and Forward Planni ng Team is responsible for horizon scanning to identify possible operational and logistic problems and provide solutions. They will use the output of epidemiologica l modelling for resource planning purposes in order to assess the oper ational impact of the predi cted progression of the outbreak, identifying likely strategic, tactical and operational milestones. JCC Operations 3.63 The JCC Operations Team acts as a central point for overseeing the relationship and communications between the NDCC and the LDCC(s). Its main function is to retain an overview of status of the response at the LDCC(s). It is also responsible for ensuring that informati on and guidance on the management of the outbreak (beyond that provided in Operational Instructions) is passed urgently to the LDCCs and that information flows from the LDCC(s) to the NDCC are accurate and timely. JCC Management Information and Reports 3.64 The JCC Management Information and Re porting Team are responsible for collecting, collating and interpreting summa ry data and information on the control and management of the outbreak. Th e team will be a central point of intelligence for the outbreak, its impact and control. They will receive the colla ted daily situation reports from the LDCC(s) and when ap propriate, from Rural Affa irs Forums from the LDCC Liaison Team. They will compile the JCC report of data and analysis which will be submitted to CCS on a daily basis or le ss frequently as jointly agreed between CCS and the Head of the JCC. The JCC Manag ement Information and Reporting Team will also coordinate the Defra/AHVLA contribution to the CRIP (Commonly Recognised Information Picture). JCC Field Operations 3.65 The Field Operations team issues tactical guidance to LDCC(s) about valuations, culling, transport, disposal and cleansing and disinf ection operations. It will liaise closely with the Proc urement Team to ensure that services are available to carry out these key operational functions and with the centra l teams of other organisations whose local staff will be involved in the field operation. This includes 23the Environment Agency and the Health Prot ection Agency. For large outbreaks the team may sub-divide into separate Team s covering Culling, Transport & Disposal and Cleansing & Disinfection. The Field Oper ations team is also responsible for imposing and lifting Air Exclus ion Zones if required. JCC Vaccination Operations 3.66 The Vaccination Operations Team will, through its management of the external emergency vaccination contractor , implement vaccination operations which will include supplying the vaccinat ion teams, the supervising veterinary surgeons and supporting management structures.

JCC Information Technology Liaison 3.69 The IT Liaison Team co-ordinate requests for IT services and developments and manage their delivery. They liaise with the IT service contractor and AHVLA Information Management and Technology (IMT ) Team who are responsible for the maintenance of IT Disease Control Systems. JCC National Emergency Epidemiology Group (NEEG) 3.70 The Head of NEEG is responsible fo r setting up and resourcing the NEEG so that the NEEG Executive can provide the CVO UK with expert epidemiological opinion relevant to the control policy and c ontribute to the relevant National Expert Group (NEG) on epidemiological matters. 3.71 During an outbreak, the NEEG operates as an operational unit within the Joint Co-ordination Centre. The NEEG provides epidemiological advice and assessment on the determinants, level and distribution of disease to the NEG, other groups and the CVO UK to inform decisions on di sease control and pr evention measures including vaccination and surveillance. It leads the epidemiological investigations of exotic disease outbreaks, delivers epidemiological model ling, designs surveillance plans and analyses surveillance outcomes, c ontributes epidemiological information and expertise to veterinary risk assessment s and provides epidemiology reports or 24the epidemiological components of reports to Defra, the public website, European Commission and OIE. JCC Veterinary Operations 3.72 The Veterinary Operations Team acts as the central point of contact in the JCC for LDCC veterinary staff. It co-o rdinates and manages the veterinary and technical aspects of the control, eradi cation and recovery operation by liaison with policy colleagues and by providing veterinary and technical direction to the field operation by means of instructions and guid ance. The team also provides veterinary and technical support to the NDCC includin g the management of sample results and circulation of these to the NEEG. Field Epidemiology 3.73 The AHVLA Field Epidemiology Team operates in both the NDCC and LDCCs to gather, collate and disseminate field epi demiology information to the NEEG. Operational Partners 3.74 The management, control, and eradication of an outbreak of exotic disease of animals inevitably requires a c oordinated response between numerous organisations. Depending on the disease in question and the scale and severity of the outbreak, the JCC may include representation fr om operational partners including: Environment Agency (EA) 3.75 The EA works with, and supports partners (including Defra, AHVLA, Local Authorities and landowner s) to minimise the environmental impact of an outbreak. The Agency provide expert advice and management options, in particular on waste and disposal sites, determine applications and registrations for waste disposal and reco very activities (including carcasses, manures and wash waters), advise on pollution prevention issues and monitor the impact of the outbr eak on the environment. 3.76 During outbreaks the EA will, wh ere appropriate, provide Liaison Officers at strategic, tactical and operational command le vels and, where necessary, attend Regional Civil Cont ingencies Committee and Strategic Co- ordinating Group meetings. Health Protection Agency (HPA) 3.77 The HPA assess the impact of di sease control measures on public health and ensure directors of public health in the Primar y Care Trusts [or their replacement] are briefed on disease cont rol measures and any related public health issues. The Agency will field health-related enquiries from public and local health service staff, ensure cont inuity of health care provision in restricted infected areas and assist in the analysis of human blood samples 25and provide laboratory support, epidemiological advice and access to modelling capability. 3.78 During outbreaks the Agency wi ll, where appropriate, provide representation at the ta ctical and operational command levels and, where necessary, attend Regional Civil C ontingencies Committee meetings. Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) 3.79 ACPO is responsible for developi ng policing policies. The Association works within a tripartite framework wh ich brings together the local Chief Constable, the local Police Authority and the Home Secretary. ACPO advise on strategic policing issues arising from disease control operations, provide a link to Chief Constables in affected Police Forces and facilitate agreement of proposed routes with all affected Police Forces. 3.80 During outbreaks, ACPO provide representation at the tactical and operational command levels and, w here necessary, attend NSC(THRC) meetings. Individual police forces 3.81 In addition to their wider role in relation to maintaining order and protecting the public, individual police fo rces will fulfil a number of specific roles in relation to an animal disease outbreak including policing of control zones, enforcement of movement controls with local authorities, providing general co-ordination of emergencies s upport, particularly in pursuing legal entry to premises, providing specia list knowledge in the area of management and co-ordination of major incidents and work in partnership with local authorities and AHVLA to share and consider local intelligence. 3.82 A chief officer from the force area affected is usually the chair of the Strategic Co-ordinating Group (SCG) and will be the chair if an outbreak or the activities needed to deal with it reach such proportions that a critical or major incident is declared and the SCG becomes Gold Command. Local Government Regulation (LGR) 3.83 LGR is the local gov ernment central body responsible for overseeing local authority regulatory and related serv ices in the UK. During an outbreak, LGR provide representation at the tact ical command level, liaise with Defra, Government Departments and other deliv ery partners to represent local government interests, provide local aut horities with information, guidance and advice (on both regulatory and enforcem ent matters) and liaise with existing local authority advisers, including t he National Animal Health and Welfare Panel, for immediate technical advi sory input into policy development. 26Individual Local Authorities 3.84 Local Authorities, county and unita ry councils, are major operational partners in the response to an outbreak of exotic notifiable disease in animals. They play key roles in enforcement and implementation of disease control strategies and are fundamental to rapid and efficient access to local information and resources. They also fu lfil a significant role in providing advice and education at a loca l level. Animal health legislation enforcement functions are usually provided by tr ading standards or environmental health services. 3.85 During an outbreak, Local Authoritie s provide resources such as staff (including Animal Health Officers, Emergency Planning Officers and Highways and Public Rights of Way departments), vehicles, equ ipment and buildings, where necessary, enforce disease cont rol measures and movement licence conditions, erect road signs for publicisin g control zones. Local Authorities also provide liaison officer representat ion at the operational command level. Department of Health (DoH) 3.86 The DoH's role is to provide clear and unambiguous advice on the human health implications of an animal disease outbreak. During an outbreak of exotic disease of animals, DoH wil l provide strategic guidance and advice on prophylaxis and treatment of people where necessary. Department for Transport (DfT) 3.87 During an outbreak of ex otic disease of animals DfT aims to provide support to Defra, its asso ciated agencies and stakeholders by responding to demands for information on transport related issues, providing practical advice and guidance and facilitating contact with the transport industry where necessary. Food Standards Agency (FSA) 3.88 The FSA is responsible for providing advice to the public concerning implications for the food chain arising from an outbreak of exotic disease of animals. FSA Operations is responsible for the protection of public and animal health through the proportionate enforcement of legislation in approved fresh meat premises. It is responsible for the delivery of official legislative controls relating to standards of hygiene in slaughterhouses and cutting plants Natural England (NE) 3.89 Natural England (NE) is an exec utive non-department al public body and is the government's independent advis er on the natural environment. NE is focused on conserving and enhanci ng England's biodiversity and landscapes and maximising the benefits they bring to the public. In particular, NE are responsible for managing E ngland's agri-environment schemes, implementation of open access legislati on including regulation for temporary 27closure, they are the licensing au thority for protected species, have responsibility for the statutory desi gnation of a range of protected sites including Sites of Special Scientific Interest and National Parks and manage the majority of the National Nature Reserves and regulate the maintenance and condition of Sites of Spec ial Scientific Interest. Stakeholders 3.90 Depending on the size, location, scale and nature of the outbreak there may be stakeholder representation wit hin the JCC. Stakeholders may be invited to attend NDCC birdtable meetings and various other meetings arranged. Stakeholders may also have a role in disseminati ng information to livestock keepers. Devolved Administrations 3.91 Representatives from the Devolved Administrations (DAs) may be based in the JCC during large scale outbreaks in Great Britain. For smaller outbreaks or those where disease is limited to England only it may not be necessary for the DAs to be embedded within the JCC and they may par ticipate at NDCC birdtables via teleconference. Operational 3.92 At the operational level, AHVLA establishes the Local Disease Control Centre(s) (LDCC(s)), headed by a Regio nal Operations Director (ROD) and appropriate to the level required to handle the outbreak/incident. The LDCC coordinate and implement t he disease control operatio n, ensuring that local operational partners and stak eholders are appropriately engage d. The LDCC follows tactical direction and policy guidance set out in the relevant disease control strategies, contingency plans and operationa l instructions. The LDCCs also report back to the JCC on the progress of the disease control operation. 3.93 For logistical reasons one or more Forward Operations Bases (FOBs) may also be established close to the outbreak or incident, providing a local operational base for those LDCC teams t hat are predominantly involved in patrolling, surveillance and field operations activity. 3.94 Upon confirmation of disease, the RO D will brief the appropriate Sub-National resilience team and the Chair of the Local Resilience Forum on the situation and agree on the local arrangements necessary to consider wider consequences of the outbreak. If necessary, a local Stra tegic Coordinating Group (SCG) may be established to manage the wider impacts of an outbreak on the local area (e.g. health, social, economic, environmental and pub lic information) and the Chair of the SCG and ROD will work closely together. 3.95 Figure 2 sets out the st ructure of LDCCs in England and a description of the roles and responsibilities follows. 28 Figure 2 - LDCC structure Regional Operations Director (ROD) 3.96 The ROD is responsible for leading the local disease control operation and taking overall control of the Local Disease Control Centre (LDCC) and any associated Forward Operations Bases (FOBs) .

Not all the contributions listed are needed at all times in an outbreak. Contributions must be brief, well focused on immediate key issues, should be objective not speculative and be complet ed as expeditiously as possible. The chair will decide if teleconferencing facilit ies are to be provided for representatives from operational partner s, other government depar tments and the Devolved Administrations who are exceptiona lly unable to attend in person. Operational Level LDCC Birdtable Meetings 4.41 LDCC Birdtable Meetings are conducted for the same purpose as NDCC Birdtable meetings above with the additional objective to provide a structure to deal with action points and a designated point at wh ich all those involved in the response can consider future action. 4.42 The Regional Operations Director (ROD) will chair the meetings with the Secretariat provided by the LDCC Communi cations Team. The participants at the meetings will be from all ar eas involved in the operational response including the Regional Policy Liaison Function (RPLF), LDCC management team, all LDCC team leaders, operational partner s and invited stakeholders. 4.43 The issues reported on will include an update on current disease status and control measures, situation reports fr om LDCC team managers, updates from Stakeholders and Operational Partners, a review of outstanding actions from previous birdtables, the battle rhythm and housekeeping issues. LDCC Management Teleconference 4.44 The LDCC Management Teleconference provides a daily forum for local offices involved in the outbreak to communicate with the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC). 4.45 The Director of Operati ons will chair the teleconf erence with the secretariat provided by the JCC Operati ons team (AHVLA Contingency Planning Division). The participants will include Regional Operati ons Director(s), Regional Policy Liaison Function, Chief Executive AHVLA, Head of Veterinary Operations, Head of JCC and other senior AHVLA Managers involved in the outbreak. 4.46 The issues that are likely to be di scussed include the National update, current regional situation(s), operat ional and policy issues, resour ces, communications, IT / Data, actions and issues requiring escalation. 41 Battle Rhythm Table 1: Battle rhythm timings Time Level Event 0800 - 0830 Strategic Daily Stock take Operational Daily Management & Communications Meeting 0830 - 0900 Tactical NDCC Birdtable Operational LDCC Birdtable 0900 - 0930 Tactical Daily Communications Meeting 1000 - 1100 Strategic NSC (THRC) 1130 - 1200 Strategic Defra Media Briefing Operational Media Briefing 1200 - 1230 Tactical NDCC Birdtable Operational LDCC Birdtable 1400 - 1430 Tactical / Operational LDCC Management Teleconference 1500 - 1600 Strategic NSC (THRC) 1800 - 1830 Tactical NDCC Birdtable Operational LDCC Birdtable Ad-hoc Strategic Animal Disease Policy Group Tactical National Experts Group 4.47 The battle rhythm set out here is indi cative. These timings are for an outbreak of significant size in which a NSC (THRC) is established and a daily media briefing is the norm. Any deviation from the set battle rhythm must be agreed between the Head of the JCC (AHVLA Head of Contingency Planning Division) and the Chief Veterinary Officer UK. 4.48 Where an outbreak is small and event s are slow moving a more condensed battle rhythm will be more appropriate, with a la ter start and earlier finishing time. The main point is to ensure that a schedule is set and understood by all. 425 Suspicion and Confirmation 5.1 The section provides an overview of the processes involved in the investigation of exotic disease of anima ls and the actions taken if disease is confirmed. Alert System to Indicate Disease Status 5.2 A standard alert system has been adopted to describe the current status of a specific disease outbreak or incid ent of exotic disease of animals. Table 2: Alert status White alert: This indicates that the dis ease is not present or suspected in the UK and will be the state of al ert under normal circumstances. Black alert: This indicates that the risk of disease is higher than normal. For example disease may be suspected or confirmed in a nearby EU Member State. This would warra nt a higher level of vigilance. The decision to raise the state of alert from white to black will be taken by the Chief Veterinar y Officer UK (CVO UK). Amber alert: This indicates that there is a strong su spicion of the presence of the disease on a particular premis es based on clinical picture, following a veterinary inquiry. Sa mples will have been submitted for laboratory analysis. Government Laboratories may identif y a notifiable disease as part of routine surveillance, in which case there could be an immediate move to amber alert stage. Red alert: This indicates that dis ease has been confirmed or that an operational response has been initiated. 5.3 Figure 5 illustrates the likely actions undertaken between whit e and red status for the first case of suspect notifi able exotic disease in clean country. 43Figure 5: Actions performed be tween white and red status 5.4 The level of suspicion is case-specific , therefore must be assessed each time disease is suspected, although each stat e of alert may cater for more than one possible disease scenario within its correspondi ng level(s) of suspicion. Table 3 sets out the level of suspicion and possible scenarios for each alert state. 44Table 3: Level of suspicion and po ssible scenarios for each alter state. State of alert (Countrywide) Level of suspicion (Case specific) Possible scenarios White/ Black 0 Disease not suspected following veterinary enquiry Any restrictions on premises lifted. No further action. 1 Lesions and clinical disease not typical - but disease cannot be ruled out entirely on clinical grounds. Suspect animal(s)/ birds left alive and observed. Samples taken for laboratory diagnosis. Amber 2 Lesions and clinical disease suggestive of the notifiable disease but not entirely convincing. Suspect animal(s)/ birds showing lesions may be culled as a preventative measure (excluding those culled for post- mortem examination and collection of tissue samples). Samples taken and submitted for laboratory diagnosis. 3 Veterinary staff on farm and at Headquarters (HQ) believe from investigation on clinical grounds that disease exists. Red 4 As a level 3 plus disease already confirmed in the country or substantial evidence that disease may have entered the country. For example, disease in imported animals originating from a region with confirmed disease. All susceptible animal(s)/ birds on the premises culled on suspicion and disease confirmed on clinical grounds only without awaiting laboratory results. Samples will be submitted for laboratory diagnosis. First reported case where disease is confirmed. Disease is already in the country and further cases have been confirmed. 45Suspicion of Disease 5.5 There is a legal duty on any person w ho suspects that an animal may have a statutory notifiable disease to report their su spicion to the Secret ary of State via the local AHVLA Duty Veterinary Officer. Arr angements for out of hours cover are in place at AHVLA offices. If the report leads the Duty VO to suspect disease may be present, an investigation will be carried out by a veterinary inspector (normally an AHVLA Veterinary Officer). 5.6 The AHVLA Duty VO fr om the investigating o ffice will inform the AHVLA Veterinary Exotic Notifiable Diseases Unit (VENDU) and the office of the Chief Executive AHVLA (CE AH VLA) that an investi gation is underway. 5.7 VENDU will circulate an NDI1 notification form to: Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO UK); Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland); Chief Veterinary Officer (Wales); Chief Veterinary Officer (Northern Ireland); Defra Ministers and Senior Officials; Senior Officials in Defra, Sc otland, Wales and Northern Ireland; Other Government Departments (C abinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS)); AHVLA senior management; and Others as appropriate. 5.8 Out of hours notification is the res ponsibility of the VENDU Duty Veterinary Adviser (VA) or Veterinary Services M anager (VSM) and the Duty Press Officer. NDI1s are not normally issued out of hours. CVOs Case Conference 5.9 On suspicion of disease there may be a series of case conferences to discuss emerging issues. Attendees would usually co mprise the four UK Chief Veterinary Officers, supported by key policy and veterinary officials from each administration. This meeting would determine whether circ umstances warranted triggering an Amber Teleconference. The case conference is or ganised by the CVO (UK)'s office and they also supply the secretariat. Amber Teleconference 5.10 If suspicion of disease is strong and its presence cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds an Amber teleconference is held. Its purpose is to appraise all concerned of the situation, to assess t he risk and to agree on next steps. The meeting is chaired by the CVO (UK) and follows a standard agenda. During the teleconference the CVO may agree to confirm disease (raising the alert status to Red) or specify what further evidence, su ch as test results, would be needed. The teleconference would also agree plans fo r future actions and communications based on the emerging situation. 46 5.11 The amber alert telephone confer ence is organised by Defra's Food and Farming Group Exotic Disease Policy Res ponse Team. The teleconference is chaired by the CVO UK and participants include all the Devolved Administration CVOs, senior officials from Defra, SG, WAG AHVLA and the relevant UK reference laboratory for the disease under investigation, the local AH VLA managers for the affected area, and relevant representatives from other Government departments and Health Agencies. 5.12 If a veterinary risk assessment indicates an unacceptable risk in waiting for laboratory test results, the CVO UK may take the decis ion to move to red alert without waiting for the results of laboratory investigations. Amber Teleconference Agenda Laboratory results and interpretation; Local situation report; National situation assessment incl uding time line and risk assessment; Review of evidence to inform decisi on to confirm diseas e / move to Red alert; and Summary of action points (if not c onfirming disease / moving to Red). 5.13 If disease is confirmed and/or the state of alert is moved to Red, the following agenda items will also be discussed (The CVO UK may choose to have a preliminary discussion on these items, ev en if the state of aler t is kept at Amber): Public Health Implications and proposed action; Food Safety issues and proposed action; Area and movement restrictions (i ncluding Temporary Control Zones where appropriate), implement ation and communications; Vaccination issues; Stakeholder engagement, timing and content - National and Local; Objectives and lines to take for Communications; Arrangements for notificati ons and public announcement; Operational response, in cluding arrangements for the establishment of the NDCC and LDCC and the initial battle rhythm; and Summary of action points. 5.14 Questions about test results and timi ng of their delivery, either at the teleconference or at any other time, must be addressed to the CVO UK or nominated contact. Notifications 5.15 If following the teleconferenc e, the level of suspicion is considered sufficient to warrant further action, official s will take responsibility for notifying others. If following these initial notifications it is considered that a full dise ase control operation is likely to commence, there are additional notificat ions and actions for officials to undertake, this will include: 47 Placing of the NDCC Policy and Operational functions on alert and potentially establishing some elements of the NDCC; and Authorisation of and establishment of a LDCC. 5.16 At the suspicion phase there ar e several key communications actions undertaken by communications officials. This is to ensure accurate information is distributed as appropriate and that in the ev ent of a move to a red alert, adequate communications resources are available to support operations. Red Alert 5.17 In cases where laboratory confirma tion is imminent and the veterinary risk assessment indicates an unacceptable risk in waiting, the CVO may take the decision to move to red alert before the final test results are received. 5.18 In the event of a red al ert, there are additional acti ons and notifications to be undertaken by officials, including: The development of objectives for disease control; The establishment of the NDCC; Determination of the boundarie s of the infected area; and Organisation of National Experts Group Meeting and Animal Disease Policy Group meeting. Notifications to the European Commission and OIE 5.19 The CVO (UK) has the responsibility for notifying the European Commission, other Member states and the OIE of an outbreak of notifi able disease within any part of the UK. 486 Communications Communications Objective 6.1 For each outbreak or incident of notifi able exotic disease of animals it is important that there are effective, timely and accurate communications with stakeholders, farmers and animal keepers, t he public and the media. Appropriate communications tools will be used to assi st in reducing the impact and spread of disease and to provide accurate, time ly updates on the latest situation. Communications with the Media and General Public 6.2 As part of the NDCC the Policy Br iefing and Communications Team gathers information on the disease outbreak. It ai ms to provide accurate and timely information on the outbreak for Ministers, th e media, senior officials, help lines and all staff dealing directly with the public and for publication via the website. 6.3 Defra Communications Directorate ( CD) aims to provide appropriate, clear and accurate information to key audiences. CD also aims to inform and coordinate Defra and central government information, identif y early any issues of key interest to the media and the public, and assist poli cy colleagues with key messages, deliver timely, integrated communications advice to Ministers, provide key messages to staff and liaise with local Co mmunications teams. 6.4 AHVLA Communications has lead re sponsibility for managing communications with livestock keepers. One of the main methods of communication is via a mass messaging system which using data held by AH VLA, allows a combinations of SMS, voicemail, email and fax messages to be se nt to livestock keepers and, working in partnership with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, veterinary practices. AHVLA Communications also manages the distribution of information packs to livestock premises within Protection Zones and Surveillance Zones. 6.5 A Daily Communications meeting is held at the NDCC (including representatives from AHVLA, Defra and other departments as appropriate) to identify and agree key points to make for inte rnal and external communications. 6.6 Each LDCC will contain a communicati ons team who liaise closely with the national communications teams and provide an integrated communications service at the local level. Internal Communications 6.7 During an outbreak or incident of notifiable exotic dise ase it is important that those staff involved are kept informed of both the operational progress of the response and other key messages. There will also be a need to keep all 49departmental staff and other Governm ent departments and bodies informed. The Communications teams in t he NDCC lead on this area. Working with Stakeholders and Operational Partners 6.8 The management, control and eradication of an outbreak or incident of notifiable exotic disease of animals r equires a coordinated response and effective communications between a number of organisations including Operational Partners and Stakeholders. 6.9 Operational Part ners are the Government/public organisations who play a key delivery role in assisting with the managemen t of certain critical aspects of the disease control operation, for example, the Environment Agency, Food Standards Agency, Police forces and Local Authorities 6.10 A stakeholder is a person or body who may be affected by the management (operations and policy) of an outbreak of exot ic disease in animals, for example, the farming industry and rural businesses. Local Level 6.11 At the Regional leve l RODs engage with local O perational Partners and stakeholders as part of their on-going emergency preparedne ss arrangements and, where possible include them in the planni ng and implementation of local exercises. 6.12 During disease outbreaks Operational Pa rtners will be part of the operational level response and be part of the LDCC if appropriate and necessary. In addition, local stakeholder groups will be established within the LDCC. These groups will help inform local decision making as appropriate and will assist with ensuring that developments in local operations are co mmunicated to all relevant parties. National Level 6.13 Depending on the size, location, scale and nature of the outbreak or incident there may be at the stakeholder representation within the JCC. Operational Partners will also form part of the JCC as appropriate. 6.14 Representatives from major stakeholder groups may be invited to attend NDCC birdtable meetings and can attend va rious other meetings arranged for stakeholders. 6.15 Depending on the outbreak, a number of different stakeholder groups may be convened, including but not limited to: Core Group of stakeholders invited in a personal capacity to work with senior officials in developing stra tegic disease control policies; Key Stakeholders representing industry organisations impacted by the outbreak as a means of keeping people informed of latest developments and providing a forum to raise issues; and 50 Veterinary Stakeholders - to ensure representatives of key veterinary bodies are kept informed of developments and have opportunity to input into decision making. 517 Area and premises restrictions & movement controls Overview 7.1 In general a report of suspicion of notifiable disease triggers an official investigation by AHVLA that may place temporary statut ory restrictions on that premises; the initial verbal re strictions are confirmed in wr iting if disease cannot be ruled out by clinical inspection carried out by a Veterinary Officer. 7.2 Depending on the disease concerned, these restrictions may apply to the whole premises or just to individual animals, would usually include a ban on the movement of susceptible animals on and off the suspect premises and may include restrictions on other things liable to transmit disease. 7.3 During the suspicion phase of certain di seases (e.g. Avian Influenza, Foot and Mouth Disease, African Swine Fever) a Te mporary Control Zone (TCZ) may also be declared around the premis es under suspicion. 7.4 Restrictions would remain in place until the official investigations are complete and an exotic notifiable disease can be ruled out. 7.5 If disease is confirmed, the primary objective is to prevent the spread of disease by: Taking action on the Infected Premises (IP) and other affected premises where disease is most likely (e.g . those linked by recent animal movements either to or from the IP); Imposing wider area based controls as required by legislation including animal movement controls (in the case of FMD in particular, GB administrations may impose national movement restrictions on susceptible animals); Restricting activities that might incr ease the risk of spread (e.g. there might be a ban on hunting or shooting); Placing controls on animal products; Considering export bans; Investigating the origin of the disease and determining whether there has been further spread of diseas e from that source; and Other surveillance to investigate possible further spread of disease. Premises Restrictions 7.6 Premises restrictions are put in pl ace by the competent authority to ensure that a disease agent is not moved off t he premises. Restrictions prevent the movement of animals susceptib le to the particular diseas e onto and off the premises. 527.7 Depending on the disease concer ned, the movement of people, non- susceptible animals, animal products, feed and fodder, vehicles and anything else potentially contaminated with infectious mate rial, off and onto the premises may also be restricted. Subject to legislative r equirements, a veterinary risk assessment and suitable biosecurity procedures, they ma y be allowed to move off and on to the premises under licence. 7.8 The rules concerning the premises will be set out in the notice served on the animal keeper and also any licence will specify conditions permitting movements onto and off the premises or restricted place. 7.9 As an additional precaution, consideration will be given to the closure of any rights of way (e.g. footpaths, bridlewa ys, etc.) that cross the premises. Area Restrictions 7.10 In the event of a notifiable disease outbreak or incident, there is likely to be initially a degree of uncertain ty about the origin of the di sease, how long it has been present and its spread. Because of this unc ertainty, area restrictions are usually imposed to stop animal movements into, fr om and within the rest ricted area. Area restrictions are not app lied for every disease. 7.11 During the suspicion phase of certai n diseases, a Temporary Control Zone (TCZ) may be declared around the premises under suspicion by Statutory Order under the relevant diseas e control legislation. 7.12 Upon confirmation of mo st notifiable diseases covered by this plan, a Protection Zone (PZ), surrounded by a lar ger Surveillance Zone (SZ) would be imposed around the Infected Premises (IP) by Statutory Order. To reflect the increased risk of transmission of disease, controls within the PZ would be more stringent that those within the SZ. In the case of Rabies, an infected area may be imposed by Statutory Order that could be sub-divided into fu rther zones, each with their own set of controls. 7.13 For those diseases where confirmation would not result in a PZ and SZ being imposed, legislation an d the relevant disease control strategy, provides for other types of controlled zones to be imposed. Although known by various terms, their main objective is to reduce the risk of disease spreading beyond the known affected area. Temporary Control Zone (TCZ) 7.14 A Temporary Control Zone would impose specific measures and be of a size considered necessary to reduce the risk of or prevent the spread of disease. For FMD, the TCZ would typically have a mi nimum radius of 10km with the centre located at the IP using the location of the suspect animal(s). A further movement control zone may also be established depen ding on the disease, restricting the movement of animals in a wider area. The TCZ would be removed if the suspect 53case tests negative or is converted to Pr otection and Surveillance Zones by Statutory Order if tests are positive and disease is confirmed. Protection Zone (PZ) 7.15 A Protection Zone would typically have a radius of not less than 3 kilometres from the IP. It may be del ineated as a circle or ma y follow roads or natural geographic boundaries. It may be necessary fo r the PZ to be a different shape, for example, if disease can be spread by vector s or likely to be windborne, to take into account the size and shape of the wind plume under which an imals may have been exposed to disease. Provided there we re no further cases and all the required surveillance has been carried out within the PZ, normally 21 days after completion of preliminary disinfection of the IP, t he PZ can be merged with the SZ, with some relaxation in the controls in the original PZ area so they are equivalent to those of the SZ. Surveillance Zone (SZ) 7.16 A surveillance zone would typica lly have a radius of not less than 10 kilometres from the IP. It may be delineated by a circle or by roads or natural geographic boundaries. Provi ded there are no further ca ses and all the required surveillance has been carried out, the surveillance zone will be lifted, usually not less than 30 days after the completion of prelim inary cleansing and disinfection on the last infected premises within the Protection Zone. Controls and Restrictions in the PZ and SZ 7.17 The detailed controls vary depending on which disease is involved and are set out in the relevant Statut ory Order declaring the zones. In general, controls are primarily focused on the movement of animals since, for most diseases, this is the most potent method of spreading disease. Legislation includes controls on vehicles, fomites (things that may physically carry th e disease agent), meat , animal products (including meat products, eggs, hides and in some cases milk and milk products derived from animals in the zones) and on the carcases of animals. 7.18 Animal keepers within the control zones may be required to carry out additional biosecurity measures and report any suspicion of disease. 7.19 Whilst the zones are in place, AHVLA will carry out surveillance, involving clinical inspection, examination and possi bly sampling for laboratory testing in the areas to demonstrate that disease has not spread. In extensive outbreaks or incidents, where there may be a large number of PZ and SZ areas declared, the areas may overlap to form a very large PZ and SZ which may increase the time required to carry out the required surveillance to demonstrate freedom. 54Exemptions to Movement Restrictions Licensing 7.20 As investigations in to an outbreak or incident progress, it will become clearer where the risks of disease spread lie. 7.21 Depending on the circumstances, subj ect to veterinary risk assessment and statutory requirements, exem ptions to controls may be granted using specific or general licences issued by the competent authority. These licences would set out any criteria (e.g. veterinary inspection, cleansing and disinfection, monitoring, etc.) that would need to be met before, during or after the move. 7.22 Each UK administration operates its own licensing regime. Co-ordination and co-operation between the admin istrations provides a coherent approach to moves across administrative borders. Each administration will discu ss its strategy for exit from movement controls with relevant st akeholders and identify pr iorities for change, subject to risk assessment, the disease situation at the time and within the requirements of the legislative framework. Welfare moves 7.23 In the event of a widespread and/or prolonged outbreak of disease with prolonged movement controls and limited or no intra-communi ty trade, there may be no outlet for meat and meat products. There may also be a build up of animals on premises because they cannot be moved off as a result of movement restrictions and cannot be sold for slaughter or because ther e is no market for t hem. Such a build up may have an adverse effect on the we lfare of animals on the premises. 7.24 Pressures on accommodation can arise quickly and this is especially so in the pig and poultry sector. It is important therefore that all animal keepers have contingency plans in place to deal wit h prolonged movement restrictions. 7.25 The welfare of animals is the respons ibility of the keeper of the animals and where there is suffering due to overcrowding the keeper may have to arrange for those animals to be humanely culled. 7.26 Immediately following the imposition of movement controls, consideration will be given to making licences available to permit certain movements for welfare purposes (e.g. dairy cow movements for milk ing, movements to permit treatment by veterinary surgeons, etc.). The conditions of these licences aim to ensure that such moves take place under suitable biosecurity rules. Enforcement 7.27 The area movement restrictions and t he licensing conditions are enforced by local authorities in England. 55Public access to the countryside falling within control zones 7.28 The risks of disease being spread by t hose seeking recreational access to the countryside are very small, and can be reduc ed further by avoiding direct contact with animals. Every effort will be made to keep access to the countryside open but, subject to assessment of t he risk, public access to land may need to be reduced or controlled in specific circumstances for specific diseases (most notably FMD). International controls and controls on animal products 7.29 In the event of a disease outbreak or incident and depending on the disease, the UK may lose its OIE international disease free status which may prevent the export of animals and their products. 7.30 Within the EU, depending on the disease, there may also be a ban on intra community trade of susceptible animals, m eat or meat product s and milk and dairy products from the whole country or parts of it. Although these products may not be traded within the community, subj ect to the disease and any movement restrictions in place, they may be traded on the domesti c market with a domestic health mark (round stamp). 7.31 In the case of trade with third countr ies (i.e. those countries that are not members of the EU or EFTA (The European Free Trade Association)), export certificates may be withdrawn until the situation has been clarified with the importing country. Regionalisation 7.32 Depending on the diseas e situation it may be possible, following a risk assessment, to divide the country into areas defined as free of disease, low risk and high risk. This would allow the relaxation of some controls and allow additional movements within an area of t he same status and from free or low risk areas to high risk areas. Regionalisation is dependent on the epidemiol ogy of the disease, accurate up to date information on its geographical distribution and seasonal trade patterns. Laboratory surveillance may be required to demonstr ate freedom from disease in a region. Proposals to regional ise must be acceptable to the other UK administrations, the European Commi ssion and other trading partners. Regionalisation would also impose rest rictions on animal and animal product movements to maintain the region's disease status. This may have an adverse economic effect that outweighs any s hort term advantage of regionalisation and economic considerations must be taken in to account in coming to decisions on regionalisation. 56Compartmentalisation 7.33 EU legislation enables intra-Community trade to resume relatively quickly once a disease is under control. However the resumption of trade with third country trading partners can take many more months. 7.34 Compartmentalisation is a concept that allows companies, in the event of a disease outbreak, to resume trade quickly with 'third countries' who have \"signed up\" to the scheme. Companies must meet t he conditions of EC Regulation 616/2009 which includes strict biosecurity measures and the requirement for premises to be approved by Government. At the present ti me, compartmentalisation applies only to certain poultry premises in the event of an avian influenza outbreak. 578 Culling and Disposal Overview 8.1 The carcases of any culled animals must be disposed of in a safe and biosecure manner as quickly as possible. Disposal usually involves removing them from the premises using bi osecure transport to the designated disposal facilities. AHVLA is responsible for arranging the cu lling and disposal of affected animals in England. 8.2 While speed of culling and disposal is essential, the health and safety of personnel, keepers and owners is paramount and careful preparations are put in place by AHVLA to ensure that health and safety is not compromised. This is particularly important in t he case of animal diseases that are communicable to humans (zoonoses) and the Health Protec tion Agency (HPA) will advise on the precautions to be taken on affected premises to protect workers. The welfare of the animals to be culled is also given careful consideration. Culling 8.3 Culling as a disease c ontrol measure is carried out under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon. The methods deployed will depend on the species, age of animals involved and the number of lives tock that need to be culled and will take account of the specific site condi tions and any resource constraints. 8.4 In most cases, culling will be under taken by licensed sl aughtermen who will be contracted by AHVLA. A r ange of contingency contracts are in place with licensed slaughtermen and marksmen. 8.5 The following are the main culling methods for catt le, sheep, pigs and other large animals: Lethal injection; Electrical stun/kill; Captive bolt followed by pithing; and Free bullet. 8.6 For poultry the main options are: Lethal injection; Neck dislocation; Percussion killing; Electrical stun/kill; Exposure to lethal gas mixtures; and Maceration (limited to day old chicks). 588.7 AHVLA has 50 containeris ed gassing units available for deployment as well as a number of poultry transport modules and stocks of specialist percussion killers. Following a number of successf ul trials, AHVLA negotiated a contract with a major bulk gas supplier to deliver a Whole H ouse Gassing (WHG) service using liquid carbon dioxide. The use of gas-filled foam is also being investigated. 8.8 Under certain very limited circum stances where highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed and where there is a threat to public health or where suitable resources to combat the disease are severely stretched, Defra may exceptionally consider the use of ventilation shutdow n where no other practical method of culling is available. 8.9 Most of the options for poultry, exc ept WHG, require the birds to be caught and either placed in crates or restrained prior to culling. Defra has contingency contracts with a number of specialist catc hers and in the event of a major disease outbreak they will seek to work with the poultry industry to obtain additional catchers released from their existing work. Culling of Animals to Prevent th e Spread of Disease (pre-emptive cull) 8.10 Ministers also have the power to require the culling of animals in order to prevent the spread of Foot and Mouth, Avian Influenza and Newcastle diseases. 8.11 Before such powers are used, Mi nisters will have to make a statement explaining the situation and why it is nece ssary to resort to using such powers. Compensation will be paid for any ani mals culled under these powers. Disposal Arrangements and Policy 8.12 In consultation with policy officials, environment agencies, local authorities and disposal industry representatives, the NDCC (National Disease Control Centre) will coordinate the task of finding and utilising available disposal capacity in GB. Responsibility for transporting the carcases to these facilities rests with the LDCC. Decisions on which site to use take account of whether the site s are approved under ABPR (Animal By Products Regulations), Waste Incineration Directive (WID) and Waste Framework Directive; value for money; the proximity of the facilities to the affected premises, logistical and seasonal issues; the tonnage of carcase material that needs to be disposed of and any epide miological data or modelling which may suggest the likely scale of the outbreak. There are also a number of strategies available, such as emergency vaccination for FMD, that if used, may help reduce the numbers of animals to be disposed of in an outbreak. 8.13 Taking into account the above, and as a guide, Defra's preferred hierarchy of disposal options for carcases is: Commercial fixed plant incineration; 59 Rendering (Category 1 and 2 ani mal by-product approved); and Permitted commercial landfill sites. 8.14 Operational protocols fo r use of incineration, render ing and permitted landfill in an outbreak of an exotic disease have been produced and shared with the Environment Agency, the United Kingdom Renderers Association (UKRA), the Foodchain and Biomass Renewables Associ ations (Fabra) and the Environmental Services Association (ESA). 8.15 LDCC staff are responsible for revi ewing the selected site's biosecurity and ensuring that the plant complies with disposal site protocols. For zoonotic diseases, the HPA is also involved assessing the pot ential exposure of workers and will issue guidance and prophylaxis as appropriate. 8.16 On-farm pyres and on-farm burial may be considered in remote areas (e.g. The Isles of Scilly, which is covered by the remote area derogation) where access to other avenues of disposal are limited. Any dec isions to use these disposal routes will be taken in consultation with key stakeholders and appropriate environmental and public health assessments will be undertaken at each disposal location prior to use. 8.17 Other disposal options, such as mass bur ial, air curtain burners, incineration in cement kilns and the use of hazardous or municipal incineration etc are potentially also available in certain limited circum stances and will only be considered where none of the preferred options are available and if demand exceeds the capacity of the preferred options of incineration/rendering and permi tted commercial landfill. 8.18 Defra recognises there are several fa ctors that may impact on the disposal hierarchy in the future. These include new environmental or waste management legislation and changes to capacity and acce ssibility of the disposal outlets. The hierarchy will therefore be regularly reviewed, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, to take account of these issues. New technologies and facilities will also be reviewed on a regular basis. Disposal Capacity 8.19 Disposal capacity is limited and subject to significant seasonal variation. Capacity is also poorly matched to the distribution of poultry and pigs within England since the main disposal facilities are generally located in areas of high cattle and sheep densities. 8.20 In an outbreak there will be a need to optimise disposal capacity and to work with the disposal industry to ei ther divert existing business to other facilities or to ensure that biosecurity at a facility site is rigorous enough to permit existing waste streams to continue to be received alongside infective material. For diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease, AHVLA is likely to require a dedicated disposal site. For some poultry diseases it may be preferable, for operational reasons, for a mixed poultry and mammalian waste stream to be received. 8.21 Additional capacity w ould be arranged as required in consultation with UKRA and Fabra. Readily available disposal c apacity in the UK varies between 2,500 and 6010,000 tonnes per week depending on the time of year, although additional capacity could be brought on stream over a period of weeks. It is unlikely that more than about 16,000 tonnes per week would ever be available for carcase disposal without major diversion of existing waste streams to landfill. Local AHVLA Offices have plans in place to invoke these disposal routes as required. Transportation of carcases 8.22 Defra has a number of framework agreements and call-off agreements with a range of specialist local, regional and nat ional haulage companies in England. Local managers will identify and procure appropriate transport for carcase disposal in consultation with the NDCC Field Operat ions team and regi onal managers. For animals culled for disease control purposes the transport of carcases is undertaken by companies under the control of AHVLA. 8.23 Defra also has an emergency call-off c ontract in place to supply a national transport logistics manager and supporting local transport manager(s) within 36 hours of confirmation of an outbreak. The local transport managers will take on responsibility for all transport logistics onc e appointed. There is sufficient contracted transport capacity to transport around 50,000 tonnes of carcase material per day. 8.24 Each vehicle will be leak-tested pr ior to being loaded, suitably placarded with hazard warning plates as required by ADR (Accord europ\u00e9en relatif au transport international des marchandises Dangereus es par Route) and the Transport of Dangerous Goods legislation and will travel by a prescr ibed route to the chosen disposal facility. For highly infectious dis eases, each vehicle will also be escorted. The driver will carry a transport incident record card, which advises police and emergency services of any precautions t hat should be taken in the event of an accident or incident. Cleansing and Disinfection (C&D) 8.25 Once susceptible animals have been culled and their carcases securely disposed of, the premises and potentially contaminated transport and equipment is cleansed and disinfected to prevent spread from the premises and potential re-emergence (recrudescence) of disease when the premises is restocked. Animal feedstuffs and items which may have been contaminated and which cannot be cleansed and disinfected may be seized and destroyed. 8.26 Potentially contaminated areas must first be cleansed to remove organic material and are then disinfected with an app roved disinfectant or biocide at the recommended rate. 8.27 The Environment Agency provides advice on precautions to be taken on premises undergoing C&D in order to minimise environmental impacts of disinfectants or biocides. 8.28 There are two phases to cleansing and disinfection (C&D), preliminary and final (secondary) - these are outlined below. 61 Preliminary Disinfection 8.29 Preliminary disinfection is carried out immediately after culling and disposal has been completed. It is carried out under the direction and cont rol of AHVLA and at Government's expense. Pre liminary disinfection consists of spraying contaminated and potentially contaminated ar eas where the animals were culled and where they were housed immediately before they were culled with an approved disinfectant or biocide. Preliminary disinfec tion is considered to be completed 24 hours after the last application of the approved disinfectant. 8.30 The timing of preliminary disinfecti on is important because, generally, the merging of the protection zone and surve illance zone can only take place after a defined number of days following completion of preliminary disinfection on the last infected premises within the zone. This per iod may vary depending on the disease. Final (Secondary) C&D 8.31 Depending on the disease, final C&D can only commence a defined number of days after preliminary disinfection. 8.32 The costs of final C&D usually fall to the owner of the premises. 8.33 The time of completion of final C&D is important because for some diseases the earliest date of country freedom is dependent on the completion of final C&D. Restocking is also dependant on the completion date. 8.34 In cases where final C&D cannot be safely or economically completed (dangerous structures, for example), depending on the disease, the premises may remain restricted and not allowed to restock until AHVLA is satisfi ed that sufficient time has elapsed for the infectious agent to have become inactivated naturally. 629 Valuation and Compensation 9.1 In most instances when an animal is culled for the control of an exotic notifiable disease, Defra must pay compensation (fair market value or part thereof) to the owner of the animals. Several acts of legislation provide for this requirement. Some legislation dictates a statutory am ount of compensation is required without valuation. Depending upon t he disease and legislation, there may be instances where animals which are infected with di sease are not compensated for or are compensated for at less than market value. 9.2 It is the Secretary of St ate's duty to arrive at an appr opriate value and for this purpose engages an accredited valuer to va lue the animal(s). AHVLA holds and maintains a list of approved valuers that it will in struct to value the animal(s). This list is subject to an annual review. There are certain instances where valuers are not required and Valuation Rate Cards (mainly for poultry systems) are used. These rates are updated quarterly. However, valuer s may still be required to value rare or specialised breeds of birds. Disputed Valuations 9.3 Within 14 days of receiving a valuati on, animal owners have the opportunity to dispute it. Their appeal, including the reasons for disput ing the valuation, must be provided in writing to AHVLA. At their own expens e, the owner may use their own valuer to re-value the animals in questi on as supporting evidence for their appeal against the original valuation. Any appeal will be processed by the NDCC and may then go to arbitration or for expert determination. Monitor Valuers 9.4 Defra has appointed Monitor Valuers to ensure that valuations are fair, equitable and consistent and to ensure t hat Government does not pay excessive compensation. These appoint ments are reviewed on a regul ar basis, at least every three years. Monitor Valuers may vi sit LDCCs as necessary and provide: Advice on instructions and guidance to be issued to valuers with the aim of ensuring fairness, uniformity and consistency of valuations; A review of valuations on request, incl uding cases for arbitration or expert determination; Advice, should it be needed, by a valuer while undertaking a valuation; and Advice concerning valuers who may appear not to be abiding by instructions or whose valuations appear to be over or under market value. 9.5 However, Monitor Valuers will not be able to over-rule valuations already made and issued to animal owners. 63European Commission 9.6 For many diseases the European Commission provide a subsequent contribution (co-financing) towards the compensation paid to the owners of culled animals and other specific activities at the affected premises. There are strict guidelines and deadlines wh ich must be followed by authorit ies in order to obtain the full contribution available. The European Co mmission reserves the right to scrutinise the methodology applied to reach the val ue of the animals and claims may be disallowed if a member state cannot demons trate that compensat ion rates meet the strict guidelines for co-financing. 6410 Vaccination Overview 10.1 Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) a nd Classical Swine Fever (CSF) are diseases where vaccination is identified in the disease control strategy. Therefore, the decision on whether to vaccinate or not will be considered at the earliest possible opportunity if either disease is confirmed. 10.2 When considering the role of vacci nation, there will be many uncertainties about the behaviour and characteristics of the disease, its origin, the length of time it has been present in the country, its prev alence, the degree of geographical spread and the risk of undisclosed infection as a result of secondary spread. 10.3 In the face of such uncertainties, t he decision on whether to vaccinate or not will need to take account of the following: The EU legal requirements governing vaccination; Veterinary and epidemiological advice; Availability and effi cacy of the vaccine; The location of any proposed vaccination zone to achieve an effective outcome; Whether the vaccine can be administered in sufficient time to sufficient animals to be effective in controlling spread of the disease; Whether there are tests to disti nguish between vaccinated and infected animals; Animal welfare; Stakeholder views; The effects on tourism and rural businesses, and Costs and benefits to the economy. 10.4 The decision taken may need to be revi ewed if additional information becomes available such as, for example, spread of disease to previously unaffected areas. 10.5 Vaccination is disease specific and in accordance with EU requirements, emergency vaccination plans have been pr epared for FMD and CSF detailing the procedures and vaccination strategies (e.g. vaccinate to live; suppressive vaccination (vaccination to kill)) that would be adopted if a decision to vaccinate was taken. Preparations in England 10.6 As required under Foot and Mouth Disease Directive 2003/85/EC, Defra has appointed a vaccination contractor to impl ement any future vaccination programme for FMD within England. The contract, whic h runs until May 2012, also includes the potential to undertake the vaccination of FMD susceptible species against other exotic diseases for which vaccination is required, under the di rection of AHVLA. 6510.7 Under the terms of the contract, the c ontractor is required to be operationally ready to implement the vaccination progra mme within 5 days of being mobilised. To arrive at this state of readiness, they have 150 teams of train ed lay vaccinators (450 staff) ready to provide assist ance from the outset. Further to this, some 75 veterinary surgeons have been recruited to check for disease prior to vaccination and to direct the work of the lay teams in the field. 10.8 A detailed emergency vaccinatio n plan for FMD can be found below. Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD) - Emergency Vaccination Plan Background 10.9 In accordance with the provisions of EU Foot and Mouth Disease Directive 2003/85/EC, to move emergency vaccination from a measure of last resort to the forefront of disease control strategies and thus enhance the capacity to respond to an outbreak, the following prov ides an overview of the operational capability to implement an emergency vaccinati on programme within England. 10.10 A vaccination contractor has been appointed to implement any future vaccination programme under the direction of AHVLA. As part of the management of the FMD vaccination operation a set of St andard Operating Proced ures (SoPs) has been developed which sets out the roles and re sponsibilities of those involved in implementing an effective vaccination programme. 10.11 AHVLA has also agreed a Health and Sa fety Policy which incorporates the need for the contractor, their employees, sub and external contractors to comply with best practice and all relevant provisions, w hether statutory or otherwise, relating to health and safety at work, including biosecurity protocols. Specific Health and Safety training must be provided for all staff. 10.12 In addition to the Health and Safety policy, an AHVLA team exists to deal specifically with Health and Safety related issues. This team will produce risk assessments for pre-vaccination visits by vets, for on-farm vaccinators and handling facilities, and maintain the necessary documentation for this. Delivery arrangements Accommodation 10.13 The contractor will prov ide 3 portable forward vacci nation centres capable of being relocated to areas of the country w here vaccination services are required. Contingency arrangements have been put in plac e to use markets, local airports and transport depots to house vaccination centres. Equipment 10.14 The contractor is required to suppl y, store, distribute and maintain the necessary equipment to support the vaccinat ion programme. Stores Managers have 66been appointed to maintain these stores and contracts are in place to allow for the replenishment of stocks within 48 hours. 10.15 AHVLA will remain responsible for t he maintenance of call-off contracts for ear tags, tag applicators and mobile handling facilities. Vaccine Supplies 10.16 The UK has its own stocks of 8 different strains of FMD antigen, in total over 8 million doses, held on its behalf by a commerc ial supplier. In addition, the EU Vaccine Bank holds a wide range of antigens for emergency use. All antigens are administered according to their authoris ed marketing authority and the number of doses available and strains are kept under re view. AHVLA has call-off contracts in place with the supplier for the delivery of vaccine to the vaccination centre including maintaining the cold chain throughout t hereby ensuring vaccine is not adversely affected by temperature variations. Lay Vaccination 10.17 To ensure that emergency vaccinati on can be implemented without delay in any future outbreak, Statutor y Instruments have been creat ed to allow non-veterinary personnel to handle and administer FMD vacci ne. The Orders specifically permit vaccine to be supplied to and administered by lay vaccinators who meet specified eligibility criteria, thus reducing pressure on veterinar y resources during an outbreak. Process 10.18 In the event of a confirmed outbreak of FMD, AHVLA will convey the scope and policy of the vaccination pr oject to the contractor a nd confirm the approach to be taken (including the vaccine delivery arr angements). AHVLA will also keep the contactor informed of all suspect and confi rmed cases as they occur and inform them of any changes which may affect field operations. 10.19 If the decision to vaccinate is taken, a Vaccination Zone will be set up, and a Vaccination Surveillance Zone, of at least 10 km in width, surrounding the Vaccination Zone will be designated. The c ontractor will be supplied by AHVLA with a complete list of holdings within the Vaccination Zone and identify those with animals that require vaccination. 10.20 The contractor will then contact farmers to arrange pre-va ccination visits by veterinary surgeons appointed by them for th is purpose. The visits will check animal handling facilities and will also inspect animals for clinical signs of FMD. 10.21 Where clinical signs of FMD are i dentified, the teams will be withdrawn from the farms and the agreed biosecurity protoc ols must be followed. Vaccination teams would then enter a 72 hour quarantine period bef ore being redeployed. 10.22 Where FMD is not found during the pre vaccination visit, vaccination teams will be deployed to carry out vaccination, record animal identification numbers, collect 67and return records. Vaccinated animals will be ear-tagged in a manner outlined in the FMD (Control of Vaccinatio n) (England) Regulations 2006 and advised by Defra. 10.23 For identification purposes, vaccinat ed cattle will have their details recorded on the cattle passport and their current premises noted on the AHVLA Disease Control System (DCS). 68Decision Tree for the Use of Emergenc y Vaccination During an Outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) Figure 6: Decision Tree Stamping out of Infected Premises and epidemiologically linked holdings onlyCan disease be eradicated using stamping out only?Is vaccination possible?Are there additional culling strategies?

NoYes 69Classical Swine Fever Vaccination 10.24 Vaccination would not normally be cons idered as a control measure in the current Classical Swine Fever control strate gy. CSF vaccination is restricted by legislation, which states that no person shall administer a CSF vaccine to any pig unless authorised to do so by the Secretary of State. 10.25 However, in exceptional circumstances, emergency vaccination may be considered, for example, w here there was a dramatic increase in the number of premises being confirmed each day or in ar eas of very high pig density areas during a prolonged outbreak. This would need to be approved by the SoS. Since emergency vaccination is not likely to be used in the UK there are currently no operational arrangements in place to mount a wide scale CSF emergency vaccination programme in the event of an outbreak in Great Britain. 10.26 However, in accordance with our obl igations under the pr ovisions of EU Classical Swine Fever Directive 2001/89/EC, a detailed vaccination plan for CSF can be found below Classical Swine Fever (CSF) - Emergency Vaccination Plan 10.27 In accordance with the provisions of EU Classical Swine Fever Directive 2001/89/EC, the following sets out arrangem ents for consideration of an emergency vaccination programme. 10.28 Both the EU Directive and our domes tic legislation permits the use of vaccination as a disease control measure in certain circumstances. The primary disease control measure that would be ado pted would be a policy of culling infected and dangerous contact pigs. The option to use vaccination would be considered regularly by the CSF Expert group at its m eetings and would take account of Annex VI of Council Directive 2001/89/EC which list s the main criteria and risk factors to be considered for the decision to apply emergency vaccination in pig holdings. 10.29 A decision to use emergency vaccinat ion would therefor e be considered in any of the following circumstances: Disease had become well established in the country and there was a dramatic increase in the number of premises being confirmed each day; Disease was established in an area with a high density of pigs e.g. East Riding of Yorkshire and or Humberside; The predictions from disease modele rs and epidemiologists suggest that it would take more than 2 months to bring the outbreak under control; and There was a shortage of rendering or incineration capacity such that infected animals or other animals being culled could not be processed after being culled. 10.30 If emergency vaccination was to be adopted, the CSF expert group would consider the extent of the geographical area in which the emergency vaccination is carried out and would make recommendations to the CVO. They would also make recommendations on the categories of pigs to be vaccinated and the duration of the 70vaccination campaign. The latter would be affected by the number of premises to be vaccinated and the availability of vaccine. 10.31 In evaluating potential vaccines it is imperative that t he vaccines used are effective and rapid at stimulating a good pr otective immunity in the vaccinated animal. It is also important that a vaccinated animal should not become infected when challenged by a field virus as such an animal may not develop clinical signs but be infectious to other animals as the fi eld virus replicates and contaminates the environment. It is also essential that a vaccine should prevent congenital infections via the trans-placental infect ion of field virus which could result in persistently infected carriers and shedders of field virus. 10.32 There are two types of vaccines curr ently available - the live attenuated and the sub-unit vaccines. Of t hese, the live attenuated type is better at stimulating a rapid immune response. The sub-unit vaccines induce a slow immune response and need two vaccinations to produce full protection. This effectively means that the sub- unit vaccines are not suitable for use in em ergency conditions due to the slow onset of immunity and the need for tw o vaccinations to induce full protection. In addition, both these vaccine types reduce clinical signs and mortality but do not prevent infection. Vaccinated pigs are therefore still capable of shedding infection and, in the case of sows, of producing persistently infected piglets. 10.33 At the present time the only CSF va ccines which are authorised for use are two sub-unit vaccines. These vaccines we re authorised by the European Medicines Agency. There are no live attenuated vaccine s approved for use in the UK. In an emergency situation the CVO would ther efore need to assess the risks and benefits of using the authorised vaccines for emerge ncy use in relation to the perceived risks of using the unauthorised conventional product which has demonstrated better efficacy in terms of onset of immunity and prot ection. Given this, it is likely that GB would only use suppressive vaccination to c ontrol the disease. This means that vaccinated pigs would be marked and then culled. This is necessary due to the fact that vaccinated pigs are still capable of shedding infection so would be a source of disease for other pigs in future. 10.34 The choice of vaccine to be used would be reviewed regularly by the CSF Expert group as they evaluate any new marker vaccines that are produced and marketed and have tests which can effectivel y differentiate between an infected but non-vaccinated animal, a vaccinated but non-infected animal, a vaccinated and infected animal and a non-infect ed and non-vaccinated animal. 7111 Recovery Phase 11.1 The recovery phase is a complex and l ong running process that involves many agencies and participants. It is vital to invo lve the affected community in the recovery process from the outset of any emergency to enable an efficient and rapid return to normality. 11.2 One of the key elemen ts of the recovery phase following an outbreak or incident of exotic notifiable disease is to have a clear strategy and plan to demonstrate absence of disease. This is essential to ensure normal trading can be resumed as quickly as possible following an outbreak. The stra tegy to restore 'disease freedom' to Great Britain and Nort hern Ireland must be considered at the same time as developing the disease control strategy as the two are interlinked. 11.3 During the recovery phase, and in certain circumstances, animal products which may be destined for export may have to undergo specific treatments e.g. heat treatment, deboning, maturing and marking wit h the EU oval health stamp, before being allowed to be exported. Depending on the disease, th e duration of the outbreak and its extent, a serological surveillance programme may be required to demonstrate that the country is free from disease before disease free status could be granted. After this programme has been completed, a certain period of time must lapse without further cases of disease before country disease free status is restored as detailed in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code which sets down rules for recovery of disease free status. The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code 11.4 OIE on behalf of its Member Countries produces the Terrestrial Animal Heath Code (The Code) which is formally adopted at the annual general assembly of all Delegates of OIE Members. Th e aim of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code is to assure the sanitary safety of internationa l trade in terrestrial animals (mammals, birds and bees) and their products. This is achieved through the detailing of health measures to be used by the veterinary authorities of importing and exporting countries to avoid the transfer of pathogens to animals or humans, while avoiding unjustified sanitary barriers. The Code se ts out, amongst other things, the detailed requirements to claim Count ry freedom from particula r animal diseases. The delegate member of the OIE fo r the UK is the CVO (UK). 11.5 The Code is now an integral part of the regulatory system established by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for trade in animals and their products. Veterinary authorities are encouraged to base their import health measures on the OIE standards. In the EU many of the current measures ar e also based on the OIE standards. Whilst there is no spec ific legal obligation for EU member states to follow the OIE standards, should a complaint be m ade to the WTO, failure to comply with the standards could have serious imp lications for the country concerned. 72 73Controlled Restocking 11.6 The controlled restocking of animals onto premises which have had affected animals culled and disposed of is an integr al part of the recovery phase. Depending on the disease, restocking is not permi tted until a defined number of days have elapsed following final (secondary) cleansing and disinfection. With certain diseases there is controlled restocking where limited numbers of animals are allowed on the premises (sentinel animals) and observed to ensure disease is no longer present. In some cases, samples are taken from these sentinel animals for laboratory testing to ensure that disease no longer exists on the premises before all restrictions are lifted and the premises allowed to restock completely. For some diseases, or in the event of prolonged outbreaks, or if final cleans ing and disinfection is not possible the restocking of a premises may not be possible for several months. Scale Down of the Disease Control Response 11.7 As part of the recovery phase it will be necessary to scale back on resources once certain parts of the outbreak or in cident management response are completed. These decisions will be agreed between the CVO UK the NDCC Director of Operations, the CVO(s) fr om the affected country or countries and the Chief Executive of AHVLA. 11.8 In England, the CVO (UK) and Head of JCC in the National Disease Control Centre (NDCC) will decide when it is appr opriate to de-escalate and reduce the schedule of NDCC meetings (including birdt ables). When operations are at a sufficiently low level, the CVO (UK) and Head of JCC will agree the timing of the closure of the NDCC. 11.9 In Scotland the Rural and Enviro nment Director on advice from the CVO Scotland will decide when it is appropriate to de-escalate and reduce the schedule of Disease Strategy Group (DSG) meetings. In Wales the CVO Wales in discussion with the Operations Director Wales, the Head of Exotic Animal Diseases Branch, veterinary advisers, the Assembly Resilience Co-ordinator and in consultation with the Director of Operations in the NDCC will decide when to de-escalate and reduce the schedule of Emergency Control C entre (Wales) (ECC (W)) meetings. 11.10 The Civil Contingencie s Secretariat in the Cabinet Office has produced 'Recovery Guidance' in respect of Animal Health and Welfare which "}
