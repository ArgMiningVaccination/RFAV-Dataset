Our services include Relaxation/Meditation, Gentle Yoga, Reiki, Jin Shin Jyutsu, Massage and Wellness Programs. Gentle Yoga involves stretching and strengthening the body along with the use of breathing to bring about mental clarity and enhance well-being. It has been shown to combat some of the side effects of cancer treatment, such as anxiety and fatigue. Jin Shin Jyutsu is a form of Eastern energy healing. The practitioner applies slight pressure with the fingertips on 26 safety energy locks along energy pathways in the body, allowing for any blocked pathways to open up. This helps restore the natural flow of energy in the body, which allows the body to access its natural healing ability. Massage is a method of manipulating the soft tissues of the body to relieve tension and restore function. It is a useful tool in stress management. Our massage therapists have specialized training in cancer massage. In our Meditation/Relaxation Group, response exercises are used to calm the mind and body. Research shows that the use of these techniques can have a profound effect on one's immune system and ability to heal, and also significantly lower stress. Our instructor teaches a different technique each week so that participants can find what works for them and begin a home program. Reiki is referred to as a Universal Life Force Energy. It uses this energy as a natural healing method which helps restore and balance the body, mind and emotions. The healing energy is activated by the light touch of the Reiki practitioner. It flows through the hands of the Reiki giver to the receiver. Reiki increases the body's ability to heal itself, reduces side effects from medications and lessens fatigue.
