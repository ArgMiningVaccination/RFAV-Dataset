This step-by-step program was designed specifically for people like you, to help you get started on your healing journey, or take yours to the next level. Led by holistic patient advocate Adrienne Nolan-Smith, BCPA, and the filmmaker behind the famous Heal Documentary, Kelly Noonan Gores, A Roadmap to Healing is an 8-week program drawing from everything we have learned from hundreds of experts we have interviewed, the latest research and science, Adrienne's patient advocacy private clients and certification, and the thousands of members of our communities who have shared their successful healing stories with us. The tools we have found to be the most effective for healing chronic health issues are easy to learn but more challenging to implement and do consistently, so our step-by-step 9-module approach introduces and helps you work on each critical aspect of a successful healing journey, one at a time. At the end of this program, you'll have all the tools and resources you need to become the CEO of your health and create an environment in your body and your mind that is optimal for healing. NAVIGATING HEALTHCARE & BEING HEARD If you don't feel heard or listened to in the conventional healthcare system, if you're ever afraid to ask or tell your doctor things because he or she seems unconcerned, dismissive, or even belittling, if it doesn't feel like a partnership with your desires taken into consideration, if your doctor doesn't appear to care much about whether you actually fix your chronic health issues, just that your symptoms are managed...you are not alone. This is the experience we have heard from hundreds of people we have interviewed and experienced ourselves. On the other hand, the integrative and holistic medicine world can also be challenging to navigate, with many treatments and therapies not covered by insurance, many different kinds of practitioners, lots of questionable sources on the internet, and many conflicting opinions (Be vegan! Be paleo! Buy this supplement!). This confusion can create overwhelm and make you feel hopeless that you'll ever actually heal your chronic condition or reverse your symptoms. The truth is: you don't need to put up with the time-consuming, expensive healthcare or the \"sickcare\" system. Living with the chronic symptoms or condition you have now is not inevitable. You have the tools now to live a long, disease-free life, you just need to know which ones to harness, and put them to work.

WE'VE BEEN THERE As various chronic health issues came up for Adrienne and her family, she struggled to navigate the conventional healthcare system and integrative medicine world to get answers. She found the lack of communication, empathy, support, transparency, and a holistic approach in the conventional system to be disheartening. Separately, she has found success healing and dramatically improving chronic illness and symptoms in her own life with integrative and naturopathic medicine. Looking back on these experiences, she wished she had known more about what the body needs to heal itself and how to harness your inner power to do those things, while at the same time navigating the conventional healthcare system to get what you need from it. Kelly has had her own set of healthcare experiences for herself, her friends, and her family that caused frustration and didn't get to the root of her chronic issues. She's also seen her body's own immense healing capabilities when she took a more holistic approach to heal chronic symptoms she experienced.

HEAR WHAT PAST PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS HAVE TO SAY \"I thought the course was very high-standard and high-quality with up-to-date information. Exceptional content with great interviews. Very professional but laidback at the same time. What I liked best was the feeling I was able to get from both of you about how much you care and are passionate about health (not only yours but everyone else's as well). I am so pleased I bought the course so I can go back and learn more each time. Thank you! - Sheila J \"I really loved the program, it was very thorough and balanced in presenting information to empower people to take control of their health. I was inspired to really consider how I think about food, products, and my environment. I am a nurse and have seen firsthand how the medical system treats symptoms rather than root causes and focuses on disease rather than prevention.\" - Kathryn K PROGRAM CURRICULUM Module 1: Introduction to A Roadmap to Healing Our approach to designing this program, belief system around healing, statistics on chronic disease and the conventional healthcare system, how wellness and healthcare can come together, what the research shows really works for successful healing, clarifying and setting your goals and intentions for the program, what to expect from the program Module 2: Getting to a diagnosis and the root causes of health issues Understanding your genes, symptom tracking, the role of intuition, medical gaslighting, how to advocate for yourself, most common root causes of health issues, defining the different types of holistic doctors, how to find good doctors who listen and take a whole-body approach, things to look for when evaluating a doctor, questions to ask your doctor, which tests to get and how to track and understand them, insurance overview and how to get things reimbursed Module 3: Reducing Your Toxic Burden and Inflammation The seven stages of disease and the concept of toxin accumulation, your body's natural detoxification process in the healing phase vs. healed phase, the places you'll find the most toxins in your daily life, how to ensure your home environment, food, products aren't full of toxins increasing your burden, understanding invisible disruptors and reducing exposure to them.
