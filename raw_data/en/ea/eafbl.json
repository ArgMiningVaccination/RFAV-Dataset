Its vaccination rate, [one of the highest in the world](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html), makes it a particularly interesting place to look at the incidence and severity of breakthrough infections. Covid-19 vaccines were first administered in Iceland at the end of 2020; by mid-July, [every resident](https://www.icelandreview.com/ask-ir/whats-the-status-of-covid-19-vaccination-in-iceland/) over the age of 16 was offered a shot. Yet tests show an alarming number of domestic [Covid-19 infections](https://qz.com/re/coronavirus) are still happening with the onset of the delta [variant](https://qz.com/india/2033950/indias-third-wave-of-covid-19-depends-on-vaccines-and-variants).

Since the [pandemic](https://qz.com/re/pandemic) began, there have been 8,738 infections and 30 coronavirus-related deaths reported in Iceland. The country managed to control the virus relatively well and has reported only one death in 2021, on May 25. That there are hardly any deaths accompanying the rising case count is a good sign. The data show that vaccinated people who are getting the virus are generally recovering without serious illness. Iceland provides a case study for how an effective [vaccine](https://qz.com/re/vaccines) rollout perhaps doesn't guarantee herd immunity but [prevents](https://qz.com/2042410/how-effective-masks-are-against-the-delta-variant) hospitalizations and deaths.
