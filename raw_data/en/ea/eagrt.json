The potency of the venom changes with the type of jellyfish and also is stronger during some seasons than in others. Other things that affect the severity of your reaction include: - Your size, age, and general health. - The location and how much of your body (surface area) was stung. - The size or number of jellyfish or tentacles that stung you. The pain from jellyfish and Portuguese man-of-war stings may be intense and may last for several hours. The skin at the site of the stings may look dusky or bluish purple. Blisters and deep sores ( [ulcers](/ulcer)) may develop. Healing is generally a slow process that may take many weeks. Permanent scars may occur at the site of a sting.
