Across the nation, tens of thousands of hunger relief agencies play a critical role in nourishing their communities, by providing food for millions of people. In an ideal world, everyone would have access to balanced meals that meet their individual health and nutritional needs. Unfortunately, this is not the case for millions of Americans. The number of people facing food insecurity surged during the first year of the Covid pandemic, and it has not let up since then. The need for food aid is growing at historic rates. Two and a half years after the onset of Covid-19, 80% of food banks continue to report either an increase in or steady demand for emergency food services, according to a recent report from Feeding America. The organization supports a vast network of more than 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries across the country. Unprecedented Demand Historically high inflation, combined with significant jumps in food prices over the last year, are only exacerbating longstanding food access issues that predate the pandemic. According to data from the US Department of Agriculture, the percentage of food-insecure households increased to 14.8% in 2020, up from 13.6% in 2019. This increase disrupted a decade-long downward trend. I witness this surging demand on a regular basis at North Valley Food Bank, the food pantry where I work in rural Montana. In 2022, overall visits to my food pantry increased by a massive 81%, compared to 2021 \u2014 and that was after the spike in demand we experienced in 2020, in the immediate aftermath of the first Covid wave. This year, we've served hundreds of first-time visitors who never needed to use a food pantry prior to 2022. This situation is not unique to our community. All across the country, food banks are reporting unprecedented levels of need. Some, like the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, which serves families in the Monacan Indian Nation in central Virginia, are serving ten times more people than they were prior to the pandemic. Feeding America's 2021 annual report states that nationwide, food banks and related programs are serving 55% more people than they were before Covid. Individuals who rely on emergency food programs are unlikely to get all the nutrients they need through diet alone. Healthy food can be especially hard to find in low-income neighborhoods, and in rural areas where grocery stores may be few and far between. What if people seeking food assistance could also pick up vitamins, minerals, and other types of dietary supplements while receiving groceries from food pantries and other food aid agencies? If handled properly, this could be an excellent way to help people fill their nutritional gaps. The question of whether to distribute supplements is a very real and practical one for people working in the field of food relief. Unfortunately, there are no uniform national guidelines on this issue, and the reality is very few food banks and pantries distribute supplements. HER Nutrition Guidelines Given the high prevalence of chronic disease among food bank users, there have been several important initiatives to encourage good nutrition within food aid programs. But at best, they have been ambivalent about inclusion of nutritional supplements. In 2019, a national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation called Healthy Eating Research (HER) convened a panel of experts in the nutrition, food policy and charitable food distribution fields. The group issued a final report in March of 2020 entitled, Healthy Eating Research Nutrition Guidelines for the Charitable Food System. The report contains evidence-based nutrition recommendations tailored specifically to the needs and capacities of food assistance programs. Its authors aim \"to improve the quality of foods in food banks and pantries in order to increase access to and promote healthier food choices.\" The HER recommendations draw from various nutrition ranking systems created for use within nonprofit, government, and private sectors. They also incorporate federal guidance from the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Food and Drug Administration's food labeling rules and regulations. \"Many items moving through the charitable food system are shelf-stable, highly processed foods that tend to be high in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars,\" the report acknowledges. Therefore, the HER nutrition guidelines focus primarily on limiting fat, salt and sugar content. The HER system is designed to help food banks\u2014and the people who visit them- evaluate the nutritional quality of the products they distribute. Based on their ingredients, food products fall into one of three HER guidelines also address a small category of nutritional products that don't receive a formal ranking. \"Food banks and food pantries often receive miscellaneous items, such as protein powders, nutritional supplements, and baby food,\" the authors state. \"These items are not ranked as they are considered necessary only for specific populations or when treating specific disease states.\" The report goes on to say, \"It is important to note that these miscellaneous products are by and large not appropriate for use by the general population. Rather, they should be reserved for clients with specific nutritional needs or conditions.\" Though the HER guidelines do not categorically dismiss these products, they do not rank or recommend them. In my experience, it is not unusual for North Valley Food Bank and other programs like ours, to receive donated supplements of all kinds. The products come to us from food retailers and distributors, food drive collections, individual donors, and other channels. To Distribute or Discard? When dietary supplements arrive at our facility, we're faced with the hard question of what to do with them. Most food banks and pantries look to large national organizations like Feeding America for guidance around product safety and distribution. In general, Feeding America follows food handling rules set forth by ServSafe. Administered by the National Restaurant Association, ServSafe is the gold standard food and beverage safety training program for restaurant and other food service employees. In 2014, Feeding America partnered with ServSafe to create a Food Handler Guide for Food Banking. It provides extensive instruction on receiving, handling, storing, and assessing the quality of products food banks acquire either through purchase or donation. The guide does address the safe handling of certain kinds of medication. One brief section explains how to assess over-the-counter (OTC) medication safety, and instructs food handlers to check with their individual programs to determine whether OTC products are permitted for distribution. It also states that potentially dangerous products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine should never be distributed at any program site. But this guide includes no mention of any type of dietary supplement. In the absence of rules specifically addressing supplements, each food aid organization must determine for itself how to handle these products. In my region, for instance, the Montana Food Bank Network (MFBN) has its own internal nutrition policy. The policy states that MFBN \"does not accept or distribute OTC medications, alcohol, energy drinks, dietary supplements, vitamins, baby food, or pet food.\" Unmet Nutritional Needs Community food pantries like mine usually follow the nutrition policies set forth by our regional food banks. This means that at my program, when we receive donations of high-quality dietary supplements, we cannot distribute them to customers. That remains true even when the donated products are manufacturer sealed, undamaged, and well-dated. Sadly, this is a lost opportunity. Many individuals are deficient in certain vitamins and minerals, and they rely on dietary supplements to stay healthy. But the costs of good quality multivitamins, as well as more specific supplements, can add up quickly. People seeking food assistance are less likely to have extra cash to spend on \"luxury\" items like supplements. Federal food programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) should, in theory, act as the first lines of defense against malnutrition for low-income Americans. However, the benefits that qualifying households receive don't necessarily address all the dietary needs of people living in food-insecure households. The average benefits that SNAP participants receive equal around $4 daily per person, or approximately $1.40 per meal. That doesn't go very far given today's food prices\u2014especially for healthy foods. It's challenging for many households to meet each family member's food needs on just $4/day, particularly in the current economy. To complicate matters further, SNAP and WIC recipients cannot use their benefits to purchase vitamins or other supplements. These \"non-food\" items are explicitly ineligible for coverage under SNAP and WIC. Recipients can, however, use their benefits to pay for snack foods which are often laden with sugar, salt, unhealthy fats, and a host of colorings, preservatives, and other chemicals with potentially negative impact on health. They can also use SNAP/WIC for \"non-alcoholic beverages\" including sodas and other soft drinks. The net result is that individuals and families who struggle to meet their nutritional needs, and who could potentially benefit from dietary supplements, must often go without them. Safety Concerns Supplements aren't a magical cure-all for the myriad health conditions that food bank customers live with. And there are a number of legitimate safety concerns regarding supplement use. Some argue that because we should be able to derive all essential nutrients directly from food sources, there isn't actually a valid need for dietary supplements. Others suggest that using supplements encourages people to skip meals. In my experience, those who access food assistance programs often skip meals anyways \u2014 and not by choice. So that argument is moot. There are sometimes issues with supplement quality and purity. Food pantries like mine often receive donated products that are at or nearing their \"best by\" dates. Depending on the product type, a supplement that's past its \"use by\" date may be less potent or less effective than it was when initially packaged. People with compromised health might not want to take a chance on an outdated product. Typically, food bank staff aren't qualified to make recommendations about health or medical products to their clients. \"Some medicines, vitamins and other supplements poured down the drain or flushed down the toilet may pass through wastewater treatment plants. They may enter lakes, rivers and streams which are often used as sources for community drinking water supplies. Wastewater plants are generally not equipped to routinely remove medicines and supplements.\" Instead of dumping them, the Agency outlines a multi-step process to appropriately label and dispose of unwanted medications and supplements. Proper disposal involves mixing products with \"undesirable substances,\" packaging them inside disposable containers, and placing them in the trash as close to garbage pickup time as possible. In the trenches, guidelines like these just create more toil for the people working in understaffed yet overwhelmed food banks and pantries. Dietary supplements create a real conundrum for food aid agencies. On the one hand we see their potential for helping people improve overall nutritional status, while on the other we are aware of the potential problems. Currently, there are no easy answers. Seeking Creative Solutions We're also hopeful that the topic of food insecurity is receiving some formal attention at the federal level. In September 2022, the Biden administration hosted the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. It was the first time in over half a century that the event took place. The initiative's stated goal is to \"End hunger and increase healthy eating and physical activity by 2030, so that fewer Americans experience diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension.\" The conference included hundreds of conversations, listening sessions and surveys of food-insecure individuals from across the US. The strategy that emerged from the White House conference includes several promising objectives, including a project aimed at \"Integrating nutrition and health, including by working with Congress to pilot coverage of medically tailored meals in Medicare; testing Medicaid coverage of nutrition education and other nutrition supports...and expanding Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries' access to nutrition and obesity counseling.\" The Biden-Harris plan also projects an expansion of \"incentives for fruits and vegetables in SNAP; facilitating sodium reduction in the food supply by issuing longer-term, voluntary sodium targets for industry; and assessing additional steps to reduce added sugar consumption.\" But in keeping with a decades-long policy of exluding supplements from federal programs, the new initiative makes no mention of them other than to state that, \"FTC (Federal Trade Commission) has indicated that it will pursue targeted law enforcement actions to prevent the deceptive advertising of foods and dietary supplements, including deceptive advertising that might be targeted to youth.\" We'll be watching closely as the White House lays out its vision for ending hunger and reducing diet-related chronic disease in the months and years to come. Whether nutritional supplements will eventually have a place in policies that aim to alleviate hunger and improve nutrition remains to be seen. At the moment, that seems doubtful. Game Changers It is painfully clear here in northern Montana that winter is by far the most challenging time of year for many families experiencing food insecurity. With more people now accessing our services than ever before, we've developed some creative strategies to help feed our community. Through the MFBN, we participate in a regional program called Montana Hunters Against Hunger. This program allows hunters to donate legally and ethically harvested deer, elk, antelope and other wild game to our food pantry. We then process and package the meat on site and distribute it directly to our pantry clients. It provides our clients with an incredible additional source of nutritious, local, and cost-free lean protein during the Fall and Winter months. Elsewhere in the country, other organizations run similar wild game donation programs. The Anne Arundel Economic Development Corporation's Hunt Down Hunger venison program benefits a local food bank in the state of Maryland. A large CSIRO study of a commercially available krill oil supplement showed that patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) obtained modest but meaningful improvements in knee pain, stiffness, and physical function after supplementing with krill oil. Krill (Euphausia superba) \u2014 a diverse group of small marine crustaceans \u2014 are among the world's most abundant species in terms of total biomass. Researchers estimate there are 300,000 million metric tons in the Antarctic Ocean alone. Like fish, krill are rich in the inflammation-reducing eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA). Patients with the highest levels of inflammation at baseline\u2014as indicated by elevated baseline C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels-experienced significantly greater improvements in knee pain following krill oil treatment than those with low or medium degrees of inflammation at baseline. Omega-3 supplements generally, and fish oils in particular, are known for their anti-inflammatory effects. Numerous fish oil studies offer evidence of its ability to quell inflammation. The literature on krill oil, however, is far less robust. The CSIRO team, headed by Dr. Welma Stonehouse, proposed that krill oil could impact OA-related pain via similar anti-inflammatory mechanisms observed for fish oil. Their randomized, placebo-controlled trial took place at four clinical sites across Australia over six months. It included 235 healthy adults between 40 and 65 years of age. All participants had clinical diagnoses of mild to moderate knee OA and habitually consumed low amounts of long-chain (LC) omega-3 (-3) fatty acids in their diets. None used fish oil supplements. The investigators split the participants into two groups: a treatment group receiving 4 grams of krill oil per day (4 one-gram capsules), and a control group that took a vegetable oil placebo. Participants were instructed to take the assigned capsules with or immediately after a meal. The krill supplement-a popular Australian retail brand containing the Superba BOOST manufactured by Aker BioMarine-provided 1 g krill oil (E. superba oil; 0.15 g EPA, 0.07 g DHA) and 0.11 mg of astaxanthin per capsule, totaling 880 mg of -3 and 45 mg astaxanthin daily. According to the investigators, the recognized dosage at which EPA in combination with DHA typically exert an anti-inflammatory response is >2 g per day. They point out that 73% of the EPA and DHA in Superba krill oil is phospholipid-bound, which they suggest would \"facilitate more efficient incorporation of long-chain -3 PUFAs into tissues than triglyceride form.\" Owing to fact that the -3s are phospholipid-bound, \"krill oil's anti-inflammatory effect would be greater than what would be expected based on its long-chain -3 PUFA content alone.\" The 4-gram daily dosage was deliberately set higher than the levels used in prior knee OA studies, \"so as to facilitate an anti-inflammatory response, but in amounts suitable as a complementary medicine.\" Supplementation with krill oil translated clearly into an increase in blood -3s levels, as indicated by changes in the OmegaQuant Omega-3 Index\u2014a measure of -3 content in red blood cell membranes. In the krill group, participants' mean Omega-3 Index increased from 6.0% at baseline to 8.9% at 3 months and to 9.0% at 6 months. In the placebo group, on the other hand, the levels did not change, with Omega-3 Index measurements remaining between 5.4% and 5.5% throughout the study. Reduced Pain & Stiffness The CSIRO researchers assessed OA severity at baseline, three months, and six months, using a visual analog self-assessment scale. They quantified changes in knee pain, stiffness, and physical function using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scales. The krill and the placebo groups both showed some degree of improvement of knee pain over the course of the trial, but, the krill group showed a greater decrease. The difference in adjusted mean change between groups at 6 months was 5.18 (95% CI: 10.0, 0.32; P = 0.04). Closer analysis indicated that patients with the highest levels of inflammation at baseline\u2014as indicated by elevated baseline C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels-experienced significantly greater improvements in knee pain following krill oil treatment than those with low or medium degrees of inflammation at baseline. Compared with the placebo group, the patients taking krill oil also showed greater improvements in knee stiffness and physical function. The difference in adjusted mean change of WOMAC scores between the two groups at 6 months was 6.45 for knee stiffness; 4.67 for physical function; and -4.83 for total knee score. All of these changes were statistically significant. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of need for NSAIDs. Safer Therapies Needed Though krill oil cannot be considered a \"cure\" for OA, the results of the Stonehouse study do hold promise for patients who suffer from OA-associated joint inflammation and pain. OA is a major cause of chronic pain and disability worldwide. While conventional drug therapies\u2014typically NSAIDs-may provide some symptomatic relief, they do little to quell the underlying drivers of inflammation. Stonehouse and colleagues note that, \"Owing to the adverse effects associated with long-term NSAID use, there is a need to identify alternative therapies that can safely and effectively reduce pain and inflammation and improve function.\" Krill oil differs structurally from other dietary sources of -3 in that it delivers a relatively high amount of -3 PUFAs in phospholipid form rather than triglyceride form (the primary source of EPA and DHA in fish oil). Preliminary research suggests that the -3s in krill oil might have a higher bioavailability than those in fish oil. There's some evidence that krill's higher relative phospholipid content could facilitate -3 incorporation into the tissues more efficiently than fish oil. Krill also confers the additional inflammation-lowering benefits of astaxanthin, a naturally occurring red pigment that acts as an antioxidant. Astaxanthin exists in only a handful of natural sources, including salmon, shrimp, trout, crayfish, algae, and yeast. Closing the Research Gap The CSIRO trial is the largest, longest, and highest-dose krill oil study to date, at least in the context of OA. The main result was a significant increase in Omega-3 Index to 9% after 6 months, which translated into a modest but significant reduction in knee pain and stiffness, and improvements in physical function of affected joints. Prior to the CSIRO trial, studies of krill supplementation and OA were mostly small, short, and used very low krill dosages. In addition to confirming krill oil's anti-inflammatory properties, the CSIRO data showed that it is remarkably safe. There were no worrisome adverse events during the 6-month trial period. Further, the patients taking the krill oil did not report any of the undesirable effects sometimes linked to fish oil, such as \"fish burps,\" flatulence, diarrhea, or bleeding/vascular complications. Krill oil is also free from the strong fishy aroma associated with fish oil supplements that some people find unpleasant. That said, krill oil is not suitable for individuals with shellfish or seafood allergies. Since it is from an animal source, it is not an option for strict vegans and vegetarians, and since it is derived from crustaceans, it is not appropriate for people who follow the Kosher dietary restrictions. By design, the Australian researchers recruited patients with mild to moderate knee OA for this trial, but excluded those with more severe conditions. That decision was based on the view that severe knee OA, \"may be beyond the point of improvement with a supplement or may require high doses of NSAIDs that may mask any supplement effect.\" For patients with milder, early-stage OA\u2014in whom there is a possibility to reduce knee pain and improve function, krill oil supplementation is a promising option. \"People who suffer from chronic elevated uric acid tend to harbor unhealthy biomes,\" says neurologist David Perlmutter, MD. In his latest book, Drop Acid: The Surprising New Science of Uric Acid, Perlmutter presents several studies showing that adverse changes in the gut microbiome directly relate to our ability to metabolize and eliminate uric acid (UA). Understanding the intricate interplay between hyperuricemia and the gut microbiome is still a relatively new field of research. But it has already led to some interesting discoveries. \"Gout bacteria\" Scientists first documented the well-known relationship between high UA and conditions like gout and kidney stones long ago. More recently, investigators began identifying unique patterns of \"bad\" gut bacteria in patients with gout, kidney stones and kidney disease. \"We know that elevated uric acid favors pro-inflammatory types of bacteria in the gut,\" Perlmutter told Holistic Primary Care. A \"very characteristic type of dysbiosis\" occurs, for instance, in patients with gout, an auto-inflammatory disease. Gout is marked by disordered purine metabolism, which results in chronic hyperuricemia as well as microbiome changes. Some refer to the microbiomes of hyperuricemiapatients as \"gout bacteria.\" \"We know that elevated uric acid favors pro-inflammatory types of bacteria in the gut. \"A very characteristic type of dysbiosis\" occurs in patients with gout. David Perlmutter, MD In a 2016 study, researchers compared the intestinal microbiota of healthy individuals and of gout patients. They identified 17 specific bacteria associated with gout. Using that data, they were able to predict diagnoses of gout with almost 90% accuracy, simply by analyzing gut microbes (Guo, Z et al. Scientific Reports. 2016; 6: 20602). This team developed the Microbial Index of Gout (MiG) based on their findings. The gout microbiome closely resembled that of patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Healthy individuals, on the other hand, showed a separate and distinct gut microbiome profile. Guo and colleagues contend that their MiG model is more reliable than the typical UA blood tests physicians use to diagnose gout. They propose it as a novel non-invasive diagnostic tool for early detection. UA in the Gut So what does uric acid have to do with gut bacteria? In healthy humans, around one third of all UA in is excreted through the gut. The rest is eliminated mainly via the kidneys. An over-accumulation of UA in the intestines can influence microbiome composition, encouraging the growth of pro-inflammatory strains. Certain intestinal microbes play important roles in metabolizing both UA and purines. Organisms in the Escherichia coli group, for instance, can secrete xanthine dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in purine breakdown. One of the natural byproducts of purine metabolism is uric acid. Many common foods contain purines, including alcohol and some types of seafood and meat, all of which hyperuricemic patients should avoid, or at least minimize. \"We know that elevated UA is associated with increased gut permeability. And that's really very important, because so much research has revealed relationships between intestinal permeability and various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.\" David Perlmutter, MD Other kinds of intestinal flora promote uric acid metabolism, improve its excretion, regulate UA absorption and secretion in the gut, and moderate intestinal inflammatory responses. A 2022 review indicates that beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli have UA-lowering effects that target the intestinal tract (Wang, J et al. Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 2022; 62(14): 3979-3989). UA Linked to Leaky Gut High UA damages the intestinal lining. This further \"pav[es] the path toward systemic inflammation,\" Perlmutter explains. Breaks in the intestinal wall allow food toxins and pathogens to exit the gut and enter the bloodstream. Once in the blood, those toxic elements can \"[trigger] an aggressive and often prolonged immune response.\" \"We know that elevated UA is associated with increased gut permeability. And that's really very important, because so much research has revealed relationships between intestinal permeability and various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.\" \"Even in my field of neurology, we see strong relationships with gut permeability to things like Alzheimer's, autism, depression, and even amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It's no wonder that researchers are now documenting a strong association between hyperuricemia, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and immune disorders,\" he added. While it's clear that elevated UA induces changes in the microbiome, the reverse might also be true. \"Changes in gut bacteria may be responsible for elevation of uric acid as well,\" Perlmutter says, pointing to experiments on animals treated with antibiotics. The drugs induced changes in the animals' gut bacteria that then lead to UA elevations. Experiments in humans have explored fecal microbial transplants (FMT) as a treatment for both acute and recurrent gout. \"FMT leads to a significant reduction of uric acid immediately after the treatment and decreases the frequency and duration of acute gout attacks.\" LUV Your Gut According to Dr. Perlmutter, \"there's a lot you can do to nourish the health of your intestinal microbiome.\" In Drop Acid, he presents the \"LUV\" (Lower Uric Values) Diet, designed in part to foster a healthy gut microbiota. One of his top recommendations is to add prebiotic-rich foods to your plate. \"Prebiotics are like fertilizer for your microbes, helping them grow and reproduce.\" Many prebiotic foods also inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme required for making UA. This is the same enzyme targeted by allopurinol and febuxostat, the two main drugs for treating gout. Eating fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains that contain prebiotics provides the \"double benefit\" of encouraging good bacteria and tamping down UA production. Fiber\u2014especially inulin, found in many familiar vegetables like onions, leeks, artichokes, and asparagus\u2014slows the release of sugars and cultivates a healthy microbiome. Inulin is not digested or absorbed. It instead acts as a prebiotic, remaining in the bowel and allowing certain beneficial bacteria to thrive. Because inulin has \"long been found to enhance the composition of the gut bacteria,\" it is abundant in the LUV Diet. Probiotic-rich fermented foods including kimchi, kombucha tea, and cultured yogurt are also great for gut health. Probiotics decrease inflammation and improve metabolism of sugar and UA. For some people, probiotic supplementation may be appropriate as well. Avoid Microbiome Disruptors Sugar substitutes such as saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame can disrupt the microbiome in ways that favor dysbiosis, blood sugar imbalances, and an overall unhealthy metabolism. \"It's important to avoid anything that interferes with your body's ability to break down and filter compounds and toxins, and that includes sugar substitutes,\" Perlmutter cautions. He also suggests reinforcing good gut bugs by avoiding foods that contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and eating organic whenever possible. Ultimately, whatever path we take to get there, \"the sooner we can drop acid to healthful levels and support the strength and function of our guts' microbiomes, the sooner we can usher in better health,\" Perlmutter urges. Conventional medical wisdom holds that uric acid is a harmless, inert form of metabolic waste, and most physicians were trained to see it as a \"trivial, incidental byproduct of our normal biology.\" But contemporary research reveals that this compound is \"anything but meaningless or unworthy of our attention,\" says neurologist David Perlmutter, MD. Though UA testing is included in routine blood work, most people\u2014unless they have gout or kidney stones- haven't heard of it, and few can recite their UA levels the way they do with their lipid profiles. Physicians themselves often ignore UA, or cast it aside as an \"innocent bystander,\" says Perlmutter. Most learned that UA is problematic only when it reaches the excessive levels that cause gout and kidney stones. In reality, a UA rise is far more than just a risk factor for gout or kidney problems. \"Above 7 mg/dL is when UA begins to precipitate in the blood and form crystals. That obviously has relevance as it relates to gout and kidney stones. But the cardiovascular risk begins at a level of 5.5 mg/dL\" Drop Acid draws on the work of Dr. Richard Johnson, a University of Colorado nephrologist who is among the world's uric acid experts, and who guided Dr. Perlmutter in developing the book. It lays out a strong case that \"asymptomatic hyperuricemia\" driven largely by excessive fructose intake, precedes the development of elevated blood glucose, hypertension, dyslipidemia, weight gain, and chronic inflammation. This is not a new concept. More than a century ago, a Scottish physician named Alexander Haig recognized a connection between elevated uric acid levels, and conditions like migraine, depression, epilepsy, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Haig published a book on this in 1896, but his ideas failed to impress his medical contemporaries who insisted that uric acid was harmless except at extremely high levels. Haig was obsessed with dietary purines as the main driver of uric acid elevation, and he advocated a highly restrictive \"purine-free\" diet that eliminated all meat, legumes, and many common vegetables. Drop Acid, which Dr. Perlmutter wrote with longtime collaborator Kristin Loberg, has a different focus and takes a gentler approach. It states that in our current society, fructose is a far more important culprit than purines. The book's \"LUV (Lower Uric Values) Diet\" emphasizes fructose reduction. While it does recommend reducing purine-rich meats and fish, the LUV Diet does not entirely eliminate them. Uric acid \"sits at the heart of regulatory mechanisms involved in our most fundamental processes of metabolism,\" says Perlmutter, who is also author of Grain Brain, and several other best-sellers. Drop Acid urges practitioners to rethink everything they learned about UA, and to recognize that rising UA is a danger sign that we should no longer ignore. Holistic Primary Care spoke with Dr. Perlmutter following the publication of Drop Acid. Here are some highlights from our interview: HPC: As you note in Drop Acid, the standard medical definition of hyperuricemia includes only two adverse symptoms: gout and kidney issues. Given what we now know about UA, how do clinicians need to think differently about this compound? DP: Over the years, what's been so fundamentally important for me is understanding what makes a good metabolism go bad. What are the inputs for metabolic mayhem in humans? The reason for my deep wish to understand this is that metabolic disturbances underlie the most pervasive chronic degenerative conditions on the planet \u2014 which, according to the World Health Organization, represent the number one causes of death [globally]. It's not COVID, it's not anything infectious. It is the chronic degenerative conditions as a group \u2014 which are, at their core, related to disturbances of metabolism. That's why anything influencing metabolic health is interesting for me. As a neurologist, Alzheimer's is fundamentally a manifestation of metabolic dysfunction. Alzheimer's, a disease now affecting some 6 million Americans \u2014 which will triple in its prevalence by the year 2050 \u2014 is a metabolic issue. Learning about the manifold mechanistic effects of elevated UA on disrupting metabolism offered a very new and exciting perspective. But beyond that, it's a new and exciting potential tool to help bring people back into metabolic balance.That's huge. That is absolutely the reason we're in the game. To figure out anything that can be beneficial, that we can leverage to help people regain metabolic health. \"It's time we put uric acid where it rightfully belongs, in terms of measuring it and following it over time, as we do with BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and fasting blood insulin.\" There are a lot of new interventions focused on helping people understand and correct their metabolism, and this is certainly one of them. That's what I found so attractive about uric acid. We tend to pigeonhole ideas and think, \"That's what these things do, end of story.\" As in, \"Testosterone is only a male hormone, or estrogen is only a female hormone.\" Well, as a matter of fact, women have testosterone in their bodies, testosterone receptors in their brains. It's very important to keep an open mind that some of the well-defined issues we studied in our education might be worthy of expansion. We've learned that UA elevation is a powerful signal to our metabolism to do some important things: raising blood pressure, raising blood sugar, increasing production of body fat, reducing use of body fat for energy. And finally, reducing our metabolic demand by ratcheting down mitochondrial function. This is significant, because in the context of our evolution, the elevation of UA proved to be an incredibly powerful survival mechanism. It would raise our blood sugar so we could power our intelligent brains when we had no food. It could give us a small advantage \u2014 a superpower, if you will \u2014 to survive during times of food scarcity by increasing our production of body fat. And part of that superpower was to reduce energy utilization by compromising mitochondrial function during times of caloric scarcity. These days, however, those mechanisms remain operative and are in hyperdrive. They are on board 365 days a year, during a time when we have anything but caloric scarcity. We are basically triggering our bodies with this alarm signal \u2014 elevated UA \u2014 to prepare for a winter that never comes. HPC: Once you've identified that a patient has elevated UA, how do you begin crafting an appropriate treatment plan? What role do dietary or lifestyle changes play, and are there cases where pharmaceutical interventions are more or less appropriate? DP: First, as a general rule, we operate under the dictum of primum non nocere, meaning above all, do no harm. That tends to guide our hand to more of the lifestyle interventions on the front end, provided things are not too aggressively disturbed. The first thing we generally do in an individual (with elevated UA) is to look at the diet. That means, first and foremost, reducing the consumption of fructose. Not necessarily fruit \u2014 but the fructose found in condiments, fruit juices, beverages of all kinds, soft drinks, etcetera. Beyond that, we like to add in some nutritional supplements demonstrated in peer-reviewed science to be helpful in terms of lowering UA. These are things like quercetin and luteolin. They target the very same enzyme, xanthine oxidase, as allopurinol and febuxostat-the drugs used to treat gout. Adding in 500 mg a day of quercetin and 100 mg of luteolin, along with dietary changes, often produces a pretty dramatic drop in UA in just a number of weeks. Five Key Supplements for Reducing Uric Acid Quercetin: 500 mg/day mg/day 1,200 mg/day For a person who has resistant hyperuricemia where UA remains significantly elevated after reducing purines, alcohol, and substantially reducing fructose consumption, and after taking quercetin, luteolin, and maybe some tart cherry extract as well, one might well consider a pharmaceutical intervention like allopurinol, a very safe drug. But that is exceedingly rare. HPC: If a patient with high uric acid has to choose which dietary adjustments to make first, what would you recommend prioritizing? DP: Job number one, regardless of where a person lives and what they have access to, is to identify the hidden sources of fructose in the diet. In America, UA levels jumped from an average of 3.5 mg/dL in 1920 to 6 mg/dL in 1970, which perfectly correlates with our increased sugar consumption. Ideally, we could get back to a diet that resembles what people were eating in the 1920s and 30s. It doesn't have to be Paleo. And it's not even so much what they were eating, but what they were not eating. And what they were not eating was sugar, as much. What are the hidden sources of fructose? Fructose is 50% of table sugar. Sucrose is 50-50 fructose-glucose. Fructose is added now via high fructose corn syrup to more than 60% of all packaged foods at the grocery store. Because we like sweet. So, the top five dietary changes to make are: 1) reduce fructose. 2) reduce fructose. 3) reduce fructose. For numbers 4) and 5), we can talk about reducing foods high in purines, reducing the high levels of sodium that people might be eating, and certainly alcohol choices. But these days, it's all about the fructose. HPC: It sounds like a few relatively minor diet and lifestyle interventions can really pack a punch when it comes to reducing UA. DP: That's right. It's time we put uric acid where it rightfully belongs, in terms of measuring it and following it over time, as we do with BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and fasting blood insulin. We need to recognize how we affect it (UA) based upon our lifestyle choices. It's really important, because elevated UA is upstream of all these other metabolic problems to which we're so desperately responding. When you look at the literature, it really hits home. For example, one study appeared in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism in 2009. It was an eight-year study involving about 42,000 men and 49,000 women. The authors found that those individuals who had uric acid of 7 mg/dL or greater during the study had a 16% increased risk of all-cause mortality, or death from any cause. They also had a 39% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, and a 35% increased risk of dying from an ischemic stroke. For every point (of UA) elevation over 7 mg/dL, there was an additional 8-13% increased risk of all-cause mortality (Chen, JH et al. Arthritis & Rheumatism. 2009. 61(2): 225-232). Now, this is a correlative finding. It shows that there is a correlation between elevated UA and in this case, risk of death from any number of factors or diseases. But as we've begun to understand how elevated UA does its damage in the body, we would expect these numbers. HPC: Speaking of the point at which UA does damage, what can you tell us about \"normal\" versus \"optimal\" uric acid ranges? DP: \"Normal\" is defined basically as what is average in a large group of people. And on average today, 88% of American adults have at least one component of metabolic syndrome. That means only one in eight American adults is metabolically intact. A third of American adults is obese \u2014 not just overweight, but obese. And by 2030, which is only eight years away, that number will be 50%. So, we've really got to get away from the notion of being part of the general crowd and wanting to be \"normal.\" Anyone reading HPC wants to know what's best \u2014 and therefore, what is optimal. As that relates to UA, the laboratory norms were developed in the context of gout. What we know is that above 7 mg/dL, UA begins to precipitate in the blood and form crystals. That obviously has relevance as it relates to gout and kidney stones. But the cardiovascular risk begins at a level of 5.5 mg/dL, not 7 mg/dL. We begin seeing significant increases in terms of cardiovascular issues and other issues related to UA at 5.5 mg/dL. So, we really want to be at 5.5 mg/dL or lower. There, people can really seek to achieve longevity, a long healthspan, and importantly, disease resistance. Now that we know what the lifestyle interventions are for lowering UA, it becomes yet another powerful tool in our tool box. Not as an end-all \u2014 it's not as if you're going to be totally at no risk for metabolic issues just because your UA level is normal and you're eating appropriately. Everything works in an integrative way. HPC:It's remarkable how vast the role of UA really is. It's so much more than a gout or kidney issue. DP: It's not your grandfather's uric acid anymore. In the context of our ancestors, it was wonderful that we as humans had this series of mutations that removed uricase \u2014 the enzyme that would have broken down UA \u2014 from our bodies. Genetic changes that began 15 million years ago in our primate ancestors compromised our ability to break down UA. Our UA levels as humans are four to five times higher than the UA levels of other mammals. That proved advantageous for almost our entire time on this planet. Not by making us fat, not by making us diabetic or hypertensive \u2014 but by trending us just a little bit more towards increased body fat. Nowadays, it's far more dramatic. We're turning on the signal [of elevated UA] and it's screaming day in and day out. What was (beneficial) through the lens of our ancestors is now through the lens of modern life a powerful manifestation of what we call an evolutionary/environmental mismatch. We can't change our evolution, and we're not going to be able to change our genome and therefore our physiology anytime soon. But we can change the other side of that relationship: the environment. We can stop triggering a survival mechanism that causes us to lay down more body fat, increases our blood sugar, raises our blood pressure, makes us insulin resistant, increases oxidative stress, decreases mitochondrial function...the list goes on. HPC:Is there anything else you'd like our readers to know about UA? DP: I'll give you a few tidbits. It is really important that we maintain insulin sensitivity. Uric acid threatens insulin sensitivity [by] threatening nitric oxide (NO) production and function. Why does this matter? NO does at least two important things. First, it targets the smooth muscle lining arteries. When NO is active, arteries relax. That improves blood supply. UA elevation threatens that, and therefore threatens blood supply to our most vital organs. It's why there is such a significant increased risk of death from stroke in people with elevated UA. \"Elevated UA is upstream of all these other metabolic problems to which we're so desperately responding.\" Here's something else your readers may not know. The other thing NO is imperative for is the function of insulin. NO allows insulin to exit the artery and bind to its receptor on the cells, where it does its magic in terms of allowing glucose to enter the cells. There, the glucose can be utilized for energy or incorporated into glycogen, keeping glucose levels under control. So, the very fact that UA is elevated threatens to increase insulin resistance, through a heretofore unrecognized mechanism. For our ancestors, it would have been a good thing to be insulin resistant and prediabetic. It allowed them to power their brains with sugar \u2014 with glucose. And it helped them avoid two things: starvation and predation. They could use their very clever brains to find food and avoid being eaten by another animal. Importantly, when fructose is metabolized into UA, it consumes adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The first enzyme in the breakdown of fructose is fructokinase, which converts ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Then, that ADP becomes adenosine monophosphate (AMP). One of the ways [the human body] deals with AMP is to activate AMP kinase (AMPK). When AMP is dealt with by AMPK, some very good things happen in the body. It helps us burn fat for energy, it helps us reduce fat storage, and importantly, it reduces gluconeogenesis \u2014 the production of glucose \u2014 in the liver. We want to do our best to keep AMPK lit up, because it paves the way for health. How do we activate AMPK? Physical exercise. It's one of the most powerful ways. It keeps us healthier, keeps our blood sugar in check, it lets us burn fat. We can also activate AMPK by taking quercetin \u2014 that's role number two for quercetin. We can activate AMPK by taking the drug metformin, which is used to keep blood sugar down in diabetics by reducing gluconeogenesis. But it turns out that AMPK has an evil twin: AMP deaminase (AMPD). The activation of the evil twin does everything opposite. It increases fat storage, increases fat production, reduces fat utilization as an energy source, increases gluconeogenesis, and enhances mitochondrial dysfunction. Our ancestors wouldn't want to always have AMPK activated. They would want to have their AMPD activated as a survival mechanism. A bear getting ready to hibernate is all AMPD. The last thing that bear would want to do is activate its AMPK. It's doing its very best to ratchet down its energy utilization. It's doing what it can to make more body fat and lock it up. That's why it is eating as much fructose as it can, and its UA levels go up. Uric acid, when elevated, shuts down AMPK and activates the evil twin (AMPD). That's powerful, it's fundamental. I think over the years we've learned about ways to activate AMPK \u2014 and now we know what threatens it. It's breathtaking. A massive online survey of more than 5 million Americans shows that political affiliation is a major factor influencing peoples' decisions about the Covid-19 vaccines. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh, in partnership with CMU's Delphi Group, culled and analyzed data on vaccine attitudes from a larger national Covid survey that Delphi runs in collaboration with Facebook Data for Good. A total of 5,088,772 US adults responded between January and May 2021. Invitations to participate appeared at the top of Facebook users' news feeds in early 2021. At the time, Covid vaccine programs were just rolling out. Among other topics, the survey asked whether or not respondents would accept a Covid-19 vaccine if it were offered to them today. Those who answered \"probably not\" or \"definitely not\" were deemed \"vaccine hesitant.\" The questionnaire included questions about race, age, education, health status, geographical location, political preferences, and more. The researchers published their findings last December in the journal PLoS ONE (King, W et al. PLoS ONE. 2021. 16(12): e0260731). A total of 5,088,772 US adults responded between January and May 2021.Vaccine-hesitant individuals were generally younger, non-Asian, and held less than a 4-year college degree. They also tended to live in rural areas, and in counties with higher voting shares for Donald Trump. Vaccine hesitancy was up over 25% at outset of the survey (95%CI, 25.3, 25.5), but it dropped to 16.6% (95% CI, 16.4, 16.7) by May 2021. There were relatively large decreases among Black, Pacific Islander, and Hispanic participants, and also among those who had not gone to college. Within the cohort of vaccine-reluctant people several demographic, environmental, political, health, belief and behavioral characteristics stood out. Vaccine-hesitant individuals were generally younger, non-Asian, and held less than a 4-year college degree. They also tended to live in rural areas, and in counties with higher voting shares for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. They tended to work outside the home, expressed that they weren't worried about Covid, were less inclined to practice social distancing, and had not gotten a flu vaccine in the prior year. Of those who said they would \"definitely not\" get vaccinated, not trusting the Covid vaccine (59.2%) and not trusting the government (51.2%) were the most frequently cited reasons. Roughly half reported a fear of side effects (49.2%) as the reason for not taking the shot. Racial & Age Variables The researchers saw significant differences in vaccine attitudes by race and age subgroups. Intent to vaccinate also rose across all racial groups in the first six months of 2021. Respondents who identified as Black and Pacific Islander showed the largest shifts from hesitancy to acceptance. As of May, those two groups plus Hispanics and Asians all demonstrated less vaccine resistance than Whites. The data showed an interesting convergence of racial and age factors over time. For instance, in May 2021 toward the end of the survey period, young Black adults under 35 years old were more hesitant than Whites in the same age group. That pattern was reversed in people 45 years and older, with older Whites showing greater reluctance than older Blacks. \"There have been racial disparities in every aspect of the pandemic, from how hard different communities have been hit by it to access to healthcare resources,\" said Robin Mejia, special faculty at the CMU Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and an author of the paper. In a press release about the study, Meija said communities of color have experienced disproportionately higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Covid-related hospitalizations, and mortality throughout the pandemic. When vaccines first became available, acceptance varied dramatically across racial and ethnic groups. To Mejia, the overall decline in hesitancy within higher-risk communities is encouraging. Overall, hesitancy decreased by about one-third, from 25.4% in January to 16.6% in May. But those who strongly resisted vaccination at the outset tended to remain adamantly opposed even as time went on. Politicizing Public Health Participants from counties that supported Trump in 2020 showed a notably higher degree of vaccine hesitancy than those from counties with the fewest Trump supporters. This disparity grew wider during the study period. From January through May, Mejia's team identified a \"dose-response relationship\" between relative degree of local Trump support and Covid vaccine hesitancy. Even after controlling for potential confounding variables, those living in counties with the highest share of Trump 2020 votes were 44% more likely to be vaccine hesitant than those living in counties with the lowest level of support for the former president. \"This finding really highlights the politicization of public health recommendations,\" said Wendy C. King, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. Vaccines Aren't Viewed Equally Another interesting finding is that Covid vaccine hesitancy appears to be \"a distinct phenomenon from general vaccine hesitancy among US adults.\" Only 14.7% of Covid vaccine resisters chose \"not liking vaccines\" in general, as a reason for avoiding the shots. That said, the people who had not taken flu vaccines in the past were 3.3 times more likely to express reluctance toward the Covid vaccine. Not surprisingly, people who reported that they were not intentionally avoiding contact with others (aka \"social distancing\") were more likely to be vaccine hesitant. This suggests there's a significant number of people who simply do not believe Covid is a real problem requiring precautions or preventive measures. There was a similar association between hesitancy and working outside the home, indicating that non-vaccinated individuals could be the likeliest to engage in activities with high transmission risk. Experience Mitigates Resistance As millions of Americans got their first Covid shots early in 2021, resistance did diminish somewhat in the months that followed. Overall, hesitancy decreased by about one-third, from 25.4% in January to 16.6% in May. But those who strongly resisted vaccination at the outset tended to remain adamantly opposed even as time went on. King and Mejia point out a small but significant segment of people with deeply entrenched aversions. \"The lack of change in prevalence of the 'definitely not' group implies those with strong feelings about the vaccine are not likely to change easily,\" said King. \"Thinking about how to reach that group and having messaging and incentives that that group will respond to is important.\" Though in general vaccine reluctance correlated inversely with education level, and those with lower educational levels showed high vaccine resistance rates early on, their acceptance rose by the end of the study. In fact, the largest drop in hesitancy occurred among respondents who had obtained no more than a high school education. Among individuals reporting higher education levels, hesitancy rates remained constant across the survey period. The authors note that having time to observe the initial months of the vaccine rollout likely played a role in shifting some groups' attitudes. A Likely Underestmate King and Mejia recognize some gaps in their research due to the study's unique design. They acknowledge that Facebook users who self-select to complete an online survey about Covid may differ from those who chose not to participate, and also from people who do not use Facebook at all. The survey sample also represented people with higher levels of education and higher overall vaccine uptake rates than other studies of the general population. For these reasons, they believe their findings may actually underestimate the true level of vaccine hesitancy. Though in general vaccine reluctance correlated inversely with education level, and those with lower educational levels showed high vaccine resistance rates early on, the largest drop in hesitancy occurred among respondents who had obtained no more than a high school education. 10% of Docs Reluctant A new study published by researchers at Texas A&M School of Public Health revealed a higher than expected level of vaccine skepticism among primary care physicians. This study, fielded in late May 2021, assessed vaccine attitudes among a representative sample of 737 practicing primary care doctors across the US. Data from 625 were included in the published analysis. Slightly over 10% of the respondents\u2014one out of every ten-did not agree that the Covid vaccines are safe, and 9.3% do not agree that they are effective (Callaghan T, et al. Vaccine. 2022) \"We thought it might be a very small proportion of physicians who hold hesitancy about vaccines given that we have lots of evidence of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. However, once we dug into the data, we found that concerns about vaccines in general were far more widespread in the physician population than we might have expected.\" Overall 67.4% of primary care physicians strongly agree that vaccines are safe, and roughly 75% strongly agree that they are effective (75.5%), and important (76.3%). \"We thought it might be a very small proportion of physicians who hold hesitancy about vaccines given that we have lots of evidence of the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. However, once we dug into the data, we found that concerns about vaccines in general were far more widespread\" -Timothy Callaghan, PhD, Texas A&M School of Public Health But Callaghan called the vaccine skeptics \"a non-trivial proportion of primary care physicians.\" As was the case in the CMU general population survey, Callaghan's physician survey also showed strong correlations between political leanings and views on vaccines. For example, adjusting for all other covariates, Callaghan's team found that 78% of those who qualify as \"extreme liberals\" strongly agree that Covid vaccines are safe; among \"extreme conservatives\" that number was 59%. Extreme liberals were 18% more likely than extreme conservatives to strongly agree that vaccines are effective. Politics aside, contracting Covid itself was a big vaccine confidence-killer. Among primary care doctors that had not had the disease, 77% strongly agreed that vaccines are effective. This number dropped to 64% for those who'd had Covid-19. \"Holding all other covariates at their sample means, we find that while the predicted probability of strongly agreeing that vaccines are safe is 70% among PCPs who had not had COVID-19, it was only 54% among those who had,\" reported Callaghan. Though some have their reservations about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, the overwhelming majority of physicians in this survey \u2014nearly 95%-reported that they had been vaccinated against Covid. Many, if not most, work in clinics that required vaccination as a matter of policy. Clashes over vaccine mandates are the latest rifts defining a deeply politicized pandemic culture. In some states, local vaccination rules directly contradict national public health directives, putting hospitals and clinics in the difficult position of determining how to best safeguard patients and staff, amid a shifting landscape of conflicting directives. I am watching one such vaccine mandate war unfold from my adopted home in rural Montana. Here, a new state law makes it illegal for employers\u2014including hospitals and medical clinics-to discriminate against workers on the basis of vaccination status. That rule conflicts with the Biden administration's recently upheld federal vaccine requirement for healthcare workers, putting the burden on hospital administrators to determine which law they're going to follow. Direct Conflict In May 2021, Montana became the first state to introduce legislation banning vaccine mandates for workers. Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) signed House Bill (HB) 702, just months after he assumed office. Codified under Montana's Human Rights Act, the bill defines employee vaccine requirements as \"discrimination.\" It prohibits businesses from imposing vaccine rules on workers and claims to safeguard patients' \"personal and sensitive [healthcare] information\" and medical record privacy. By Fall, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for nearly all workers at facilities that receive federal funds through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). That rule includes hospitals, nursing homes, and other health clinics. Eschewing the CMS vaccine rule could result in major revenue shortfalls if CMS enforces the mandate. That could lead to hospital and clinic closures and, \"drastically reduce access to healthcare services for Montanans . Several health systems throughout Montana promptly announced their intention to comply with the new federal regs. But that puts these networks in direct conflict with Gov. Gianforte and the state's new law. Surging Caseloads Montana has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country: 54% of the state's population of just over 1 million are fully vaccinated as of mid-January. Roughly 3,000 Montanans have died from COVID-19, the third leading cause of death in the state in 2020. Though prevalence and mortality are relatively low compared to more populous and urban states, the pandemic is taking a severe toll on some Montana communities. The state is home to one of the country's largest Native American populations, and COVID was the top cause of death in Montana's native communities in 2020. All-cause mortality among American Indian Montana residents increased by 36% that same year, compared with the previous five years. Last October, when COVID hospitalizations surged, some Montana facilities had to implement crisis of care standards and care-rationing protocols. Hospitalizations are once again rising sharply across the state as Omicron spreads. A Threat to Access More than a half a million Montanans receive coverage through Medicare and Medicaid. Data released late last year indicate that nearly 40% of the state's population relied on the federal programs in 2020. \"Payments received from Medicare and Medicaid help support services available to all of us,\" said MHA president and CEO Rich Rasmussen in a recent statement. CMS funding represents 70% of all revenue at Montana hospitals, and is \"critical to the financial viability and continued operations\" of medical centers statewide. According to the Montana Hospital Association (MHA), eschewing the CMS vaccine rule could result in major revenue shortfalls if CMS enforces the mandate. That could lead to hospital and clinic closures and, \"drastically reduce access to healthcare services for Montanans over 65 years of age, working and low-income families, pregnant women and children, and people with disabilities.\" In other words, elderly and high-risk individuals who already have limited access to healthcare, would have their access further compromised. With the Supreme Court's split decisions\u2014supporting CMS but dashing OSHA-it's now up to individual employers to determine how the final rules impact their businesses. The Court did not explicitly address the question of how, on a practical level, federal rules apply in places like Montana, with conflicting state-level laws. \"Failure to comply (with the CMS mandate) means that CMS could terminate our participation in the program, which will threaten our ability to care for those in our services,\" reported Logan Health, a hospital system based in northwestern Montana. In November, Logan announced that its more than 4,000 employees must be fully vaccinated for COVID by early December in order to continue working onsite. The original CMS deadline for employee vaccinations was January 4. But in courts around the country, officials wasted no time challenging federal mandates. Louisiana and Missouri each filed separate actions questioning the legality of the CMS requirement. District court judges issued preliminary injunctions against the rule's enforcement in November, temporarily pausing the vaccine requirements for healthcare staff. Keeping Up with the Judges Those decisions forced medical centers to suddenly reverse course. Logan Health suspended its staff vaccination plan merely a week after rolling it out. On January 13, the Supreme Court issued a final ruling formally upholding the CMS regulation. It concluded that the Secretary of HHS acted within his authority when he determined that \"a vaccine mandate was \"necessary to promote and protect patient health and safety.\" \"Healthcare facilities that wish to participate in Medicare and Medicaid have always been obligated to satisfy a host of conditions that address the safe and effective provision of healthcare,\" the assenting justices wrote. That includes long-standing rules specifically addressing infectious disease prevention, control, and surveillance within medical settings--regulations created well before the threat of COVID-19. The justices also point out that staff vaccine policies to prevent other diseases are standard practice. \"Vaccination requirements are a common feature of the provision of healthcare in America,\" they write. Healthcare facilities nationwide already require shots against measles, mumps, and rubella, hepatitis B, and influenza as a condition of employment. In a press release shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, MHA's Rasmussen noted that, \"With the CMS COVID-19 vaccine requirement once again in place for healthcare facilities, Montana hospitals will adjust their policies to ensure compliance with the federal law. CMS has asserted this federal requirement takes priority over state and local law.\" But even if Montana's medical facilities do comply with CMS's requirements, other business sectors will abide by the state's mandate prohibition. Without strong federal vaccine standards for workers outside of healthcare, public health policy here and in other states will be governed by a patchwork of regional laws and executive orders. And these policies vary significantly from state to state. A Political Battle Mandates do raise overall vaccination rates. Data from a White House report on vaccine strategies show increased uptake in the vast majority of communities that have implemented requirements. The justices point out that staff vaccine policies to prevent other diseases are standard practice. Vaccination requirements are a common feature of the provision of healthcare in America. Healthcare facilities already require shots against measles, mumps, and rubella, hepatitis B, and influenza as a condition of employment. A recent Axios/Ipsos poll suggests that \"the majority of employed Americans support vaccine and mask mandates in their workplace.\" But while 60% support their employers' vaccine requirements, only 14% are supportive of firing colleagues who do not comply. Even as the Omicron wave engulfs health centers around the country, opposition to vaccine mandates remains strikingly high, especially in Republican-governed states. For some, the rapid spread of Omicron-even among fully vaccinated people-is evidence that the shots are ineffective, and therefore, unnecessary. Twenty states--all with Republican governors--currently prohibit businesses or government agencies from requiring people to prove that they're vaccinated. Some governors are using emergency orders to halt \"proof-of-vaccination\" requirements for entry into restaurants, community events, and public activities. Others, including Montana, ban vaccine rules or \"immunity passports\" via permanent legislation. State laws in Florida ban employer vaccine mandates, prohibit school face mask policies, and impose fines of up to $50,000 per worker on businesses that violate the state's anti-mandate rules, which\u2014in true Orwellian fashion-are described as \"employee health protections.\" The scene is markedly different in Democrat-led states. California, New York, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington permit businesses to prohibit entry of unvaccinated people and allow individuals with proof-of-vaccination to bypass restrictions that apply to non-vaccinated people. Eighteen states are taking a more hands-off approach, neither outlawing nor establishing vaccine requirements. To Treat or Prevent? The Biden administration pushed for a nationwide vaccination-or-test policy for businesses employing 100 or more individuals, via the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The Supreme Court's second January 13 ruling struck it down. Opponents of the OSHA mandate--private businesses and Republican-led states--accused the agency of overreach, claiming that authority to issue emergency public health rules falls under the purview of state and local governments only. Many also argued that the decision to take a vaccine should be a personal choice, not a requirement as a condition of employment. With the Supreme Court's split decisions\u2014supporting CMS but dashing OSHA-it's now up to employers to determine how the final rules impact their businesses. Rather than tightening prevention efforts, including vaccines, some politicians and business leaders are instead promoting a wait-and-treat approach. Their message, in essence, is take no precautions and wait until you catch COVID to do anything about it. That's based in the logic that only a small percentage of infected people will develop severe or fatal symptoms, and that effective therapies are on the horizon. There are indeed several promising new antiviral drugs that could change the course of the pandemic moving forward. While they will undoubtedly help save lives, the myopic focus on treatment overlooks the countless additional lives that could be spared through more intensive prevention efforts. Advocates of wait-and treat are also willing to ignore the overwhelming pressure that ill and unvaccinated COVID patients place on healthcare systems and practitioners. And they fail to acknowledge the staggering number of patients who develop long COVID. Few Walk-Outs A prevailing argument against jobsite vaccine rules is that many employees will quit their jobs, or choose to be fired, rather than get vaccinated. This is an oft-expressed fear in my community, where staffing gaps are a real and chronic concern. Many of Montana's rural counties are officially recognized as health professional shortage areas. Severe staffing inadequacies and limited access to services are perennial problems. COVID simply exacerbated existing issues in rural healthcare delivery. Do healthcare personnel really walk out in opposition to vaccine mandates? Sure, some do so, but not in large numbers. So far, healthcare systems with vaccine requirements are seeing only minimal staff loss. Fierce Healthcare recently published data from 59 hospitals and healthcare networks across the country that have implemented mandates: none report attrition rates of more than 1% of total workforce due to vaccine-related resignations or terminations. Do healthcare personnel really walk out in opposition to vaccine mandates? Sure, some do so, but not in large numbers. Healthcare systems with vaccine requirements are seeing only minimal staff loss. A 1% workforce loss is not nothing, especially in facilities already short-staffed. But neither is it the apocalypse that mandate critics predicted. That 1% walkout rate needs to be weighed against the number of medical professionals temporarily or permanently sidelined by COVID itself. \"A Menace in Work Settings\" Unsurprisingly, some of the country's most prominent medical organizations and experts support the OSHA vaccine requirement. The American Medical Association, American College of Physicians, National League for Nursing, American Public Health Association, and many others signed a joint statement expressing their collective backing of a broad federal mandate. Several also filed an amicus brief opposing legislative efforts to obstruct the requirement. In a January 13 press release, Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh defended the OSHA vaccine-or-test policy, noting that OSHA's current guidance basically just outlines the CDC's recommendations. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 grant OSHA the power to enact temporary emergency standards if \"employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards\" and if such emergency standards are deemed \"necessary to protect employees from such danger.\" According to the judges who backed OSHA's vaccine rule, COVID clearly \"poses grave dangers.\" \"The disease has by now killed almost 1 million Americans and hospitalized almost 4 million,\" they write. \"It spreads by person-to-person contact in confined indoor spaces, so causes harm in nearly all workplace environments...COVID-19, in short, is a menace in work settings.\" With the Supreme Court's split decisions\u2014supporting CMS but dashing OSHA-it's now up to employers to determine how the final rules impact their businesses. The Court did not explicitly address the question of how, on a practical level, federal rules apply in places like Montana, with conflicting state-level laws. Here, it remains technically impossible for clinics to comply with both federal and state law. Administrators and healthcare workers in our state remain in an untenable position. Gov. Gianforte has not yet issued a formal response to the CMS over-ride of his anti-mandate law. With further legal actions surely still to come, a fundamental question remains unanswered: whose health deserves to be protected during a public health emergency? Over the last five years, nearly all of the major information technology companies have launched some sort of healthcare initiative. The COVID pandemic, with its surging demand for telemedicine and rapid exchange of medical data, only intensifed that trend. But some tech giants have learned the hard way that healthcare is very different from other business sectors. Successful or not, Big Tech's healthcare ventures raise profound ethical questions about the uses of personal medical data and the limits of privacy in the digital age. Haven & Hell Haven was founded on the lofty goals of improving healthcare services and lowering medical costs for employees of the three founding companies, an aggregate workforce of roughly one million people. The venture started out strong in 2018, but proved to be short-lived. By early 2021, barely three years after its launch, Haven posted a vaguestatement on its now defunct website announcing plans to disband. Many healthcare analysts have opined on why Haven hit the rocks. CNBC reported that despite the outward appearance of collaboration, \"each of the three founding companies executed their own projects separately with their own employees, obviating the need for the joint venture to begin with.\" Other speculations cite sluggish progress, high executive turnover, lack of \"bold ideas,\" absence of \"strategic clarity,\" and the company's status as a not-for-profit rather than a profit-driven venture. But it might also be that Haven's leaders simply overestimated their own strengths and underestimated the depth of healthcare's quicksand. The hiring of a few medical superstars like surgeon/author Atul Gawande, MD, and former ZocDoc chief technology officer, Serkan Kutan, was not enough to transform an online retailer, an investment bank, and a corporate holding company into a healthcare business. \"A real possibility is that the entrenched complexity of the American healthcare business model proved too daunting to change. As large as these parent organizations are, they still don't possess the economies of scale to tip the balance when it comes to healthcare,\" said Lyndean Brick, president of healthcare consulting firm Advis, in an article published by Fierce Healthcare. Many healthcare analysts have opined on why Haven hit the rocks. Speculations cite sluggish progress, high executive turnover, lack of \"bold ideas,\" absence of \"strategic clarity,\" and the company's status as a not-for-profit. But it might also be that Haven's leaders simply overestimated their own strengths and underestimated the depth of healthcare's quicksand. Moving forward, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase have stated\u2014in perfect corporate-speak-that they will \"leverage the insights\" gained from Haven, and will \"collaborate informally to design programs tailored to address the specific needs of their own employee populations.\" Healthcare on Demand Amazon seems undaunted by the Haven debacle; the company has forged on with several independent healthcare ventures. Earlier this year, it confirmed plans to broadenAmazon Care-a virtual healthcare service previously available only to Amazon employees\u2014to other big employers. Amazon Care was piloted in 2019 as a benefit for Amazon workers and their families in the company's home state of Washington. This Summer, it extended the virtual service to all its US employees. Successful or not, Big Tech's healthcare ventures raise profound ethical questions about the uses of personal medical data and the limits of privacy in the digital age. Aspects of Amazon Care resemble other well-established telehealth services. To begin using the app, patients answer questions about their physical and mental health. Users can then schedule medical visits and chat with nurses or doctors via video or messaging features. Amazon claims employees are typically able to connect with medical professionals in less than 60 seconds. Along with virtual care, the system also provides options for in-person services. Patients can request home or office visits for COVID-19 and flu testing, vaccinations, illness and injury treatment, preventive care, routine blood draws, sexual health services, prescription requests, refills, deliveries, and more. Amazon ambitiously aims to bring its virtual and in-home healthcare platforms to at least 20 major US cities in 2021 and 2022. The company also plans to expand Amazon Care beyond its own employee base by \"supplying\" it as a workplace benefit to other companies. The paradox is that as Amazon strives to be a healthcare leader, it simultaneously faces accusations of unsafe working conditions and employee abuse. During the \"heat dome\" weather event last summer, indoor temperatures at an Amazon warehouse in Washington state allegedly reached 90 degrees. Despite the extreme heat and lack of adequate climate control, workers were asked to move as quickly as possible to \"boost productivity,\" theSeattle Times reported. This follows many prior charges from Amazon employees who've described unhealthy working conditions while being treated \"like robots.\" Beyond Amazon Care Amazon Care is not the tech titan's only foray into healthcare. Its most recent is a direct-to-consumer at-home COVID-19 test kit. Last Spring, the Food and Drug Administration issued anEmergency Use Authorization for Amazon's real-time RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Customers can now order these Amazon COVID-19 test kits through the company's diagnostics site,AmazonDx.com, by providing the same login credentials used to access its online shopping site. Amazon hinted at further moves into diagnostics, including tests for respiratory infections and sexually transmitted diseases, Business Insider recentlyreported. Last June, Amazon Web Services (AWS) unveiled theAWS Healthcare Accelerator, a four-week \"technical, business, and mentorship accelerator opportunity\" for fledgling digital health companies. The paradox is that as Amazon strives to be a healthcare leader, it simultaneously faces accusations of unsafe working conditions and employee abuse. According to a blog post from Sandy Carter, AWS' vice president of worldwide public sector partners and programs, the Accelerator is specifically focused on startups seeking to \"accelerate growth in the cloud.\" The program is now accepting applications from up-and-comers looking to leverage Amazon's technical and commercial expertise \"to help solve the biggest challenges in the healthcare industry.\" The Accelerator will focus on \"solutions\" \u2014 a favorite tech industry term \u2014 such as remote patient monitoring, data analytics, patient engagement, voice recognition, and virtual care. By using AWS, Amazon says \"organizations can increase the pace of innovation, unlock the potential of data, and personalize the healthcare journey.\" Data Fuels Deep Learning But what exactly is the \"potential\" of data? And who does it really benefit? Among the more revolutionary developments in IT are data-driven \"smart\" machines, which use artificial intelligence to \"think\" and act like humans. One branch of AI, called deep learning, relies on algorithms that mimic the neural networks of the human brain. Like the brain, AI-based machines continually receive and process large amounts of data, and teach themselves new tasks based on what they glean. People across the globe generate huge amounts of data every day, all of which \u2014 when captured \u2014 fuels the deep learning process. The more information the algorithms take in, the better they become at predicting outcomes \u2014 including things like human behaviors, disease progression, and treatment responses. Most of our digital gadgets now rely on machine learning to some extent. Virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri use AI to decipher users' unique speech and language patterns. Driverless AI-guided vehicles learn not only the mechanics of driving, but how to respond spontaneously to unexpected obstacles or occurrences. Whether or not users realize it, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram continuously collect and analyze personal behavioral data. Our data is, essentially, a form of payment to access these \"free\" online services. AI-based programs glean information about our favored activities, habits, aesthetic preferences, socioeconomic status, political inclinations, and our health. Presently, the US does not have comprehensive consumer data privacy regulations governing what can and cannot be done with data that users enter into online apps. Instead, we have a patchwork of inconsistent state-level regulations. Amazon, with its diverse healthcare operations, are no doubt amassing astonishing amounts of medical information. So are most of the high-tech healthcare companies. Big Promises, Big Problems Proponents of AI present it as a powerful problem-solver that helps us overcome the limits of our own brains. Because machines can process much larger quantities of information than can the human brain, AI expands our ability to think creatively and develop novel solutions to serious problems. Tech companies say they use AI to enhance the \"user experience.\" In healthcare, the rationale is usually \"to improve clinical outcomes,\" to \"reduce complexity,\" to \"streamline the patient experience\" or some similar pastel-toned platitude. And there's no question that AI does hold great promise for improved patient care. One of the most exciting medical applications is in the detection of cancer. An article published last year in Nature describes an AI technology \"capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction\" (McKinney, S et al. Nature. 2020; 577: 89-94). The AI system's ability to interpret mammograms outperformed humans in detecting both false-positive and false-negative results. Researchers have also used artificial neural networks to predict the likelihood of recurrence within 10 years following breast cancer surgery. One group posits that accurate predictions by machine learning algorithms \"may improve precision in managing patients\" post-surgery and increase the understanding of risk factors for breast cancer recurrence (Lou, S et al. Cancers (Basel). 2020; 12(12): 3817). But the price for AI-enhanced healthcare is loss of privacy. Flow of Information Take, for instance, AI-driven menstrual trackers. The popular menstrual app,Flo, which is used by an estimated 100 million women, offers what claims to be \"the most precise AI-based period and ovulation predictions by tracking 70+ body signals like cramps, discharge, headaches and more.\" Flo users enter a host of health details related to their menstrual cycles and sexual activity, and the app tracks period symptoms and fertility patterns. The company says it helps users determine whether their cycles are \"normal\" or \"irregular.\" Similarly, Apple iPhones contain a built-in app whose features include menstrual cycle tracking. Applesays the tracker will \"improve predictions for your period and fertility window.\" While menstrual tracking apps might offer benefits like helping couples to either achieve or avoid pregnancy, they also raise significant safety and privacy concerns. In exchange for period-tracking services, patients provide the tech companies \u2014 and potentially others \u2014 with a wealth of very personal information. The price for AI-enhanced healthcare is loss of privacy Researchers have questioned both the reliability of fertility apps and the unregulated nature of the market (Ali, R et al. Repro BioMed Online. 2021; 42(1) 273-281). One study from 2020 looked at 140 different menstrual apps and concluded that while some are accurate and useful, \"many more are of low quality, and users should be wary of relying on their predictions to avoid pregnancy or to maximize chances of conception.\" Some menstrual trackers, including Flo, have significant data privacy flaws and they have been called out for sharing user data despite promises to keep that information private. In 2019, a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that the app shared users' intimate reproductive and sexual health data with Facebook, Google, and other third parties that provided marketing and analytics services for Flo. According to Consumer Reports, analysis of privacy and data security practices of Flo and four other period trackers showed that users receive no guarantee that their data would not be shared with third parties for marketing or other purposes. Following a 2020 complaint, the Federal Trade Commission announced last January that it had reached a settlement with Flo. Among other requirements, it mandates that the company must obtain users' consent before sharing their health information. Lack of Oversight Presently, the US does not have comprehensive consumer data privacy regulations governing what can and cannot be done with data that users enter into online apps. Instead, we have a patchwork of inconsistent state-level regulations. There are data privacy laws governing specific sectors, including healthcare. The best known is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Other laws also regulate electronic health records systems and telehealth technologies. But in the post-COVID world, many of HIPAA's protections have been curtailed. Early in the pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \u2014 the entity charged with enforcing HIPAA \u2014 announced a temporary relaxing of regulations with which healthcare practitioners formerly had to comply. HHS saw the massive need for accessible telehealth services, and rightly recognized that in this public health emergency, HIPAA compliance was an obstacle to the speedy expansion of telemedicine. The agency acknowledged that \"some of these technologies, and the manner in which they are used by HIPAA-covered healthcare providers, may not fully comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Rules.\" Therefore, HHS chose to \"exercise its enforcement discretion\" by refraining from \"impos[ing] penalties for noncompliance with the regulatory requirements under the HIPAA Rules...in connection with the good faith provision of telehealth during the COVID-19...emergency.\" Many telehealth platforms, remote monitoring tools, and health apps are not really HIPAA-compliant. And nearly two years on, the \"temporary\" HIPAA suspensions are starting to feel permanent. Hackers Target Health Data There's no question that sensitive medical data gathered by health apps, telemedicine platforms, and EMR systems is vulnerable to both marketing misuse and cyberattacks. High-profile hacks targeting government agencies and private companies alike regularly make news headlines. Healthcare organizations, from hospitals to health plans to practitioners themselves can be targets of cybercrime \u2014 a threat that's escalated significantly in the past year. HHS indicates a 25% increase in healthcare data breaches in 2020 over 2019, itself a record-breaking year. In 2020, the department recorded thehighest total of large health data breaches -1.76 incidents per day on average-in any year since it began tracking the problem in 2009. Officials have warned medical groups of a rise in hacking attempts during COVID, in part stemming from cybercriminals' efforts to steal vaccine-related research and other medical data. Aware of these threats, some politicians are advocating for tighter federal data privacy and security laws. US Representative Suzan DelBene (D-WA) introduced legislation last March that, if passed, would create the country's first-ever national data privacy standards. TheInformation Transparency and Personal Data Control Act seeks to protect individuals' personal identifying information, including data relating to financial, health, genetic, biometric, geolocation, sexual orientation, citizenship and immigration status, Social Security Numbers, and religious beliefs. It also protects all information pertaining to children under age 13. Further, it would strengthen the Federal Trade Commission's capacity to enforce privacy rights and punish bad actors. That's good as far as it goes. But, notably, the bill does not mention either AI or facial recognition technologies, or the ways in which they capture consumer data. Meanwhile, the use of these technologies\u2014and in some cases, their exploitation-is only accelerating within and beyond the healthcare realm. AI-driven systems do indeed hold tremendous potential to transform medical care for the better. But these advances do have downsides\u2014both predictable and unexpected. It is na\u00efve to think otherwise. If a better night's rest is what you're after, think twice before using a sleep tracker. An abundance of modern health and wellness technologies promise benefits like improved sleep and relaxation. But research indicates that sleep tracking devices can actually reinforce some users' sleep-related stress, making peaceful slumber even harder to attain. Sleep Aids Gain Popularity Of the myriad personal health and fitness gadgets on the market today, sleep trackers are among the most popular. The global market for sleep aids, including devices, medications, special mattresses and pillows, sleep tests and monitors, is already worth billions, and is projected to grow from $81.2 billion in 2020 to $112.7 billion by 2025. The category includes products like reading lights, noise machines, weighted blankets, and even \"smart\" mattresses that monitor sleep quality. Wristbands, watches, rings, and other wearable sleep tracking devices are increasingly common. They analyze features like breathing, heart rate, and movement during sleep. Many devices produce a \"sleep score\" that is conveyed to the user via a smartphone app. For some, sleep trackers provide valuable information that leads to healthier sleep patterns. But in other cases, the devices themselves become barriers to better shut-eye. The patients were so preoccupied with improving their sleep data that their devices actually became obstacles to improved sleep. The patients' inferred associations between sleep tracker data and perceived fatigue fostered a \"perfectionistic quest for the ideal sleep in order to optimize daytime function.\" Not a Luxury As a nation, we struggle to get enough quality rest. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a third of US adults report usually getting less than the recommended daily amount of sleep. Sleep disorders can increase a patient's risk of other health problems. \"Not getting enough sleep is linked with many chronic diseases and conditions\u2014such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and depression\u2014that threaten our nation's health,\" the CDC cautions. Inadequate sleep raises the risk of motor vehicle crashes and mistakes at work, resulting in injuries, disabilities, or worse. \"Getting enough sleep is not a luxury\u2014it is something people need for good health.\" Orthosomnia In recent years, a new kind of sleep disorder has begun to emerge: orthosomnia. The term, coined by Dr. Kelly Glazer Baron and colleagues at Rush University Medical School, basically means losing sleep over getting enough sleep. Baron and her sleep research team describe an increase in patients seeking treatment for self-diagnosed sleep disorders. In a 2017 paper in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, they document a series of cases involving individuals who sought treatment for insomnia or insufficient sleep duration. The patients believed their symptoms correlated with periods of light or restless sleep, based on data they obtained from sleep tracking devices. What the researchers found, however, was that the patients were so preoccupied with improving their sleep data that their devices actually became obstacles to improved sleep. The patients' inferred associations between sleep tracker data and perceived fatigue fostered a \"perfectionistic quest for the ideal sleep in order to optimize daytime function.\" Ironically, fixation on the goal of excellent sleep resulted not in better rest, but in heightened stress and, consequently, lost sleep. The findings suggest that tracking devices may augment anxieties about sleep, or fuel a counterproductive sense of \"perfectionism\" in some patients. (Baron, K et al. J Clin Sleep Med. 2017; 13(2): 351-354). \"Ortho\" comes from the Greek root meaning straight or correct, and \"somnia\" from the Latin for sleep. The authors selected the term because \"the perfectionist quest to achieve perfect sleep is similar to the unhealthy preoccupation with healthy eating, termed orthorexia,\" they explain Data Enthusiasts As health tracking devices continue to gain popularity, their widespread use raises a host of important questions for medical professionals. The Rush paper cautions that one \"challenge for clinicians is balancing educating patients on the validity of these devices with patients' enthusiasm for objective data.\" While sleep trackers do measure several factors related to rest, they aren't nearly as sophisticated as true medical sleep studies, which are based on validated sleep assessment techniques such as polysomnography or actigraphy. Real sleep studies monitor patients' brain waves and analyze sleep cycles, generating data that physicians can use to diagnose disorders like insomnia or sleep apnea. Generally, sleep tracking apps can't do that. Multiple validation studies show hat sleep tracking devices are \"unable to accurately discriminate stages of sleep and have poor accuracy in detecting wake after sleep onset,\" Baron and colleagues report. Yet patients often feel that the data from their trackers aligns more closely with their perceived sense of how well they rested, than the data obtained from a medical sleep study. Challenges for clinicians This gulf can be a big challenge for physicians. Despite sleep trackers' documented shortcomings, patients' fervent confidence about the quality of their devices can be \"difficult to alter.\" \"Consumers are enthusiastic about this technology and often think the data are highly consistent with their experience of their sleep,\" the Rush team writes. This enthusiasm can be an impediment to successful treatment of sleep disorders. Patients with strong attachments to their sleep devices may be tough to effectively engage in interventions like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a common technique for treating sleep conditions. COVID-somnia New research indicates that Americans' sleep health took a turn for the worse last year. Findings from one study show that the number of days participants reported difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or not feeling rested, all increased in 2020 over 2018 levels. Notably, the decline in sleep health was more pronounced in younger adults than in individuals aged 60 or older (Hisler, G & Twenge, J. 2021. Social Sci & Med. 276: 113849). As lockdowns disrupted the usual rhythms of daily life, many people also experienced major changes in their physical activity levels, eating habits, use of electronic devices, and sleep habits. Millions of people started using home health technologies like workout apps or personal training programs in lieu of trips to the gym. Of the 10 most frequently downloaded health and fitness apps in 2020, two of the top four were not workout products--they were sleep and meditation apps. Calm, the number one app, provides programs like guided meditations to help users achieve better quality sleep, lower stress and anxiety, and improve focus. Number four on the list of most-installed programs, Headspace, is another mindfulness and meditation app. In a year marked by heightened stress and uncertainty, it is no surprise that tools promoting relaxation and restfulness rose in popularity. That said, not everyone suffered from worse sleep during the COVID era. Paradoxically, pandemic-induced lifestyle changes like fewer early morning commitments, working or schooling from home, and traveling less often gave many people newfound opportunities to improve the length or quality of their sleep. Several factors--including level of caregiving responsibilities, vulnerability to stress, work schedules, and health status--predict the likelihood that the pandemic resulted in improved sleep health (Gao, C & Scullin, M. Sleep Med. 2020; 73: 1-10). Promoting Good Sleep Hygiene Given the general uptick in sleep disturbances last year, it is crucial that clinicians talk to their patients about the quality of their sleep. The good news is that with the right interventions, sleep disorders are treatable. Start by encouraging patients to use reliable, trusted technologies to track sleep traits. The nonprofit HeartMath Institute, for instance, offers a suite of scientifically validated tools and techniques shown to help patients reduce and avoid stress. The HeartMath systems analyze \"heart-brain communication\" with the goal of balancing users' emotional wellbeing, improving sleep, increasing focus, and restoring energy. Health tech users seeking better sleep should be particularly mindful of their screen time. Simply spending time looking at a phone or laptop screen can itself prevent restful sleep, even if the device is used to access health programming. Digital devices emit blue light, which suppresses the body's natural production of melatonin. Health tech users seeking better sleep should be particularly mindful of their screen time. Simply spending time looking at a phone or laptop screen can itself prevent restful sleep, even if the device is used to access health programming. Digital devices emit blue light, which suppresses the body's natural production of melatonin. Dr. Baron and her team at Rush University warn that individuals who are overly reliant on sleep tracking devices \"may also have other problematic technology use patterns.\" Working late at night, receiving nighttime smartphone notifications or calls, and watching television on a laptop or phone before bed can all interrupt sleep. She also noted that, \"it is conceivable that patients who are highly anxious about their sleep may be tempted\" to log into their sleep applications to check on sleep patterns during the night, though none of the people in her study did so. \"Clinicians should be sure to address poor sleep habits such as phone use during the night that may be exacerbating factors in insomnia and daytime fatigue.\" Some of the simplest strategies for improving sleep hygiene are totally tech-free. Sleep professionals recommend limiting time in bed to a structured 8-hour period, avoiding stimulants like caffeine late in the day, and removing distractions such as phones or televisions from the bedroom. Setting a consistent sleep schedule, following a relaxing pre-bedtime routine, and creating a comfortable sleep environment can also set patients up for a good night's rest. What do the stock market and the immune system have in common? More than you might think. Researchers tracked a small group of finance professionals during a highly stressful period of extreme market volatility. They showed that the heightened stress led to marked shifts in important immune system biomarkers. Participants' physiological reactions to market-related stress resembled the immune defenses typically triggered by physical health threats like infections. If the body's infection defense system responds to financial crisis as if it's a disease, the implications for personal health are vast. More broadly, the authors argue, major market events including crashes and share price fluctuations may even have roots in the financial community's collective physiological response to stress. \" Physiological changes occurring in the financial community shift risk preferences pro-cyclically. This phenomenon caus[es] investors to take too much risk on the upside, pushing a bull market into a bubble, and too little on the downside, driving a bear market into a crash.\" This analysis, published two years before the COVID pandemic wrought global economic chaos, offers a unique perspective for our current times, when millions are facing the dual challenge of economic hardship and immune health concerns. The Biology of Risk-Taking In a 2018 paper posted on Biorxiv, (pronounced \"Bio Archive\") a pre-print service run by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a team of British investigators described the physiology of 15 male traders at a mid-sized hedge fund in the City of London. The study took place near the end of the European Sovereign Debt Crisis, at a time of declining but still elevated market volatility. For two weeks, researchers measured participants' stress and immune responses under real working conditions. They tested for salivary cortisol and four immune system signaling proteins, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-, three times daily. Sampling occurred at 9am, 12pm, and 4pm on business days. Simultaneously, the research team referenced an index of equity and bond volatility to monitor fluctuations in market stability. Not surprisingly, they observed a strong link between market volatility and elevated cortisol, the main stress hormone. During the two-week study period, the volatility index dropped approximately 18%. The traders' average daily cortisol levels also dropped by a strikingly similar 19%. Participants' mean cortisol levels at each daily sampling point correlated \"significantly and positively\" with price changes in Eurostoxx and Bunds, the two main European stock markets. Changes in cortisol lagged behind market fluctuations by approximately one hour (coef. = 0.182, Adj 2 = 0.86, = 0.02, = 30). \"This finding agrees with existing research suggesting that the halflife of an episodic increase in cortisol is approximately 66 minutes,\" the authors noted. The discovery that changes in the market correlate with elevated stress among finance professionals is not on its own a new finding. Neuroscientist John Coates, PhD--one of the paper's authors--showed in a prior study that traders experienced a 68% jump in mean daily cortisol levels as market volatility increased over an 8-day period (Coates, J & Herbert, J. 2008. PNAS. 105 (16): 6167-6172). Like cortisol, the traders' IL-1 production closely mirrored changes in the volatility index. Coates, a former research fellow at the University of Cambridge, was himself a Wall Street trader at one point in his life. After earning his doctorate, Coates worked for companies including Goldman Sachs, and ran a trading desk for Deutsche Bank in New York. After observing the behavior of financial professionals on the trading floor, Coates grew interested in researching the biology of risk taking, gut feelings, and stress. His earlier investigations centered on stress and the activation of the endocrine system in individuals engaging in financially risky behavior. Information Induces Inflammation Coates and his colleagues, based at Cambridge University, identified that the immune system also plays a key role in risk taking. They found that exposure to large amounts of financial information almost immediately triggered powerful endocrine and inflammatory reactions in the body. Coates' 2018 Biorxiv paper posits that high-volatility financial crises offer a unique opportunity to examine the biological response to information overload. In volatile markets, traders endure a constant flow of unsettling status reports and news releases about seesawing securities prices. \"When traders and asset managers around the world read news feeds and observe price changes they become immersed in an environment of nonstop information and surprise, and their physiology tracks it in sympathy,\" Coates and colleagues reported. When market volatility soared, the traders' physiology resembled a typical chronic stress condition. Market stabilization brought a decrease in information exposure and subsequently provided a greater sense of certainty. In turn, participants' immune systems began returning to a more normal state. One of the main immune markers they looked at was the pro-inflammatory molecule IL-1. Coates' research team observed that, like cortisol, the traders' IL-1 production closely mirrored changes in the volatility index. Elevated IL-1 secretion is associated with the presence of inflammatory disease (Kaneko, N et al. 2019. Inflamm Regener. 39(12)). When the market volatility index fell by 18%, daily average IL-1 levels among the traders also decreased by 18%. Within-day IL-1 concentrations shifted in tandem with both market volatility and an index measuring the traders' physiological arousal. These changes resembled the co-occurring shifts in cortisol levels seen throughout the study. IL-1 as First Responder It's not hard to imagine that a stressful experience would kickstart an inflammatory response in the body. But in the London study, a different pattern emerged. The data revealed temporal interactions among cortisol, IL-1, and three other inflammatory cytokines. The traders' IL-1 levels significantly predicted not only cortisol, but also IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- concentrations. IL-1, the authors explain, was acting as a \"first responder,\" initiating a cascade of subsequent immunological and endocrine reactions. This finding echoes earlier studies defining IL-1 as an upstream signaling molecule that sets off a series of other stress and inflammatory responses in the body. Over time, chronic stress and low-grade systemic inflammation can produce a condition called \"sickness behavior.\" Normally a defense against physical pathogens, the Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicinedefines sickness behavior as a \"motivational state responsible for reorganizing an ill individual's perceptions and actions to enable better coping with infection.\" The data revealed temporal interactions among cortisol, IL-1, and three other inflammatory cytokines: IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-. It includes adaptive traits like fever, appetite loss, fatigue, social withdrawal, reduced pleasure-seeking, a heightened sense of fear and-if prolonged-depression. In other words, it's that sick feeling that tells us something is really wrong. Sickness behavior makes sense when a person's immune system is focused on fighting disease. But what happens when the members of an entire professional group all behave like they're ill at the same time? Sickness Behavior: A Market Force? One element of the classic sickness response is a decrease in risky behavior. Coates' group believes that long bouts of systemic inflammation and chronic stress--like what traders experience during periods of high market volatility --might instill a collective sense of risk aversion throughout the financial community. \"Given the high correlations we have found in this and our previous study, we suggest that both cortisol and IL-1 rose during the Debt Crisis, perhaps substantially, and for an extended period of time,\" they write. While it is not possible to retroactively measure traders' cytokine levels as the Debt Crisis unfolded, the researchers believe that chronic cytokine elevation \"would have brought risk-aversion to the financial community and may well have exacerbated the market sell-off.\" Coates and colleagues believe stress physiology has powerful effects on the stability of entire financial marketplaces. \"Our guiding hypothesis has been that physiological changes occurring in the financial community shift risk preferences pro-cyclically,\" they write. This phenomenon \"caus[es] investors to take too much risk on the upside, pushing a bull market into a bubble, and too little on the downside, driving a bear market into a crash.\" By the time the Cambridge researchers reached the trading floor to study their cohort of traders, the crisis in Europe was abating, and the traders' physiology may have been returning to a more \"normal\" state. The reduced stress and inflammatory responses \"could have released the brake on their risk-taking and they, along with the wider financial community, felt emboldened to start buying in the credit markets.\" \"Our findings therefore offer the beginnings of an understanding of what could be called the biochemistry of risk-on, and more generally of the shifting risk preferences that destabilize markets.\" They also point out that inflammation-induced risk-aversion \"could well provide an explanation for the observation that stock markets under-perform during the time of year when seasonal affective disorder occurs.\" October--a notorious month for stock market crashes--maps with the time of year when, in late autumn and early winter, the body's levels of circulating cytokines IL-1, TNF- and IL-6 naturally tend to increase. Defining Financial Wellness There were a number of limitations to the London study, including its small sample size, short duration, and inclusion of male participants only. But the findings do shed light on the flurry of biological responses initiated by uncertain financial situations. Money-related stress, of course, isn't limited to those who work in financial services. If hedge fund traders, who are generally well-off even in the worst of times, show wild cytokine swings in response to market shifts, it is reasonable to extrapolate that these physiological responses are even more intense in people who are struggling to get by economically. For the millions of people who've endured the death of loved ones, job loss, staggering medical bills, and food or housing insecurity over the past year, these endocrine and immune system changes are, no doubt, extreme. If hedge fund traders, who are generally well-off even in the worst of times, show wild cytokine swings in response to market shifts, it is reasonable to extrapolate that these physiological responses are even more intense in people who are struggling to get by economically. Coates and colleagues are not the only researchers to show that personal financial stress has physical ramifications. Findings from a 2016 study by John Sturgeon and colleagues at Stanford University showed that financial stress influences inflammation. Participants exposed to major financial stressors exhibited higher concentrations of inflammatory markers IL-6 and C-reactive protein, which correlated with greater levels of self-reported psychological distress and lower levels of psychological wellbeing (Sturgeon, J et al. 2016. Psychosom Med. 78(2): 134-43). More recently, a 2020 analysis looked at financial stressors within the context of the COVID-19 crisis. Over 3,000 participants were surveyed about their fears related specifically to the coronavirus. Concerns about financial burdens stemming from the pandemic were as troublesome as fears about contracting the virus itself. Respondents worried less about dying from COVID-19, than about being confronted with poverty. Interestingly, female participants generally reported higher overall COVID-19-related worries than males, with one exception: when it came to financial concerns, men and women reported comparable stress levels (Barzilay, R et al. 2020. Trans Psych. 10(291)). It's not yet clear how financial stressors connected to COVID might be affecting our immune health. But if the existing research offers any indication, the pandemic is challenging our immune systems in more ways than we realize. Many American families were already struggling to afford enough food before the COVID-19 pandemic. In the year since the virus hit, millions more are now relying on emergency food assistance to help cover their basic nutritional needs. In rural and urban communities alike, food banks and hunger relief organizations are straining to keep up with the surging demand. The essential lifelines which these services provide for millions of the country's most vulnerable people, are stretched to the breaking point. I bear witness to the realities of poverty and hunger daily, in my role as Operations Coordinator at the North Valley Food Bank in Whitefish, a small town in northwest Montana. Since last Spring, I've watched our food aid lines grow continually longer. Some who access our services are returning users who needed food assistance long before COVID ravaged our economy. But we're also seeing a rising number of people suddenly experiencing food insecurity for the first time in their lives. Progress Undone America's hunger problem is definitely not new, but the coronavirus-induced economic downturn is making it a lot worse. A recent Forbes list ranked Feeding America--the national food aid nonprofit--as the second largest charity by revenue in the US in 2020. According to a Feeding America analysis of COVID-19's impact, more than 35 million people--including nearly 11 million children--lived in food-insecure households prior to the current public health crisis. The term \"food insecurity\" is defined as \"lack access to enough food for an active, healthy life\" for all members. The nonprofit estimates that at least 50 million people in the country, 17 million of whom are children, likely experienced food insecurity in 2020. The COVID-related surge in hunger reversed significant strides made in the decade following the Great Recession. Pre-pandemic data showed a hopeful trend: food insecurity rates had hit a 20-year low. All that has changed significantly since COVID. Leaders in Washington, DC, are at least acknowledging the pressing problem of food insecurity. In his January 14 \"Build Back Better\" speech announcing the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, President Joe Biden said, \"Millions of Americans never thought they'd be out of work. Many of them never even envisioned the idea, are facing eviction, waiting for hours in their cars to feed their families, as they drive up to a food bank.\" Citing Census Bureau data, Biden noted that one in seven American households, and more than one in five Black and Latino households, do not have enough food to eat. That's 30 million adults and as many as 12 million children. \"It's wrong, it's tragic, it's unnecessary, it's unacceptable.\" The Biden administration has promised to extend the 15% increase in food stamp benefits initiated by the Trump administration through to the end of 2021 (it was slated to expire in June); to provide financial assistance to restaurants via the FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act to help them prepare free meals for hungry people; and to commit an additional $3 billion to ensure food security for mothers of young children. In the longer term, the Biden administration promises to raise the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $15 per hour. Given the current state of American politics, all of this relief will likely take months to years before it reaches those who need it. But hunger does not wait, and the lines at the food banks continue to lengthen. Rural Hunger Food banks are the frontlines of hunger relief in countless communities. In communities like Whitefish, and thousands of other rural towns across the country, barriers like limited employment opportunities, low wages, transportation issues, and difficulty accessing far-away resources are common everyday factors that contribute to the hunger problem. In 2019, our relatively small food pantry served approximately 1,300 community members. That number skyrocketed to 4,445 local residents in 2020--representing a year-over-year increase of 243%. Unique visits from residents picking up emergency food at our site jumped from 18,184 in 2019 to 30,498 visits in 2020, up 62%. Those utilizing our services report reduced work hours, job loss, school closures, and COVID-related medical concerns among their primary reasons for seeking food aid. Rural communities seldom make national news. But big cities do--and the stories of overwhelmed urban food programs are making visible our nation's widespread, but previously hidden, hunger crisis. Striking images from across the country depict miles-long lines and hours-long waits at food banks in major metropolitan areas, from Pittsburgh to San Antonio to Los Angeles. Hunger Affects Health Physically and psychologically, health and hunger are inextricably linked. Inadequate nourishment affects the body on a physiological level--and the prolonged stress of wondering where one's next meal will come from takes an added emotional toll. Food insecurity and poor nutrition disproportionately impact many of the same individuals who are at highest risk for serious illness associated with COVID-19, including seniors, patients with chronic conditions, low-income earners, and people of color. The colliding public health and economic crises reveal and exacerbate longstanding health disparities. Unemployment and poverty unevenly affect Black Americans, putting them at greater risk of food insecurity. Black households bring in significantly lower incomes than White, non-Hispanic households, and are more than twice as likely to experience hunger. Families with kids who qualify for free or reduced-cost school lunches have been hit especially hard by coronavirus school closures. In 2019, the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), operated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), provided low-cost or free lunches to 29.4 million children daily at a total cost of $14.1 billion. That was about 8% lower than the peak in 2011, when the program was feeding roughly 31.8 million children. Millions of households that depended on school breakfast and lunch programs to make ends meet abruptly lost access to a vital nutrition lifeline. To fill the gap, many school districts have repurposed their would-be dormant kitchens to produce pre-packaged breakfast and lunch kits available to student-families for pickup at schools and other community sites. Native American communities also experience food insecurity at rates higher than in other populations. As the Feeding America report notes, \"this occurrence is driven by above-average unemployment and poverty among Native Americans, resulting from a history of persistent geographic displacement and damaging federal policies.\" The disparities faced by indigenous communities also increases their vulnerability to the coronavirus. Statistically, Native American communities have a greater prevalence of underlying health conditions including respiratory disease and diabetes, and they are more likely than White non-Natives to face limited access to clean water. Barriers to social distancing may also exist in multigenerational communal or crowded living situations. All of this heightens the dual risk of COVID complications and pandemic hunger. Think Nationally, Act Locally No single solution will, on its own, ameliorate our food insecurity problem. An effective response requires a mix of national programs addressing broad social inequities, and local initiatives tailored to specific community needs. One example of a successful federal level anti-hunger initiative is the USDA-funded Farmers to Families Food Box Program. Established in April 2020 as part of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, Farmers to Families partners with national and regional distributors to purchase staple food ingredients, package them into family-sized boxes, and transport them to food banks and other direct-service community organizations. The food boxes contain fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy items, and meat products from American producers of all sizes. The USDA grant dollars that fund the program are awarded to suppliers impacted by business closures in the restaurant, hotel, and food service industries--a win for both food purveyors and families facing food insecurity. Hunger in modern-day America is rarely a result of famine or crop failure, as was the case in prior centuries. In our time, the problem arises from deeper economic issues, and lopsided distribution. The supply-and-demand mismatch was clearly evident early on in the pandemic. In some parts of the country, food banks and relief organizations were quite literally running out of food and turning people away. In other regions, farmers were destroying their crops, killing off livestock, or letting fruit and vegetables rot on the ground because the wholesale markets collapsed, transportation was disrupted, or workers had gotten sick at the worst possible times. The Farmers to Families program was initially slated to run through the end of June 2020. Since then, its popularity has earned it multiple rounds of extended funding and is still ongoing today. USDA reports that it has purchased more than $3.5 billion worth of food to date. The program is currently projected to run through April 2021. When emergency food resources like the Farmers to Families boxes arrive at regional food banks, it is then up to community-based programs like ours to facilitate their distribution. That can be quite challenging. It's wonderful to receive a huge shipment of food large enough to feed an entire community. But it is not easy to determine how to efficiently and equitably share the resources, and to get that food onto the plates of those most in need. In larger communities, food banks have started using event spaces like football stadiums for massive drive-through food distribution events. Here in Whitefish, connecting our remote neighbors to food aid remains a top priority. With support from a local philanthropic organization, North Valley Food Bank was able to purchase a box truck shortly after shelter-in-place restrictions first took effect. Having our own large vehicle enables us to transport larger quantities of food between agencies, and to reach hundreds more recipients through a new off-site mobile pantry program. We also assist with regular deliveries of Farmers to Families boxes and other food items to aid organizations that serve the nearby Blackfeet Indian Reservation and other remote local communities. On a weekly basis, we continue to serve residents who have never before accessed our services--or any other emergency food assistance--in their lifetimes. And with no clear end to the pandemic in sight, the demand for emergency food will likely endure into the foreseeable future. "}
