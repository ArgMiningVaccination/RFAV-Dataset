When paired with physical activity, good nutrition can help you reach and maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic ailments, like heart disease and cancer, and promote your overall health. 3 Big Benefits of Healthy Eating 1) Everyday Wellness Healthy eating affects how you feel on a daily basis. A balanced diet can help increase your energy level, reduce your risk of obesity, improve your muscle strength and even build stronger bones and teeth.

Recent research suggests that healthy eating can help both the body and the brain. \"A very large body of evidence now exists that suggests diet is as important to mental health as it is to physical health,\" [says Felice Jacka, president of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20150820/food-mental-health#1). \"A healthy diet is protective and an unhealthy diet is a risk factor for depression and anxiety.\" Start Slow but Stay Consistent Don't worry about drastically changing your diet right away. It's better to make gradual, but permanent adjustments instead. For example, you could start by eating a small salad once a day, and then incorporate additional healthy changes in subsequent weeks. What to do to Stay Healthy - Eat breakfast - Drink water - Know your food's Ingredients - Practice mindful eating Over time, you can work to revamp your whole diet to include the right balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins and minerals.
