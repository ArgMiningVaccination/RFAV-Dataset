If anyone has any question about who has been\u2014and is\u2014the wind beneath the wings of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for about the last decade, I can answer it . I t is Heidi Buttner Fordi! She is cel- ebrating her 25th year with AACAP\u2014a milestone for AACAP, and one for any organization\u2014especially in this day and age . W hile it needs to be said that there is something about AACAP that has attracted strong, capable leaders who have endured\u2014our previous executive director, Ginger Anthony, did the job for 39 years\u2014Heidi started at the beginning . S he began as a communication assistant, and quickly worked her way up as a meeting planner; director of meetings; and senior director of meetings, continu-ing medical education, and development before becoming deputy executive direc-tor before assuming the current execu-tive director position in 2012 . As c hild and adolescent psychiatrists, we have a particular interest in what makes someone tick so to speak . W hy are they who they are? As AACAP's president, and one who has been at a number of academic institutions over the years, I can say that what makes Heidi unique is her extraordinary dedication to making things work and making other people look good in the process . I' m sure all of us presidents support that statement, and members (and staff) that work closely with Heidi will second it in a flash . F or the record, though, Heidi comes from a family of service-oriented people . P erhaps that is where the selfless gene comes from . H owever, she started at AACAP because she was looking for an organization that helped children . S he is grateful for the mentorship and advance-ments she received from Ginger . Ne vertheless, in my experience it is rare to find someone who isn't scrabbling for the credit, and who makes sure everyone else is OK before taking care of them-selves . T hat is, of course, what a good parent does and that also defines Heidi who has a husband and two children . Y ou might even say that AACAP is like a third child . O f course, the parent who puts everyone else first before they get to themselves often means they don't get to themselves . I re member meeting Heidi in 2003 when the Annual Meeting was in Miami . I h ad somehow forgotten to make a hotel reservation and was panicking because of course all the rooms were sold out . M y able assistant figured out she was the one to contact, and in a flash, she took care of the problem . I f ound her to say thank you and her response was \"it's the least we can do for all you do for us .\" Th at kind of response, of course, engenders a reciprocal good-will which is really important in running an orga-nization that is dependent on members volunteering their time . T hat is her gift . So , I will use this opportunity to put Heidi at the top of the list and ask her a few questions . Gay e: The obvious question, Heidi: Why have you stayed for 25 years? Heidi: I'm passionate about the critical mission of AACAP and am honored to Gabrielle A. Carlson, MD, President, AACAP, and Heidi Fordi, Executive Director, AACAP support the amazing work of our col- laborative and dedicated members . I' m fortunate to work with talented internal team members who work tirelessly to advance the mission of the organization . Whe n I first joined the Academy, I knew little about association management . I w as fortunate that Ginger provided me with expanded opportunities to grow and experience different roles . H er generous leadership, friendship, and encouragement cultivated my growth and enthusiasm . E arly on in my tenure at AACAP, I had the opportunity to work closely with member leaders around the country through my involvement in the Annual Meeting . I r eceived invaluable mentorship from Dr . B ennett Leventhal and leaders on the Program and Local Arrangements Committees . I l earned much through these collaborations and was officially hooked on the field . In m y current role, I have the rare oppor- tunity to work closely with AACAP's elected leadership . E very two years I develop a strong partnership with our President and learn from each of their leadership styles . S ince I became executive director, I've worked with Drs . M arty Drell, Paramjit Joshi, Greg Fritz, Karen Dineen Wagner, and you . I' m grateful for their (and your) guidance, friendship, and mentorship . E ach day is different and another chance to learn and grow . Gay e: How has AACAP changed/ evolved over the 25 years? Heidi: AACAP has grown tremendously over the last 25 years! Our membership increased from 5,800 to 10,000, our budget grew from $3 million to close to $11 million, and attendance at the Annual Meeting has doubled . T o accommodate such growth, our team increased from 22 to 41 people . W e are still in the building that former AACAP leaders had the wise foresight to purchase, although we've gone from having several tenants to being the sole occupants . W e treasure our home at 3615 Wisconsin Avenue, NW . PRESIDENT'S COLUMN 202 AACAP NEWSOf course, it's more than numbers and dollars . O ur members and staff have all contributed to our evolution . A ACAP has a strong voice\u2014and we use it! We play a vital role in increasing awareness of mental illness and reducing stigma . O ur focus on advocacy has increased . W hen I started at AACAP, we were a 501(c)(3) . W e've since added a 501(c)(6) and politi- cal action committee (PAC) . We v alue our relationships and col- laboration with external organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Psychiatric Association . T he expertise of our members and organization is sought out and valued . Be cause of our talented members and staff, I am confident we will continue to make great progress . Gay e: What are you most proud of? Heidi: I am AACAP's second Executive Director . M anaging the transition from Ginger's esteemed leadership after 39 years was a major accomplishment . W e built a strong team and I am grateful for the leadership of our directors . W e've worked diligently to keep child psychia-try front and center . W e have a solid infrastructure and are experiencing our ninth consecutive year of membership growth . O ur finances are strong, and our reserves are healthy . AA CAP's Annual Meeting is the world's largest gathering of leaders in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry and is a capstone event for our members . M entorship is embedded in all that we do, including our active Life Members Committee and innovative programming for Medical Students and Residents . T hrough the generosity of our donors, our fundraising program has flourished and allows us to support research and a robust awards portfolio . I t is reward- ing to see the commitment of our members and the establishment of the 1953 Society . We s erve as a trusted source for the field, for families, and on Capitol Hill . W e will continue to work hard for diversity, equity, and inclusion in our leadership, staff, and partnerships . I am e specially proud of how our team continues to navigate the challenges of transitioning to a virtual work environ-ment in COVID-19 . O ver the last six months, we've remained responsive and adaptive to member needs and have maintained our commitment to outstanding member service . I t has been rewarding implementing innovative pro-grams that you, Gaye, conceived, such as the Screenside Chats, Virtual Forums, and the Summer Lecture series, all while changing gears to plan for our first virtual Annual Meeting . I' ve never been prouder of our committed and talented staff . T hey've done an outstanding job in all areas of support without missing a beat . I re main committed to professional development . I m aintain my Certified Association Executive (CAE) certifi-cation which allows me to network with colleagues and stay abreast of best practices . Gay e: What do you see/hope for the future of AACAP? Heidi: I am optimistic about the future of child psychiatry but recognize there is much more to be done . A ACAP's leadership, passionate membership, and dedicated staff will continue to build and strengthen our programs and services . A ACAP is stronger than ever because of our expanding community who donate time, resources, and talent in support of our mission . S ome of the areas that I'd like to see us grow include: 1 . I'm i nvigorated by our efforts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion . T his is critical for our organization and especially to the children and families we serve . 2 . We w ill grow our team to best support our members in navigating the evolving professional land-scape, including promoting better understanding of the unique skills and extensive training of child psychiatrists, encouraging practice transformation, and advocating for better reimbursement . 3 . We m ust continue to focus on grow- ing and diversifying our workforce, including offering earlier exposure to the field, exploring alternative shortened pathways to child psychia-try, and improving our researcher pipeline . E xpanding our fundrais- ing programs will help us meet these goals . 4 . We m ust continue the fight to reduce stigma . 5 . We w ill continue to enhance our relationships with other medical and allied organizations and further define our role in organized medicine . We s till face serious obstacles .

H e reports that after getting into an argu- ment with his grandmother\u2014his primary caregiver\u2014over chores, she took away his video game system, which led to further altercation and him threatening to kill himself . F or the past five months, he has spent most of his day inside playing video games, and has not been able to go out for recreational activities or see his friends due to the coronavirus pandemic . Pr oviding care to school-aged children admitted to the psychiatric hospital during the coronavirus pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to explore their personal experiences of stress . T he majority of children who are admitted to the hospital have been sent either because there were concerns for suicidal behaviors, or for aggression and threats to others . A lthough many of these children meet criteria for one or more psychiatric diagnoses (most commonly ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, or an anxiety disorder in school-aged children, and depression, anxiety, substance-use disorders, or psychosis in adolescents and teens), the underly-ing challenges for such children often aren't mental health issues, but rather the environmental and family stressors that produce or exacerbate them . The c hildren in our population have a high prevalence of abuse, trauma, neglect, and/or reside in a family system with significant economic struggles . U nderstanding the reasons for a child's suicidal or aggressive behaviors must include considering the interaction of factors at multiple levels including the individual level (e .g ., p sychiatric ill - ness, neurodevelopmental challenges, or medical illness), the relational level (family, siblings, and partners), the com-munity level (school, work, recreational activities, and social media) and the global level (political, economic, and public health factors) . T he coronavirus pandemic represents a stressor at the global level . Whe n a child is admitted to the hospital, we spend a significant amount of time working to understand which stressors contributed to the child's suicidal or aggressive behaviors . B y understanding the precipitating stressor, we are posi-tioned to develop a meaningful safety plan to be used when the child returns home . S ince the pandemic began, I have seen approximately 300 children in the hospital and to my surprise very few even mention or agree that the pandemic has been a major stressor for them . T he kinds of stressors that children and adolescents have been reporting during the pandemic are the same stress-ors they have been reporting prior to the pandemic: stress about school (e .g ., ma intaining grades, bullying, or social anxiety), conflict with their caregiv-ers surrounding rules, losing access to electronic devices, relationship issues, and changes in the family structure (e .g ., ch anging households, moving, or a family member being arrested) . M ost of these stressors represent challenges that have arisen at the relational level . Cody Roi, DO, and Kim Masters, MD Clearly, the coronavirus pandemic has been a contributing stressor to children, but from their perspective it may simply magnify existing stressors . F or example, the anxiety of starting high school may be exacerbated by not knowing if your classes will go online, be in person, or if the school year will even be completed . H aving your phone taken away as a punishment can feel like a severe depri-vation given inability to leave the house or visit friends due to social distancing and stay at home orders . C hildren who identify their primary stressor as being \"fussed at,\" may find that they are being disciplined more frequently and for lesser offenses as their stressed caregiv-ers struggle to cope with the economic impacts of the pandemic . Re cently there have been lots of families, schools, and organizations requesting resources, materials, and special tools to help children deal with the pandemic . S ome of these materials currently exist and more are sure to come as research builds in this area . B ut while we wait, we should not dismiss existing strategies for supporting children that have proven effective in helping children . The k inds of interventions that have been successfully helping kids for years have continued to help today . W e have been successful in supporting children in crisis during the pandemic using a variety of modalities including CBT, mind-body interventions (breathing practices, guided imagery), art therapy, play therapy, family systems work, psychodynamic interventions, and with the use of medications . W e have found success with these techniques even if there are no adaptations made to include pandemic-specific content . In c onclusion, we, as behavioral health professionals need not defer or be paralyzed while waiting for pandemic-focused interventions . W e currently do have the tools necessary to sup-port children with issues that they are experiencing . T he biggest challenge to helping children with mental and behavioral health needs is not a lack of COLUMNS204 AACAP NEWSCHILD & ADOLESCENT SERVICE INTENSITY INSTRUMENT For more information on CASII, contact the Clinical Practice Program Manager at clinical@aacap.org.www.aacap.org/CASIIresources\u2014rather, it's the challenge of delivering these resources . W e need to be wise about how we allocate our time . F or instance, energy must be put into expanding and developing systems that increase access for families by identify-ing struggling children and getting them connected with resources . A t this time, rather than the focus on pandemic-specific psychological effects, health care providers need to work towards crossing the barriers that impair access to services . The c oronavirus pandemic represents a global stressor which affects many areas of psychological well-being . W hile important to continue to understand the direct effects of the pandemic on pediatric mental health and develop specific materials accordingly, it seems equally important that we not lose sight of helping kids with problems they were facing prior to the pandemic, and which they will likely continue to face after the pandemic . m Dr. Roi is Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at LSU in New Orleans. He works with young children and their families in the acute crisis hospital setting. He teaches a year-long psychotherapy seminar and specializes in play, psychodynamic, and family/systems therapy. His current research projects include looking at the effects of bullying, factors that contribute to the report of auditory and visual hallucinations in pediatric patients, trends in suicidal behaviors, the phenomenology of pediatric trauma, and the use of discourse on social determinants of health as a tool for teaching in medicine. He is the recent recipient of AACAP's Psychodynamic Faculty Training and Mentorship program and is the current president of the Mid-Gulf Council for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Dr. Masters is a consultant at Three Rivers Behavioral Health Services Midlands Campus Residential Treatment Center and adjunct professor in the Physician's Assistant Program at the Medical University of South Carolina; as well as in the Psychiatry Department and the Physician's Assistant program at Wake Forest Medical School WinstonSalem, North Carolina.

Shana is a 15-year-old female adolescent who presented to a community mental health ambula- tory clinic with concerns for inattention, impulsivity, and associated disruptive behaviors . S hana also had a recent history of severe bullying by a group of female peers in school, who report-edly would send young men over to her home to try to attack her . A c omprehen- sive assessment indicated that Shana had ADHD, combined type . S he was started on a stimulant medication and began to do much better in school: impulsiv-ity and aggression at school decreased, and Shana's grades improved . H owever, as time went on, Shana began missing psychiatry and therapist appointments, and her impulsive and aggressive behav-iors began occurring again . S hana also began sneaking out of the house several nights a week and smoking marijuana . S he dropped out of treatment despite her mother's continuing efforts to bring her to appointments . T wo years later, her mother called to set up an appointment stating that Shana had been depressed since the birth of her son six months before and had begun smoking mari-juana again (although she had reportedly stopped during the pregnancy) . S hana's mom stated that Shana had been trans - ferred to an alternative school when she was 16 years old and had been doing much better in school with extra support services . H owever, since having the baby, Shana was now more irritable and much more sensitive to perceived insults, resulting in physical altercations with peers at school . Al though the incidence of adolescent pregnancy is currently at a record low, the United States continues to have the highest rate of adolescent pregnancy in developed countries .1 Adolescent preg - nancy disproportionately affects minority racial and ethnic groups, as well as low education/low income households .1 There is also a relatively high rate of pregnancy in sexual minority women .2 Psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, major depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and substance use disorders, are risk factors for adolescent pregnancy .3 Child and adolescent psychi - atrists have an opportunity to reinforce the importance of safer sexual practices as well as consequences of adolescent pregnancy, including increased likeli - hood of dropping out of high school, living in poverty, rapid repeat pregnancy, and their future child(ren) repeating this cycle .3 There are also physical health risks to pregnant adolescents and their children . Ch ild and adolescent psychia - trists should take care to see adolescents alone and respect confidentiality, unless safety is a concern, and ask about intimate partner violence; contracep-tive/condom use; risky behaviors; and psychiatric symptomatology, including suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and substance use history . A wareness of programs that have been identified by the US Department of Health and Human Services as being effective in Jasmin Scott-Hawkins, MD, MPH, Liwei L. Hua, MD, PhD, and the Adolescent Psychiatry Committee reducing sexually transmitted infections, sexual risk behaviors, and teen preg-nancy in order to refer at-risk youth to these programs is essential .4 Child and adolescent psychiatrists should be famil-iar with these programs so that they can share these resources with their patients . T een pregnancy and repeat teen preg- nancy remain a major public health concern . A lthough efficacious interven- tion programs exist across the country, the need vastly outweighs the supply . A s providers for youth, child and adolescent psychiatrists are poised in a pivotal posi-tion to aid in improving the trajectory of at-risk patients through intervention and education . P articipation and collabora- tion with community-based programs, schools, out-of-home facilities, and primary care providers are critical in joining the effort to promote safer sex and decrease teen pregnancy rates to encourage success in these youth . I n our case presentation, Shana was lost to follow-up and ended up returning two years later to outpatient care as an ado-lescent mother, presenting with similar issues but with an additional diagnosis of postpartum depression . T his presented a new opportunity to address her psychi-atric symptoms, as well as introduce her to community resources, to keep her engaged in school and offer coping skills that would help her seek more positive options for herself and better nurture and provide for her child . AACAP Physician Scientist Program in Substance Use K12 Career Development Award The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) is requesting applications for the AACAP Physician Scientist Program in Substance Use K12 Career Development Award, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) .

H owever, during this time, we should be even more vigilant in asking if patients are engaging in sexual activity and if they are using protection, while con-tinuing to encourage social distancing . C oncerns have also been raised about increased sexual abuse by family mem-bers or others living in the household, as well as increased risk to children on the internet, during this time of isola-tion; 5 it is vitally important that child and adolescent psychiatrists inquire about abuse and safety as well during these unprecedented times .

I n October 2019, a social move- ment emerged to demand social justice and equality in numerous areas, includ-ing health . T his \"social outburst\"\u2014trig- gered by students in the face of 10 Chilean pesos (12 cent) rise in the price of the subway ticket\u2014paralyzed the country . T he demonstrations in the streets turned extremely violent, against the government, but also against private property and anybody who opposed it, generating a severe crisis of legitimacy of all institutions, especially the political system . T his crisis gave rise to a referen- dum for a new constitution, which was postponed because of the pandemic . De mands for greater equality in access to the health system, for mental health, allow us to foresee that the impact of the pandemic on mental health will deepen social unrest and demands on the health system . F or the first time, traditional political opinion polls incorporated questions about mental health and 49 .3 pe rcent of the respondents said that their mood worsened during the pandemic (rage, sadness, fear), although 15 percent perceived that it improved . A co mmission called \"The Social Committee\" made up of government representatives and specialists in health, municipalities, and academics was convened . Wi th the purpose of \"strengthening the country strategy and having a single voice in the fight against the coronavirus,\" this panel incorporated mental health into the national plan to confront the pandemic . G iven the context in Chile, mental health policies in response to the pandemic may play a relevant role in mitigating the deleterious effects on the mental health of the popu-lation, but these would require some coherence with international recom-mendations and with the policy path previously defined by the country, while also considering the ongoing scenario of mobilizations and the broad social demands by the population . COVID-19 on top of the previous Social Crisis has had significant effects in Mental Health: Negative Effects: It has deepened the gap between demand and availability of services . In itially, health authorities focused on ICU beds and ventilators, not considering the crucial need to provide mental health assistance to both patients and medical teams . S o mental health teams and inter- ventions have arrived late and have had difficulty participating as part of an integrative model of health service delivery . Go vernment failed to consult with mental health specialists in considering the need for a social communication strategy that would address anxiety and uncertainty, which would have promoted a more adaptive emotional and behavioral response from the population . Positive Effects: As opposed to the Mental Health services provided at major medical centers (both public and private) whose facilities and personnel have been converted into COVID-19 medical services, the Community Mental Health System, part of the National Family Health Centers (CESFAM), has remained the corner-stone upon which our services have been provided . Fo llowing more than a decade of sig- nificant obstacles to developing tele mental health services, in just four months most mental health providers are using them, and regulations are being studied and implemented . A pr esidential initiative, commis- sion, and national mental health plan has been delineated . I t attempts to integrate the health system along with the academic, educational, and social policy systems in providing not only outreach and coverage, but also a mental health general and inter-sectoral approach in all aspects of government and public policy . If s uccessful, would be akin to switching from a medical model of occasional psychiatric or mental health consultation, to one of mental health liaison, in which all parts of government (health, education, labor, social policy, housing, and urbanism, etc .) wou ld be imbued by a culture of caring for the mental health needs of the population served . COLOMBIA Andres Cardozo, MD Resident, Bogota, Colombia As of this writing, my country (Colombia) ranks fourth among countries in the Americas in the total number of new cases on the daily report by the World Health Organization (WHO) . S ocial distancing, hand washing, use of masks, and other public health measures have achieved an amazing effect by delaying the peak of the pandemic and allowing everyone and the healthcare system to prepare for it . T his imposes a huge burden on our children and adolescents, and here we see many mental health problems arising for them: disruption of educational and recreational routines, increased conduct and mood symptoms, and higher expo-sure to certain types of violence . A s our country has one of the highest income disparities in the world, all these effects are worse for a huge portion of our population while only a fraction affords healthcare services easily when needed . As a c hild and adolescent psychiatry trainee, it is clear to me that the current SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2020 209 COMMITTEES/REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS scenario presents us with great oppor- tunities and tough challenges . M any of our activities have undergone a rapid transformation to telehealth services; it is now easier for some underserved popu-lations to access such services, but many of them (and some physicians) do not know how to properly use the necessary technology, and children are especially challenging to assess . O utpatient facili- ties were either closed for a long time or had low attendance, which hindered the training in some crucial skills (e .g ., ps ychotherapy) . W e, both teachers and residents, are afraid of entering cer-tain areas of large hospitals and had a hard time learning how to use personal protective equipment . F inally, classes need to be refined to make better use of the tools available online for sharing knowledge and evaluating fairly this new process of learning . EGYPT Maha Emadeldin, MD Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Professor & Head of Psychiatry Department, Bani Suef University, Egypt, General Secretary of Egyptian Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Association In response to the emerging crisis of COVID-19, national bodies respon - sible for mental health (MH) in Egypt realized the need to integrate efforts supporting children and adolescents (C&A) . A n ational task force for child and adolescent MH was formed, including representatives from universities, NGOs, and regional offices of international organizations . A ll these entities worked under the ministry of health as an execu-tive body . T o promote psychological well being, messages about MH and disorders in C&A were disseminated by videos and social media posts . I n deprived areas, where social media is not accessible, the messages were delivered in person through community workers from col-laborating NGOs . Wi th the closure of several psychiatric facilities, the available services were mapped for referral of urgent cases or new prescriptions since that online prescription is still not legal in Egypt . T o adapt to the ongoing crisis, the medica-tions were dispensed for three months . T o ensure continuity of the services to ASD children, some centers provided training to mothers with weekly follow up calls . To c ompensate for the decreased face-to-face psychiatric services, a specialized national C&A MH helpline was launched . S ervices included the providing of parenting advice and psychological support . Wi th more chal- lenging cases suspecting MH disorders, parents are encouraged to seek the avail-able psychiatric help from the nearest mapped services . I n cases of emergen- cies like DSH and abuse, a certain protocol is applied . The he lpline was an eye-opening experi- ence toward the possibility of spreading services all over Egypt utilizing the same limited resources with the use of technology . A ccordingly, the task-force- initiated implemented research to assess the acceptability of using tele-mental health services among service provid-ers, users, and stakeholders . T he results could help change the current situation to legalize using these services in Egypt . INDIA Aniruddh Behere, MD Grand Rapids, MI The current COVID-19 pandemic has caused havoc in India, which is the world's second-most popu- lous country . R ecently, total cases passed five million\u2014on track to overtake the US . T he psychosocial and emotional trauma associated with the current pan-demic in India has been profound and multifaceted . The re has been a surge in reported domestic violence and child abuse cases during the pandemic . T he enforce- ment of the world's biggest lockdown, enforced to mitigate the spread of the virus, has had negative effects including economic downturn; a dramatic increase in unemployment rates; migrant workers being forced to travel back to their native homes and dying of exhaustion, or in accidents; and an increase in farmers' suicide . N ot only has there been an increase in rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts, but also stigma associated with people who may have contracted the virus leading to further isolation and psychological distress . I n one state in India, 66 children commit-ted suicide within a span of 100 days of COVID-19 lockdown . Ac cess to trained mental health profes- sionals has been severely restricted as an obvious consequence of the country-wide lockdown . K ids with autism and developmental disabilities have suffered profoundly due to the pause in services . C onsequently, this has led to a move- ment of innovation within healthcare . T he Medical Council of India laid out guidelines for telehealth services for medical providers . N umerous indig- enous telehealth platforms have been developed . I n rural areas, telephonic consultations have increased . T here has also been a relaxation of laws governing prescription drugs to maintain accessibil-ity and availability . NIGERIA Ronke Babalola, MD, MPH Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Rutgers University-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School In Nigeria, most children are evalu- ated by general psychiatrists . N igeria is like other parts of the world in that there is a comparatively small percent-age of child and adolescent psychiatrists . S ome states in Nigeria have no child psychiatrists . In t he city of Lagos, Nigeria, which is considered one of the progressive states (Lagos State) in Nigeria, telemedicine was almost nonexistent in both public and private sectors for psychiatrists prior to the COVID-19 pandemic . T herefore, the minimal EMR does not have the capability to send medication via EMR, and most pharmacies have the same issue . P atients are seen via WhatsApp, telephone calls, and other virtual com-munication platforms . T his is a small percentage of their patients (approxi-mately 1-2% of all patients) . T he main limiting factor is money, and most of the patients and their families lack Wi-Fi capability . F irst, they must buy data to use the Wi-Fi, and the signals (connec-tion) are terrible at best even when paid for . M ost importantly, some people do not have smartphones, or have minimal 210 AACAP NEWS COMMITTEES/REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS data smartphones that are not able to connect to virtual visits . H ospitals may not be able to provide free data, and doctors may provide this service from their own personal money . S ome child and adolescent psychiatrists found some creative ways to get medica-tion to patients: they made arrangements with pharmacies to scan images of the prescriptions to the pharmacy, and all hard-copy originals were later submit-ted by the doctors at the end of the week to the pharmacist . S ometimes the doctors used carrier services to deliver prescriptions . In N igeria, most patients were not seen, especially in remote areas . T he patients are slowly returning to face-to-face visits at hospitals . PHILIPPINES - Jasmin Lagman By Rhodora Andrea M. Concepcion, MD, FPPA (Life), FPSCAP, President, Philippine Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry On March 15, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte placed the National Capital Region under \"community quarantine\" intended to last only for two weeks . Wi th the increasing number of patients identified to be posi-tive with COVID-19, the national gov-ernment implemented stricter efforts to protect the Filipino population . P resident Duterte placed the entire Luzon under \"enhanced community quarantine\" on March 17, 2020 . M any of the regions in the Philippines with identified cases of the virus infection are still placed in general community quarantine up to this time . Un der this condition, strict home quar- antine is implemented in all households . C lasses were suspended . A ll means of public transportation were suspended . P ublic establishments were closed . P rovisions for food and essential health services were regulated . T he presence of uniformed personnel to enforce the quarantine procedures was heightened, and all events that could draw crowds were cancelled .Ov er this period, parents and children themselves expressed concerns about the impact of this pandemic on their lives and how this is affecting the mental and emotional health of their children and teens . C hallenges face families each day on how this pandemic impacts their lives and how this is affecting their physical, mental, and emotional health . D uring the COVID-19 pandemic, health- care workers including adult and child psychiatrists are being pushed to their limits as they selflessly care for patients . N ot only are they under enormous strain at work, they also face the fear of bring-ing the virus home to their families . Ps ychiatrists in the Philippines are get- ting creative about telehealth as the safest and most practical option for the current time . W ebinars are now the trend . F or now, it has changed the way we communicate and hold psychother-apy sessions with patients, both children and adults, and with their families . I t has also changed the way we gather to hold a public event . L ooking at the safety benefits of telehealth, there can be an expanded use of telemedicine after the pandemic because it works well for most medical practitioners and their patients . T he Philippine Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry provides a series of monthly webinars on the theme \"Challenges in the Care of Children and Families in Living the New Normal\" that started in the second quarter of 2020 and will run until the last quarter of 2021 . The m ain objectives of these series of webinars are: A . To he lp children and families: Fi nd positive ways to express disturbing feelings such as fear and sadness Co mmunicate their unique ways of expressing emotions Co nvey their individual styles of coping Dr aw important lessons from the experience El icit valuable realizations from the experienceB . To g uide mental health profession- als, parents, guardians, and teachers allay the worries and anxiety of these young population amidst the public health crisis and in the post-crisis situation . QATAR Muhammad Waqar Azeem, MD Chair, Department of Psychiatry, Sidra Medical & Research Center Qatar is a small country in the Middle East with a population of 2 .8 mi llion . T his includes about 500,000 children and adoles-cents . Q atar had a national response to COVID-19 through the Ministry of Public Health . O ne hospital was designated to take care of all the patients with COVID-19 . U ntil July 7, 2020, the total number of people tested was 390,997 with 100,945 testing positive for COVID-19 . T he total number of deaths was 134 . A N ational Hotline was started for mental health in March . S idra Medicine is the main provider of child and adolescent psychiatric services in the country . T elepsychiatry services were started for children and adoles - cents in the middle of March to a good response . Th is included psychiatric assessments, follow-ups, and psychother - apy interventions . Wi th telepsychiatry, no-show and cancellation rates markedly decreased . Ps ychotropic medications were delivered via drive-through pharma - cies in hospitals, and the postal service delivered medications to homes . I n addi - tion, the Psychiatry Department at Sidra arranged webinars and support groups for frontline staff . O n June 15, medical ser - vices started phased reopening with plans of fully operational in-person-services by September 2020 . m SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2020 211 COMMITTEES/REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONSHEALTH INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY (HIT) COMMITTEE Key Considerations for Telepsychiatry Private Practice After COVID-19 Krysti (Lan Chi) Vo, MD The COVID-19 response of rapid conversion to telemedicine has been stressful for some psy- chiatrists in private practice for whom telepsychiatry may have come with the unfamiliarity of the regulatory and technological requirements . F ortunately, the enforcement of several regulations was relaxed to support the need for telehealth during social isolation and allow widespread use of telemedicine . Wi th the anticipation that the national emergency status will be lifted soon, psychiatrists should discuss continua-tion of their telepsychiatry practice with their malpractice servicer or healthcare lawyer . E ven if we only want to use telepsychiatry once, conduct a hybrid model of both in-person and video visit, or expand our practice with telepsychia-try, these initial considerations remain relevant . T his brief overview is meant as a primer of key legal considerations primarily for those who plan to continue practicing synchronous telepsychiatry with their private practice patients . Te lehealth and telemental health describe an umbrella of services that includes synchronous and asynchronous (or \"store-and-forward\") modalities . T elemedicine, which includes telepsychi - atry, is often defined as the application of synchronous technology to replicate the interaction of in-person encoun-ters between clinicians and patients at different locations from each other . I n short, synchronous telepsychiatry visits are conducted in real-time through an audio-visual platform and asynchro - nous e-visits are provided without face-to-face engagements . H istorically, asynchronous modalities do not meet the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) definition of telemedi-cine, but these definitions have recently been fluid . I n 2019, Medicare started covering virtual check-ins1 that can be conducted through telephonic com - munication, while Medicaid did not . I f applicable to your practice, it is impor-tant to stay updated on the changes with both Medicaid and Medicare since they do differ in coverage for different telehealth modalities . Implement the Standard of Care The first step in telepsychiatry is to determine exactly which clinical care model we will use, while remembering that the standard of care for treatment via telemedicine is exactly the same as it is for the patient seen via an in-person encounter . I n addition to clinical standards of care, we must meet the standards required for the practice of telemedicine . T he American Academy and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) and the Federation of State Medical Boards have issued guidelines for the practice of telemedicine that informs the standard of care . Comply with Federal and State Regulations After we have defined the scope of our telepsychiatry practice, we should familiarize ourselves with the telemedi-cine regulations of both your state and the state where the patient resides, as we will be required to comply with both sets of rules . W hile there are many regulations, the below are a few major areas to start . Licensure A psychiatrist must often first meet the licensure requirements of the states in which their patients are physi-cally located at the time of treatment . W hether a license is required may vary depending on several factors, including whether another physician is involved in the care . F or example, teleconsultation to other healthcare providers without seeing the patient has its own licensure requirements that differs from direct-to-patient care . Consent We should become familiar with state consent requirements, which may require a telehealth consent process, in addition to a consent for mental health treatment . T his process may require verbal, digital and/or paper consent, and may be different for telephonic visits versus synchronous, virtual visits . F or example, some states do not consider telephonic visits as telemedicine, and thus may not require a consent process for telephonic visits, but will for audio-visual visits . Electronic Prescribing If part of our treatment plan includes prescribing medication, we should be aware of relevant federal and state laws regarding prescribing of controlled and non-controlled medications online . D uring the national emergency, the \"We should become familiar with state consent requirements, which may require a telehealth consent process, in addition to a consent for mental health treatment. This process may require verbal, digital and/or paper consent, and may be different for telephonic visits versus synchronous, virtual visits.\"212 AACAP NEWSDrug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has developed an algorithm2 to guide prescribers on how to prescribe controlled substances . O utside of this national emergency, the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 3 dictates that no controlled substance may be delivered, distributed, or dispensed by means of the internet without a valid prescription . I n short, the Ryan Haight Act requires that a physi-cian must see a patient in person before prescribing a controlled substance . T here are exceptions for certain tele- medicine activities, but overall, this act has made the expansion of telepsychia-try difficult . I n an effort to remedy this, the American Telemedicine Association, American Psychiatric Association, and other organizations advocate for a flexible framework for legitimate and appropriate online prescribing . I t is important to discuss the Ryan Haight Act with a healthcare lawyer to make sure your practice procedures are in compliance . HIPAA HIPAA regulations require that when using a system wherein patient-identi-fying information is created, received, maintained, or transmitted, a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with the system vendor is necessary . W hile many video vendors are HIPAA compliant, they must still sign a BAA directly with you and your business, which may simply entail signing an electronic form . I f the information is not stored and the system merely acts as a conduit, then the vendor is not a Business Associate under HIPAA . F or example, while the technological processing of payment is an exception 4 to HIPAA, there are fac- tors, such as invoicing and statements associated with a payment process-ing company, that are not exempted . M ost situations require a BAA . I f your system vendor will not provide this, you should carefully review the pri-vacy policy to confirm that it is not a Business Associate . Te lemedicine regulations are rapidly- changing . G iven the increasing focus placed on access to mental healthcare and the continued shortage of men-tal health providers, telepsychiatry is projected to have tremendous growth, and with it, new opportunities . C OVID- 19 has prompted software platform companies to invest further in telemedi-cine regulatory compliance, and pushed malpractice servicers and healthcare lawyers to provide support for their cli-ents to conduct telepsychiatry . A s such, the telemedicine community should advocate for regulatory agencies to be flexible with appropriate telepsychiatry prescribing practices . P ayers should enhance their coverage of telepsychia-try services and take into account the continued need for telemedicine, even after this national emergency ends . W e have seen that telepsychiatry can be an invaluable tool for allowing greater men-tal healthcare access for patients, and ultimately improve quality care .A great resource on updated federal and state policies is The Center for Connected Health Policy .5 For fur- ther information, please visit AACAP's Telepsychiatry toolkit .6 m References 1 .

COMMITTEES/REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2020 213 FEATURESGLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE Climate Change and Child and Adolescent Mental Health-Points to Ponder Introduction Climate change is a long-term devia- tion in weather patterns and is a leading public health threat to vulnerable popu-lations .1 During the last 650,000 years, scientists have recorded seven cycles of climate change, most of which were the result of slight changes in earth orbit that affected the amount of solar energy the Earth received . T he modern climate era, which started at the end of the last ice age, also led to increased human activity on Earth . B y the mid-nineteenth century, climate trends were point-ing towards a level of increased global warming that was unprecedented .2,3 The rise of urbanization, industrializa-tion, and global trade in the twentieth century led to increased atmospheric CO2 levels (from 285 parts per million-ppm in the pre-industrial era to 407 in 2018), which caused sharp increases in global temperatures . Wi th the mount- ing surface and oceanic temperatures, melting glaciers are increasing sea levels and causing the acidification of oceans . T hese increasing temperatures also lead to increased intensity and frequency of rainfalls, coastal flooding, droughts, hur-ricanes, and wildfires, wreaking havoc on vulnerable communities . Direct and Indirect Effects on Mental Health It is well known that childrens' cogni- tive and emotional development occurs in the context of healthy relationships within the home, school, and broader community . Cl imate-related events and eventual displacements disrupt the relationship between humans and their environment, which is essential to maintaining adequate emotional health and livelihood across all ages . A s a result, individuals of all ages are affected by these climate-induced phenomena and experience increased psychological distress . I ndividuals with pre-existing mental health problems are particularly prone to further decompensation of their physical and emotional health .4 Individuals at the extremes of the age groups and indigenous population show greater psychological vulner-ability to these adverse events and take longer to recover . C limate change can affect individuals indirectly by creat-ing psychosocial insecurity because of uncertainty about the intensity, dura-tion, and frequency of weather patterns . L ong periods of drought-like conditions usually increase environmental dust, alter disease patterns, pollen, and water-borne diseases, and lead to food and water insecurity, which in turn results in poor physical and emotional health . I t is important to note that if disasters cause disruption and chaos in the communi-ties, they may also inspire individuals to come together to console, rebuild, and create a sense of meaning amid the loss . I n addition to disrupting the socio- economic fabric of the society, global warming has more direct effects on our mental health . S tudies have found that as temperature and humidity rises, emer - gency room visits increase .5,6 Higher temperatures are associated with aggres - sion and conduct behaviors . Y outh with psychotic disorders and substance use disorders are particularly prone to decompensation . Sud den and abrupt disruption in weather resulting in torna-does, cyclones, and floods causes severe anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) .7 In contrast, sub- acute weather disasters, like droughts, tend to cause symptoms consistent with loss, including depression, anxiety disor-ders, sub-threshold traumatic responses, hopelessness, and suicide .\"8,9 Conclusion The literature on the effects of climate change on child and adolescent mental health is limited . T his brief review attempts to generate further debate and to highlight the need for more research into one of the biggest mental health challenges of the 21st century . B oth the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Psychiatric Association (APA) have published position state-ments about the effects of climate change on individuals . Ot her than creating a consensus among AACAP members, it is essential that practicing physicians and the broader mental health system play a role in identifying the effects of climate change on mental health . T his work needs to be done on a continuum from providing support to families, restoring their safety and helping them through treatment and recovery, and at the same time coming up with effective means to prevent or reduce youth's vulnerabilities . m Ahsan Nazeer, MD, Muhammad Waqar Azeem, MD 214 AACAP NEWS FEATURES Get in the News!

SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2020 215 FEATURES2020 NCROCAP and Klingenstein Conferences: A Student Member's Perspective Emily Trimm The waves crashed onto the beautiful pacific beach and sand worked its way into the creases of my black shoes \u2014 the same ones I had worn to medical school interviews just a year before . I f elt incredibly lucky to be attending the Northern California Regional Organization of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry's (NCROCAP) annual meeting as a first-year student, and a morning of interesting talks had left me feeling excited about the future of child psychiatry . Sa nne, Liza, Maud, and Cindy, four medical students from The Netherlands and Australia, were equally enthused . T hey had travelled to the US as part of Dr . A nita Kishore's initiative to cre- ate an international medical student network for child psychiatry, and we had begun our journey together at the 2020 Klingenstein Third Generation Foundation (KTGF) National Medical Student Conference just a few days earlier . I t had been an intense week of immersion in child psychiatry, and we had learned a lot, both from peers as well as from mentors in the field . Whe n I first entered medical school, I wasn't sure where my journey would take me . A s an MD-PhD student, I had a strong interest in science and knew that I wanted research to be a large part of my future career . I a lso knew that I loved to work with children, but it wasn't clear to me how these two passions could be combined or translated professionally . E arly participation in the Klingenstein program introduced me to the excit-ing world of child psychiatry and a warm community of medical students that shared many of my research and clinical goals . A n opportunity to present at the KTGF National Medical Student Conference \u2014 and an introduction to the international students \u2014 expanded this community dramatically and high-lighted the diverse pathways that my future career could take . At t he NCROCAP meeting, I learned about current practices within the field and gained valuable insight from a broader group of child psychiatrists . T he inclusion of trainees and medi- cal students in the meeting made it clear that education was valued by the organization's members, and I left with the sense that a career in child psychia-try would be well-supported . The m ain day of NCROCAP meeting ended with an exciting talk by Matthew State, MD, PhD, on the genetics of Autism Spectrum Disorder . U sing high- throughput data from the largest cohort of patients ever studied, his team had been able to characterize many rare mutations that were highly predictive of the condition . D r . S tate finished his talk with a bold promise: gene-therapy treatments would be available for neuro-psychiatric disorders within the next five years . A dvancements in basic science are racing towards an intersection with child psychiatry and new treatments are on the horizon . I t's an exciting time to be a student entering the field . m Emily Trimm is a second-year medical student in the medical scientist training program at Stanford University. She is a teaching assistant for the Klingenstein Fellowship in Child Psychiatry, a Fulbright student leader, and the 2020 recipient of the AWP Leah J. Dickstein, MD Award. Emily is currently working with Dr. Anita Kishore to establish an international medical student network for child and adolescent psychiatry. 216 AACAP NEWS OPINIONSClimate Change, Coronavirus, and Children's Mental Health Robert Root, MD I think a lot about Covid-19 and of the parallels to my work to combat the climate crisis\u2014issues of eco-anxiety, climate grief, and the risk of PTSD in children who have experienced wildfires and massive storms . T he coronavirus is also a global health threat on an unimag-inable scale . I t, too, triggers feelings of being overwhelmed and helpless . T here is an urgency to take action that is driven by our fears around health, finances and the safety of our planet . The y ear 2019 was one of expanded consciousness about the devastating impacts of climate change as millions of people in diverse regions of the world personally experienced extreme weather events . T he year 2020 will be remem- bered for decades to come for this viral pandemic . O ur lives have changed so drastically and abruptly . O ur fundamen- tal sense of the safety and security of our future has been shaken . As a c hild and adolescent psychiatrist, I see the human effects of these dual global crises . I b elieve it is vitally impor- tant that, as we work towards more enlightened policies in global public health and climate activism, we keep in mind the impacts at the level of society and in the minds of our children . The re are profound disruptions to the normal rhythm of everyday life . T he constricted nature of our activity threatens to derail adolescents from a healthy developmental trajectory . T he virtual classroom is incredible, but it also heightens dependence on parents, which both children and parents know is a strain on the relationship . W e are asked to socially distance when what we need most is the intimacy and comfort of our social network . Lo neliness and isolation are some of the most pernicious impacts . S ome teens have responded with remarkable maturity, and recognize that their social distancing helps to protect vulnerable members of the community . O thers are finding social cohesion virtually through Zoom and online activism . B ut many adolescents I have spoken to are painfully aware of the disruptions to their social connections . F or high school seniors, there is profound disappoint-ment at missing the milestones of prom, graduation, and college tours . S ummer jobs, camp and specialized programs are likely all going to be cancelled . F or children already vulnerable to depres-sion and anxiety, sheltering in place is further isolating . I a nticipate that we will soon see a \"surge\" of childhood anxiety, depression and PTSD . It i s clear that we must take action on a transformational scale . W e must provide equitable access to telehealth and ensure the protection of our natural resources\u2014like clean air, clean water and healthy forests . An d yet we have historically failed to mobilize when catastrophe approaches . A gain I draw the parallel to climate change . P ublic health experts have warned for decades about the risk of a severe pandemic . C limate scientists have similarly warned about the health impacts of a warming world . I t would be rational self-preservation, guided by evidence-based science, to prepare for such planetary plagues and atmospheric changes in advance . T hese crises could have been mitigated, if not largely pre-vented, by swift and urgent action . Wh at can we tell our children whose lives are upended and imperiled by inac-tion? We need to \"flatten the curve\" by concerted action to limit the exponential spread of the pandemic . A M arch 2020 article through Yale Environment 360 suggests we need similarly to \"flatten the curve\" of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . I w ould add that we must be determined to flatten the curve once more by limiting the emotional reverber-ations of these events on our children's well-being . As a p sychiatrist, I believe that we can do this by accepting reality and taking positive action . W e must listen to our children's anxiety with thoughtfulness and patience . W e must manage our own . L et us transform worldwide anxiety and suffering into global collaboration . W e have the opportunity to emerge from this crisis with greater wisdom and empathy . A s frightening and surreal as these past many weeks have been, I marvel at how remarkably adaptable we human beings can be . C hildren do Zumba class by Zoom, parents serve as primary teachers, journalists cover new beats, and mental health practitioners provide care through teletherapy . P eople around the world have dem- onstrated that they are capable of mobilizing a massive and united global response . A s we contemplate re-opening our communities, we must integrate environmentally sustainable clean energy policy as we rebuild the econ-omy . L et us galvanize young adults with public service work rather than unem-ployment . L et us protect the elderly and the marginalized . F or the sake of our children, let us nurture this spirit of action with compassion and wisdom . m Robert Root, MD, is a Senior Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at The Child Mind Institute and A Climate Reality Leader through Al Gore's Climate Reality Project.

It's FREE! We need to spread the word not just to our re sident s and fellows, but also to our colleagues in medical student education that registration to this year 's annual meeting is free for ALL trainee members! 2. Plan in Advance. Meet NOW to start planning . Use a vir tual meeting with trainees to explore the AACAP Meeting Virtual Center together! Be sure to orient them to the structure and content of the two weeks . Walk them through the MSR Events Guide which highlights M edical Student and Residents (MSR) s ignature events. Additionally, here are two sessions, we don't want you to miss: AALI (Alliance for Learning & Innovation ): Trainees or ECPs who are up-and -coming clinician educat ors can email .org to to the AALI Meeting on Sund ay, O ctober 18th Training & Ed Summi t: While we can 't share lunch, we still want to see you! Join Program Director friends from across the nation to connec t meaningfully and learn to gether on Monday, October 19th 3. Watch Parties. If you have an auditorium or large conference room, reserve it for Watch P arties ( distanced and masked , of course) . Pair with outdoor breaks so trainees and faculty can rejuvenate with refreshments or lunch . Or learn from millennials (and their Netflix Watch Parties) and create virtual Watch Parties! 4. Encourage Time Off . It's important for well-being that we don't just squeez e in conference time between clinical obligations ! So, s trategize with your chief residents in advance . Can clinical duties b e streamlined ? Can a shared or staggered clinical coverage schedule be arranged? Be creat ive. Be mindful! 5. Cancel Didactics. Your job as a Program Director is easier during the conference ! Simply c ancel your didactics and extracurricular learning activities, and substitute with AACAP Annual Meeting content ! You could even make attendance mandatory during regular protected classroom teaching hours . 6. Divide & Conqu er. It's tempting to answer emails and write patient notes while on Zoom , but we know from neuroscience that \"multi-tasking \" impairs learning and efficiency. So, create stru cture that encourages engagement ! Have trainees teach their peers what they learned in post -conference summarization sessions. 7. Engage Your Faculty . Have faculty recommend specific conference sessions to attend based on their expertise, and then distribute the sug gestions to your trainees . Encourage mentors to have a 1-on-1 mentorship meeting to share tips and tricks of how to utilize the conference for professional development. 8. Network , Network , Network. Be sure trainees are aw are of networking events (e.g. Meet and Greet , Ment orship P rograms , Receptions & Reu nions, Direct Chat). You could even shoot an email to a nother Program Direct or to e-connect a fellow who is intere sted in career opportunities in new geographies. 9. Targeted Kudos . Be sure that folks at your institution know when others (especially trainees) a re presenting po sters and presentations , so that we can support our colleagues. Snap a screenshot of your trainee presen ting and (with their permission !) share on social media and with your department leadership . 10. Have FUN ! AACAP has Virtual Fun sessions scheduled in the evenings ! Have fun locally too! Gamify by breaking into teams and using a free tracking app (e.g. MapMyFitness with \"Indoor Sport, Othe r\") to track the most minutes of c onference time attended. Virtual Happy Hours between programs in the same city ! Be sure to share additional innovative ideas on the AADPRT CAP Listserv !

NOSHPITZ CLINE HISTORY LECTURE Thrown Under the Bus: Addressing the Mental Health Impacts of the Pandemic on Young People Globally Wednesday, October 21 1:00 pm-2:30 pm EDT (open) Speaker: Vikram Patel, MBBS, PhD While the pandemic has disrupted the lives of billions around the world, its impact has not been evenly distrib-uted . T he closure of educational institutions, physical distancing, and the loss of jobs disproportionately affects children and adolescents who, paradoxically, are the least affected by the virus itself . T hey are, in effect, being asked to sacrifice their needs and desires for the good of their parents and grandparents . B ut their unique developmental needs, and their voices and aspirations, are largely absent from the conversations on how policies should be designed . T he emergence of a generation of young people who feel anger, despair, and anxious about the world around them and their own future is a distinct reality . T his lecture considers how the pandemic offers a historic opportunity to address this distress and transform our approach to mental health concerns of children and adolescents . 224 AACAP NEWS 2020 VIRTUAL ANNUAL MEETING OCTOBER 12-24, 2020 2020 VIRTUAL ANNUAL MEETING OCTOBER 12-24, 2020Vikram Patel is The Pershing Square Professor of Global Health and Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow at the Harvard Medical School .

SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2020 225 2020 VIRTUAL ANNUAL MEETING OCTOBER 12-24, 2020 TOWN MEETING Transforming Child Psychiatric Care Delivery: Necessities and Opportunities Thursday, October 22 1:00 pm-2:30 pm EDT (AACAP members only) Chair: Mary-Margaret Gleason, MD Speakers: Mark S. Borer, MD, Lawrence Wissow, MD, MPH, Kaye L, McGinty, MD, Kaye L. McGinty, MD, Shabana Khan, MD, Linda Chokroverty, MD Responding to multiple forces, the practice of child and ado- lescent psychiatry is moving towards innovative approaches to delivering high quality care to the patients who need it in the places they need it . P rominent among these shaping forces are the ongoing workforce shortage and the COVID-19 pandemic . T he chronic workforce shortage is well known to our field . T here are approximately 8,300 child adolescent psychiatrists to meet the estimated needs of over 15 million children with mental health problems . T hese estimates are based on pre- COVID-19 mental health needs in the population and the mental health burden is expected to rise exponentially in this disaster time and that disaster-related mental health problems will persist without treatment . In r esponse to chronic workforce shortages and to the immedi- ate public health measures of COVID-19 in early 2020, child and adolescent psychiatrists are participating in transforma-tions of service delivery . T his year, most child and adolescent psychiatrists learned to provide individual direct care through telehealth . T o meet the needs of our youth, innovative popula- tion health approaches are also needed, including consultation to pediatric primary care clinicians to promote early identifica-tion, first line intervention, co-management, and referral . T o sustain these and other innovative approaches, it will be critical for child and adolescent psychiatrists to understand some financing structures . Th is Town Meeting focuses on introducing principles and mod- els of transformative approaches to child psychiatry in 2020 and beyond with a goal of highlighting innovative strategies and models of care and providing a framework for understand-ing financing structures .LAWRENCE A.

G regorio ('Goyo') Katz is one of the fathers of child and adolescent psychiatry in Mexico . I n fact, he was its co-father, with the late Dr . M anuel Isa\u00edas L\u00f3pez . I n 1974, the two of them launched its first formal training program at the National Autonomous University (UNAM), the country's largest univer-sity . A fter completing his residency and fellowship in Michigan in the late '60s, Goyo returned to his native Mexico to become a trailblazer not only in educa-tion, but in clinical care, scholarship, and advocacy as well . G oyo's expertise and innovative approaches to intellectual disabilities are legion: in 1984 he estab-lished CADI, a thriving model center for independent living for young adults; he has been a member of the WPA's steer-ing committee on intellectual disabilities, and an ICD-11 taskforce topic expert . H e has written or edited 16 books, including Discapacidad Intelectual , the first textbook in its class written in Spanish, and published by McGraw Hill in 2010 . I n 1998, he was awarded the Academy's prestigious Gorge Tarjan Award for his lifelong dedication to intel-lectual disabilities . G oyo is a proud life- time member of the Academy, and was one of the founding members and a past president of the Mexican Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AMPI) . In t he midst of the pandemic, Goyo reached an important milestone . O n June 15, 2020, he was inducted into the Mexican National Academy of Medicine (ANMM) . H e joined that rarified club of honor by virtue of his lifelong efforts, as well as by his more recent research initiatives . I n this work, including an article now in press at BMC Medical Ethics , Goyo has focused on paternal - ism and how to move from this still entrenched doctor-patient paradigm into one of shared decision-making . G oyo is a dear colleague, teacher, mentor and close friend . I s alute and celebrate his latest and so well deserved professional accolade: \u00a1Felicidades, Goyo!

Adam Shrier, D.Eng, JD SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2020 231 FOR YOUR INFORMATIONAvoid Unforeseen Penalties and Fees! Why Reviewing Your Electronic Health Record System is Essential to be Compliant with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)'s 21st Century Cures Act . What is the 21st Century Cures Act ? The 21st Century Cures Act , signed into law by President Obama, promotes and funds the acceleration of research into preventing and curing serious illnesses; accelerates drug and medical device development; attempts to address the opioid abuse crisis; and tries to improve mental health service delivery . T he final rule for cures act was published on May 1, 2020 . Why is the 21st Century Cures Act important? While the bill is largely known to help fund efforts such as precision medi-cine, it contains some provisions to improve healthcare IT and improve patient access to their own electronic health information . How does the 21st Century Cures Act impact me and my fellow child and adolescent psychiatrists? The final rule includes a provision stating that patients can electronically access all electronic health information (EHI), structured and/or unstructured, at no cost . S ection 4004 of the regulation authorizes the U .S . S ecretary of Health & Human Services to identify any block-ing of information to patients while still allowing reasonable exceptions . T he consequence of being an \"information blocker\" can be severe and may include civil penalties up to $1 million per violation for the health IT developers, disincentives for health care provid-ers, and possible certification ban on Healthcare IT providers . M any child and adolescent psychiatrists in private prac - tice may be in violation of some aspects of the 21st Century Cures Act . A ACAP's Health Information and Technology Committee is happy to be a resource for members with electronic health information questions including how the 21st Century Cures Act will impact how patient information is shared . F or more information, please reach out to AACAP's Clinical Practice Department ( clinical@aacap.org ) for upcoming meetings and webinars on these and all related health information technology topics . m Members are invited to submit up to two photographs every two months fo r consideration . W e look for pictures\u2014paintings included\u2014that tell a story about children, family, school, or childhood situation .

This project set off a chain reaction of learning, using all available resources at my university, fellowship program, local institutions and organizations, governmental programs, and the general community. Attending the day-long program and presenting a poster with fellow awardees was interactive, informative and fun. Now as an attending physician, I apply the concepts of systems-based care in collaborating with our colleagues from several other specialties. AACAP'S ADVOCACY COMMITTEE I strongly believe that every physician is inherently an advocate for our patients. My first brush with the Advocacy Committee came in the form of a presentation by Drs. Deb Koss and Karen Pierce on the important role of physicians in mental health policy. This created a deep impression and ignited my interest to learn and involve myself in such efforts. I successfully applied for the Resident S cholar F ellowship o pportunity, which allowed me to work closely with AACAP's Department of Government Affairs on projects that support lawmakers' offices in Congress, aiding in policies related to child and adolescent mental health. Living in Washington DC in July, visiting Senators' and Representatives' offices on the Hill, I felt like a congressional summer intern (without the coffee runs!). I also received exposure collaborating with other stakeholders with mutual goals in the \"House of Medicine.\" Since joining the committee in 2019, the committee members and AACAP's support staff have become like family. I feel like I am 'always learning' in the midst of these esteemed committee members and the knowledge they bring to the table is awe-inspiring. I strongly urge you to join our Advocacy Liaison Network, the backbone of our grassroots effort! We would love to have you on our team.2018 AACAP EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH PROGRAM (EOP) FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY RESIDENTS SUPPORTED BY THE AACAP ENDOWMENT FUND Through AACAP's EOP program, I was able to experience at the Annual Meeting a glimpse of the breadth and depth of opportunities AACAP can provide combined with rich mentorship. I felt inspired by various child and adolescent psychiatry leaders and got to share the table with the President of AACAP over the Young Leaders Awards Breakfast. A memory I will treasure is during the Life Members' Dinner I was the youngest one at the table and was nervous; the Life Members endearingly addressed me as \"kiddo\" and had great conversations with me. With this experience, it felt like I grew a personal relationship with AACAP, despite this being my first Annual Meeting. MILESTONES Born in India, I grew up in a household that instilled in me that knowledge and values are one's greatest assets. At age 8, I was playing cricket with friends when our ball went onto a roof. Upon retrieving it, I was electrocuted by a high voltage power line and needed nine life-threatening surgeries to survive. Life \"as a patient\" motivated me to strive hard and become the first doctor in my family. Upon finishing medical school in India, I turned to the United States after experiencing inhuman discrimination in my effort to pursue further specialty training. Navigating a new country without knowing anyone was humbling, living on couches while preparing my residency applications; and the uncertainty of basic necessities like food and shelter, taught me a lot about life. I worked hard and eventually trained and did research at Harvard. I matched and pursued both residency and fellowship at SIU School of Medicine in Springfield, Illinois. Abe Lincoln's town! My motto is \"Learn to serve; serve to learn.\" I am an immigrant physician, taking it one day at a time, serving the underserved population. Life's uncertainty continues but AACAP has become my steady source of support and camaraderie through members and colleagues like you. ABOUT DR.

We recognize the impact that systemic and structural racism has on everyone - especially youth and black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC)\u2014and the trauma and pain caused by systemic racism and violence. As President, I recently appointed a Presidential Working Group to Promote Health Equity and Combat Racism, led by Drs. Melvin Oatis, Lisa Cullins, and Tami Benton. AACAP's longstanding priority to diversity and action includes advancing health equity and combating racism. To that end, AACAP is engaging all members at all levels (Executive Committee, Council, Assembly, committees, and staff) to combat racism and inequities in all areas, including research, care, and practice. AACAP's Diversity and Culture Committee, skillfully led by Drs. Lisa Cullins and Cheryl Al-Mateen and managed by Carmen Thornton, crafted a dynamic and robust Action Plan for AACAP to address mental health equity concerns as well as combating racism in the era of COVID-19 and beyond. AACAP's Council approved this plan and champions these efforts. We continue with our efforts on this front, working on many projects including the following: AA CAP's Virtual Forum on \"Healthcare disparities through the lens of diversity during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Dr . Carlson interviewed Dr. Patrice Harris on health equities and disparities in the COVID-19 era , as part of AACAP's SCREENSIDE CHATS series AA CAP's Racism Resource Library , prominently positioned on AACAP's website AA CAP and the American Psychiatric Association released a joint statement detailing the necessary steps for safely reopening schools JA ACAP : Our Vision: An Anti-Racist Journal Le cture series with multiple committees on COVID-19 and Health Disparities AA CAP Caucuses: Black, Hispanic, Asian, Latino, and International Medical Graduates Po licy Statement on Racism (in development) We are committed to anti-racism and to building a just and equitable society. Working together, we move forward with our efforts in strengthening our community that is built on dignity, respect, and trust.

The shooting of Mr. Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, appears to represent a failure to adhere to the credo of \"protect and serve\" while another Black family is destroyed and the lives of children unnecessarily endangered and forever traumatized due to actions of individuals sworn to protect them. While most police officers serve with honor and professionalism, the actions of a few officers betray this trust and once again, traumatized a family and a nation still grieving a growing list of Black lives unjustly lost at the hands of law enforcement personnel. This tragedy, like so many others that have taken the lives of Black men and women, should have never happened. Effective screening and training of police officers with mandated anti-racist and implicit bias training and other actions are urgently needed. Racism and trauma significantly impact children's physical and emotional health and development. AACAP stands by our mission to promote the healthy development of children, adolescents, and families through advocacy, education, and research. As a result, we cannot stand by silently while events like that in Kenosha traumatize Black children and families, while adversely affecting the moral fiber of our community. We send our thoughts and prayers to the Blake family, offer support for the children, and reiterate our resolute support for the principle that Black Lives Matter. # The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry promotes the healthy development of children, adolescents, and families through advocacy, education, and research.

SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2020 237 FOR YOUR INFORMATIONNo. 132; August 2020 Working with Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists in the Digital Age Healthcare technologies are changing rapidly. Child and adolescent psychiatrists increasingly use digital health tools such as video and messaging technologies, patient portals, and electronic health records. As a parent seeking care for your child, it is important to understand why and how these tools are used and what the risks and benefits are of using them. When seeking mental health care, you may want to ask how the clinician uses technology. Some clinicians use paper charts, while others use electronic records. While digital health tools can be very convenient and provide valuable information, it is important to understand how this data is used and protected. Asking the following questions can help you decide if a clinician's use of technology will be a good fit for you and your family. Virtual appointments Does this practice offer visits via video (telepsychiatry)? Wh at program is used? Wh at measures are taken to make sure information is protected and confidential? Ar e there any differences in cost or how insurance coverage works for visits via video or phone compared to in person? Do es video have to be used or can the appointment be by phone? Health records Does this practice use an electronic health record or paper charts? Is t he electronic health record shared or accessible between providers and systems? Is i t possible to opt out of or limit a clinician's use of electronic records for my child? Patient portal Is there a patient portal where I can access my child's information, such as upcoming appointments, health records, a nd billing information? Do es my access depend on the age of my child? Wh o has access in the case of divorced parents? Ca n a full medical record be accessed through the portal? If n ot, how can the record be requested? Providing clinical information Will electronic surveys or symptoms rating scales be sent out to us? Ar e they sent via the portal, email, text message or an app? Ho w are they used in treatment? Wh o has access to this information? Ca n we share data from our devices or health tracking apps, such as apps that track mood, sleep patterns or steps walked? (continued)238 AACAP NEWS FOR YOUR INFORMATIONCommunication How are email, text messages and voicemail used in this practice? Wh at measures are taken to maintain confidentiality and security when communicating using text messages or email? Ar e texting and email for requests such as scheduling changes or can they be used to discuss concerns about my child? Ca n my child contact their clinician directly via text, voicemail or email? Wh at is the best way to reach out in case of an emergency? Prescription refills How do we request prescription refills between appointments? Ar e prescriptions sent electronically to pharmacies? Ca n all types of prescriptions be sent electronically, including prescriptions for controlled substances such as stimulant medications? Billing How do I access billing information? Ca n bills be paid electronically? These are some questions that can help you understand how digital health tools are used. Federal and state laws, insurance plans and other policies can impact the use of technology in the care of your child. Ask the child and adolescent psychiatrist or health care provider you are working with if you have additional questions or concerns. # # # If you find Facts for Families\u00a9 helpful and would like to make good mental health a reality, consider donating to the Campaign for America's Kids .
