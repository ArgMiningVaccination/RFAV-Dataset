That's why so much is written about it'. That is the [title of a post](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/18/we-know-little-about-the-effect-of-diet-on-health-thats-why-so-much-is-written-about-it/) in which I advocate the view put by John Ioannidis that remarkably little is known about the health effects if individual nutrients. That ignorance has given rise to a vast industry selling advice that has little evidence to support it. The 2016 Conference of the so-called \"College of Medicine\" had the title \"Food, the Forgotten Medicine\". This post gives some background information about some of the speakers at this event. I'm sorry it appears to be too ad hominem, but the only way to judge the meeting is via the track record of the speakers. Quite a lot has been written here about the \"College of Medicine\". It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' late, unlamented, Foundation for Integrated Health. But unlike the latter, its name is disguises its promotion of quackery. [Originally](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) it was going to be called the \"College of Integrated Health\", but that wasn't sufficently deceptive so the name was dropped. For the history of the organisation, see [The new \"College of Medicine\" arising from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) [Don't be deceived.

Is Graeme Catto selling out?](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/05/03/the-college-of-medicine-is-in-the-pocket-of-crapita-capita-is-graeme-catto-selling-out/) The conference programme ( [download pdf](http://www.dcscience.net/College-of-Medicine-Food-conf-programme-2016.pdf)) is a masterpiece of [bait and switch](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Bait+and+switch). It is a mixture of very respectable people, and outright quacks. The former are invited to give legitimacy to the latter. The names may not be familiar to those who don't follow the antics of the magic medicine community, so here is a bit of information about some of them. The introduction to the meeting was by [Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Michael+Dixon) and [Catherine Zollman](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Zollman), both veterans of the Prince of Wales Foundation, and both devoted enthusiasts for magic medicne. [Zollman even believes](http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7217/1115.1) in the battiest of all forms of magic medicine, homeopathy ( [download pdf](Vickers-Zollman-homeopathy-1999.pdf)), for which she totally misrepresents the evidence. Zollman works now at the [Penny Brohn centre](http://www.pennybrohn.org.uk/) in Bristol. She's [also linked to](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Portland-Centre-4pp-A5-Programme-68048-FINAL-4.pdf) the \" [Portland Centre for integrative medicine](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/)\" which is run by [Elizabeth Thompson](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/07/27/dr-elizabeth-thompson-of-bristol-homeopathic-hospital-finds-that-pills-that-contain-nothing-have-no-effect-not-even-placebo-effect/), another advocate of homeopathy. It came into being after NHS Bristol shut down the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, on the very good grounds that it doesn't work. Now, like most magic medicine it is privatised. The [Penny Brohn shop](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/) will sell you a wide range of expensive and useless \"supplements\". For example, [Biocare Antioxidant capsules](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/collections/supplements-1/products/biocare-antioxidant-complex-90-vegecaps) at \u00a337 for 90. Biocare make [several unjustified claims](https://www.biocare.co.uk/default.aspx?GroupGuid=1053) for their benefits. Among other unnecessary ingredients, they contain a very small amount of green tea. That's a favourite of \"health food addicts\", and it was the subject of a [recent paper](http://www.dcscience.net/delaTorre-green-tea-2016.pdf) that contains one of the daftest statistical solecisms I've ever encountered \"To protect against type II errors, no corrections were applied for multiple comparisons\". If you don't understand that, try [this paper](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216). The results are almost certainly false positives, despite the fact that it appeared in Lancet Neurology. It's yet another example of broken peer review. It's been know for decades now that [ \"antioxidant\" is no more than a marketing term](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/03/anti-oxidant-supplements-dangerous-garlic-useless-update/), There is no evidence of benefit and large doses can be harmful. This obviously doesn't worry the College of Medicine. Margaret Rayman was the next speaker. She's a real nutritionist. Mixing the real with the crackpots is a standard bait and switch tactic. Eleni Tsiompanou, came next. She runs yet another [private \"wellness\" clinic](http://healthbeing.co.uk/), which makes all the usual exaggerated claims. She seems to have an [obsession with Hippocrates](http://healthbeing.co.uk/hippocrates/) (hint: medicine has moved on since then). [Dr Eleni's Joy Biscuits](http://healthbeing.co.uk/recipes/dr-elenis-joy-biscuits/) may or may not taste good, but their health-giving properties are make-believe. Andrew Weil, from the University of Arizona gave the keynote address. He's described as \"one of the world's leading authorities on Nutrition and Health\". That description alone is sufficient to show the fantasy land in which the College of Medicine exists. He's a typical supplement salesman, presumably very rich. There is no excuse for not knowing about him. It was 1988 when [Arnold Relman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_S._Relman) (who was editor of the New England Journal of Medicine) wrote [A Trip to Stonesville: Some Notes on Andrew Weil, M.D.](http://www.quackwatch.com/11Ind/weil.html). \"Like so many of the other gurus of alternative medicine, Weil is not bothered by logical contradictions in his argument, or encumbered by a need to search for objective evidence.\" This blog has mentioned his more [recent activities](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/02/17/quackademics-in-usa-and-canada/#arizona), many times. [Alex Richardson](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=7412), of Oxford Food and Behaviour Research (a charity, not part of the university) is an enthusiast for omega-3, a favourite of the supplement industry, She has published several papers that show little evidence of effectiveness. That looks entirely honest. On the other hand, [ their News section](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=342) contains many links to the notorious supplement industry lobby site, Nutraingredients, one of the least reliable sources of information on the web (I get their newsletter, a constant source of hilarity and raised eyebrows). I find this worrying for someone who claims to be evidence-based. I'm told that her charity is funded largely by the supplement industry (though I can't find any mention of that on the web site). Stephen Devries was a new name to me. You can infer what he's like from the fact that he has been endorsed byt Andrew Weil, and that his address is \"Institute for Integrative Cardiology\" (\"Integrative\" is the latest euphemism for quackery). Never trust any talk with a title that contains \"The truth about\". His was called \"The scientific truth about fats and sugars,\" In [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24PC0zYKLkk), he claims that diet has been shown to reduce heart disease by 70%. which gives you a good idea of his ability to assess evidence. But the claim doubtless helps to sell his books. Prof Tim Spector, of Kings College London, was next. As far as I know he's a perfectly respectable scientist, albeit one with [books to sell](http://www.tim-spector.co.uk/), But his talk [ is now online](https://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/food-medicine-diet-myths-microbes/?dm_i=PC7,4DPC1,3PB5TI,G3CAO,1), and it was a bit like a born-again microbiome enthusiast. He seemed to be too impressed by the PREDIMED study, despite it's statistical unsoundness, which was [pointed out by Ioannidis](http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-2013-nutrition-bmj.pdf). Little evidence was presented, though at least he was more sensible than the audience about the uselessness of multivitamin tablets. Simon Mills talked on \"Herbs and spices. Using Mother Nature's pharmacy to maintain health and cure illness\". He's a herbalist who has featured here [many times](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Simon+Mills%22). I can recommend especially his video about [Hot and Cold herbs](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/06/10/bait-and-switch-by-herbalists-chinese-and-western/) as a superb example of fantasy science. Annie Anderson, is [Professor of Public Health Nutrition](http://medicine.dundee.ac.uk/staff-member/professor-annie-s-anderson) and Founder of the Scottish Cancer Prevention Network. She's a respectable nutritionist and public health person, albeit with their customary disregard of [problems of causality](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/18/we-know-little-about-the-effect-of-diet-on-health-thats-why-so-much-is-written-about-it/). Patrick Holden is chair of the [Sustainable Food Trust](http://www.ciwf.org.uk/about-us/high-profile-supporters/visionaries/civil-society/patrick-holden-cbe/). He promotes \"organic farming\". Much though I dislike the cruelty of factory farms, the \"organic\" industry is largely a way of making food more expensive with no health benefits. The Michael Pittilo 2016 Student Essay Prize was awarded after lunch. Pittilo has [featured frequently](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=pittilo) on this blog as a result of his execrable promotion of quackery -see, in particular, [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/06/18/a-very-bad-report-gamma-minus-for-the-vice-chancellor/). Nutritional advice for patients with cancer. This discussion involved three people. Professor Robert Thomas, Consultant Oncologist, Addenbrookes and Bedford Hospitals, Dr Clare Shaw, Consultant Dietitian, Royal Marsden Hospital and Dr Catherine Zollman, GP and Clinical Lead, Penny Brohn UK. Robert Thomas came to my attention when I noticed that he, as a regular cancer consultant had spoken at a meeting of the quack charity, \"YestoLife\". When I saw he was scheduled tp speak at another quack conference. After I'd written to him to point out the track records of some of the people at the meeting, he withdrew from one of them. See [The exploitation of cancer patients is wicked. Carrot juice for lunch, then die destitute](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/03/25/the-exploitation-of-cancer-patients-is-wicked-carrot-juice-for-lunch-then-die-destitute/). The influence seems to have been temporary though. He continues to lend respectability to many dodgy meetings. He edits the [Cancernet web site](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/index.html). This site lends credence to bizarre treatments like [homeopathy](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-homeopathy.htm) and [crystal healing](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-crystal.htm). It used to sell [hair mineral analysis](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/nutritional-reports.htm), a well-known phony diagnostic method the main purpose of which is to sell you expensive \"supplements\". They still sell the \"Cancer Risk Nutritional Profile\". for \u00a3295.00, despite the fact that it provides no proven benefits. Robert Thomas designed a food \"supplement\", Pomi-T: capsules that contain Pomegranate, Green tea, Broccoli and Curcumin. Oddly, he seems still to subscribe to the antioxidant myth. Even the supplement industry [admits that that's a lost cause](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Regulation-Policy/Why-antioxidant-claims-have-been-killed-off-in-the-EU/?utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=22-Jun-2016&c=Spm99iS8YwD3CuvOLnW9pQ%3D%3D&p2=), but that doesn't stop its use in marketing. The one [randomised trial](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/pp-pomi-t.pdf) of these pills for prostate cancer was inconclusive. [Prostate Cancer UK says](http://prostatecanceruk.org/about-us/news-and-views/2013/6/superfoods) \"We would not encourage any man with prostate cancer to start taking Pomi-T food supplements on the basis of this research\". Nevertheless it's promoted on Cancernet.co.uk and widely sold. The [Pomi-T site boasts](https://www.pomi-t.co.uk/) about the (inconclusive) trial, but says \"Pomi-T\u00ae is not a medicinal product\". There was a cookery demonstration by Dale Pinnock \"The medicinal chef\" The programme does not tell us whether he made is signature dish \"the [ Famous Flu Fighting Soup](http://www.dalepinnock.com/flu-fighting-soup-itvs-this-morning/)\". Needless to say, there isn't the slightest reason to believe that his soup has the slightest effect on flu. In summary, the whole meeting was devoted to exaggerating vastly the effect of particular foods. It also acted as advertising for people with something to sell. Much of it was outright quackery, with a leavening of more respectable people, a standard part of the bait-and-switch methods used by all quacks in their attempts to make themselves sound respectable. I find it impossible to tell how much the participants actually believe what they say, and how much it's a simple commercial drive. The thing that really worries me is why someone like Phil Hammond supports this sort of thing by chairing their meetings (as he did for the \"College of Medicine's\" direct predecessor, the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. His defence of the NHS has made him something of a hero to me. He assured me that he'd asked people to stick to evidence. In that he clearly failed. I guess they must pay well. Follow-up This is my version of a [post which I was asked to write for the Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rio-2016-cupping-michael-phelps-swimming-what-is-it-does-it-work-no-gwyneth-paltrow-cups-marks-a7182411.html). It's been published, though so many changes were made by the editor that I'm posting the original here ( [below](#indy)). Superstition is rife in all sports. Mostly it does no harm, and it might even have a placebo effect that's sufficient to make a difference of 0.01%. That might just get you a medal. But what does matter is that superstition has given rise to an army of charlatans who are only to willing to sell their magic medicine to athletes, most of whom are not nearly as rich as Phelps. So much has been said about cupping during the last week that it's hard to say much that's original. Yesterday I did six radio interviews and two for TV, and today Associated Press TV came to film a piece about it. Everyone else must have been on holiday. The only one I've checked was the piece on the BBC News channel. That one didn't seem to go too badly, so it's here BBC news coverage It starts with the usual lengthy, but uninformative, pictures of someone being cupped, The cupper in this case was actually a chiropractor, [Rizwhan Suleman](http://www.gcc-uk.org/chiropractor-search/?postcode=&surname=suleman). Chiropractic is, of course a totally different form of alternative medicine and its value has [been totally discredited](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=chiropractic+colic) in the wake of the Simon Singh case. It's not unusual for people to sell different therapies with conflicting beliefs. Truth is irrelevant. Once you've believed one impossible thing, it seems that the next ones become quite easy. The presenter, Victoria Derbyshire, gave me a fair chance to debunk it afterwards. Nevertheless, the programme suffered from the usual pretence that there is a controversy about the medical value of cupping. There isn't. But despite Steve Jones' excellent report to the BBC Trust, the media insist on giving equal time to flat-earth advocates. The report, ( [Review of impartiality and accuracy of the BBC's coverage of science](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/our_work/editorial_standards/impartiality/science_impartiality.html)) was no doubt commissioned with good intentions, but it's been largely ignored. Still worse, the BBC News Channel, when it repeated the item (its cycle time is quite short) showed only [Rizwhan Suleman](http://www.gcc-uk.org/chiropractor-search/?postcode=&surname=suleman) and cut out my comments altogether. This is not false balance. It's no balance whatsoever. A formal complaint has been sent. It is not the job of the BBC to provide free advertising to quacks. After this, a friend drew my attention to a much worse programme on the subject. The Jeremy Vine show on [BBC Radio 2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07mjrn6), at 12.00 on August 10th, 2016. This was presented by Vanessa Feltz. It was beyond appalling. There was absolutely zero attempt at balance, false or otherwise. The guest was described as being am \"expert\" on cupping. He was [Yusef Noden](http://www.londonhijamaclinic.com/practitioners/), of the London Hijama Clinic, who \"trained and qualified with the Hijama & Prophetic Medicine Institute\". No doubt he's a nice bloke, but he really could use a first year course in physiology. His words were pure make-believe. His repeated statements about \"withdrawing toxins\" are well know to be absolutely untrue. It was embarrassing to listen to. If you really want to hear it, here is an audio recording. The [Jeremy Vine show](http://www.dcscience.net/Cupping.m4a) This programme is one of the worst cases I've heard of the BBC mis-educating the public by providing free advertising for quite outrageous quackery. Another complaint will be submitted. The only form of opposition was a few callers who pointed out the nonsense, mixed with callers who endorsed it. That is not, by any stretch of the imagination, fair and balanced. It's interesting that, although cupping is often associated with Traditional Chinese Medicine, neither of the proponents in these two shows was Chinese, but rather they were Muslim. This should not be surprising as neither cupping nor acupuncture are exclusively Chinese. Similar myths have arisen in many places. My first encounter with this particular branch of magic medicine was when I was asked to make a [podcast for \"Things Unseen\"](http://www.thingsunseen.co.uk/podcasts/complementary-medicine-a-matter-of-faith/), in which I debated with a Muslim hijama practitioner and an Indian Ayurvedic practitioner. It's even harder to talk sense to practitioners of magic medicine who believe that god is on their side, as well as believing that selling nonsense is a good way to make a living. An excellent history of the complex emergence of similar myths in different parts of the world has been published by Ben Kavoussi, under the title \" [Acupuncture is astrology with needles](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/astrology-with-needles/)\". Now the original version of my [blog for the Independent.](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rio-2016-cupping-michael-phelps-swimming-what-is-it-does-it-work-no-gwyneth-paltrow-cups-marks-a7182411.html) Cupping: Michael Phelps and Gwyneth Paltrow may be believers, but the truth behind it is what really sucks The sight of Olympic swimmer, Michael Phelps, with bruises on his body caused by [cupping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupping_therapy) resulted in something of a media feeding-frenzy this week. He's a great athlete so cupping must be responsible for his performance, right? Just as cupping must be responsible for the complexion of an earlier enthusiast, Gwyneth Paltrow. The main thing in common between Phelps and Paltrow is that they both have a great deal of money, and neither has much interest in how you distinguish truth from myth. They can afford to indulge any whim, however silly. And cupping is pretty silly. It's a pre-scientific medical practice that started in a time when there was no understanding of physiology, much like bloodletting. Indeed one version does involve a bit of bloodletting. Perhaps bloodletting is the best argument against the belief that it's ancient wisdom, so it must work. It was a standard part of medical treatment for hundreds of years, and killed countless people. It is desperately implausible that putting suction cups on your skin would benefit anything, so it's not surprising that there is no worthwhile empirical evidence that it does. The Chinese version of cupping is related to acupuncture and, unlike cupping, acupuncture has been very thoroughly tested. Over 3000 trials have failed to show any benefit that's big enough to benefit patients. [Acupuncture is no more than a theatrical placebo](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/). And even its placebo effects are too small to be useful. At least it's likely that cupping usually does no lasting damage.. We don't know for sure because in the world of alternative medicine there is no system for recording bad effects (and there is a vested interest in not reporting them). In extreme cases, it can [leave holes in your skin](http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/popular-treatment-known-as-cupping-therapy-leaves-man-with-seven-holes-in-his-back/news-story/33b979706858045dc7fcce1523772084) that pose a serious danger of infection, but most people probably end up with just broken capillaries and bruises. Why would anyone want that? The answer to that question seems to be a mixture of wishful thinking about the benefits and vastly exaggerated claims made by the people who sell the product. It's typical that the sales people can't even agree on what the benefits are alleged to be. If selling to athletes, the claim may be that it relieves pain, or that it aids recovery, or that it increases performance. Exactly the same cupping methods are sold to celebs with the claim that their beauty will be improved because cupping will \" [boost your immune system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBnZdxCUXbk&feature=youtu.be)\". This claim is universal in the world of make-believe medicine, when the salespeople can think of nothing else. There is no surer sign of quackery. It means nothing whatsoever. No procedure is known to boost your immune system. And even if anything did, it would be more likely to [cause inflammation and blood clots](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/boost-your-immune-system/) than to help you run faster or improve your complexion. It's certainly most unlikely that sucking up bits of skin into evacuated jars would have any noticeable effect on blood flow in underlying muscles, and so increase your performance. The [salespeople would undoubtedly benefit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBnZdxCUXbk&feature=youtu.be) from a first year physiology course. Needless to say, they haven't tried to actually measuring blood flow, or performance. To do that might reduce sales. As [Kate Carter said recently](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/aug/08/does-cupping-do-olympic-athletes-any-good) \"Eating jam out of those jars would probably have a more significant physical impact\". The problem with all sports medicine is that tiny effects could make a difference. When three hour endurance events end with a second or so separating the winner from the rest, that is an effect of less than 0.01%. Such tiny effects will never be detectable experimentally. That leaves the door open to every charlatan to sell miracle treatments that might just work. If, like steroids, they do work, there is a good chance that they'll harm your health in the long run. You might be better off eating the jam. Here is a very small selection of the many excellent accounts of cupping on the web. There have been many good blogs. The mainstream media have, on the whole, been dire. Here are three that I like, | | In July 2016, Orac posted in ScienceBlogs. \" | | Photo Timothy Caulfield, wrote \" [Olympic debunk](http://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/august-2016/olympic-debunk/)!\". He's Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Alberta, and the author of Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong about Everything. \"The Olympics are a wonderful celebration of athletic performance. But they have also become an international festival of sports pseudoscience. It will take an Olympic-sized effort to fight this bunk and bring a win to the side of evidence-based practice.\" Jennifer Raff wrote [Pseudoscience is common among elite athletes outside of the Olympics too...and it makes me furious](https://violentmetaphors.com/2016/08/09/pseudoscience-is-common-among-elite-athletes-outside-of-the-olympics-too-and-it-makes-me-furious/). She works on the genomes of modern and ancient people at the University of Kansas, and, as though that were not a full-time job for most people, she writes blogs, books and she's also \"training (and occasionally competing) in Muay Thai, boxing, BJJ, and \"I'm completely unsurprised to find that pseudoscience [is common]among the elite athletes competing in the Olympics. I've seen similar things rampant in the combat sports world as well.\" What she writes makes perfect sense. Just don't bother with the comments section which is littered with Trump-like post-factual comments from anonymous conspiracy theorists. Follow-up This post was written for the [Spectator Health section](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/spectator-surgery/2015/05/prince-charless-letters-reveal-the-extent-of-his-lobbying-for-dangerous-alternative-medicine/), at short notice after the release of the spider letters. The following version is almost the same as appeared there, with a few [updates](#acu). Some of the later sections are self-plagiarised from earlier posts. Picture: Getty The age of enlightenment was a beautiful thing. People cast aside dogma and authority. They started to think for themselves. Natural science flourished. Understanding of the natural world increased. The hegemony of religion slowly declined. Eventually real universities were created and real democracy developed. The modern world was born. People like Francis Bacon, Voltaire and Isaac Newton changed the world for the better. Well, that's what most people think. But not Charles, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall. In 2010 he said \"I was accused once of being the enemy of the Enlightenment,\" he told a conference at St James's Palace. \"I felt proud of that.\" \"I thought, 'Hang on a moment'. The Enlightenment started over 200 years ago. It might be time to think again and review it and question whether it is really effective in today's conditions.\" It seems that the Prince preferred things as they were before 1650. That's a remarkable point of view for someone who, if he succeeds, will become the patron of that product of the age of enlightenment, the Royal Society, a venture that got its Royal Charter from King Charles II in1622. I suppose that the Prince cannot be blamed for his poor education. He may have been at Trinity College Cambridge, his 2.2 degree is the current euphemism for a fail (it seems that he even failed to learn the dates of the enlightenment). His behaviour has brought to the fore the question of the role of the monarchy. A constitutional monarch is purely ceremonial and plays no part in politics. Well actually in the UK it isn't quite as simple as that. The first problem is that we have no constitution. Things haven't changed much since the 19th century when Walter Bagehot said \"the Sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy... three rights\u2014the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.\". These are real powers in a country which is meant to be run by elected representatives. But nobody knows how these powers are used: it is all done in secret. Well, almost all. The Prince of Wales has been unusually public in expressing his views. His views bear directly on government policy in many areas: medicine, architecture, agriculture and the environment. These are mostly areas that involve at least an elementary knowledge of science. But that is something that he lacks. Worse still, he seems to have no consciousness of his ignorance. The Royal family should clearly have no influence whatsoever on government policies in a democracy. And they should be seen to have no influence. The Queen is often praised for her neutrality, but the fact is that nobody has the slightest idea what happens at the weekly meetings between the Prime Minister and the Queen. I doubt that she advises the prime minister to create a National Health Service, or to tax the rich. We shall never know that. We should do. Almost the only light that has been thrown on the secret activities of Charles was the release, on 13 May, of 27 letters that the Prince wrote to government ministers in the Blair government between 2004 and 2005. It has take 10 years of effort by the Guardian to get hold of the letters. It was ike getting blood from a stone. When the Information Commissioner ruled that the letters should be made public, the decision was vetoed by the Conservative attorney general, Dominic Grieve. [He said](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/written-ministerial-statement-freedom-of-information-act-veto-of-release-of-prince-charles-letters). of the \"particularly frank\" letters, \" Disclosure of the correspondence could damage The Prince of Wales' ability to perform his duties when he becomes King.\" That, of course, is precisely why the documents should be revealed. If Charles' ability to perform his duty as King is damaged, should his subjects be kept unaware of that fact? Of course not. In this case, the law prevailed over the attorney general. After passing through the hands of 16 different judges, the Supreme Court eventually ruled, in March, that the government's attempts to block release were unlawful. The government spent over \u00a3400,000 in trying, and failing, to conceal what we should know. The Freedom of Information Act (2000) is the best thing that Tony Blair did, though he, and Jack Straw, thought it was the worst. I expect they are afraid of what it might reveal about their own records. Transparency is not favoured by governments of any hue. What do the letters say? You can read all the letters on the [Guardian web site](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2015/may/13/read-the-prince-charles-black-spider-memos-in-full). They give the impression of being written by a rather cranky old man with bees in his bonnet and too much time on his hands. The problem is that not all cranky old men can write directly to the prime minister, and get an answer. Not all the letters are wrong headed. But all attempt to change government policy. They represent a direct interference in the political process by the heir to the throne. That is unacceptable in a democracy. It disqualifies him from becoming king. Some letters verged on the bizarre. | | 21 October 2004 I particularly hope that the illegal fishing of the Patagonian Toothfish will be high on your list of priorities because until the trade is stopped, there is little hope for the poor old albatross. No doubt illegal fishing is a problem, but not many people would write directly to a minister about the Patagonian Toothfish. Others I agree with. But they are still attempts to influence the policies of the elected government. This one was about the fact that supermarkets pay so little to dairy farmers for milk that sometimes it's cheaper than bottled water. | | To Tony Blair 8 September 2004 \". . . unless United Kingdom co-operatives can grow sufficiently the processors and retailers will continue to have the farmers in an arm lock and we will continue to shoot ourselves in the foot! You did kindly say that you would look at this . . . \". Yours ever, Charles He wrote to the minister of education to try to influence education policy. | | 22 February 2005 \"I understand from your predecessor, Charles Clarke, that he has spoken to you about my most recent letter of 24th November, and specifically about the impact of my Education Summer School for teachers of English and History. This Programme, which involves up to ninety state school teachers each year, has been held over the past three years in Dartington, Devon, at Dunston, in Norfolk and at Buxton, in Derbyshire. I believe that they have added fresh inspiration to the national debate about the importance of English Literature and History in schools.\" Despite having made substantial progress, as you may be aware I remain convinced that the correct approaches to teaching and learning need to be challenged It's interesting that the meeting was in Dartington. That's near Totnes (\" [twinned with Narnia](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/03/25/the-exploitation-of-cancer-patients-is-wicked-carrot-juice-for-lunch-then-die-destitute/)\") and it's a centre for the bizarre educational cult promoted by the mystic and racist, [Rudolf Steiner](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/10/06/the-true-nature-of-steiner-waldorf-education-mystical-barmpottery-at-taxpayers-expense-part-1/). Then we get a reference to one of Charles' most bizarre beliefs, alternative medicine. | | 24 February 2005 Dear Prime Minister, We briefly mentioned the European Union Directive on Herbal Medicines, which is having such a deleterious effect on complementary medicine sector in this country by effectively outlawing the use of certain herbal extracts. I think we both agreed this was using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. You rightly asked me what could be done about it and I am asking the Chief Executive of my Foundation for Integrated Health to provide a more detailed briefing which I hope to be able to send shortly so that your advisers can look at it. Meanwhile, I have given Martin Hurst a note suggesting someone he could talk to who runs the Herbal Practitioner's Association. Yours ever, Charles In this he opposes the [ EU Directive on Herbal Medicines](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/). All this directive did was to insist that there was some anecdotal evidence for the safety of things that are sold to you. It asked for no evidence at all that they work, and it allowed very [misleading labels](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/). It provided the weakest form of protection from the deluded and charlatans. It was put into effect in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA). They even allowed products that were registered under this scheme to display an [impressive-looking \"kite-mark\". ](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/) Most people would interpret this as a government endorsement of herbal medicines. This got a sympathetic response from Tony Blair, someone who, along with his wife, was notoriously sympathetic to magic medicine. | | 30 March 2005 Dear Prince Charles Thanks too for your contacts on herbal medicines who have been sensible and constructive. They feel that the directive itself is sound and the UK regulators excellent, but are absolutely correct in saying that the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy. We can do quite a lot here: we will delay implementation for all existing products to 2011; we will take more of the implementation upon ourselves; and I think we can sort out the problems in the technical committee - where my European experts have some very good ideas. We will be consulting with your contacts and others on the best way to do this we simply cannot have burdensome regulation here. Yours ever, Tony Note \"absolutely correct in saying that the implementation as it is currently planned is crazy. We can do quite a lot here: we will delay implementation for all existing products to 2011\". Government support for [acupuncture](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/30/acupuncture-is-a-theatrical-placebo-the-end-of-a-myth/) and herbal medicine was made explicit in [a letter from](http://www.dcscience.net/DH_Herbal_Medicine_Scanned_Letter.pdf) Health Secretary, [John Reid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Reid,_Baron_Reid_of_Cardowan) (February 2005). He assures the prince that government is taking action to \"enhance the status of the herbal medicine and acupuncture professions\". Nothing could reveal more clearly the clueless attitude of the then government to quackery. In fact, after 15 years of wrangling, the promised recognition of herbalism by statutory regulation [never happened](http://www.dcscience.net/2015/03/30/herbs-get-the-push-no-statutory-regulation-for-western-herbalists-or-traditional-chinese-medicine/). One is reminded of the time that an equally-clueless minister, [Lord (Phillip) Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hunt,_Baron_Hunt_of_Kings_Heath), referred to [ 'psychic surgery' as a \"profession\"](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/05/22/lord-hunt-thinks-psychic-surgery-is-a-profession/). We got a preview of the Prince's letters a month before the release when Max Hastings [wrote in the Spectator](http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-week/diary/9487542/max-hastingss-diary-the-joys-of-middle-age-and-prince-charless-strange-letters/) I have beside me a copy of a letter allegedly written by him some years ago to a cultural institution, asserting the conviction that 'there is a DIVINE Source which is ultimate TRUTH... that this Truth can be expressed by means of numbers... and that, if followed correctly, these principles can be expressed with infinite variety to produce Beauty'. You can't get much barmier than that. Are the letters harmless? That has been the reaction on the BBC. I can't agree. In one sense they so trivial that it's amazing that the government thought it was a good use of \u00a3400,000 to conceal them. But they are all the evidence that we'll get of the Prince's very direct attempts to influence the political process. The Prince of Wales is more than just a crank. He has done real harm. Here are some examples. When the generally admirable NHS Choices re-wrote their advice on homeopathy (the medicines that contain no medicine) the new advice took two years to appear. [ It was held up in the Department of Health](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/02/13/policy-based-evidence-department-of-health-and-princes-foundation-censor-accurate-information-about-magic-medicines/) while consultations were made with the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. That's Charles' lobby organisation for crackpot medicine. (The word \"integrated\" is the euphemism for alternative medicine that's in favour with its advocates.) If it were not for the fact that I used the Freedom of Information Act to find out what was going on, the public would have been given bad advice as a direct result of the Prince's political interference. The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) [folded in 2010](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/04/30/the-end-of-the-princes-foundation-for-magic-medicine/) as a result of a financial scandal, but it was quickly [reincarnated as the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/10/29/dont-be-deceived-the-new-college-of-medicine-is-a-fraud-and-delusion/). It was originally [going to be named the College of Integrated Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/), but it was soon decided that this sounded too much like quackery, so it was given the deceptive name, College of Medicine. It appears to be [financed by well-known outsourcing company Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/05/03/the-college-of-medicine-is-in-the-pocket-of-crapita-capita-is-graeme-catto-selling-out/). It's closely connected with Dr Michael Dixon, who was medical advisor to the FIH, and who tried to [derail the advice given by NHS Choices](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/02/13/policy-based-evidence-department-of-health-and-princes-foundation-censor-accurate-information-about-magic-medicines/). Perhaps the worst example of interference by the Prince of Wales, was his [attempt to get an academic fired](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/12/hrh-\"meddling-in-politics\"/). Prof Edzard Ernst is the UK's foremost expert on alternative medicine. He has examined with meticulous care the evidence for many sorts of alternative medicine.Unfortunately for its advocates, it turned out that there is very little evidence that any of it works. This attention to evidence annoyed the Prince, and a letter was sent from Clarence House to Ernst's boss, the vice-chancellor of the University of Exeter, Steve Smith. Shamefully, Smith didn't tell the prince to mind his ow business, but instead subjected Ernst to disciplinary proceedings, After subjecting him to a year of misery, he was let off with a condescending warning letter, but Ernst was forced to retire early. In 2011and the vice-chancellor was rewarded with a knighthood. His university has lost an honest scientist but [continues to employ quacks](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/05/31/acupuncturists-show-that-acupuncture-doesnt-work-but-conclude-the-opposite-journal-fails/). Not just interfering but costing taxpayers' money The Prince's influence seems to be big in the Department of Health (DH). He was given \u00a337,000 of taxpayers' money to produce his Patients' Guide (I produced [a better version](http://www.dcscience.net/magic-medicine-the-short-version/) for nothing). And he was paid an astonishing \u00a3900,000 by DH to prepare the ground for the setting up of the hapless self-regulator, the [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) (CNHC, also known as Ofquack). The Prince of Wales' business, Duchy Originals, [has been condemned](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-440103/Duchy-original-sins--Charles-range-spotlight.html) by the Daily Mail, (of all places) for selling unhealthy foods. And when his business branched into selling quack \"detox\" and herbal nonsense he found himself censured by both [the MHRA](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/03/duchy-originals-pork-pies.html) and the [Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2009/5/Duchy-Originals-Ltd/TF_ADJ_46199.aspx) (ASA) for making unjustifiable medical claims for these products. It runs in the family The Prince of Wales is not the only member of the royal family to be obsessed with bizarre forms of medicine. The first homeopath to the British royal family, Frederick Quin, was a son of the Duchess of Devonshire (1765-1824). Queen Mary (1865-1953), wife of King George V, headed the fundraising efforts to move and expand the London Homeopathic Hospital. King George VI was so enthusiastic that in 1948 he conferred the royal title on the London Homeopathic Hospital. The Queen Mother loved homeopathy too (there is no way to tell whether this contributed to her need for a colostomy in the 1960s). The present Queen's homeopathic physician is Peter Fisher, who is medical director of what, until recently was called the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH). In 2010 that hospital was rebranded as the Royal London Hospital for Integrated medicine (RLHIM) in another unsubtle bait and switch move. The RLHIM is a [great embarrassment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4213) to the otherwise excellent UCLH Trust. It has been repeatedly [condemned by the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=6089#follow) for making false claims. As a consequence, it has been forced to withdraw all of its patient information. The patron of the RLHIM is the Queen, not the Prince of Wales. It is hard to imagine that this anachronistic institution would still exist if it were not for the influence, spoken or unspoken, of the Queen. Needless to say we will never be told. The royal warrant for a firm that sells \"meningitis vaccine\" that contains nothing Ainsworth's homeopathic pharmacy is endorsed by both Prince Charles and the Queen: it has [ two Royal Warrants](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/04/yet-another-incompetent-regulator-the-general-pharmaceutical-council-is-criminally-negligent/), one from each of them. They sell \"homeopathic vaccines\" for meningitis, measles, rubella and whooping cough. These \"vaccines\" contain nothing whatsoever so they are obviously a real danger to public health. Despite the fact that Ainsworth's had already been [censured by the ASA](http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/7/Ainsworths-(London)-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_148070.aspx) in 2011 for selling similar products, Ainsworth's continued to recommend them with a \" [casual disregard for the law](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/ainsworths-pharmacy.html)\". The regulator (the MHRA) failed to step in to stop them until it was eventually stirred into action by a young BBC reporter, Sam Smith who made a [programme for BBC South West](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZf9mUzI4RI&feature=c4-overview&list=UUei35H3nu7bduw-6DBJFGrQ). Then, at last, the somnolent regulator was stirred into action. The MHRA \"told Ainsworths to stop advertising a number of products\" (but apparently not to stop making them or selling them). They still sell Polonium metal 30C and Swine Meningitis 36C, and a booklet that recommends homeopathic \"vaccination\". Ainsworth's sales are no doubt helped by the Royal Warrants. The consequence is that people may die of meningitis. In 2011, the MHRA Chief Executive Professor Kent Woods, was knighted. It was [ commented](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2013/01/why-does-the-mhra-not-close-down-these-homeopaths.html), justly, that \"Children will be harmed by this inaction. Children will die. And the fault must lie with Professor Sir Kent Woods, chairman of the regulator \" But the regulator has to fight the political influence of the Queen and Prince Charles. They lost. The attorney general, while trying to justify the secrecy of Charles' letters, said \"It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the Monarch is a politically neutral figure\". Questions about health policy are undoubtedly political, and the highly partisan interventions of the Prince in the political process make his behaviour unconstitutional. The Prince's petulant outbursts not only endanger patients. They endanger the monarchy itself. Whether that matters depends on how much you value the tourist business generated by the Gilbert & Sullivan flummery at which royals excel. The least that one can ask of the royal family is that they should not endanger the health of the nation. It would help if they refrained from using their influence on matters that are beyond their intellectual grasp.. If I wanted to know the winner of the 2.30 at Ascot, I'd ask a royal. For any other question I'd ask someone with more education. Follow-up The letters have made headlines in just about every newspaper. The Guardian had extensive coverage, of course. The Times had a front page story \"Revealed: how Charles got Blair to alter health policy\" [ The British Medical Journal wrote \"Prince Charles delayed regulation of herbal medicines\" [ For me, the most shocking item was an interview given by Jack Straw, on Radio 4's Today Programme. He was Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 and Foreign Secretary from 2001 to 2006 under Tony Blair. From 2007 to 2010 he was Lord Chancellor. His response to the letters sounded like that of a right-wing conservative. Like Blair. he deplored the Freedom of Information Act that his own government passed. He defended the secrecy, and supported the Conservative attorney-general's attempt to veto the release of the letters. Perhaps his defence of secrecy is not surprising, He has a lot to hide, His involvement in the mendacity that led to the Iraq war, the dodgy dossier, his role in covering up torture (the \"rendition\" scandal). And He was [suspended by the Labour party](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/22/jack-straw-malcolm-rifkind-cash-for-access-channel-4-dispatches-telegraph) in February 2015 due to allegation of cash bribes. He is certainly a man with plenty of things to hide. The [last email of Stefan Grimm](http://www.dcscience.net/2014/12/01/publish-and-perish-at-imperial-college-london-the-death-of-stefan-grimm/), and its [follow-up post](http://www.dcscience.net/2014/12/23/some-experiences-of-life-at-imperial-college-london-an-external-inquiry-is-needed-after-the-death-of-stefan-grimm/), has been read over 195,000 times now. After Grimm's death, Imperial announced that it would investigate itself The [report is now available](/Imperial-Performance-Management-Review-FULL.pdf). | | Performance Management: Review of policies, procedures and support available to staff Following the tragic death of a member of the College's staff community, Professor Stefan Grimm, the Provost invited the Senior Consul, Professor Richard Thompson, and the Director of Human Resources, Mrs Louise Lindsay, to consider the relevant College policies, procedures and the support available to all staff during performance review. The report is even worse than I expected. It can be paraphrased as saying 'our bullying was not done sufficiently formally -we need more forms and box-ticking'. At the heart of the problem is Imperial's Personal Review and Development Plan (PRDP). Here is an extract. \"Professor Grimm had been under review in the informal process for nearly two years. His line manager was using this period to help Professor Grimm obtain funding or alternative work (the review panel saw evidence of the efforts made in this regard). The subsequent formal process would have involved a minimum of two formal meetings with time to improve in-between formal meetings before consideration would have been given to the termination of Professor Grimm's employment. Understandably there is a reluctance to move into formal hearings, particularly when the member of staff is hard working and diligent, but the formal stages would have provided more clarity to Professor Grimm on process and support through the written documentation, representation at meetings and HR involvement.\" \"It is recommended that the new capability procedure and ordinance include greater clarity on timescales for informal action and how this might operate in different roles.\" It seems to be absurd to describe [Wilkins' letter](http://www.dcscience.net/2014/12/01/publish-and-perish-at-imperial-college-london-the-death-of-stefan-grimm/#051214) has an attempt to \"help\" Professor Grimm, It was a direct threat to the livelihood of a competent 51 year-old full professor. Having flow charts for the bullying would not have helped. Neither would the provision by HR of \"resilience\" courses ( [what I've seen of such classes](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/01/09/dodgy-questionnaires-and-dubious-projects-wellbeing-part-2/) makes me feel suicidal at the thought of how far universities have sunk into pseudo-scientific HR babble). I'll skip straight to the conclusions, with my comments on them in italic. 1. Expand the Harassment Support Contact Programme to train volunteers, academic staff, who can be matched with individuals going through informal processes. Looks like a charade to me. If they want to fire people without enough grants, they'll do it. 2. Refresh and re-launch information on the employee assistance services widespread distribution and regular update of promotional material. Ditto 3. Ensure regular training is given to new and experienced managers in core HR procedures. Train senior people to bully properly. 4. Create a separate guidance and support document for staff to supplement document. The document to include a clear and concise summary of the informal formal process, a flowchart, the support available to staff and frequently asked questions Pretend that staff are being helped by threatening to fire them. 5. Direct managers to inform HR before commencing the informal stage of performance management. All managers to have a briefing from their local HR representative of the instigation of performance management. Make sure you've filled in the forms and ticked the boxes before you start bullying. HR don't understand performance and should have no role in the process. 6. Create a separate policy for performance management in the form of procedure, which includes clear definitions for informal and formal performance management and further guidance on the timescales and correspondence in stages. Provide clarity on the role of the PRDP appraisal in performance management. The role PRDP is to increase the status of Imperial College, but pretend it's to benefit its victims. 7. Create template documentation for performance management correspondence and formal stages of the process. Direct managers to ensure all correspondence reviewed by an HR representative before it is sent to a member of staff. Bullying is OK if you've filled in enough forms. In summary, these proposals merely add more bureaucracy. They won't change anything. As one supposed, they are merely a smokescreen for carrying on as at present. There is only one glimmer of hope in the whole report. | | Additional recommendation Although this was not within the remit of the current review, a number of concerns were raised with the reviewers about the application and consistency of approach in the use of performance metrics in academia and in the College. The reviewers recommend that the College undertake a wider consultation and review of the application of performance metrics within Imperial College with recommendations to be considered by the Provost's Board in the summer term. I've been [telling them since 2007](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/08/03/how-should-universities-be-run-to-get-the-best-out-of-people/) that the metrics they use to judge people are plain silly [ [download the paper](http://dcscience.net/colquhoun-goodscience-jp-version-2007.pdf)]. So have many other people. Could the message have sunk in at last? We'll see. What should be done about performance? I've been very critical of the metrics that are used by Imperial (and some other places) to harass even quite senior people. So, it might well be asked how I think that standards should be maintained. If people are paid by the taxpayers, it isn't unreasonable to expect them to work to the best of their abilities. The following observations come to mind. - Take a [lesson from Bell Labs](http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/21/2887206/jon-gertner-idea-factory-bell-labs-great-american-age-innovation-book-review)in its heyday (before performance managers got power) . \"First, management had to be technically competent; at Bell Labs, all managers were former researchers. Second, no researchers should have to raise funds. They should be free of that pressure. Third, research should and would be supported for years - if you want your company to last, take the long view. And finally, a project could be terminated without damning the researcher. There should be no fear of failure.\" - Take a lesson from the great [Max Perutz about how to run a successful lab](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/08/11/the-mismeasurement-of-science-2/).\"Max had the knack of picking extraordinary talent. But he also had the vision of creating a working environment where talented people were left alone to pursue their ideas. This philosophy lives on in the LMB and has been adopted by other research institutes as well. Max insisted that young scientists should be given full responsibility and credit for their work. There was to be no hierarchy, and everybody from the kitchen ladies to the director were on first-name terms. The groups were and still are small, and senior scientists work at the bench.\" - Read [Gus John](http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2014/dec/16/bullying-higher-education-university-managers)\"The results of the Guardian higher education network's survey on bullying in higher education should give the entire sector cause to worry about the competence and style of leaders and managers in the sector\" - The vast majority of scientists whom I know work absurdly long hours. They are doing their best without any harassment from \"performance managers\". Some are more successful, and/or lucky, than others. That's how it is. Get used to it. - Rankings of universities are arbitrary and silly, but worse, they provide an incentive to vice-chancellors to justify their vast salaries by pushing their institution up the rankings by fair means or foul. It's no exaggeration to suspect that things like the Times Higher Education rankings and the REF contributed to the death of Stefan Grimm. - Realise that HR know nothing about science: their \"performance management\" kills original science, and it leads to corruption. It must bear some of the blame for the crisis in the reproducibility of published work. - If you want innovation, you have to [tolerate lots and lots of failur](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-decision-maker/the-power-of-failing/)e Follow-up Stop press On April 7th, [the coroner said](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/stefan-grimm-inquest-new-policies-may-not-have-prevented-suicide/2019563.article) the Grimm had asphyxiated himself on 25 September, 2014. He described the death as \"needless\"/ And Imperial's HR director, Louise Lindsay, when asked if the new procedures would have saved his life, said \"not clear it would have resulted in a different outcome.\". So we have it from the horse's mouth. Imperial has done nothing to prevent more tragedies happening. 10 April 2015 King's College London has just issued a draft for its \"performance management\" system. You can [read all about it here](http://www.dcscience.net/2014/06/07/bad-financial-management-at-kings-college-london-means-vc-rick-trainor-is-firing-120-scientists/#100415). \"Performance management is a direct incentive to do shoddy short-cut science.\" 17 April 2015 Alice Gast declines to apologise At 06.22 on Radio 4's Today Programme, Tanya Beckett interviewed Alice Gast. President of Imperial College London. After a 4-minute commercial for Imperial, Gast is asked about the death of Stefan Grimm. Her reply doesn't even mention Grimm. \"professors are under a lot of pressure . . .\". Not a word of apology or explanation is offered. I find it hard to comprehend such a heartless approach to her employees. 1 May 2015 The Imperial students' newspaper, Felix Online, carried a description of the internal report and the inquest: [Review in response to Grimm's death completed. Results criticised by external academics: \"Imperial doesn't get it.\"](http://felixonline.co.uk/news/5475/review-in-response-to-grimms-death-completed/), It's pretty good.. I wonder what undergraduates feel about being taught by people who write [letters like Martin Wilkins](http://www.dcscience.net/2014/12/01/publish-and-perish-at-imperial-college-london-the-death-of-stefan-grimm/#051214)' did? It makes a nice change to be able to compliment an official government report. | | Ever since the House of Lords report in 2000, the government has been vacillating about what should be done about herbalists. At the moment both western herbalists and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are essentially unregulated. Many (but not all) herbalists have been pushing for statutory regulation, which they see as government endorsement. It would give them a status like the General Medical Council. | | A [ new report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/417768/Report_on_Regulation_of_Herbal_Medicines_and_Practitioners.pdf) has ruled out this possibility, for very good reasons [ [download local copy](/Report_on_Regulation_of_Herbal_Medicines_and_Practitioners.pdf)]. Back story (abridged!) My involvement began with the publication in 2008 of a report on the Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine . That led to my post, [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/06/18/a-very-bad-report-gamma-minus-for-the-vice-chancellor/). [The report](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2008.pdf) was chaired by the Vice-Chancellor of The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. The membership of the group consisted entirely of quacks and the vice -chancellor's university ran a course in homeopathy (now closed). The Pittilo report recommended statutory regulation and \"The threshold entry route to the register will normally be through a Bachelor degree with Honours\". It ignored entirely the little problem that you can't run a BSc degree in a subject that's almost entirely devoid of evidence. It said, for example that acupuncturists must understand \" yin/yang, 5 elements/phases, eight principles, cyclical rhythms, qi ,blood and body fluids\". But of course there is nothing to \"understand\"! They are all pre-scientific myths. This [\"training dilemma\"](http://www.dcscience.net/dilemmas-of-cam/) was pointed out in one of my earliest posts, You'd think it was obvious, but nonetheless the then Labour government seemed to take this absurd report seriously. In 2009 a consultation was held on the Pittilo report. I and many of my friends spent a lot of time [pointing out the obvious](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Pittilo). Eventually the problem was again kicked into the long grass. The THR scheme Meanwhile European regulations caused the creation of the Traditional Herbal Registration (THR) scheme. It's run by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA). This makes it [legal to put totally misleading claims on labels](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/) of herbal concoctions, as long as they are registered with THR, They also get an impressive-looking certification mark. All that's needed to get THR registration is that the 'medicines' are not obviously toxic and they have been in use for 30 years. There is no need to supply any information whatsoever about whether they work or not. This appears to contradict directly the MHRA's brief: \"\"We enhance and safeguard the health of the public by ensuring that medicines and medical devices work and are acceptably safe.\" After much effort, I elicited an admission from the MHRA that there was no reason to think that any herbal concoctions were effective, and that there was nothing to prevent them from adding a statement to say so on the label. They just chose not to do so. That's totally irresponsible in my opinion. See [Why does the MHRA refuse to label herbal products honestly? Kent Woods and Richard Woodfield tell me](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/04/01/why-does-the-mhra-refuse-to-label-herbal-products-honestly-kent-woods-and-richard-woodfield-tell-me/). Over 300 herbal products have been registered under the THR scheme (a small percentage of the number of products being used). So far only one product of Tibetan medicine and one traditional Chinese medicine have been registered under THR. These are the only ones that can be sold legally now, because no herbs whatsoever have achieved full marketing authorisation -that requires good evidence of efficacy and that doesn't exist for any herb. The current report Eventually, in early 2014, the Tory-led government set up yet another body, \"Herbal Medicines and Practitioners Working Group \" (HMPWG). My heart sank when I saw its [membership (Annex A.2).](/Report_on_Regulation_of_Herbal_Medicines_and_Practitioners) The vice-chair was none other that the notorious [David Tredinnick MP (Con, Bosworth)](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/05/15/a-curious-letter-from-david-tredinnick-mp-the-governments-resident-medical-loon/). It was stuffed with people who had vested interests. I wrote to the chair and to the few members with scientific credentials to put my views to them. But my fears were unfounded, because the report of the HMPWG was not written by the group, but by its chair only. David Walker is deputy chief medical officer and he had clearly listened. Here are some quotations. The good thing about the European laws is that \"This legislation effectively banned the importation and sale of large-scale manufactured herbal medicine products. This step severely limited the scope of some herbal practitioners to continue practising, particularly those from the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurvedic traditions.\" The biggest loophole is that \"At present under UK law it is permitted for a herbal practitioner to see individual patients, offer diagnoses and prepare herbal treatments on their own premises, as long as these preparations do not contain banned or restricted substances. This is unchanged by the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive. \" Walker recognised frankly that there is essentially no good evidence that any herb, western or Chinese, works well enough to make an acceptable treatment. And importantly he, unlike Pittilo, realised that this precludes statutory regulation. \"There are a small number of studies indicating benefit from herbal medicine in a limited range of conditions but the majority of herbal medicine practice is not supported by good quality evidence. A great deal of international, primary research is of poor quality. \" \"ts. Herbal medicine practice is therefore currently based upon traditional practice rather than science. It is difficult to differentiate good practice from poor practice on the basis of this evidence in a way that could establish standards for statutory regulation\" The second problem was the harms done by herbs. Herbalists, western and Chinese, have no satisfactory way of reporting side effects \" . . . there is very limited understanding of the risks to patient safety from herbal medicines and herbal practice. A review of safety data was commissioned from HMAC as part of this review. This review identified many anecdotal reports and case studies but little systematically collected data. Most herbal medicine products have not been through the rigorous licensing process that is required of conventional pharmaceutical products to establish their safety and efficacy. Indeed, only a small proportion have even been subject to the less rigorous Traditional Herbal Registration (THR) process. \" \"The anecdotal evidence of risk to patients from herbal products in the safety review highlighted the prominence of manufactured herbal medicines in the high profile serious incidents which have been reported in recent years. Many of these reports relate to harm thought to be caused by industrially manufactured herbal products which contained either dangerous herbs, the wrong constituents, toxic contaminants or adulterants. All such industrially manufactured products are now only available under European regulations if their safety is assured through MHRA licensing or THR accreditation; and specific dangerous herbs have been banned under UK law. This has weakened the case for introduction of statutory regulation as a further safety measure. \" Then Walker identified correctly the training dilemma. Although it seems obvious, this is a big advance for a government document. Degrees that teach nonsense are not good training: they are miseducation. \"The third issue is the identification of educational standards for training practitioners and the benchmarking of standards for accrediting practitioners. With no good data on efficacy or safety, it is difficult for practitioners and patients to understand or quantify the potential benefits and risks of a proposed therapeutic intervention. Training programmes could accredit knowledge and skills in some areas including pharmacology and physiology, professional ethics and infection control but without a credible evidence base relating to the safety and effectiveness of herbal medicine it is hard to see how they could form the basis of accreditation in this field of practice. There are a number of educational university programmes offering courses in herbal medicine although the number has declined in recent years. Some of these courses are accredited by practitioner organisations which is a potential governance risk as the accreditation may be based on benchmarks established by tradition and custom rather than science. \" \"The herbal medicine sector is in a dilemma\" is Walker's conclusion. \"Some practitioners would like to continue to practise as they do now, with no further regulation, and accept that their practice is based on tradition and personal experience rather than empirical science. The logical consequence of adopting this form of practice is that we should take a precautionary approach in order to ensure public safety. The public should be protected through consumer legislation to prevent false claims, restricting the use of herbal products which are known to be hazardous to health\" The problem with this is, if course, is that although there is plenty of law, it's rarely enforced : see [Most alternative medicine is illegal](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/01/15/most-alternative-medicine-is-illegal/) Trading Standards very rarely enforce the [Consumer Protection Regulations (2008)](http://www.dcscience.net/2009/01/15/most-alternative-medicine-is-illegal/) but Walker is too diplomatic to mention that fact. \"The herbals sector must recognise that its overall approach (including the rationale for use of products and methods of treatment, education and training, and interaction with the NHS) needs to be more science and evidence based if in order to be established as a profession on the same basis as other groups that are statutorily regulated.\" So what happens next? In the short term nothing will happen. The main mistake has been avoided: there wil be no statutory regulation. The other options are (a) do nothing, or (b) go for accreditation of a voluntary register (AR) by the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA). Walker ends up recommending the latter, but only after a lot more work (see [pages 28-29 of report](/Report_on_Regulation_of_Herbal_Medicines_and_Practitioners)). Of particular interest is recommendation 5. \"As a first step it would be helpful for the sector organisations to develop an umbrella voluntary register that could support the development of standards and begin to collaborate on the collection of safety data and the establishment of an academic infrastructure to develop training and research. This voluntary register could in due course seek accreditation from the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA).\" So it looks as though nothing will happen for a long time, and herbalists and TCM may end up with the utterly ineffectual PSA. After all, the PSA have accredited voluntary registers of homeopaths, so clearly nothing is too delusional for them. It's very obvious that, unlike Walker, the PSA are quite happy to ignore the training dilemma. Omissions from the report Good though this report is, by Department of Health standards, it omits some important points. Endangered species and animal cruelty aren't mentioned in the report. Traditional Chinese medicine, and its variants, are responsible for the [near-extinction of rhinoceros, tiger](http://www.dcscience.net/pittilo-consultation-response.pdf) and other species because of the [superstitious belief](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/9525512/Rhinos-under-24-hour-armed-guard.html) that they have medicinal value. It's not uncommon to find [animal parts in Chinese medicines](http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/local-news/endangered-species-found-mixed-herbal-6006076) sold in the UK despite it being illegal And the unspeakably cruel practice of [farming bears to collect bile](#) is a direct consequence of TCM. A bile bear in a \"crush cage\" on Huizhou Farm, China (Wikipedia) Statutory regulation of Chiropractors The same arguments used in Walker's report to deny statutory regulation of herbalism, would undoubtedly lead to denial of statutory regulation of chiropractors. The General Chiropractic Council was established in 1994, and has a status that's the same as the General Medical Council. That was a bad mistake. The [GCC has not protected the public](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2014/01/conflicts-of-interests-gcc.html), in fact it has acted as an advertising agency for chiropractic quackery. Perhaps Prof. Walker should be asked to review the matter.

But, as usual, all the interesting controversies have been sanitised. Edzard Ernst has also commented on this topic: [Once again: the regulation of nonsense will generate nonsense - the case of UK herbalists](http://edzardernst.com/2015/03/once-again-the-regulation-of-nonsense-will-generate-nonsense-the-case-of-uk-herbalists/). | | Maurice Nathan Saatchi, | | The debate was deeply depressing: very pompous and mostly totally uninformed. You would never have guessed that the vast majority of those who understand the problem are against the bill. The Bill has failed to win the support of The British Medical Association, The Motor Neurone Disease Association, the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Surgeons, the Medical Research Society, the Royal College of Radiologists, The Medical Defence Union, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Royal College of Pathologists, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Academy for Healthcare Science, the Wellcome Trust, Action Against Medical Accidents, and patient advocacy charities Health Watch and the Nightingale Collaboration, [and others](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/what-do-doctors-lawyers-and-medical-charities-say/). Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, has \"very serious concerns\" about it. Grief is not a good basis for legislation. In the Daily Telegraph, Lord Saatchi attributes the lack of a \"cure for cancer\" to fear of litigation. \"Any deviation by a doctor is likely to result in a verdict of guilt for medical negligence. The law defines medical negligence as deviation from that standard procedure. But as innovation is deviation, non-deviation is non-innovation. This is why there is no cure for cancer.\" This statement is utterly bizarre. Evidently Lord Saatchi knows much more about how to sell cigarettes than he does about how to discover new drugs. The reason there is no cure is that it's a very difficult problem. It has nothing to do with litigation Almost every medical organisation, and many lawyers, have pointed out the flaws in his ideas,. But slick, and often mendacious, advertising of his cure has deceived many of our scientifically-illiterate parliamentarians, and the bill is making progress Lord Saatchi's Bill would allow uncontrolled testing of treatments on any patient. It is not limited to cancer, nor to terminally ill patients (though some amendments, yet to be accepted, might change that). This sort of uncontrolled experimentation is likely to impede advances in treatment rather than to help them. And the vagueness of the wording of the bill could lead to an increase in litigation, rather than the intended decrease. It is no coincidence that the [legion of cancer quacks](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5891) is in favour of the bill. It opens the door to their nonsense. Big pharma is likely to benefit too, because they will be able to sell improperly tested drugs with little or no effectiveness and immunity from prosecution if they do harm. For more information about the Bill, see the excellent site, [Stop the Saatchi Bill](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/). There are sections on [ Dispelling Myths](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/faq-dispelling-myths/), on [Professional Concerns](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/what-do-doctors-lawyers-and-medical-charities-say/), and on the many [good articles and blogs](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/read-articles-about-the-bill/) that have pointed out the many problems with the bill. Two recent articles are well worth reading [Saatchi's 'Medical Innovation Bill' will benefit lawyers and charlatans, not patients](https://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/david-nicholl/saatchi%27s-%27medical-innovation-bill%27-will-benefit-lawyers-and-charlatans-not-pat#.VEevO8uIwrI.twitter), by neurologist David Nicholl. And it's particularly interesting that the Telegraph's arch-conservative, Peter Oborne has come out strongly against the bill, in [The 'Saatchi Bill' is dangerous and will bring nothing but harm. ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/saatchi-bill/11183012/The-Saatchi-Bill-is-dangerous-and-will-bring-nothing-but-harm.html)I can't agree with his opening words (\"Lord Saatchi is rightly regarded as a national treasure. In his early days he was the advertising genius who played a fundamental role in selling the Thatcherite message\"), but I agree entirely with \"The PR campaign distorts the facts, exploiting ignorance and desperation to plant false hope in the rich soil of multiple fallacies.\" \"Quacks will be given free rein. No \"treatment\" is so loopy (or potentially dangerous) that the Saatchi Bill won't protect doctors who prescribe or administer it from prosecution.\" \"The propagation of falsehoods and fallacies surrounding and arising from this Bill will have a corrosive effect on medical ethics and society as a whole.\" Lord Saatchi, who proposed the bill said \"To prevent more needless cancer deaths, doctors must be free to innovate\". This statement shows he has no idea of the efforts that go into cancer research. We are doing our best, but it is a very hard problem. In some areas (like breast cancer) there have been big advances. In others areas (e.g. pancreatic or ovarian cancer) there has not yet been any perceptible progress. It will take many more years of hard scientific work. Individual doctors tinkering with speculative untested treatments will not solve the problem. - The only people who will benefit from the bill will be lawyers, quacks and big pharma. - \"Innovation\" is undefined -the bill is based on the myth that there exists a miraculous cure waiting to be found. Sadly, the probability of this happening is vanishingly small. - To some extent, medicine is victim of its own hype. The public feels it has a right to demand the latest miracle cure. Too often, they don't exist. - There is no need for the bill because doctors can already prescribe whatever they want. The Medical Defence Union says it has no reason to think that doctors are deterred from innovating by the fear of litigation. - The bill won't help to discover new cures -in fact it is more likely to hinder it, especially if it deters people from joining properly organised clinical trials. The bill will generate many separate anecdotes which may or may not be published. That's the worst possible way to do research. - The bill removes protections from patients and is more likely to increase litigation than reduce it. - Anyone unlucky enough to get cancer is immediately a target for a [legion of quacks](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5891)trying to sell you crazy \"treatments\". There is nothing to stop even the lunatic fringe of alternative medicine, homeopaths, promoting their sugar pills. There are, disgracefully, several hundred homeopaths with medical degrees -all a quack has to do is to ask another quack doctor to endorse their daft ideas. - For untested treatments there is, by definition, no reason to think they'll do more good than harm. The cancer surgeon, Michael Baum said, rightly, that in cases of terminal cancer \"there will be many patients we can't help. but none we can't harm\". As a result of tweeting about the bill, I got a call on 21 October from RT TV (UK) asking me speak on the Saatchi Bill. That was a pleasure. Here it is (done from home, on Skype). And on the day of the Lords debate (24 October 2014) I was asked to talk again about the Saatchi Bill, on the flagship Radio 4 morning news programme, Today. It was only a 3 minute interview with [Mishal Husain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/1pRyL8J7mJJM4NF7dKrRSJP/mishal-husain), but it was unopposed so I managed to get in the main points.

It does 0 - 60 in 4.2 seconds but costs \u00a350k -more than twice the price of a Prius. | || | Follow-up 25 October 2014 A summary of the misunderstandings in yesterday's House of Lords debate: [What the Lords Missed](http://www.stopthesaatchibill.co.uk/what-the-lords-missed/). Here is a record of a couple of recent newspaper pieces. Who says the mainstream media don't matter any longer? Blogs may be in the lead now when it comes to critical analysis. The best blogs have more expertise and more time to read the sources than journalists. But the mainstream media get the message to a different, and much larger, audience. The Observer ran a whole page interview with me as part of their [\"Rational Heroes\" series](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/apr/21/rational-heroes-david-colquhoun-pharmacologist?INTCMP=SRCH). I rather liked their subtitle [ [pdf of article](/David-Colquhoun-Twitter-addicted scourge of scientific quackery _ Science _ pseudoscience on his unmissable blog\" It was pretty accurate apart from the fact that the picture was labelled as \"DC in his office\". Actually it was taken (at the insistence of the photographer) in Lucia Sivilotti's lab. Photo by Karen Robinson. The astonishing result of this was that on Sunday the blog got a record 24,305 hits. Normally it gets 1,000-1,400 hits a day . between posts, fewer on Sunday, and the previous record was around 7000/day A week later it was still twice normal. It remains to be seen whether the eventual plateau stays up. I also gained around 1000 extra followers on twitter, though some dropped away quite soon, and 100 or so people signed for email updates. The dead tree media aren't yet dead. I'm happy to say. 3 June 2013 Perhaps as a result of the foregoing piece, I got asked to write a column for The Observer, at barely 48 hours notice. This is the best I could manage in the time. The [web version has links](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/jun/02/medical-cure-health-quackery-david-colquhoun?INTCMP=SRCH). This attracted the usual \"it worked for me\" anecdotes in the comments, but I spent an afternoon answering them. It seems important to have a dialogue, not just to lecture the public. In fact when I read a regular scientific paper, I now find myself looking for the comment section. That may say something about the future of scientific publishing. It is for others to judge how succesfully I engage with the public, but I was quite surprised to discover that UCL's public engagement unit, @UCL_in_public, has blocked me on twitter. Hey ho. They have 1574 follower and I have 7597. I wish them the best of luck. Follow-up It's hard to know what to make of David Tredinnick MP (Cons, Bosworth). He is certainly an extreme example of the scientific ignorance of our parliamentary representatives, but he isn't alone in that. Our present minister of Education, Michael Gove, memorably referred to [Newton's Laws of Thermodynamics](http://politicalscrapbook.net/2011/06/michael-gove-physics/), blissfully unaware that thermodynamics was a 19th century development. And our present Minister of Health seems to [think that magic water cures diseases](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100179258/jeremy-hunt-health-secretary-thinks-homeopathy-works/). But Mr Treddinick breaks every record for anti-scientific nonsense. That, no doubt, is why he was upset by the recent revision of come NHS Choices web pages, so that they now give a good account of the evidence (that's their job, of course). They did that despite two years of obstruction by the Department of Health. which seemed to think that it was appropriate to take advice from Michael Dixon of the Prince's Foundation for integrated Health. That shocking example of policy based evidence was [revealed on this blog](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5778), and caused something of a stir. Treddinick's latest letter A copy of a letter from Mr Tredinnick to the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, has some into my possession by a tortuous route [ [download the letter](/trediinnick-letter.pdf)]. It's a corker. Here are a few quotations. \"1. UKIP moving onto our ground Attached is an extract from a recent UKIP policy statement. The position which UKIP has taken is one with which most of our Daily Mail reading supporters of complementary medicine would agree.\" It seems that Treddinick's preferred authority on medicine is now Nigel Farage, leader of the UK's far right party. UKIP's policy on health is appended to the letter, and it's as barmy as most of the other things they say. \"2. Herbal Medicine . . .there is very real concern that the Government will not regulate Herbal Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. The current situation is unacceptable, because herbal practitioners need regulation and cannot function as herbal therapists, nor can they cannot obtain stocks of their herbal remedies, without it. This refers to a saga that has been running for at least 10 years. Herbalists are desperate to get a government stamp of approval by getting statutory regulation, much like real doctors have, despite the fact that they make money by selling sick people \" [an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733)\" (as quoted recently in the [House of Lords](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000207)). Even the US [National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm) (NCCAM) doesn't claim that a single herbal treatment is useful. The saga of herbal regulation is long and tedious. The short version is that a [very bad report, The Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235), recommended regulation of herbalists. After years of prevarication, Andrew Lansley ignored the impartial scientific advice and yielded to the pressure from the herbal industry to [accept the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117). But still nothing has happened. Could it be that even Jeremy Hunt realises, deep down, that the regulation of nonsense is a nonsense that would harm the public? We can only hope that a letter from Mr Tredinnick is the kiss of death. Perhaps his continuous pestering will only reinforce the doubts that seem to exist at the Department of Health. Then Tredinnick returns (yawn) to his obsession with magic water. He vents his rage at the [now excellent NHS Choices](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5778) page on homeopathy. 3. Homeopathy \"Recently this wording has been removed and instead a comment by the Chief Medical Officer that homeopathy is placebo inserted in its place, as well as links to external organisations which campaign against homeopathy. For instance, there is a link to the Sense About Science website, and Caroline Finucane, who is Editor of new content at NHS Choices, also writes for the Sense About Science website. This is an organisation which has no expertise in homeopathy and traces its roots back to the ultra-left Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP).\" \"I respectfully suggest that the original wording be reinstated and these links to external organisations be removed or changed to ensure a balanced view.\". So it seems that he prefers the medical views of Nigel Farage and the Prince of Wales to those of the Chief Medical Officer and the government's chief scientist. Disgracefully, Tredinnick picks out one particular employee of NHS Choices among many, and one who does an excellent job. And he raises the hoary old myth that Sense About Science is a communist organisation. Odd, since others accuse it of being neo-libertarian. The actual history [is here](http://www.senseaboutscience.org/blog.php/36/where-sense-about-science-comes-from). The organisation that is a bit too libertarian for my taste is Spiked Online. I haven't agreed with every word that Sense about Science has printed, but they have a totally honest belief in evidence. To drag in the name of one person out of many, and to justify it by a false history shows, once again, how very venomous and vindictive the advocates of delusional medicine can be when they feel cornered. A bit more information about Mr Treddinick This is what the [BBC News profile](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk_politics/2055369.stm) says about him. | | David Tredinnick is an old style Conservative MP, being an Eton-educated former Guards officer, who has sat in the Commons since 1987. However, his ambition for high office was thwarted by his role in one of the sleaze stories which helped to sink the Major government. He accepted \u00a31,000 from an undercover reporter to ask parliamentary questions about a fictitious drug. He was obliged to resign from his role as a PPS and was suspended from the Commons for 20 sitting days. He has not sat on the frontbench since. He is an orthodox Conservative loyalist, though he is more supportive of the European Union than many of his colleagues. He has, however, carved himself a niche as the Commons' most enthusiastic supporter of complementary medicine. He has wearied successive health secretaries with his persistent advocacy of any and all homeopathic remedies. He has also supported their use in prisons and even suggested them as an aid in alleviating the foot and mouth crisis. | | Tredinnick has also asserted that he was aware of a psychiatric hospital that doubled its staff at full moon (this is an old urban myth, and is, of course, His advocacy of homeopathic borax as a way to control the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth diease can be Picture of David Tredinnick MP from the Follow-up Much has been written on this blog about [Dr Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Michael+Dixon%22), and about the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22College+of+Medicine%22)\", which is the direct inheritor of the mantle of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. At the time of the foundation of the College it was [stated that](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) \"The College represents a new strategy to take forward the vision of HRH Prince Charles\". Michael Dixon has also been chairman of the NHS Alliance since 1998. That was one of very few organisations to support Andrew Lansley's Health Bill. No doubt [he will be happy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295) for Crapita Capita to supply alternative nonsense at public expense. Dr Dixon took offence to a review in The Times of Mark Henderson's new book, The Geek Manifesto. . The [review, by David Aaronovitch](http://journalisted.com/article/3olf4), said, apropos of the [1023 campaign](http://www.1023.org.uk/), \" . . .there was now, almost for the first time, a group of people who were not content to see claims made for discredited treatments without making everyone aware of the science that disproved those claims. And second, what they were doing had implications for public policy.\" and \"The geeks represent, for me, one of the most encouraging recent developments in British public life.\" This excellent review evidently upset Dr Dixon, because on 20th May, his letter appeared in the Times. | | David Aaronovitch is right to argue for a robust scientific approach in medicine. However, he is not being logical or scientific when he says that if something is suspected to be placebo then it has no benefit and the NHS should not pay for it. What about scientific research on remedies that many believe to be placebo? These frequently show that there is a benefit but this is confined to those who believe in the treatment given. Surely, in such cases, it would be logical to say that the treatment was beneficial albeit in a specific group of \"believers\". From there, it would be good science to compare the safety costs of this supposed placebo remedy with its currently given alternative before deciding whether \"believers\" should be able to receive such a remedy on the NHS. The problem here is that belief and mindset play an enormous part in healing - science needs to take account of this. Patients' symptoms are frequently metaphors and effective treatment can often be symbolic and culturally dependent. The mind, in the right circumstances, can produce its own healing chemicals often mimicking those given in conventional medicine. Until science can explain healing in psychosocial as well as biomedical language, we must be cautious about \"voting for the geeks\" as Mr Aaronovitch suggests. It is far better surely that individual treatment should be tailored, within reason, to the patient and their beliefs and perspectives. Further more, might it not be wiser to direct NHS resources according to pragmatic trials of cost effectiveness and safety rather than a limited interpretation of science that excludes the effect of the mind? Dr Michael Dixon Chair of Council College of Medicine. This letter seemed remarkable to me. It is very close to being an admission that alternative medicine is largely placebo. It called for a reply. We have been here before. Many people have discussed the dubious ethics of deceiving patients by giving placebos while pretending they are no such thing. There is wide agreement that it is not only unethical, but also unnecessary. Kevin Smith has written [a scholarly essay](http://www.dcscience.net/Smith-response.pdf) on the topic. Edzard Ernst wrote [Mind over matter?](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103080345/http://www.arc.org.uk/news/arthritistoday/131_1.asp) Margaret McCartney, the Glasgow GP, and author of The Patient Paradox, has [explained it](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=1071). Some views of Dr Dixon's approach are less flattering than mine. For example, from the USA, Steven Novella's [Dr. Michael Dixon - \"A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men\"](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/dr-michael-dixon-a-pyromaniac-in-a-field-of-integrative-straw-men/). And, Majikthyse, [Michael Dixon caught red-handed!](http://majikthyse.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/michael-dixon-caught-red-handed/), and Dr Aust's [Dr Michael Dixon is annoyed](http://draust.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/dr-michael-dixon-is-annoyed/). The list is almost endless. .Two replies were published in the Times on 26 May (and they were the lead letters -bold print). One from the excellent Evan Harris, and one from me. Here they are as text. | | Sir, Dr Michael Dixon's letter (May 21) is fascinating. He is, of course, a well-known advocate of alternative medicine. Yet he seems now to believe that much alternative medicine is just a placebo. That's something the geeks have been saying for years, and he appears, at last, to have accepted it. That being the case, it follows that we have to ask whether placebos produce useful benefits, and whether it is ethical to prescribe them. Nobody denies the existence of placebo effects. But recent research has shown that they are usually both small and transient. Often they are not big enough to provide a useful degree of relief. For example, a recent paper on acupuncture in the British Journal of General Practice showed that it had a remarkably small placebo effect. And placebos have no effect at all on the course of cancer or infectious diseases. There has been an admirable movement in medicine for doctors to be open and honest with patients. Prescribing of medicines that contain no active ingredient involves lying to patients. That is old-fashioned and unethical. It is fair to ask why so many people seem to believe in alternative medicine, if even their placebo effects are small. The answer seems to lie in the \"get better anyway\" effect (known to geeks as regression to the mean). Most of the conditions for which placebos seem to work are things that wax and wane naturally. You take the \"cure\" when you are at your worst, and next day you are better. You would have been better anyway, but it's hard to avoid attributing the improvement to whatever you took. That is why alternative medicine is advertised largely on the basis of anecdotal testimonials. And it is doubtless why Dr Dixon advocates \"pragmatic\" trials: that's a euphemism for trials without a proper control group. Psychosocial problems may indeed be very important for some patients. But deceiving such patients with dummy pills is not the proper way to deal with their problems. D. Colquhoun, FRS Professor of Pharmacology, University College London Sir, Dr Michael Dixon argues that the NHS should fund placebo treatments such as homeopathy (though he stops short of agreeing that homeopathy is a placebo) on the basis that they can offer limited help to those who \"believe\" in them. It is no part of modern ethical medical practice to deceive patients into thinking \u2014 or failing to disabuse them of the belief \u2014 that an inert substance or ineffective medicine has beneficial effects. This can not be justified by the hope \u2014 or even expectation \u2014 of deriving for that patient the limited psychologically based improvement in symptoms that may follow from the deployment of the placebo. Pedlars of homeopathy for profit in the private sector will, alas, always seek to fool people into believing the hocus pocus of \"memory of water\" and the effects of infinite dilution and a lot of bottle-shaking. But doctors have responsibilities not to deceive their patients, even out of a paternalistic wish to assist them to manage their symptoms; and public policy demands that the NHS spends its resources only on treatments that work without deception in a cost-effective way. Dr Evan Harris Oxford Follow-up Our undercover investigation finds evidence of nutritional therapists giving out advice that could seriously harm patients' health That's the title of [an article](/Which-Nutritional-therapists-Feb-2012.pdf) in February's Which? magazine. (That's similar to Consumer Reports in the USA). \"When Which? sent researchers to investigate the quality of advice from nutritional therapists, some was so bad that patients' health was put at risk. One nutritional therapist advised against surgery and radiotherapy to treat cancer, while another 'diagnosed' a problem with adrenal glands without any blood-test results. Some also used unproven testing, such as iridology or mineral testing, to identify problems or diagnose conditions.\" \"We sent five undercover researchers to visit three nutritional therapists each. Every researcher was equipped with a specific health-related scenario: Helen (46) and Sarah (40), recently diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), the most common type of non-invasive breast cancer; Mark (56) and Linda (52), suffering with serious fatigue for the past three months; and Emily (31), trying unsuccessfully to conceive for more than a year.\" | | Sarah, posing as a patient diagnosed with DCIS, visited a nutritional therapist who advised her to delay treatment recommended by her oncologist (a lumpectomy and a course of radiotherapy). The therapist suggested that Sarah follow a no-sugar diet for three to six months and told her, 'cancer lives off sugar; if you feed it sugar it's going to thrive. If we starve the cancer of sugar then you have a better opportunity of the cancer going away'. When Sarah asked whether the cancer could progress during this time the therapist said it was a 'gamble'. Dr Margaret McCartney, from our panel of experts, says: 'If cancer treatment were as simplistic as cutting out sugar, surely we would have discovered a cure. This advice is highly irresponsible.' Our experts rated this consultation as a 'dangerous fail'.\" The The Universities Admission Service (UCAS) no longer lists any BSc/MSc degrees in \"Nutritional Therapy\" or \"Nutritional medicine\". Westminster University But there are a large number of university courses called \"Nutrition\". How many of them teach properly, and how many of them teach the nonsense that prevails in \"nutritional therapy\", I don't know. The term 'nutrition' has turned into a dangerous minefield. It can mean almost anything, because the term is undefined. Anyone can, and does, describe themselves as a nutritionist. At one extreme you have slick pills salesman like The one thing that you need to get clear is that if you want advice about nutrition, go to a dietitian not a \"nutritionist\". Dietitians are the properly qualified people who work in the NHS, and who are (mostly) free of crackpot ideas. I suppose that one should not be surprised at the poor, and sometimes dangerous, advice that was given by nutritional therapists. Their training contains much nonsense so it isn't surprising that they did so badly. Some of it has been revealed here. See, for example, [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) [Nutritional Fairy Tales from Thames Valley University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=260) [College of Natural Nutrition: bizarre teaching revealed](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=384) [Nutriprofile: useful aid or sales scam?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=221) [Response to a threatening letter from Mr Holford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=159) [Food for the Brain: Child Survey. A proper job?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=218) [Teaching bad science to [The last BSc (Hons) Homeopathy closes! But look at what they still teach at Westminster University.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) The level of knowledge of both physiology and chemistry shown my some of the therapists was shocking. One recommended avoiding margarine, because it's \"two chemical bonds away from pure plastic\". Another said that Flora margarine contains lots of trans fat, which has not been true for a long time. One graduate ot the [late Thames Valley University course](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=260) said \"\"advantage of the wholemeal or the wholegrain ... is that they contain more fibre and the fibre stops the sugars being absorbed quite as quickly\". Not so. Brown and white bread have [much the same glycaemic index](http://www.portalsaudebrasil.com/artigospsb/nutri028.pdf) (60 - 70). Quack diagnosis One alarming fact was that several therapists offered methods of [diagnosis for allergy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=122) and for deficiencies that have been known for many years not to work. There isn't anything controversial about [iridology](http://www.skepdic.com/iridol.html), hair mineral analysis, taste tests. kinesiology. or the [Vega test](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131#vega). They [are pure quackery](http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/iridology.html). Colquhoun, from our panel of experts, said: 'Sadly, nutritional therapy is plagued by \"diagnostic tests\" that are little more than quackery; they are tools to aid sales, rather than tools to diagnose deficiencies. [Iridology]and [hair analysis]simply don't work.\" Unnecessary treatments One therapist advised a researcher to have an optimum nutritional evaluation test, costing \u00a3312, and a cellular nutrition profile, costing \u00a3156. Apparently, these would allow the therapist to give a more targeted service by establishing what vitamin and mineral deficiencies he had. Our experts were not convinced by these tests and certainly didn't think they were worth the money; any necessary testing could be done by a GP for free. In 12 of the 15 consultations, researchers were prescribed a huge range of supplements, costing up to \u00a370 per month. It was not revealed whether or not the prescriber made money from this, but usually you were asked to give the prescriber's name \"to get a discount\". So it's a fair guess that they got kickbacks. British Association for Applied Nutrition & Nutritional Therapy (BANT) Despite the low standards of advice, 13 out of the 14 therapists who were visited were registered with BANT, the British Association for Applied Nutrition & Nutritional Therapy. This is what passes for a professional association for nutritional therapists, though like all such bodies in alternative medicine, it is entirely ineffective as a regulator. Rather it serves to protect whatever untrue claims they make. BANT's code of practice says that its members won't diagnose, but in fact many of the therapists diagnosed conditions and created treatment plans. You can be confident that BANT will do nothing to stop this bad practice. You can find out a lot about BANT from these sources: [British Association for Nutritional Therapy - when an organisation looks like a regulator, quacks like a regulator, but isn't a regulator](http://holfordwatch.info/2007/05/09/british-association-for-nutritional-therapy-when-an-organisation-looks-like-a-regulator-quacks-like-a-regulator-but-isnt-a-regulator/) [Why it is easy to get the incorrect impression that BANT is a regulator](http://holfordwatch.info/2007/05/11/why-it-is-easy-to-get-the-incorrect-impression-that-bant-is-a-regulator/) [Nutritional Therapists Fail to Join Ofquack](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/04/nutritional-therapists-fail-to-join.html) [BANT: A Profile](http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/bant-a-profile/) [Matthias Rath drops his million pound legal case against me and the Guardian.](http://www.badscience.net/2008/09/matthias-rath-pulls-out-forced-to-pay-the-guardians-costs-i-think-this-means-i-win/) Only 3 of the 14 therapists were registered with the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (the [CNHC, more commonly know as Ofquack](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311)). They are meant to be the official regulator, launched with a good chunk of taxpayers' money, but registration is voluntary and [not many have volunteered](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/04/nutritional-therapists-fail-to-join.html).

If you have symptoms please see your GP, not someone who can't diagnose accurately.' If you're looking for tailored dietary advice, visit a registered dietitian. \" There is [a discussion](http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/nutritional-therapists-advice-worth-the-cost/) of this topic on the Which? magazine site. Follow-up The excellent [Quackometer has posted](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2012/01/which-uncovers-dangerous-advice-from-nutritionists.html) simultaneously on the great nutritional therapy scam. 16 January 2012 The British Dietetic Association issued a press release that describes very clearly the many differences between a real dietitian and a \"nutritional therapist\". Download [Leading UK Nutrition Association Urges Awareness Between Dietitians and Nutritionists](/BDA-press-release-nut-therapists.pdf) (pdf). 16 January 2012 BANT issued a press release. Download [Are Nutritional Therapists Gambling with Your Health?](/BANT-PR-160112.pdf). It answers none of the serious questions raised by the Which? investigation. BANT moans that that Which? \"did not provide all the promised transcripts/questionnaires in a timely fashion\". In fact they got them before Christmas and were given until January 15th to respond. 16 January 2012. BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, had an item with Jenny Driscoll from Which? magazine and BANT chairperson, Catherine Honeywell. She did, inter alia, admit that some of the behaviour of the therapists were irresponsible. It remains to be seen if they do anything about it. don't hold your breath. [Hear it on BBC iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b019f8bh). 16 January 2012. There was pretty god coverage of the story, even [in the Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2087167/Nutrition-therapists-condemned-quacks-patients-health-risk.html). 17 January 2012 Another question answered. I just learned that the [ludicrous course in Nutritional Therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), previously validated by the University of Wales (and a contributor to its downfall), is now being validated by, yes, you guessed, [Middlesex University](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm). Professor Driscoll seems determined to lead his univerity to the bottom of the academic heap. His new partnership with the Northern college of Acupuncture is just [one of a long list](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/business/partners/uk/index.aspx) of validations that almost rivals that of the [late University of Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766). The course has, of course, an [enthusiastic testimonial](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm), from a student. It starts I work full time as a team leader for a pension company but I am also a kinesiologist and work in my spare time doing kinesiology, reiki and Indian head massage. Evidently she's a believer in the barmiest and totally disproved forms of magic medicine. And Middlesex University will give her a Master of Science degree. I have to say I find it worrying that she's a team leader for a pension company. Does she also believe in the value of worthless derivatives. I wonder? 17 January 2012 The discussion is going on at the [Which? web site](http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/nutritional-therapists-advice-worth-the-cost/). A Chris James cast doubt on the reaults because ot the small sample size, and asked for confidence limits, so [I gave them](http://conversation.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/nutritional-therapists-advice-worth-the-cost/comment-page-1/#comments). Chris James It is easy enough to calculate limits yourself -you don't even need to be able to do the maths -there are web calculators that do it for you, e.g. [http://www.causascientia.org/math_stat/ProportionCI.html] 14/15 = 93% failed. 95% confidence limits for this are 69.8% to 98.4% 6/15 = 40% gave dangerous advice 95% confidence limits 19.7% to 64.6% So despite the small sample size we can say that it's likely that at least 70% (and possibly 98%) of nutritional therapists fail. And it is likely that at least 20% (and possibly 65%) of nutritional therapists give dangerous advice. These results give real cause for concern, despite the small sample size. For statistical enthusiasts, these limits are Bayesian with a uniform prior. Very much the same result is given by the standard analysis which is explained in section 7.7 of Lectures on Biostatistics [ [download pdf](/Lectures_on_biostatistics-ocr4.pdf) 10.5 Mb] 18 January 2012. BANT has, at last, produced an [\"updated response\"](http://www.bant.org.uk/bant/pdf/WHICH/UPDATED_RESPONSE_FROM_BANT_TO_WHICH_ARTICLE_20120118.pdf). The good thing is that it starts by saying \" . . it is completely outside the BANT Code of Practice to advise a client to withhold any treatment for cancer for any period of time in order to follow a nutritional approach. Were a client to be advised in such a way we would expect to receive a complaint against the practitioner.\" I hope that this will happen. This statement, the only admission of guilt in BANT's response, is rather spoiled by a later suggestion that no such recommendation was made. It looked very clear to both Which? magazine and to the three members of the expert panel. The rest of the response admits no fault of any sort. I'm sorry to say that the response by BANT shows very clearly what is wrong in nutritional therapy. Any organisation which can see nothing wrong in the advice given in 14 of the 15 consultations is, I'd argue, a threat to the health of the nation. Rather than saying we'll try to improve, they just deny everything. The response seems to show that the professional organisation for nutritional therapists is not part of the solution. Rather it is part of the problem. Since writing about anti-scientific degrees in [Nature (March 2007)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), much has been revealed about the nonsense that is taught on these degrees. New Year's day seems like a good time to assess how far we've got, five years on. At the beginning of 2007 [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/) (the universities central admission service) offered 45 different BSc degrees in quackery, at 16 universities. Now there are only 24 such degrees. If you exclude chiropractic and osteopathy, which all run at private colleges, with some sort of \"validation\" from a university, there are now only 18 BSc/MSc courses being offered in eight universities. Degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy and \"nutritional therapy\", reflexology and aromatherapy have vanished altogether from UCAS. In the race to provide BScs in anti-science, Middlesex University has now overhauled the long-standing leader, Westminster, by a short head. | | Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex | | Let's see what's gone. The University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) was the first to see sense. In August 2008 they [announced closure of their \"BSc\" degree in homeopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249). On September 2008 they announced [ an internal review ](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=252)of their courses in homeopathy. herbalism and acupuncture. The report of this review [closed down all of them in July 2009.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899) I first asked for their teaching materials in July 2006. I finally got them in December 2010, after winning an appeal to [the Information Commissioner](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364), and then winning an appeal against that decision at an [ Information tribunal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) . By the time I got them, the course had been closed for over two years. That is just as well, because it turned out that UCLAN's students were [being taught dangerous nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2628). No wonder they tried so hard to conceal it. Salford University was the next to go. They [shut down their courses](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885) in complementary medicine, homeopathy and acupuncture. In January 2009 they announced \" they are no longer considered \"a sound academic fit\" \". Shortly afterwards. a [letter appeared in The Times](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984) from three heavyweights (plus me) congratulating the vice-chancellor on his decision. University of Westminster For many years, Westminster was the biggest supplier of BSc degrees in quackery. At the beginning of 2007 they offered 14 different BSc degrees in homeopathy, naturopathy, nutritional therapy, \"complementary therapies\", (western) herbal medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with acupuncture. Some of their courses were so bizarre that some of the students and even staff sent me slides which taught things like \"amethysts emit high Yin energy\". Like UCLAN, Westminster also [held an internal review](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=984). Unlike UCLAN it came to the absurd conclusion that all would be well if they injected more science into the courses. The incompetence of the review meant that those who wrote it hadn't noticed that if you try to put science into homeopathy or naturopathy, the whole subject vanishes in a puff of smoke. Nevertheless Westminster closed down entry to BSc homeopathy in March 2009 (though the subject remained as part of other courses). Three years after the [Nature article](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19), all five BSc homeopathy degrees had shut their doors. During 2011, Westminster shut down Naturopathy, Nutritional therapy, Therapeutic bodywork and Complementary Medicine. See, for example, [More dangerous nonsense from the University of Westminster: when will Professor Geoffrey Petts do something about it?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4361) [Professor Geoffrey Petts of the University of Westminster says they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". The facts show this is not true](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4683) [University of Westminster shuts down naturopathy, nutritional therapy, but keeps Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4704) Now Westminster has only four courses in two subjects. They still teach some dangerous and untrue things, but I suspect the writing is on the wall for these too. I have seen a document, dated 11 April 2011, which states \"The following courses have been identified as 'at risk' (School definition) and will be discussed at the APRG and University Review Group2, due to poor recruitment and high cost of delivery: Integrated Health Scheme: BSc BSc Herbal Medicine\" All but Chinese medicine and Herbal medicine have already gone. Almost there. University of Wales Since my first [post in 2008](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) about the validation scam operated by the University of Wales, and some good investigations by BBC Wales TV, the outcome was the most spectacular so far. The entire [institution collapsed](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education-news/2011/12/29/can-education-heed-the-lessons-of-2011-91466-30025844/). They no longer \"validate\" external degrees at dodgy business colleges, loony religious colleges or magic medicine colleges. [Another worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259) (October 2008) This is a 'degree' in nutrtional therapy. It is even more hilarious than usual, but it passed the validation anyway. [Scandal of the University of Wales and the Quality Assurance Agency](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3675) (November 2010). This post followed the BBC Wales TV programme. At last the QAA began to notice, yet further confirmation of its utter ineptitude. [The University of Wales disgraced (but its vice chancellor is promoted)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766) (October, 2011) The eventual collapse of the university was well-deserved. But it is very weird that the people who were responsible for it have still got their jobs. In fact the vice-chancellor, Marc Clement, was promoted despite his mendacious claim to be unaware of what was going on. It remains to be seen how many of the many quack courses that were validated by the University of Wales will be taken on by other universities. The McTimoney College of Chiropractic is owned by BPP University (so much for their quality control, as [explained in Private Eye](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4422)). but still claims to be validated by Wales until 2017. Some of the more minor players Edinburgh Napier University. After an FOI request (rejected), Napier closed their herbal medicine degree in 2010. [Hot and cold herbal nonsense from Napier University Edinburgh: another course shuts.](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3200) (June 2010) As expected, the Scottish Information Commissioner agreed with that for England and Wales and ordered material to be sent.

Some of the horrors so discovered appeared in [Yet more dangerous nonsense inflicted on students by Edinburgh Napier University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4188).

Chiropractic Surprisingly, given the total discreditation of chiropractic in the wake of the Simon Singh affair, and the internecine warfare that followed it, none of the chiropractic courses have shut yet. Some are clearly in trouble, so watch this space. Osteopathy has also had no course closures since 2007. Like chiropractic it also suffers from internecine warfare. The General Osteopathic Council refuses to disown the utter nonsense of \"craniosacral\" osteopathy. But the more sensible practitioners do so and are roughly as effective as physiotherapists (though [there are real doubts](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) about how effective that is). Excluding chiropractic and osteopathy, this is all that's left. It now consists almost entirely of Chinese medicine and a bit of herbal.

Manchester Metropolitan gets the booby prize for actually starting a new course, just as all around are closing theirs. Dr Peter Banister, who was on the committee that approved the course (but now retired), has told me \" I am sceptical in the current economic climate whether it will prove to be successful\". Let's hope he's right. But well done Westminster. Your position as the leader in antiscientific degrees has now been claimed by Middlesex University. Their \"degrees\" [ in Ayurveda](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/search/index.aspx?q=ayurveda) mark out Middlesex University as the new King of Woo. Over to you, Professor Driscoll. As vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, the buck stops with you. Both still teach Chinese and herbal medicine, which are potentially dangerous. There is not a single product from either that has marketing authorisation from the MHRA, though the MHRA has betrayed its trust by allowing misleading labelling of herbal medicines without requiring any evidence whatsoever that they work, see, for example [Why degrees in Chinese medicine are a danger to patients](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) [More quackedemia. Dangerous Chinese medicine taught at Middlesex University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923) [Why does the MHRA refuse to label herbal products honestly? Kent Woods and Richard Woodfield tell me](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4269) Sub-degree courses In contrast to the large reduction in the number of BSc and MSc degrees, there has actually been an increase in two year foundation degrees and HND courses in complementary medicine, at places right near the [ bottom of the academic heap](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?v=wide). The subject is sinking to the bottom. With luck it will vanish entirely from universities before too long. Research-intensive Universities Although all of the degrees in magic medicine are from post-1992 universities, the subject has crept into more prestigious universities. Of these, the [University of Southampton](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) is perhaps the worst, because of the presence of [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956), and his defender, Stephen Holgate. Others have staunch defenders of quackery, including the University of Warwick, University of [Edinburgh](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) and [St Batholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555). Why have all these courses closed? One reason is certainly the embarrassment caused by exposure of what's taught on the courses. Professors Petts (Westminster) and Driscoll (Middlesex) must be aware that googling their names produces references to this and other skeptical blogs on the front page. Thanks to some plain brown emails, and, after a three year battle, the Freedom of Information Act, it has been possible to show here the nonsense that has been foisted on students by some universities. Not only is this a burden on the taxpayer, but, more importantly, some of it is a danger to patients. When a course closes, it is often said that it is because of falling student numbers (though UCLAN and Salford did not use that excuse). Insofar as that is true, the credit must go to the whole of the skeptical movement that has grown so remarkably in the last few years. Ben Goldacre's \"ragged band of bloggers\" have produced a real change in universities and in society as a whole. The people who should have done the job have either been passive or an active hindrance. The list is long.

This contradicts the statement from UoW. Watch this space. 3 January 2012. Thanks to [Neil O'Connell](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) for drawing my attention to a paper [in Pain](/white-2011-acupuncture-placebo-rct.pdf). The paper is particularly interesting because it comes from the [Southampton group](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4582) which has previously been sympathetic to acupuncture. Its authors include [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). It shows, yet again that there is no detectable difference between real and sham acupuncture treatment. It also shows that the empathy of the practitioner has little effect: in fact the stern authoritarian practitioner may have been more effective. Patients receiving acupuncture demonstrated clinically important improvements from baseline (i.e., a 29.5% reduction in pain), but despite this, acupuncture has no specific efficacy over placebo for this group of patients. The clinical effect of acupuncture treatment and associated controls is not related to the use of an acupuncture needle, nor mediated by empathy, but is practitioner related and may be linked to the perceived authority of the practitioner.\" Sadly. the trial didn't include a no-treatment group, so it is impossible to say how much of the improvement is regression to the mean and how much is a placebo effect. The authors admit that it could be mostly the former. Surely now the misplaced confidence in acupuncture shown by some medical and university people must be in tatters. In yet another sign that even acupuncture advovates are beginning to notice that it doesn't work, a recent article [Paradoxes in Acupuncture Research: Strategies for Moving Forward](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/180805/), shows some fascinating squirming. 3 January 2012. The [Daily Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/degree-courses/8989183/Lie-back-and-relax-reflexology-and-aromatherapy-degrees-are-dropped.html) has carried a piece about closure of university courses, written by Michael Hanlon. On [31 January](#310112) they carried a much longer piece. 3 January 2012. It is a great pity that some physiotherapists seem to have fallen hook, line and sinker for the myths of acupuncture. Physiotherapists are, by and large, the respectable face of manipulative therapy. Their evidence base is certainly not all one would wish, but at least they are free of the outrageous mumbo humbo of chiropractors. Well, most of them are, but not the [Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists](http://www.aacp.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=137&Itemid=149) (AACP), or, still worse, The [Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Energy Medicine](http://www.energymedphysio.org.uk/), a group that is truly away with the fairies. These organisations are bringing a very respectable job into disrepute. And the Health Professions Council, which is meant to be their regulator, has, like most regulators, done nothing whatsoever to stop it. 5 January 2012. Times Higher Education gives a history of the demise of the University of Wales, [Boom or Bust](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=418612). It's a useful timeline, but like so many journalists, it's unwilling to admit that bloggers were on to the problem long before the BBC, never mind the QAA. There was also a leader on the same topic, [Perils of the export business](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=418588&c=2). It again fails to take the QAA to task for its failures. Interviews for [Deutsche Welle](http://www.dw-world.de/) and [Middle East Broadcasting Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Broadcasting_Center) TV. 17 January 2012 Another question answered. I just learned that the [ludicrous course in Nutritional Therapy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=259), previously validated by the University of Wales (and a contributor to its downfall), is now being validated by, yes, you guessed, [Middlesex University](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm). Professor Driscoll seems determined to lead his univerity to the bottom of the academic heap. His new partnership with the Northern college of Acupuncture is just [one of a long list](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/business/partners/uk/index.aspx) of validations that almost rivals that of the [late University of Wales](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4766). The course has, of course, an [enthusiastic testimonial](http://www.chinese-medicine.co.uk/studying/qualified-nutritional-therapist-graduates.htm), from a student. It starts I work full time as a team leader for a pension company but I am also a kinesiologist and work in my spare time doing kinesiology, reiki and Indian head massage. Evidently she's a believer in the barmiest and totally disproved forms of magic medicine. And Middlesex University will give her a Master of Science degree. I have to say I find it worrying that she's a team leader for a pension company. Does she also believe in the value of worthless derivatives. I wonder? 18 January 2012. the story has gone international, with an interview that I did for Deutsche Welle, [UK universities drop alternative medicine degree programs](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15673133,00.html). I'm quoted as saying \"They're dishonest, they teach things that aren't true, and things that are dangerous to patients in some cases\". That seems fair enough. There is also an [interesting item](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5789488,00.html) from July 2010 about pressure to drop payment for homeopathy by German health insurance 31 January 2012 The Daily Telegraph carried a prominent 1200 word account (the title wasn't mine).

But it has come to a head with some [utterly vile threatening letters](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/11/the-burzynski-clinic-threatens-my-family.html) sent to the admirable Andrew Lewis, because he [told a few truths](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/11/the-false-hope-of-the-burzynski-clinic.html) about [Stanislaw Burzynski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Burzynski)'s despicable outfit. Please read his original post, [The False Hope of the Burzynski Clinic](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/11/the-false-hope-of-the-burzynski-clinic.html). I have to add by two-pennorth worth to the row that has blown up in the blogosphere at the outrageous behaviour of Burzynski. I hope other bloggers will do the same. There is safety in numbers. We need a Streisand effect to face down these pathetic bullies. It's the \"I am Spartacus\" principle. I won't repeat all the details. They have spread like wildfire round the web. Briefly, it was sparked off by tragic case of a 4-year old girl, Billie Bainbridge who has a rare form of brain cancer. Well-intentioned pop stars have been trying to raise \u00a3200,000 to \"enrol her into a clinical trial\" at Burzynski clinic in Texas, despite the fact that Dr Stanislaw Burzynski has already been [on trial for cancer fraud](http://www.ncahf.org/nl/1997/3-4.html). In fact his clinic is not allowed to treat cancer patients, but it has evaded that ban, for many years, by pretending to run clinical trials. Normally patients volunteer for clinical trials. Sometimes they are paid a modest amount. Never, in the civilised world, are people asked to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to be a guinea pig. Dorothy Bishop has written about [The Weird World of US ethics regulation](http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2011/11/weird-world-of-us-ethics-regulation.html). There is nothing new about this. The Cancerbusters site won the [Anus Maximus Award ](http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/history/2000/2000awards.htm)for the year 2000. The [award was announced](http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/cancerbusters.htm) in the following words: The top award this year goes to the acolytes of Dr Stanislaw Burzynski who have created an advertising site at www.cancerbusters.com using a five-year-old boy named Thomas Navarro. Thomas is dying of cancer and this site exploits that tragedy to try and get the law changed so that quacks can have the untrammelled right to deceive desperate, sick people by promising them magic cures for cancer, AIDS and other diseases for which no cure is yet available. While this site is specifically a Burzynski promotion, his competitors support the site and mention it because if the campaign is successful it will dramatically increase the size of the market for quackery and therefore their opportunities to make money.

The drug company Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals could not duplicate Burzynski's claims for AS-2.1 and A-10. The Japanese National Cancer Institute has reported that antineoplastons did not work in their studies. No Burzynski coauthors have endorsed his use of antineoplastons in cancer patients.

Professor Petts has, however, replied to a letters sent to him recently by the [Nightingale Collaboration](http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/news/102-pseudo-science-by-degrees-a-response.html). He said \"Whilst I understand your concerns, colleagues of the School of Life Sciences where these courses are offered do not share them. They are not teaching pseudo-science, as you claim,...\". Neither of thse claims is true.I know at least two members of the Life Sciences Faculty who are very worried. One has now left and one has retired. The rest are presumably too scared to speak out. It is most certainly not true to say they \"are not teaching pseudo-science\". Both the vice-chancellor and the Dean of Life Sciences, Jane Lewis, have been made aware of what;s happening repeatedly over several years, I can think of no other way to put it but to say Professor Petts is lying. Tha is not a good thing for vice-chancellors to do. Much of what is taught at Westminster has now been revealed. This seems like a good moment to summarise what we know. Searching this blog for \"University of Westminster\" yields 39 hits. Of these, 11 show what's taught at Westminster, so I'll summarise them here for easy reference. March 26th, 2007 The day after \" [Science degrees without the Science](http://dcscience.net/?p=19)\" appeared in Nature, the University of Westminster issued a statement (now vanished, [but see debate in THE](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=208512\u00a7ioncode=26)). In my view, their statement provides the strongest grounds so far to believe that the BSc is inappropriate. Let's take a look at it. | | \"The BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Homeopathy is a fully validated degree that satisfies internal and external quality assurance standards.\" Since that time, the university has closed down the BSc in Homeopathy.

He must know that this simply isn't true.

The lecturer underestimated the stupidiity of the Department of Health which [went ahead with statutory regulation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117) despite being made aware of what was going on. The latest example to come to light is cited by Andy Lewis on his [Quackometer blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/foresight-preconception.html) \"There are some even odder characters too, such as [Roy Riggs B.Sc]who describes himself as a \"Holistic Geobiologist\" and is \"an \"professional Earth Energy dowser\".

His denial of the obvious fact that his university is teaching pseudo-science serves only to discredit further the University of Westminster and his own integrity. Follow-up 13 August 2011 I'm intrigued to notice that two days after posting this summary, googling \"Geoffrey Petts\" brings up this post as #3 on the first page. Actions have consequences. Almost all the revelations about what's taught on university courses in alternative medicine have come from [post-1992 universities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_universities). (For readers not in the UK, post-1992 universities are the many new univerities created in 1992, from former polytechnics etc, and [Russell group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_group) universities are the \"top 20\" research-intensive universities) It is true that all the undergraduate courses are in post-1992 universities, but the advance of quackademia is by no means limited to them. The teaching at [St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1143), one of the oldest, was pretty disgraceful for example, though after protests from their own students, and from me, it is now better, I believe. Quackery creeps into all universities to varying extents. The good ones (like Southampton) don't run \"BSc\" degrees, but it still infiltrates through two main sources, The first is via their HR departments, which are run by people who tend to be (I quote) \" [credulous and moronic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=226)\" when it comes to science. The other main source is in teaching to medical students. The General Medical Council says that medical students must know something about alterantive medicine and that's quite right, A lot of their patients will use it. The problem is that the guidance is shockingly vague . \"They must be aware that many patients are interested in and choose to use a range of alternative and complementary therapies. Graduates must be aware of the existence and range of such therapies, why some patients use them, and how these might affect other types of treatment that patients are receiving.\" (from [Tomorrow's Doctors, GMC]) In many medical schools, the information that medical students get is quite accurate. At UCL and at King's (London) I have done some of the familiarisation myself. In other good medical schools, the students get some shocking stuff. [St Bartholomew's Hospital](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555) medical School was one example. [Edinburgh University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) was another. But there is one Russell group university where alternative myths are propagated more than any other that I know about. That is the University of Southampton. In general, Southampton is a good place, I worked there for three years myself (1972 - 1975). The very first noise spectra I measured were calculated on a PDP computer in their excellent Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, before I wrote my own programs to do it. But Southanpton also has a The Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit . Oddly the unit's web site, [http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk), is not a university address, and a search of the university's web site for \"Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit\" produces no result. Nevertheless the unit is \"within the School of Medicine at the University of Southampton\" Notice the usual euphemisms 'complementary' and 'integrated' in the title: the word 'alternative' is never used. This sort of word play is part of the [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/personalized-medicine-bait-and-switch/) approach of alternative medicine. The unit is [quite big](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/people.php): ten research staff, four PhD students and two support staff It is headed by [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). Teaching about alternative medicine to Southampton medical students. The whole medical class seems to get quite a lot compared with other places I know about. That's 250 students (210 on the 5-year course plus another 40 from the 4-year graduate-entry route). Year 1: Lecture by David Owen on 'holism' within the Foundation Course given to all 210 medical students doing the standard (5-year) course. Year 2: Lecture by Lewith (on complementary medicine, focusing on acupuncture for pain) given within the nervous systems course to the whole medical student year-group (210 students). Year 3 SBOM (scientific basis of medicine) symposium: The 3-hour session (\"Complementary or Alternative Medicine: You Decide\"). I'm told that attendance at this symposium is often pretty low, but many do turn up and all of them are officially 'expected' to attend. There is also an optional CAM special study module chosen by 20 students in year 3, but also a small number of medical students (perhaps 2 - 3 each year?) choose to do a BMedSci research project supervised by the CAM research group and involving 16-18 weeks of study from October to May in Year 4. The CAM research group also supervise postgraduate students doing PhD research. As always, a list of lectures doesn't tell you much. What we need to know is what's taught to the students and something about the people who teach it. The other interesting question is how it comes about that alternative medicine has been allowed to become so prominent in a Russell group university. It must have support from on high. In this case it isn't hard to find out where it comes from. Here are some details. Year 1 Dr David Owen [David Owen](http://www.thenaturalpractice.com/practitioners/index/?practitioner=1) is not part of Lewith's group, but a member of the Division of Medical Education headed by Dr Faith Hill (of whom, more below). He's one of the many part-time academics in this area, being also a founder of [The Natural Practice](http://www.thenaturalpractice.com/) . Owen is an advocate of homeopathy (a past president of the Faculty of Homeopathy). Homeopathy is, of course, the most barmy and discredited of all the popular sorts of alternative medicine. Among those who have discredited it is the head of the alt med unit, [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695) himself (though oddly he [still prescribes it](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956)). And he's also a member of the [British Society of Environmental Medicine](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/) (BSEM). That sounds like a very respectable title, but don't be deceived. It is an organisation that promotes all sorts of seriously fringe ideas. All you have to do is notice that the star speaker at their 2011 conference was none other than used-to-be a doctor, Andrew Wakefield, a man who has been responsible for the death of children from measles by causing an unfounded scare about vaccination on the basis of data that turned out to [ have been falsified](http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452). There is still a [letter of support](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/the-gmc-and-dr-andrew-wakefield) for Wakefield on the BSEM web site. The BSEM [specialises in](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/practitioners) exaggerated claims about 'environmental toxins' and uses phony allergy tests like [ kinesiology](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/05/how-applied-kinesiology-can-be-used-to-justify-any-quack-treatment.html) and the [Vega test](http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series2/food_sensitivity_allergy_vega_tests.shtml) that misdiagnose allergies, but provide en excuse to prescribe expensive but unproven nutritional supplements, or expensive psychobabble like \"neuro-linguistic programming\". Other registered \"ecological physicians\" include the infamous D [r Sarah Myhil](http://www.skepticat.org/2010/04/dr-myhill/)l, who, in 2010, was the subject of a [damning verdict by the GMC](http://www.drmyhill.co.uk/wiki/GMC%27s_full_verdict), and Southampton's George Lewith. If it is wrong to expose medical students to someone who believes that dose-response curves have a negative slope (the smaller the dose the bigger the effect -I know, it's crazy), then it is downright wicked to expose students to a supporter of Andrew Wakefield. David Owen's appearance on Radio Oxford, with the indomitable Andy Lewis appears on his [Quackometer blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/06/debating-homeopathy-on-bbc-oxford-radio.html). Year 2 Dr George Lewith Lewith is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. He's participated in some research that is quite good by the (generally pathetic) standards of the world of alternative medicine. In 2001 he showed that the [ Vega test did not work](http://www.dcscience.net/Lewith-Vega-test-01.pdf) as a method of allergy diagnosis. \"Conclusion Electrodermal testing cannot be used to diagnose environmental allergies\", published in the BMJ .[ [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/Lewith-Vega-test-01.pdf)]. In 2003 reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/Brien-Lewith-2003.pdf)] that showed homeopathic pills with no active ingredients had no effects: The conclusion was \"\"Ultramolecular homeopathy has no observable clinical effects\" (the word ultramolecular, in this context, means that the belladonna pills contained no belladonna). In 2010 he again concluded that homeopathic pills were no more than placebos, as described in [Despite the spin, Lewith's paper surely signals the end of homeopathy (again)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695). [ [download reprint](http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/11/08/rheumatology.keq234.full.pdf)] What i cannot understand is that, despite his own findings, his private practice continues to prescribe the Vega machine and continues to prescribe homeopathic pills. And he continues to preach this subject to unfortunate medical students. Lewith is also one of the practitioners [recommended by BSEM](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/practitioners). He's a [director of](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) the \"College of Medicine\". And he's also an advisor to a charity called Yes To Life. (see [A thoroughly dangerous charity: YesToLife promotes nonsense cancer treatments](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4239)). 3rd year Student Selected Unit The teaching team includes: - David Owen - Principal Clinical Teaching Fellow SoM, Holistic Physician - George Lewith - Professor of Health Research and Consultant Physician - Caroline Eyles - Homeopathic Physician - Susan Woodhead - Acupuncturist - Elaine Cooke - Chiropractic Practitioner - Phine Dahle - Psychotherapist - Keith Carr - Reiki Master - Christine Rose - Homeopath and GP - David Nicolson - Nutritionalist - Shelley Baker - Aromatherapist - Cheryl Dunford - Hypnotherapist - Dedj Leibbrandt - Herbalist More details of the teaching team [here](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/teachingteam.php). There is not a single sceptic among them, so the students don't get a debate, just propaganda. In this case. there's no need for the Freedom of Information Act. The [ handouts](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/handouts.php). and the [powerpoints](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/presentations.php) are on their web site. They seem to be proud of them Let's look at some examples Chiropractic makes an interesting case, because, in the wake of the [Singh-BCA libel case](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1980), the claims of chiropractors have been [scrutinised as never before](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) and most of their claims have turned out to be bogus. There is a close relationship between Lewith's unit and the Anglo-European Chiropractic College (the 3rd year module includes a visit there). In fact the handout provided for students, [Evidence for Chiropractic Care ](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/evidence_for_chiropractic_care.pdf), was written by the College. It's interesting because it provides no real evidence whatsoever for the effectiveness of chiropractic care. It's fairly honest in stating that the view at present is that, for low back pain, it isn't possible to detect any difference between the usefulness of manipulation by a physiotherapist, by an osteopath or by a chiropractor. Of course it does not draw the obvious conclusion that this makes chiropractic and osteopathy entirely redundant -you can get the same result without all the absurd mumbo jumbo that chiropractors and osteopaths love, or their high-pressure salesmanship and superfluous X-rays. Neither does it mention the sad, but entirely possible, outcome that none of the manipulations are effective for low back pain. There is, for example, no mention of the fascinating paper by Artus et al [ [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/artus-rheumatology-2010.pdf)]. This paper concludes \"symptoms seem to improve in a similar pattern in clinical trials following a wide variety of active as well as inactive treatments.\" This paper was brought to my attention through the blog run by the exellent physiotherapist, Neil O'Connell. [He comments](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) \"If this finding is supported by future studies it might suggest that we can't even claim victory through the non-specific effects of our interventions such as care, attention and placebo. People enrolled in trials for back pain may improve whatever you do. This is probably explained by the fact that patients enrol in a trial when their pain is at its worst which raises the murky spectre of regression to the mean and the beautiful phenomenon of natural recovery.\" This sort of critical thinking is conspicuously absent from this (and all the other) Southampton handouts. The handout is a superb example of bait and switch: No nonsense about infant colic, innate energy or imaginary subluxations appears in it. Acupuncture is another interesting case because there is quite a lot of research evidence, in stark contrast to the rest of traditional Chinese medicine, for which there is very little research. | | There is a The message is simple and totally uncritical. It works. | | In fact there is now a broad consensus about acupuncture. (1) Real acupuncture and sham acupuncture have been found to be indistinguishable in many trials. This is the case regardless of whether the sham is a retractable needle (or even a toothpick) in the \"right\" places, or whether it is real needles inserted in the \"wrong\" places. The latter finding shows clearly that all that stuff about meridians and flow of Qi is sheer hocus pocus. It dates from a pre-scientific age and it was wrong. (2) A non-blind comparison of acupuncture versus no acupuncture shows an advantage for acupuncture. But the advantage is usually too small to be of any clinical significance. [ In all probability it is a placebo effect](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3136) -it's hard to imagine a more theatrical event than having someone in a white coat stick long needles into you, like a voodoo doll. Sadly, the placebo effect isn't big enough to be of much use. Needless to say, none of this is conveyed to the medical students of Southampton. Instead they are shown crude ancient ideas that date from long before anything was known about physiology as though they were actually true. These folks truly live in some alternative universe. Here are some samples from the acupuncture [powerpoint show](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/presentations/Acupuncture%20presentation%20Susan%20Woodhead.pdf) by Susan Woodhead. Well this is certainly a \"different diagnostic language\", but no attempt is made to say which one is right. In the mind of the acupuncurist it seems both are true. It is a characteristic of alternative medicine advocates that they have no difficulty in believing simultaneously several mutually contradictory propositions. As a final exmple of barminess, just look at the acupuncture points (allegedly) on the ear The fact that it is a favoured by some people in the Pentagon as [battlefield acupuncture](http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/02/15/battlefield-acupuncture-pseudoscience-for-wounded-troops/), is more reminiscent of the mad general, Jack D. Ripper, in [Dr Strangelove](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY&feature=related) than it is of science. There is an equally uncritical [handout on acupuncture](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/_compmed_handouts_acupuncture.pdf) by Val Hopwood. It's dated March 2003, a time before some of the most valuable experiments were done. The handout says \"sham acupuncture is generally less effective than true acupuncture\", precisely the opposite of what's known now. And there are some bits that give you a good laugh, always helpful in teaching. I like \"There is little doubt that an intact functioning nervous system is required for acupuncture to produce analgesia or, for that matter, any physiological changes\" and Modern techniques: These include hybrid electro-acupuncture . . . and Ryadoraku [sic] therapy and Vega testing. Vega testing!! That's been disproved dozens of times (not least by George Lewith). And actually the other made-up nonsense is spelled [Ryodoraku](http://www.ryodoraku.eu/). It's true that there is a short paragraph at the end of the handout headed \"Scientific evaluation of acupuncture\" but it doesn't cite a single reference and reads more like excuses for why acupuncture so often fails when it's tested properly. Homeopathy. Finally a bit about that most boring of topics, the laughable medicine that contains no medicine, homeopathy. Caroline Eyles is a member for the Society of Homeopaths, the organisation that did nothing when its members were caught out in the murderous practice of recommending homeopathy for prevention of malaria. The Society of Homeopaths also [endorses Jeremy Sherr](http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/jeremy-sherr-fellow-of-the-society-of-homeopaths-wants-to-cure-aids-and-malaria-with-homeopathy/), a man so crazy that he believes he can cure AIDS and malaria with sugar pills. The homeopathy [handout](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/_compmed_handouts_homeopathy.pdf) given to the students has 367 references, but somehow manages to omit the references to their own boss's work showing that the pills are placebos. The handout has all the sciencey-sounding words, abused by people who don't understand them. \"The remedy will be particularly effective if matched to the specific/particular characteristics of the individual (the 'totality' of the patient) on all levels, including the emotional and mental levels, as well as just the physical symptoms. 'Resonance' with the remedy's curative power will then be at it's [sic] best.\" The handout is totally misleading about the current state of research. It says \"increasing clinical research confirms it's [sic] clinical effectiveness in treating patients, including babies and animals (where a placebo effect would be hard to justify).\" | | The | | Anyone who has to rely on the utterly discredited [Jacques Benveniste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Benveniste) as evidence is clearly clutching at straws. What's more interesting about this slide the admission that \"reproducibility is a problem -oops, an issue\" and that RCTs (done largely by homeopaths of course) have \"various methodological flaws and poor external validity\". You'd think that if that was the best that could be produced after 200 yours, they'd shut up shop and get another job. But, like aging vicars who long since stopped believing in god, but are damned if they'll give up the nice country rectory, they struggle on, sounding [increasingly desperate](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/1887.html). How have topics like this become so embedded in a medical course at a Russell group university? The details above are a bit tedious and repetitive. It's already established that hardly any alternative medicine works. Don't take my word for it. Check [the web site](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/atoz.htm) of the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) who, at a cost of over $2 billion have produced nothing useful. A rather more interesting question is how a good university like Southampton comes to be exposing its medical students to teaching like this. There must be some powerful allies higher up in the university. In this case it's pretty obvious who thay are. Professor Stephen Holgate FBMS FMed Sci CBE has to be the primary suspect, He's listed as one of Southampton's [Outstanding Academics](http://www.soton.ac.uk/research/outstanding_academics/index.html). His work is nothing to do with alternative medicine but he's been a long term supporter of the late unlamented Prince of Wales' Foundation, and he's now [on the advisory board](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/professor-stephen-holgate) of it's successor, the so called \"College of Medicine\" (for more information about that place see the [new \"College of Medicine\" arising from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), and also [Don't be deceived. The new \"College of Medicine\" is a fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632) ). His description on that site reads thus. \"Stephen Holgate is MRC Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton School of Medicine and Honorary Consultant Physician at Southampton University Hospital Trust. He is also chair of the MRC's Populations and Systems Medicine Board. Specialising in respiratory medicine, he is the author of over 800 peer-reviewed papers and contributions to scientific journals and editor of major textbooks on asthma and rhinitis. He is Co-Editor of Clinical and Experimental Allergy, Associate Editor of Clinical Science and on the editorial board of 25 other scientific journals.\" Clearly a busy man. Personally I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who claims to be the author of over 800 papers. He graduated in medicine in 1971, so that is an average of over 20 papers a year since then, one every two or three weeks. I'd have trouble reading that many, never mind writing them. Holgate's long-standing interest in alternative medicine is baffling. He's published on the topic with George Lewith, who, incidentally, is [one of the directors](http://www.dcscience.net/blREX+0L0198-7358_6-05180774.pdf) of the \"College of Medicine\".. It may be unkind to mention that, for many years now, I've been hearing rumours that Holgate is suffering from an unusually bad case of [Knight starvation](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=13#quote). The Division of Medical Education appears to be the other big source of support for. anti-scientific medicine. That is very odd, I know, but it was also the medical education people who were responsible for mis-educating medical students at. [St. Bartholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555) and at [ Edinburgh university](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming). Southampton's [Division of Medical Education](http://www.som.soton.ac.uk/research/medicaleducation/) has a mind-boggling 60 academic and support staff. Two of them are of particular interest here. Faith Hill is director of the division. [Her profile](http://www.som.soton.ac.uk/about/staff/listing/profile.asp?fhill) doesn't say anything about alternative medicine, but her interest is clear from a 2003 paper, [Complementary and alternative medicine: the next generation of health promotion?](http://www.dcscience.net/Faith-Hill-CAM.pdf). The research consisted of reporting anecdotes from interviews of 52 unnamed people (this sort of thing seems to pass for research in the social sciences). It starts badly by misrepresenting the conclusions of the [House of Lords report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=199) (2000) on CAM. Although it comes to no useful conclusions, it certainly shows a high tolerance of nonsensical treatments. Chris Stephens is Associate Dean of Medical Education & Student Experience. His sympathy is shown by a paper he wrote In 2001, with David Owen (the homeopath, above) and George Lewith: [Can doctors respond to patients' increasing interest in complementary and alternative medicine?](http://www.bmj.com/content/322/7279/154.full?ijkey=cef1ed0dd3a181def66f02738144eb35ba3f229c&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). Two of the conclusions of this paper were as follows. \"Doctors are training in complementary and alternative medicine and report benefits both for their patients and themselves\" Well, no actually. It wasn't true then, and it's probably even less true now. There's now a lot more evidence and most of it shows alternative medicine doesn't work. \"Doctors need to address training in and practice of complementary and alternative medicine within their own organisations\" Yes they certainly need to do that. And the first thing that Drs Hill and Stephens should do is look a bit more closely about what's taught in their own university, I hope that this post helps them, Follow-up 4 July 2011. A correspondent has just pointed out that Chris Stephens is a [member of the General Chiropractic Council](http://www.gcc-uk.org/page.cfm?page_id=8). The GCC is a truly pathetic pseudo-regulator. In the wake of the Simon Singh affair it has been kept busy fending off well-justified complaints against untrue claims made by chiropractors. The [ GCC is a sad joke](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2010/11/chiropractors-at-war-with-their-regulator-the-gcc.html), but it's even sadder to see a Dean of Medical Education at the University of Southampton being involved with an organisation that has treated little matters of truth with such disdain. A rather unkind tweet from (ex)-chiropractor @RichardLanigan. \"Chris is just another light weight academic who likes being on committees. Regulatory bodies are full of them\" One of my first posts about nonsense taught in universities was about the University of Westminster (April 2008): [Westminster University BSc: \"amethysts emit high yin energy\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227). since then, there have been several more revelations. | | Professor Petts | | The vice-cnancellor of Westminster, Professor Geoffrey Petts, with whom the buck stops, did have an internal review but its report was all hot air and no action resulted (see By that time Salford University had closed down all its CAM, and the University of Central Lancashire was running an honest internal review which resulted in closure of (almost) all of their nonsense degrees. But Westminster proved more resistant to sense and, although they closed down homeopathy, they still remain the largest single provider of degrees in junk medicine. See, for example [More make-believe from the University of Westminster. This time it's Naturopathy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812), and [The last BSc (Hons) Homeopathy closes! But look at what they still teach at Westminster University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329). It's interesting that Westminster always declined to comply with Freedom of Information requests, yet I had more from them than from most places. All the information about what's taught at Westminster came from leaks from within the university. Westminster has more moles than a suburban garden. They were people with conscience who realised that the university was harming itself. They would claim that they were trying to save the university from some remarkably bad management. I claim also that I'm working in the interests of the university. In the wake of the [victory at the Information Tribunal,](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485) I sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for for samples of teaching materials from all of their courses. This time they couldn't legally refuse. The first batch has just arrived, so here are a few selected gems of utter nonsense. Well, it is worse than nonsense because it endangers the health of sick people. A letter to the university from a student Before getting on to the slides, here's a letter that was supplied under FOIA. It was sent anonymously to the university. I was told that this was the only letter of complaint but I happen to know that's not true so I've asked again. This one was forwarded to the vice-chancellor in 2008, and to the review committee. Both seem to have ignored it. Judging from the wording, one would guess that it came from one of their own undergraduates. :Here are some extracts.[ [download whole letter](/westminster-complaint-2008.pdf)] | | It is a flagrant contradiction of a 'science' in the BSc to have these practices, but it also jeopardises our profession, which is under DoH review and being constantly attacked in the media Gustifiable I suggest). We are taught that simply tasting plant tinctures can tell us which part of the body they work. on and what they do in the body. We are given printed charts with an outline of the body on to record our findings on. This is both nonsense, but is dangerous as it implies that the pharmacology of plant tinctures can be divined by taste alone. In class we are taught that we can divine the drug actions or use of an unknown plant simply by tasting an alcohol extract. Science? or dangerous fantasy. There are lecturers taking clinics who allow students to dowse and partake themselves in dowsing or pendulums to diagnose and even to test suitability of plant drugs. Dowsing is taught to us by some lecturers and frowned upon by others but we feel it brings the herbal medicine into a poor light as it is unscientific and bogus nonsense. We are concerned that we have seen the course leader brush over this practice as though she is frightened to make a stand. The letter seems to refer to a course in herbal medicine. That is a subject that could be studied scientifically, though to do so would leave students unemployed because so few herbal treatments have been shown to work. It obviously is not being studied scientifically: but even teaching students about dowsing and pendulums does not seem to have stirred the vice-chancellor into action. David Peters: wishful thinking? David Peters is a nice man. He's the Clinical Director of Westminster's School of Integrated Health. I debated with him on the excellent Radio 4 Programme, Material World. His lecture on \"Complementary Healthcare in the NHS\" showed some fine wishful thinking. It shows the progress of the euphemisms that quacks use to try to gain respectability, but little else. Interestingly, later slides show a bit more realism. So he has noticed that the tide has turned and that a lot of people are no longer willing to be palmed off with new age gobbledygook. And yes, courses are shutting. Perhaps his course will be the next to shut? According to an internal Westminster email that found its way to me, The following courses have been closed/identified for closure due to poor recruitment : - BSc degrees in Homeopathy and Remedial Massage & Neuromuscular Therapy, students completing by September 2011 - MA degrees in International Community development, Community development and Faith-based Community development, students completing by September 2011 - BSc degree Complementary Medicine - Graduate diploma BMS The following courses have been identified as 'at risk' (School definition) and will be discussed at the APRG and University Review Group2, due to poor recruitment and high cost of delivery: - Integrated Health Scheme: BSc Herbal Medicine The BSc (Hons) degree in naturopathy Naturopathy us pretty bizarre, because it consists largely of doing nothing at all, beyond eating vegetables . Being ill is good for you. Perhaps the best source to judge claims is the US [ National Center for Complementary and Alternive Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=123) (NCCAM), a branch of the National Institutes of Health. This is the outfit that has spent over a billion dollars of US taxpayers' money testing alternative medicines and for all that money has not come up with a single useful treatment. They never link to any sort of critical comment, and are nothing if not biassed towards all things alternative. If they can't come up with evidence. nobody can. Two useful links to NCCAM are [Herbs at a glance](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm), and [Health Topics A - Z](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/atoz.htm). Uses of herbal teas in naturopathic dietary care I was sent a set of over 50 slides on \"Herbal Teas/Decoctions (3CMWS03, 1/02, Uses of herbal teas in naturopathic dietary care). About half of them amount to little more than 'how to make a cup of tea'. but then we get onto uses, but then a lot of fantasy ensues. What [NNCAM says about dandelion](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/dandelion/). There is no compelling scientific evidence for using dandelion as a treatment for any medical condition. What Westminster says Well I know what a diuretic is, but \"blood purifier\" and \"liver tonic\" are meaningless gobbledygook. We've been through this before with Red Clover (see Michael Quinion's .look at the term \" [blood cleanser](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=16)\"). Using words like them is the very opposite of education. What [NCCAM says](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/chamomile/ataglance.htm).about chamomile: Chamomile has not been well studied in people so there is little evidence to support its use for any condition. What Westminster says So, judging by NCCAM, these claims are unjustified. It's teaching folk-lore as though it meant something. More dangerous advice comes when we get to the 'repertories'. Infections can kill you, They are one of the modest number of things that pharmacology can usually cure, rather than treat symptomatically.

It will \" . . strengthen and protect against toxic environmental influences, geopathic stress, and other hazards of technology-dominated modern life. This includes the disruptive effects of radiation on human energy fields from X-rays, televisions, computer monitors, electromagnetic fields, airplane flights or nuclear fall-out.\" OK stop giggling. This is serious stuff, taught in a UK university as part of a BSc degree, and awarded a high score by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA). Professor Petts, are you listening? I believe it is you, not I, who is bringing your university into disrepute. The slides shown here are copyright of the University of Westminster or of the author of the lecture. They are small sample of what I was sent and are reproduced under the \"fair quotation\" provision, in the public interest. Follow-up 5 May 2011. By sheer coincidence, [Emily and Linda Rosa](#rosa) were passing through London. They called for lunch and here's a picture (with Ben Goldacre) in UCL's ( [endangered](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ascr/housmanroomfuture)) Housman room. Linda kindly gave me a copy of her book [Attachment Therapy on Trial: The Torture and Death of Candace Newmaker](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Attachment-Therapy-Trial-Newmaker-Psychology/dp/B000PY3FMQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1304623563&sr=8-1). [Download [ reprint of Rosa's paper.](/Rosa-1998-JAMA.pdf).] . 6 May 2011. Talking of the \"vibrational medicine\" fantasy, I had an email that pointed out a site that plumbs new depths in fantasy physics. It's on the PositiveHealthOnline website: A post there, [Spirals and Energy in Nature](http://www.positivehealth.com/article/energy-medicine/spirals-and-energy-in-nature), was written by [Robert McCoy](http://www.positivehealth.com/author/robert-mccoy). He claims to have worked on microprocessor layout design, but anyone with school physics could tell that the article is sheer nonsense. In a way it is much more objectionable that the silly slides with coloured rays used in the Westminster course. McCoy's post seeks to blind with sciencey-sounding language, that in fact makea no sense at all. Luckily my retweet of the site attracted the attention of a real physicist, A.P. Gaylard, who made a very welcome return to blogging with [Fantasy physics and energy medicine](http://apgaylard.wordpress.com/2011/05/06/fantasy-physics-and-energy-medicine/). He dismantles the physics, line-by-line, in a devastating critique. This sort of junk physics is far more dangerous than the perpetual motion pundits and the cold-fusion fantasists. At PositiveHealthOnline it is being used to push pills that do you no good and may harm you. It is a danger to public health. "}
