It increases awareness of the sound scientific basis to aromatherapy with a wealth of data, and contains practical information for treatment. Contents include: Skin structure and function * Essential oil sciences in context * Aromadermatology and safety issues * The essentials of aromatic formulations * Skin-care essentials * Skin and the psyche * Skin infections * Childhood skin complaints * Inflammatory disorders * Wound care * Nails, hair and sebaceous glands 'With the growing interest in aromatherapy, it is important that therapists and healthcare professionals are able to offer a valid rationale when integrating essential oils into clinical care. Sound knowledge of bio-chemical principles and the ability to critically appraise and apply relevant research are fundamental requirements. This book offers a comprehensive, in-depth view of current knowledge. The authors have skilfully woven research and clinical application. A range of therapeutic possibilities is explored and offers practitioners alternative approaches to the management of skin conditions. These include detailed discussions on different methods of application. I hope that this book will become a standard text on both pre-qualifying and CPD courses in aromatherapy.' - Angela Avis, in her Foreword 'This well-illustrated, thorough and authoritative text is written in a language and style that is clear and accessible to a variety of healthcare practitioners. A thorough understanding of dermatology underpins the book, and both current research and clinical knowledge are elegantly applied to the skin conditions discussed.' - Robert "}
