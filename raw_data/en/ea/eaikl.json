Some KU Medical Center partners are administering their own religious exemption request processes while other sites are directing KU Medical Center to perform that review. If the clinical site you are assigned to is administering the exemption review process, you may not need to complete or submit any forms to KU Medical Center, unless otherwise directed by the site. Some sites reviewing and deciding exemptions have developed their own forms for students to submit directly to them. Please communicate with your school/program to better understand the clinical site's process, and which form to complete. Please know that some clinical sites are still deciding how they will administer student requests for religious exemption, and have not yet communicated their processes to KU Medical Center. If your clinical site directs that KU Medical Center review and decide religious exemption requests, please complete and submit the form.
