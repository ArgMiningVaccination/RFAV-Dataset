After the intake, we will apply acupuncture needles based on what you are wanting help with that day. This can be anywhere from 10-30 needles. Once all the needles are placed, we allow 25-30 minutes of rest time where the practitioner will leave the room. During that time, it is okay to fall asleep, stay awake, meditate, or just reflect on your day. If any discomfort is experienced while the practitioner is out of the room, we give you a handheld button to \"page\" us if anything gets uncomfortable for you. After the rest time is up, the practitioner will come back in and pull the needles out.
