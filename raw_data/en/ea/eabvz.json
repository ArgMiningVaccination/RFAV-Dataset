However, access to CAR-T cells is not adequate to meet clinical needs, in part due to high cost and long lead times for manufacturing clinical grade virus. Non-viral site directed CAR integration can be accomplished using CRISPR/Cas9 and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) via homology-directed repair (HDR), however yields with this approach have been limiting for clinical application (dsDNA) or access to large yields sufficient to meet the manufacturing demands outside early phase clinical trials is limited (ssDNA).METHODS: We applied homology-independent targeted insertion (HITI) or HDR using CRISPR/Cas9 and nanoplasmid DNA to insert an anti-GD2 CAR into the T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) locus and compared both targeted insertion strategies in our system. Next, we optimized post-HITI CRISPR EnrichMENT (CEMENT) to seamlessly integrate it into a 14-day process and compared our knock-in with viral transduced anti-GD2 CAR-T cells. Finally, we explored the off-target genomic toxicity of our genomic engineering approach.RESULTS: Here, we show that site directed CAR integration utilizing nanoplasmid DNA delivered via HITI provides high cell yields and highly functional cells. CEMENT enriched CAR T cells to approximately 80% purity, resulting in therapeutically relevant dose ranges of 5.5*108-3.6*109 CAR+T cells. CRISPR knock-in cells were functionally comparable with viral transduced anti-GD2 CAR-T cells and did not show any evidence of off-target genomic toxicity.CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides a novel platform to perform guided CAR insertion into primary human T-cells using nanoplasmid DNA and holds the potential to increase access to CAR-T cell therapies.

In addressing the future of CAR T cell therapy for B-ALL, innovative strategies to avert antigen downregulation and enhance CAR persistence warrant prioritized focus.We describe promising engineering strategies to refine CAR constructs to reverse exhaustion, develop regulatable CARs, optimize manufacturing, enrich for immune memory and disrupt immune inhibition. We additionally focus on alternative targeting to CD19-monospecific targeting and contextualize possibilities for expanded CAR utilization.We describe research advances as they are independently reported, however anticipate an integrative strategy incorporating complementary modifications will be required to effectively address CAR loss, overcome antigen downregulation and enhance reliability and durability of CAR T cell responses for B-ALL.

Establishment of grading scales and standardized grade-based treatment algorithms for toxicity syndromes can improve the safety of these treatments, as observed for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) in patients with B cell malignancies treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. We have observed a toxicity syndrome, distinct from CRS and ICANS, in patients treated with cell therapies for tumors in the central nervous system (CNS), which we term tumor inflammation-associated neurotoxicity (TIAN). Encompassing the concept of 'pseudoprogression,' but broader than inflammation-induced edema alone, TIAN is relevant not only to cellular therapies, but also to other immunotherapies for CNS tumors. To facilitate the safe administration of cell therapies for patients with CNS tumors, we define TIAN, propose a toxicity grading scale for TIAN syndrome and discuss the potential management of this entity, with the goal of standardizing both reporting and management.

In conventional T cell therapy, chronic stimulation can result in poor invivo function, a phenomenon termed exhaustion. Whether or not Tregs are also susceptible to exhaustion, and if so, if this would limit their therapeutic effect, was unknown. To \"benchmark\" exhaustion in human Tregs, we used a method known to induce exhaustion in conventional T cells: expression of a tonic-signaling chimeric antigen receptor (TS-CAR). We found that TS-CAR-expressing Tregs rapidly acquired a phenotype that resembled exhaustion and had major changes in their transcriptome, metabolism, and epigenome. Similar to conventional T cells, TS-CAR Tregs upregulated expression of inhibitory receptors and transcription factors such as PD-1, TIM3, TOX and BLIMP1, and displayed a global increase in chromatin accessibility-enriched AP-1 family transcription factor binding sites. However, they also displayed Treg-specific changes such as high expression of 4-1BB, LAP, and GARP. DNA methylation analysis and comparison to a CD8+ T cell-based multipotency index showed that Tregs naturally exist in a relatively differentiated state, with further TS-CAR-induced changes. Functionally, TS-CAR Tregs remained stable and suppressive invitro but were nonfunctional invivo, as tested in a model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. These data are the first comprehensive investigation of exhaustion in Tregs and reveal key similarities and differences with exhausted conventional T cells. The finding that human Tregs are susceptible to chronic stimulation-driven dysfunction has important implications for the design of CAR Treg adoptive immunotherapy strategies.

Researchers have attempted to apply Boolean-logic gating to CAR T cells to prevent toxicity3-5; however, a truly safe and effective logic-gated CAR has remained elusive6. Here we describe an approach to CAR engineering in which we replace traditional CD3 domains with intracellular proximal T cell signalling molecules. We show that certain proximal signalling CARs, such as a ZAP-70 CAR, can activate T cells and eradicate tumours in vivo while bypassing upstream signalling proteins, including CD3. The primary role of ZAP-70 is to phosphorylate LAT and SLP-76, which form a scaffold for signal propagation. We exploited the cooperative role of LAT and SLP-76 to engineer logic-gated intracellular network (LINK) CAR, a rapid and reversible Boolean-logic AND-gated CAR T cell platform that outperforms other systems in both efficacy and prevention of on-target, off-tumour toxicity. LINK CAR will expand the range of molecules that can be targeted with CAR T cells, and will enable these powerful therapeutic agents to be used for solid tumours and diverse diseases such as autoimmunity7 and fibrosis8. In addition, this work shows that the internal signalling machinery of cells can be repurposed into surface receptors, which could open new avenues for cellular engineering.

Case series report poor outcomes for those with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who develop HLH-like toxicities, although larger outcomes analyses of children and young adults (CAYA) with B-ALL who develop these toxicities following commercial tisagenlecleucel are not described. Using a multi-institutional database of 185 CAYA with B-ALL, we conducted a retrospective cohort study including groups that developed HLH-like toxicities, high grade CRS without HLH-like toxicities, or no to low grade CRS without HLH-like toxicities. Primary objectives included characterizing the incidence, outcomes, and pre-infusion factors associated with HLH-like toxicities. Among 185 CAYA infused tisagenlecleucel, 26 (14.1%) criteria for HLH-like toxicities. One-year overall survival and relapse-free survival were 25.7% 4.7% in those with HLH-like toxicities, compared with 80.1% and 57.6% in those without. In multivariable analysis for death, meeting criteria for HLH-like toxicities carried a hazard ratio of 4.61 (95% confidence interval: 2.41-8.83), controlling for disease burden, age, and sex. Patients who developed HLH-like toxicities had higher pre-tisagenlecleucel disease burden, ferritin, C-reactive protein levels, and lower platelet and absolute neutrophil counts than patients with high grade or no/low grade CRS without HLH-like toxicities. Overall, CAYA with B-ALL who developed HLH-like tisagenlecleucel experienced high rates of relapse and non-relapse mortality, indicating the urgent need for further investigations into prevention and optimal management of patients who develop HLH-like toxicities following tisagenlecleucel.

Literature describing specific relapse patterns and extramedullary (EM) sites of involvement in the post-CAR setting remains limited, and a clinical standard for post-CAR disease surveillance has yet to be established. We highlight the importance of integrating peripheral blood minimal residual disease (MRD) testing and radiologic imaging into surveillance strategies, to effectively characterize and capture post-CAR relapse.Here, we describe the case of a child with multiply relapsed B-ALL who relapsed in the post-CAR setting with gross non-contiguous medullary and EM disease. Interestingly, her relapse was identified first from peripheral blood flow cytometry MRD surveillance, in context of a negative bone marrow aspirate (MRD <0.01%). Positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose revealed diffuse leukemia with innumerable bone and lymph node lesions, interestingly sparing her sacrum, the site of her bone marrow aspirate sampling.We highlight this case as both peripheral blood MRD and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging were more sensitive than standard bone marrow aspirate testing in detecting this patient's post-CAR relapse. Clinical/Biologic Insight: In the multiply where relapse patterns may include patchy medullary and/or EM disease, peripheral blood MRD and/or whole body imaging, may carry increased sensitivity at detecting relapse in patient subsets, as compared with standard bone marrow sampling.

Here we review the immunobiology and design principles of current prototype CARs and present emerging platforms that are anticipated to drive future clinical advances. The field is witnessing a rapid expansion of next-generation CAR immune cell technologies designed to enhance efficacy, safety and access. Substantial progress has been made in augmenting immune cell fitness, activating endogenous immunity, arming cells to resist suppression via the tumour microenvironment and developing approaches to modulate antigen density thresholds. Increasingly sophisticated multispecific, logic-gated and regulatable CARs display the potential to overcome resistance and increase safety. Early signs of progress with stealth, virus-free and in vivo gene delivery platforms provide potential paths for reduced costs and increased access of cell therapies in the future. The continuing clinical success of CAR T cells in liquid cancers is driving the development of increasingly sophisticated immune cell therapies that are poised to translate to treatments for solid cancers and non-malignant diseases in the coming years.

To characterize determinants of resistance, we profiled over 700 longitudinal specimens from two independent cohorts (n= 65 and n= 73) of r/rLBCL patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. A method for simultaneous profiling of circulating tumor (ctDNA), cell-free of tumor and both engineered and non-engineered Tcell effector-mediated factors for assessing treatment failure and predicting outcomes. Alterations in multiple classes of genes are associated with resistance, including B cell identity (PAX5 and IRF8), immune checkpoints (CD274), and those affecting the microenvironment (TMEM30A). Somatic tumor alterations affect CAR19 therapy at multiple levels, including CAR19 Tcell expansion, persistence, and tumor microenvironment. Further, CAR19 Tcells play a reciprocal role in shaping tumor genotype and phenotype. We envision these findings will facilitate improved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) Tcells and personalized therapeutic approaches.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has transformed outcomes for relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, but whether its benefits extend commensurately to racial/ethnic minorities and patients with obesity is poorly understood. With a primary focus on patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we retrospectively evaluated the impact of demographics and obesity on CAR T-cell therapy outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies treated with CAR T-cell therapy across 5 phase 1 clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute from 2012 to 2021. Among 139 B-ALL CAR T-cell infusions, 28.8% of patients were Hispanic, 3.6% were Black, and 29.5% were overweight/obese. No significant associations were found between race, ethnicity, or body mass index (BMI) and complete remission rates, neurotoxicity, or overall survival. Hispanic patients were more likely to experience severe cytokine release syndrome compared with White non-Hispanic patients even after adjusting for leukemia disease burden and age (odds ratio, 4.5; P= .001). A descriptive analysis of patients with multiple myeloma (n= 24) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n= 23) displayed a similar pattern to the B-ALL cohort. Our findings suggest CAR T-cell therapy may provide substantial benefit across a range of demographics characteristics, including for those populations who are at higher risk for chemotherapy resistance and relapse. However, toxicity profiles may vary. Therefore, efforts to improve access to CAR therapy for underrepresented populations and elucidate mechanisms of differential toxicity among demographic groups should be prioritized.

To identify genes limiting T cell function, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens in human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Top hits were MED12 and CCNC, components of the Mediator kinase module. Targeted MED12 deletion enhanced antitumor activity and sustained the effector phenotype in CAR- and T cell receptor-engineered T cells, and inhibition of CDK8/19 kinase activity increased expansion of nonengineered T cells. MED12-deficient T cells manifested increased core Meditator chromatin occupancy at transcriptionally active enhancers-most notably for STAT and AP-1 transcription factors-and increased IL2RA expression and interleukin-2 sensitivity. These results implicate Mediator in T cell effector programming and identify the kinase module as a target for enhancing potency of antitumor T cell responses.

We conducted a Phase I/II trial of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in children and young adults with recurrent/refractory solid tumors.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ADVL1412, Part C assessed safety of plus ipilimumab at two dose levels (DL): DL1 and DL2 3mg/kg nivolumab plus 1mg/kg Ipilimumab. Part D evaluated response at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ipilimumab) in Ewing was measured using RECIST v1.1. Pharmacokinetics and PD-L1 expression on archival tissues were assessed.RESULTS: Fifty-five eligible patients enrolled. Based upon safety, tolerability and similar drug exposure to the same doses administered in adults, DL2 was defined as the pediatric RP2D. Among 41 patients treated at the RP2D, 2 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities during Cycle 1 and 4 patients experienced toxicities beyond that period. Two patients had clinically significant sustained partial responses (1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1 Ewing sarcoma) and 4 had stable disease. Among 8 patients treated at DL3, 3 DLTs occurred, all immune related adverse events; no objective responses were observed.CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D of nivolumab (3mg/kg) plus ipilimumab (1mg/kg) is well-tolerated in children and young adults with solid tumors and shows some clinical activity. Increased dose of ipilimumab (3mg/kg) plus nivolumab (1mg/kg) was associated with increased toxicity without clinical benefit.

Phase II landmark data from the ELIANA trial demonstrated nonresponse and relapse rates of 14.5% and 28%, respectively, whereas use in the real-world setting showed nonresponse and relapse rates of 15% and 37%. Outcome analyses describing fate after post-CAR nonresponse and relapse remain limited. Here, we aim to establish survival outcomes after nonresponse and both CD19+ and CD19- relapses and explore treatment variables associated with inferior survival.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multi-institutional study of 80 children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia experiencing nonresponse (n = 23) or relapse (n = 57) after tisagenlecleucel. We analyze associations between baseline characteristics and these outcomes and establish survival rates and salvage approaches.RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) at 12 months was 19% across nonresponders (n = 23; 95% CI, 7 to 50). Ninety-five percent of patients with nonresponse had high preinfusion disease burden. Among 156 morphologic responders, the cumulative incidence of relapse was 37% (95% CI, 30 to 47) 380 days). 57 patients experiencing relapse, the OS was 52% (95% CI, 38 to 71) at 12 months after time of relapse. Notably, CD19- relapse was associated with significantly decreased OS as compared with patients who relapsed with conserved reinfusion, and chemotherapy were used as postrelapse salvage therapy with greatest frequency, yet high variability in treatment sequencing and responses limits efficacy analysis across salvage approaches.CONCLUSION: We describe poor survival across patients experiencing nonresponse to tisagenlecleucel. In the post-tisagenlecleucel relapse setting, patients can be salvaged; however, CD19- relapse is distinctly associated with decreased survival outcomes.

Biomarkers associated with resistance and toxicity are limited. In this study, single-cell proteomic profiling of circulating CAR T cells in 32 patients treated with CD19-CAR identified that CD4+Helios+ CAR T cells on day 7 after infusion are associated with progressive disease and less severe neurotoxicity. Deep profiling demonstrated that this population is non-clonal and manifests hallmark features of T regulatory (TReg) cells. Validation cohort analysis upheld the link between higher CAR TReg cells with clinical progression and less severe neurotoxicity. A model combining expansion of this subset with lactate dehydrogenase levels, as a surrogate for tumor burden, was superior for predicting durable clinical response compared to models relying on each feature alone.

Currently, patients receive a single dose of tisagenlecleucel across a wide dose range of 0.2- 5.0 x 106 CAR T cells/kg for patients 50 kg, or 0.1- 2.5 x 108 CAR T cells for patients > 50 kg. The effect of cell dose on survival and remission has yet to be well-established. Our primary goal was to determine if CART cell dose impacts overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free-survival (RFS) in tisagenlecleucel-recipients. Retrospective data were collected from the Pediatric Real World CAR Consortium (PRWCC) member institutions and included 185 patients infused with commercial tisagenlecleucel. The median dose of viable transduced CAR T cells was 1.7 x106 CAR T cells/kg. To assess the impact of cell dose, we divided the responders into dose quartiles: 0.134-1.300 x n=43 (24%). OS, EFS, and RFS were improved in patients that received higher doses of Tisagenlecleucel (p=0.031, 0.0079 and 0.0045 respectively). Moreover, higher doses of tisagenlecleucel were not associated with increased toxicity. As the current tisagenlecleucel package insert dose-range remains broad, this work has implications in regard to targeting higher cell doses to optimize patients for long-standing remission.

Building upon our experiences targeting CD19 and CD22 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we report on our phase 1 dose-escalation study of a novel murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-CD19/CD22-4-1BB bivalent CAR T-cell (CD19.22.BB) for children and young adults (CAYA) with B-cell malignancies. Primary objectives included toxicity and dose finding. Secondary objectives included response rates and relapse-free survival (RFS). Biologic correlatives included laboratory investigations, CAR T-cell expansion and cytokine profiling. Twenty patients, ages 5.4 to 34.6 years, with B-ALL received CD19.22.BB. The complete response (CR) rate was 60% (12 of 20) in the full cohort and 71.4% (10 of 14) in CAR-nave patients. Ten (50%) developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS), with 3 (15%) having grade 3 CRS and only 1 experiencing neurotoxicity (grade 3). The 6- and 12-month RFS in those achieving CR was 80.8% [CI]: Limited expansion and persistence of MSCV-CD19.22.BB compared with EF1-CD22.BB prompted laboratory investigations comparing EF1 vs MSCV promoters, which did not reveal major differences. Limited CD22 targeting with CD19.22.BB, as evaluated by ex vivo cytokine secretion and leukemia eradication in humanized mice, led to development of a novel bicistronic CD19.28/CD22.BB construct with enhanced cytokine production against CD22. With demonstrated safety and efficacy of CD19.22.BB in a heavily pretreated CAYA B-ALL cohort, further optimization of combinatorial antigen targeting serves to overcome identified limitations (www.clinicaltrials.gov #NCT03448393).

Using a chronic stimulation assay, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to systematically discover regulators of Tcell exhaustion, which identified an enrichment of epigenetic factors. Invivo CRISPR screens in murine and human tumor models demonstrated that perturbation of the INO80 and BAF chromatin remodeling complexes improved Tcell persistence in tumors. Invivo Perturb-seq revealed distinct transcriptional roles of each complex and that depletion of canonical BAF complex members, including Arid1a, resulted in the maintenance of an effector program and downregulation of exhaustion-related genes in tumor-infiltrating Tcells. Arid1a depletion limited the acquisition of exhaustion-associated chromatin accessibility and led to improved antitumor immunity. In summary, we provide an atlas of the genetic regulators of Tcell exhaustion and demonstrate that modulation of epigenetic state can improve Tcell responsesin cancer immunotherapy. details for [DOI 10.1016/j.ccell.2022.06.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2022.06.001) View details for [PubMedID 35750052](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35750052) View details for [Web of Science ID 000892509505641](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000892509505641) View details for [Web of Science ID 000892509507415](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000892509507415) View details for [Web of Science ID 000892509507391](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000892509507391) View details for [Web of Science ID 000892509500153](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000892509500153) View details for [Web of Science ID 000892509507408](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000892509507408) View details for [Web of Science ID 000788322300444](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000788322300444) View details for [Web of Science ID 000840122400074](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000840122400074) View details for [Web of Science ID 000863680300019](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000863680300019) Infants with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have poor outcomes due to chemotherapy resistance leading to high relapse rates. Tisagenlecleucel, a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy, is FDA approved for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-ALL in patients 25 years; however, the safety and efficacy of this therapy in young patients is largely unknown since children <3 years of age were excluded from licensing studies. We retrospectively evaluated data from the Pediatric Real-World CAR Consortium to examine outcomes of patients with infant B-ALL who received tisagenlecleucel between 2017 and 2020 (n=14). Sixty-four percent of patients (n=9) achieved minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative remission post-CART and 50% of patients remain in remission at last follow-up. All patients with high disease burden at time of CART infusion (>M1 marrow) were refractory to this therapy (n=5). Overall, tisagenlecleucel was tolerable in this population, with only 3 patients experiencing > grade 3 cytokine release syndrome. No neurotoxicity was reported. This is the largest report of tisagenlecleucel use in infant B-ALL and shows that this therapy is safe and can be effective in this population. Incorporating this novel immunotherapy into the treatment of infant B-ALL offers a promising therapy for a highly aggressive leukemia.

Reinfusion with the same CART product (CART2) in patients with suboptimal response or antigen positive relapse following first infusion (CART1) represents a potential treatment strategy, though early experiences suggest limited efficacy of CART2 with CD19 targeting. We report on our experience with CART2 across a host of novel CAR T-cell trials. This was a retrospective review of children and young adults with B-ALL who received reinfusion with an anti-CD19, anti-CD22, or anti-CD19/22 CART construct on one of 3 CAR T-cells trials at the National Cancer Institute (NCT01593696, NCT02315612, NCT0344839) between July 2012 and January Primary objectives were to describe response to and toxicity of CART2. Indication for CART2, impact of LD intensity, and CAR T-cell expansion and leukemia antigen expression between CART infusions was additionally evaluated. Eighteen patients proceeded to CART2 due to persistent (n=7) or relapsed antigen positive disease (n=11) following CART1. Seven of 18 (38.9%) demonstrated objective response (responders) to CART2: 5 achieved a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative CR, 1 had persistent MRD level disease, and 1 showed a partial remission, the latter with eradication of antigen positive disease and emergence of antigen negative B-ALL. Responders included four patients who had not achieved a CR with CART1. Limited cytokine release syndrome was seen following CART2. Peripheral blood CART1 expansion was higher than CART2 expansion (p=0.03). Emergence of antigen negative/dim B-ALL in 6 (33.3%) patients following CART2 contributed to lack of CR. Five of seven (71.4%) responders received intensified LD pre-CART2, which corresponded with higher CART2 expansion than in those receiving standard LD (p=0.029). Diminished CAR T-cell expansion and antigen downregulation/loss impeded robust responses to CART2. A subset of patients, however, may derive benefit from CART2 despite suboptimal response to CART1. Intensified LD may be one strategy to augment CART2 responses, though further study of factors associated with CART2 response, including serial monitoring of antigen expression, is warranted.

Here, we present SNIP CARs, a protease-based platform for regulating CAR activity using an FDA-approved small molecule. Design iterations yielded CAR-T cells that manifest full functional capacity with drug and no leaky activity in the absence of drug. In numerous models, SNIP CAR-T cells were more potent than constitutive CAR-T cells and showed diminished Tcell exhaustion and greater stemness. In a ROR1-based CAR lethality model, drug cessation following toxicity onset reversed toxicity, thereby credentialing the platform as a safety switch. In the same model, reduced drug dosing opened a therapeutic window that resulted in tumor eradication in the absence of toxicity. SNIP CARs enable remote tuning of CAR activity, which provides solutions to safety and efficacy barriers that are currently limiting progress in using CAR-T cells to treat solid tumors.

Novel delivery methods for therapeutic cells have shown promise for treatment of solid tumors when compared with standard intravenous administration methods, but the few reported approaches leverage biomaterials that are complex to manufacture and have primarily demonstrated applicability following tumor resection or in immune-privileged tissues. Here, we engineer simple-to-implement injectable hydrogels for the controlled co-delivery of CAR-T cells and stimulatory cytokines that improve treatment of solid tumors. The unique architecture of this material simultaneously inhibits passive diffusion of entrapped cytokines and permits active motility of entrapped cells to enable long-term retention, viability, and activation of CAR-T cells. The generation of a transient inflammatory niche following administration affords sustained exposure of CAR-T cells, induces a tumor-reactive CAR-T phenotype, and improves efficacy of treatment.

We previously discovered that the disialoganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on H3K27M-mutant glioma cells and demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy of GD2-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells2, providing the rationale for a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04196413). Because CAR T-cell-induced brainstem inflammation can result in obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, and dangerous tissue shifts, neurocritical care precautions were incorporated. Here we present the clinical experience from the first four patients with H3K27M-mutant DIPG/DMG treated with GD2-CAR T cells (GD2-CART) at dose level 1 (1e6 GD2-CAR T cells/kg administered intravenously). Patients who exhibited clinical benefit were eligible for subsequent GD2-CAR T infusions administered intracerebroventricularly3. Toxicity was largely related to tumor location and reversible with intensive supportive care. On-target, off-tumor toxicity was not observed. Three of four patients exhibited clinical and radiographic improvement. Proinflammatory cytokines were increased in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Transcriptomic analyses of 65,598 single cells from CAR T cell products and CSF elucidate heterogeneity in response between subjects and administration routes. These early results underscore the promise of this approach for H3K27M+ DIPG/DMG therapy.

However, approximately 40% of patients with neuroblastoma still relapse, and anti-GD2 has not mediated significant clinical activity in any other GD2+ malignancy. Macrophages are important mediators of anti-tumor immunity, but tumors resist macrophage phagocytosis through expression of the checkpoint molecule CD47, a so-called 'Don't eat me' signal. In this study, we establish potent synergy for the combination of anti-GD2 and anti-CD47 in syngeneic and xenograft mouse models of neuroblastoma, where the combination eradicates tumors, as well as osteosarcoma and small-cell lung cancer, where the combination significantly reduces tumor burden and extends survival. This synergy is driven by two GD2-specific factors that reorient the balance of macrophage activity. Ligation of GD2 on tumor cells (a) causes upregulation of surface calreticulin, a pro-phagocytic 'Eat me' signal that primes cells for removal and (b) interrupts the interaction of GD2 with its newly identified ligand, the inhibitory immunoreceptor Siglec-7. This work credentials the combination of anti-GD2 and anti-CD47 for clinical translation and suggests that CD47 blockade will be most efficacious in combination with monoclonal antibodies that alter additional pro- and anti-phagocytic signals within the tumor microenvironment.

Assessments included daily inpatient monitoring, caregiver-based neuro-symptom checklist (NSC), exploratory neurocognitive assessments, clinically-indicated imaging, CSF analysis, and systematic cytokine profiling, outcomes of which were associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and treatment response post-infusion. Patients with active CNS leukemia were included.Amongst 52 patients treated, 13 patients had active CNS leukemia at infusion. Neurotoxicity was seen in 11/52 (21.2%) patients, with an incidence of 29.7% (11/37) in patients with CRS. Neurotoxicity was associated with the presence and severity of CRS. Those with neurotoxicity had higher levels of peak serum IL-6, IFN, and IL-15. Additionally, CNS leukemia was effectively eradicated in most patients with CRS. Pilot neurocognitive testing demonstrated stable-to-improved neurocognitive test scores in most patients, albeit limited by small patient numbers. The NSC enabled caregiver input into the patient experience.This is the first systematic analysis of neurotoxicity utilizing a CD19/CD28 CAR construct in CAYA, including those with active CNS involvement. The experience demonstrates that the neurotoxicity profile was acceptable and reversible, with evidence of anti-leukemia response and CNS trafficking of CAR T-cells. Additionally, neurocognitive testing, while exploratory, provides an opportunity for future studies to employ systematic evaluations into neurotoxicity assessments and validation is needed in future studies.

We developed Tcells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting glypican-2 (GPC2), a fetal antigen expressed on neuroblastoma (NB) and several other solid tumors. CARs engineered using standard designs control NBs with transgenic GPC2 overexpression, but not those expressing clinically relevant GPC2 site density (5,000 molecules/cell, range 1-6* 103). Iterative engineering of transmembrane (TM) and co-stimulatory domains plus overexpression of c-Jun lowered the GPC2-CAR antigen density threshold, enabling potent and durable eradication of NBs expressing clinically relevant GPC2 antigen density, without toxicity. These studies highlight the critical interplay between CAR design and antigen density threshold, demonstrate potent efficacy and safety of a lead GPC2-CAR candidate suitable for clinical testing, and credential oncofetal antigens as a promising class of targets for CAR Tcell therapy of solid tumors.

We report clinical outcomes and analyze covariates of outcomes after commercial tisagenlecleucel.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi-institutional study of CAYA with RR B-ALL across 15 US institutions, who underwent leukapheresis shipment to Novartis for commercial tisagenlecleucel. A total of 200 patients were included in an intent-to-treat response analysis, and 185 infused patients were analyzed for survival and toxicity.RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrates a 79% morphologic CR rate (95% CI, 72 to 84). The infused cohort had an 85% CR (95% CI, 79 to 89) and 12-month OS of 72% and EFS of 50%, with 335 days of median follow-up. Notably, 48% of patients had low-disease burden (< 5% bone marrow lymphoblasts, no CNS3, or extramedullary disease), undetectable lymphoblasts, or non-CNS with inferior outcomes, with a 12-month OS of 58% and EFS of 31% .0001 for OS and EFS).

The development of CAR T-cells for patients with haematological malignancies, especially B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL), has been spectacular. However, currently, there are scientific, clinical and logistical challenges for use of CAR T-cells in BCP-ALL and other paediatric malignancies, leukaemia (AML), lymphomas and solid tumours. The aims of the Forum were to summarise the current landscape of CAR T-cell therapy development in paediatrics, too identify current challenges and future directions, with consideration of other immune effector modalities and ascertain the best strategies to accelerate their development and availability to children. Although the effect is of limited duration in about half of the patients, anti-CD19 CAR T-cells produce high response rates in relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL and this has highlighted previously unknown mechanisms of relapse. CAR T-cell treatment as first- or second-line therapy could also potentially benefit patients whose disease has high-risk features associated with relapse and failure of conventional therapies. Identifying patients with very early and early relapse in whom CAR T-cell therapy may replace haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and be definitive therapy versus those in whom it provides a more effective bridge to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a very high priority. Development of approaches to improve persistence, either by improving T cell fitness or using more humanised/fully humanised products and co-targeting of multiple antigens to prevent antigen escape, could potentially further optimise therapy. Many differences exist between paediatric B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL) and BCP-ALL. In view of the very small patient numbers with relapsed lymphoma, careful prioritisation is needed to evaluate CAR T-cells in children with Burkitt lymphoma, primary mediastinal B cell lymphomaand other NHL subtypes. Combination trials of alternative targets to CD19 (CD20 or CD22) should also be explored as a priority to improve efficacy in this population. Development of CD30 CAR T-cell immunotherapy strategies in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma will likely be most efficiently accomplished by joint paediatric and adult trials. CAR T-cell approaches are early in development for AML and T-ALL, given the unique challenges of successful immunotherapy actualisation in these diseases. At this time, CD33 and CD123 appear to be the most universal targets in AML and CD7 in T-ALL. The results of ongoing or planned first-in-human studies are required to facilitate further understanding. There are promising early results in solid tumours, particularly with GD2 targeting cell therapies in neuroblastoma and central nervous system gliomas that represent significant unmet clinical needs. Further understanding of biology is critical to success. The comparative benefits of autologous versus allogeneic CAR T-cells, T-cells engineered with T cell receptors T-cells engineered with T cell receptor fusion constructs, CAR Natural Killer (NK)-cell products, bispecific T-cell engager antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates require evaluation in paediatric malignancies. Early and proactive academia and multi-company engagement are mandatory to advance cellular immunotherapies in paediatric oncology. Regulatory advice should be sought very early in the design and preparation of clinical trials of innovative medicines, for which regulatory approval may ultimately be sought. Aligning strategic, scientific, regulatory, health technology and funding requirements from the inception of a clinical trial is especially important as these are very expensive therapies. The model for drug development for cell therapy in paediatric oncology could also involve a 'later stage handoff' to industry after early development in academic hands. Finally, and very importantly, strategies must evolve to ensure appropriate ease of access for children who need and could potentially benefit from these therapies.

Data for CAR therapy in extramedullary (EM) involvement is limited. Retrospective data was abstracted from the Pediatric Real World CAR Consortium (PRWCC) of 184 infused patients from 15 US institutions. Response (CR) rate, overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and duration of B-cell aplasia (BCA) in patients referred for tisagenlecleucel with EM disease (both CNS3 and non-CNS EM) were compared to bone marrow (BM) only. Patients with CNS disease were further stratified for comparison. Outcomes are reported on 55 patients with EM disease prior to CAR (n=40 CNS3; n=15 non-CNS EM). The median age at infusion in CNS cohort was 10 years (range <1-25) and the non-CNS EM cohort was 13 years (2-26). In patients with CNS disease, 88% (35/40) achieved a CR, versus only 66% (10/15) with non-CNS EM disease. Patients with CNS disease (both with and without marrow involvement) had comparable 24-month OS outcomes to non-CNS EM or BM only (p=0.41). There was no difference in 12-month RFS between CNS, non-CNS EM, or BM only patients (p=0.92). No increased toxicity was seen with CNS or non-CNS EM disease (p=0.3). Active CNS disease at time of infusion did not impact outcomes. Isolated (iCNS) disease trended towards improved OS when compared to combined CNS and BM (p=0.12). R/R EM disease can be effectively treated with tisagenlecleucel with toxicity, relapse rates and survival rates comparable to patients with BM only. Outcomes for iCNS relapse are encouraging.

However, treatment failure after initial response approaches 50%. In allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, optimal fludarabine exposure improves immune reconstitution, resulting in lower nonrelapse mortality and increased survival. We hypothesized that optimal fludarabine exposure in lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CAR T-cell therapy would improve outcomes. In a retrospective analysis of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients undergoing CAR T-cell (tisagenlecleucel) infusion after cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepleting chemotherapy, we estimated the fludarabine exposure as area-under-the-curve (AUC;mg*hr/L) using a validated population-pharmacokinetic model. Fludarabine exposure was related to overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and a composite endpoint (loss of B-cell aplasia (BCA) or relapse). Eligible patients (n=152) had a median age of 12.5 years (range <1-26), response rate of 86% (131/152), 12-month determined an AUC13.8mg*hr/L. multivariable analyses patients with an AUC<13.8mg*hr/L had a 2.5-fold higher CIR (HR=2.45 [1.34-4.48]; P=0.005) and a twofold higher of relapse or loss of BCA (HR=1.96 [1.19-3.23]; P=0.01) compared to those with optimal fludarabine exposure. High preinfusion disease burden was also associated with an increased risk of relapse (HR=2.66 achieve optimal fludarabine exposure should be tested in prospective trials and based on this analysis may reduce disease relapse after CAR T-cell therapy.

Gene editing platforms are under study in this arena to 1) enhance immune cell potency by knocking out molecules that inhibit immune responses; 2) deliver genetic payloads into precise genomic locations and thereby enhance safety and/or improve the gene expression profile by leveraging physiologic promoters, enhancers, and repressors; and 3) enable off-the-shelf therapies by preventing alloreactivity and immune rejection (Figure 1). This review will discuss gene editing approaches that have been most well studied in the context of human T cells and adoptive T cell therapies, summarizing their current status and near-term potential for translation.

As CAR T-cell therapy continues to evolve, infection risks and management thereof will become increasingly important to optimize outcomes across the spectrum of antigens and disease targeted. We retrospectively characterized infectious complications occurring in 162 children and adults treated amongst five phase 1 CAR T-cell clinical trials. Trials included targeting of CD19, CD22, or B-cell maturation infections between lymphocyte depleting (LD) chemotherapy and day 30; with the majority (80.5%) occurring between day 0 (D0) and day 30 (D30). By trial, the highest proportion of infections was seen with CD22 CAR T-cells (n=23/53; 43.4%), followed by BCMA CAR T-cells(n=9/24; 37.5%). By disease, patients with multiple myeloma, had the highest proportion of infections (9 of 24, 37.5%) followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36 of 102, 35.3%). Grade 4 infections were rare (n=4, 2.5%). Between D0 and D30, bacteremia and bacterial site infections were the most common infection type. In univariate analysis, increasing prior lines of therapy, recent infection within 100 days of LD chemotherapy, corticosteroid or tocilizumab use and fever and neutropenia (F&N) were associated with a higher risk of infection. In a multivariable analysis, only prior lines of therapy and recent infection were associated with higher risk of infection. In conclusion, we provide a broad overview of infection risk within the first 30 days post infusion across a host of multiple targets and diseases, elucidating both unique characteristics and commonalities highlighting aspects important to improving patient outcomes.

In this work we assessed the direct and indirect antitumor effect of allogeneic CAR-engineered invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, a cell population without GvHD-induction potential that displays immunomodulatory properties. Experimental Design: After assessing murine CAR iNKT cells direct antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo, we employed an immunocompetent mouse model of B-cell lymphoma to assess the interaction between allogeneic CAR iNKT cells and endogenous immune cells. Results: We demonstrate that allogeneic CAR iNKT cells exerted potent direct and indirect antitumor activity when administered across major MHC-barriers by inducing tumor-specific antitumor immunity through host CD8 T cell cross-priming. Conclusions: In addition to their known direct cytotoxic effect, allogeneic CAR iNKT cells induce host CD8 T cell antitumor responses resulting in a potent antitumor effect lasting longer than the physical persistence of the allogeneic cells. The utilization of off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR iNKT cells could meet significant unmet needs in the clinic.

We profiled the GD2-targeting receptor (CAR) T cells and control CD19-targeting CAR T cells, which present less exhaustion-inducing tonic signaling, at multiple points during their ex vivo expansion. We found widespread, dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility and three-dimensional (3D) chromosome conformation preceding changes in gene expression, notably at loci proximal to exhaustion-associated genes such as PDCD1, CTLA4, and HAVCR2, and increased DNA motif access for AP-1 family transcription factors, which are known to promote exhaustion. Although T cell exhaustion has been studied in detail in mice, we find that the regulatory networks of T cell exhaustion differ between species and involve distinct loci of accessible chromatin and cis-regulated target genes in human CAR T cell exhaustion. Deletion of exhaustion-specific candidate enhancers of PDCD1 suppress the expression of PD-1 in an in vitro model of T cell dysfunction and in HA-28z CAR T cells, suggesting enhancer editing as a path forward in improving cancer immunotherapy.

Ten of 16 patients with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) with progressive disease after CAR19 treatment had absent or low CD19. Lower surface CD19 density pretreatment was associated with progressive disease. To prevent relapse with CD19- or CD19lo disease, we tested a bispecific CAR targeting CD19 and/or CD22 (CD19-22.BB.z-CAR) in a phase I clinical trial ( NCT03233854 ) of adults with relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and LBCL. The primary end points were manufacturing feasibility and safety with a secondary efficacy end point. Primary end points were met; 97% of products met protocol-specified dose and no dose-limiting toxicities occurred during dose escalation. In B-ALL (n=17), 100% of patients responded with 88% complete remission (CR); in LBCL (n=21), of patients responded with 29% CR. Relapses were CD19-/lo in 50% (5 out of 10) of patients with B-ALL and 29% (4 out of 14) of patients with LBCL but were not associated with CD22-/lo disease. CD19/22-CAR products demonstrated reduced cytokine production when stimulated with CD22 versus CD19. Our results further implicate antigen loss as a major cause of CAR T cell resistance, highlight the challenge of engineering multi-specific CAR T cells with equivalent potency across targets and identify cytokine production as an important quality indicator for CAR T cell potency.

Interventions that preserve the gut microbiome hold promise to improve HCT-associated morbidity and mortality. Murine models demonstrate that prebiotics such as fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) may increase gut levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, and CD4+ T-regulatory cells (Tregs), that impact GVHD risk.METHODS: We conducted a pilot Phase I trial to assess the investigate the maximum tolerated dose of FOS in patients undergoing reduced-intensity (RIC) allo-HCT (n=15) compared to concurrent controls (n=16). We administered FOS starting at pretransplant conditioning and continuing for a total of 21 days. We characterized the gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, measured stool determined peripheral T-cell concentrations using CyTOF.RESULTS: We found that FOS was safe and well-tolerated at 10g per day without significant adverse effects in patients undergoing allo-HCT. Community-level gut microbiota composition was significantly different on the day of transplant (day 0) between patients receiving FOS compared to concurrent controls, however FOS-associated alterations of the gut microbiota were not sustained after transplant. Although the impact of FOS was fleeting, transplantation itself impacted a substantial number of taxa over time. In our small pilot trial, no significant differences were observed in gut microbial metabolic pathways, stool SCFAs, or in peripheral Tregs although Tregs trended higher in those patients who received FOS. A marker of CD4+ T-cell activation, namely CTLA4+, was significantly higher in patients receiving FOS, whereas a non-significant trend existed for FOP3+CD4+ T-regulatory cells that were higher in those receiving FOS compared to controls.CONCLUSIONS: FOS is well-tolerated at 10g per day in patients undergoing RIC allo-HCT. While alterations in the gut microbiota and peripheral immune cell composition in those receiving FOS are intriguing, additional studies are required to investigate the use of prebiotics in HCT recipients.

This prospective multicenter study explored the prognostic value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) before and after standard-of-care axi-cel for predicting patient outcomes.METHODS: Lymphoma-specific variable, diversity, and joining gene segments (VDJ) clonotype ctDNA sequences were frequently monitored via next-generation sequencing from the time of starting lymphodepleting chemotherapy until progression or 1 year after axi-cel infusion. We assessed the prognostic value of ctDNA to predict outcomes and axi-cel-related toxicity.RESULTS: A tumor clonotype was successfully detected in 69 of 72 (96%) enrolled patients. Higher pretreatment ctDNA concentrations were associated with progression after axi-cel infusion and developing cytokine release syndrome and/or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Twenty-three of 33 (70%) durably responding patients versus 4 of 31 (13%) progressing patients demonstrated nondetectable ctDNA 1 week after axi-cel infusion (P < .0001). At day 28, patients with detectable ctDNA compared with those with undetectable ctDNA had a median progression-free survival and OS of 3 months versus not reached (P < .0001) and 19 months versus not reached (P = .0080), respectively. In patients with a radiographic partial response or stable disease on day 28, 1 of 10 patients with concurrently undetectable ctDNA relapsed; by contrast, 15 of 17 patients with concurrently detectable ctDNA relapsed (P = .0001). ctDNA was detected at or before radiographic relapse in 29 of 30 (94%) patients. All durably responding patients had undetectable ctDNA at or before 3 months after axi-cel infusion.CONCLUSION: Noninvasive ctDNA assessments can risk stratify and predict outcomes of patients undergoing axi-cel for the treatment of large B-cell lymphoma. These results provide a rationale for designing ctDNA-based risk-adaptive chimeric antigen receptor T-cell clinical trials.

Using murine xenograft models and an in vitro model wherein tonic CAR signaling induces hallmark features of exhaustion, we tested the effect of transient cessation of receptor signaling, or rest, on the development and maintenance of exhaustion. Induction of rest through enforced down-regulation of the CAR protein using a drug-regulatable system or treatment with the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in the acquisition of a global transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming, and restored antitumor functionality in exhausted CAR-T cells. This work demonstrates that rest can enhance CAR-T cell efficacy by preventing or reversing exhaustion, and it challenges the notion that exhaustion is an epigenetically fixed state.

We evaluated the long-term course of hematologic recovery, immune reconstitution, and infectious complications in 41 patients with LBCL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) at a single center. Grade 3+ cytopenias occurred in 97.6% of patients within the first 28 days postinfusion, with most resolved by 6 months. Overall, 63.4% of patients received a red blood cell transfusion, 34.1% of patients received a platelet transfusion, 36.6% of patients received IV immunoglobulin, and 51.2% of patients received growth factor (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) injections beyond the first 28 days postinfusion. Only 40% of patients had recovered detectable CD19+ B cells by 1 year, and 50% of patients had a CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells per L by 18 months postinfusion. Patients with durable responses to axi-cel had significantly longer durations of B-cell aplasia, and this duration correlated strongly with the recovery of CD4+ T-cell counts. There were significantly more infections within the first 28 days compared with any other period of follow-up, with the majority being mild-moderate in severity. Receipt of corticosteroids was the only factor that predicted risk of infection in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 3.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-16.5). Opportunistic infections due to Pneumocystis jirovecii and varicella-zoster virus occurred up to 18 months postinfusion in patients who prematurely discontinued prophylaxis. These results support the use of comprehensive supportive care, including long-term monitoring and antimicrobial prophylaxis, beyond 12 months after axi-cel treatment.

We identified over 66,000 shared specificity groups, of which 435 were clonally expanded and enriched in tumors compared to adjacent lung. The antigenic epitopes of one such tumor-enriched specificity group were identified using a yeast peptide-HLA A02:01 display library. These included a peptide from the epithelial protein TMEM161A, which is overexpressed in tumors and cross-reactive epitopes from Epstein-Barr virus and E.coli. Our findings suggest that this cross-reactivity may underlie the presence of virus-specific Tcells in tumor infiltrates and that pathogen cross-reactivity may be a feature of multiple cancers. The approach and analytical pipelines generated in this work, as well as the specificity groups defined here, present a resource for understanding the Tcell response in cancer.

We demonstrate that CD93 CAR T cells engineered from a novel humanized CD93-specific binder potently kill AML in vitro and in vivo but spare hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). No toxicity is seen in murine models, but CD93 is expressed on human endothelial cells, and CD93 CAR T cells recognize and kill endothelial cell lines. We identify other AML CAR T-cell targets with overlapping expression on endothelial cells, especially in the context of proinflammatory cytokines. To address the challenge of endothelial-specific cross-reactivity, we provide proof of concept for NOT-gated CD93 CAR T cells that circumvent endothelial cell toxicity in a relevant model system. We also identify candidates for combinatorial targeting by profiling the transcriptome of AML and endothelial cells at baseline and after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines.CD93 CAR T cells eliminate AML and spare HSPCs but exert on-target, off-tumor toxicity to endothelial cells. We show coexpression of other AML targets on endothelial cells, introduce a novel NOT-gated strategy to mitigate endothelial toxicity, and demonstrate use of high-dimensional transcriptomic profiling for rational design of combinatorial immunotherapies.See related commentary by Velasquez and Gottschalk, p. 559.

Bleeding sites intracranial (N=2), gastrointestinal features of consumptive coagulopathy. On univariate analysis, patients with bleeding were older (median 72 vs. 60 yrs, P<0.01), had lower baseline platelets (86 vs. 178 K/uL, P<0.01), lower platelet nadir after fibrinogen nadir and elevated LDH (P=0.01). ICANS grade 3 was associated with increased bleeding (50% vs. 15%; P=0.01), thrombosis (50% vs. 16%; P=0.04), PT prolongation, elevated D-dimer. A paucity of events limited multivariate analysis, however low pre-treatment platelets were associated with bleeding in a multivariate logistic regression model. Patients with thrombocytopenia or severe ICANS are at increased risk of bleeding complications and should be closely monitored particularly within the first month after CAR therapy. Future studies in larger cohorts should assess risk factors for systemic coagulopathies in CAR-T therapy, including their association with neurotoxicity.

Secondary objectives included evaluation of OS/EFS, relapse free survival (RFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse for all patients who proceeded to HSCT, stratified by first and second HSCT, as well as the tolerability of HSCT following CAR induced remission.This was a retrospective review of children and young adults enrolled on one of three CAR T-cell trials at the NCI targeting CD19, CD22, and CD19/22 (NCT01593696, NCT02315612, T-cell therapy.From 7/2012 to 2/2021, 46 children and young adults with pre-B ALL went directly to HSCT following CAR therapy. Of these patients, 74% (34/46) proceeded to a first HSCT with a median follow-up of 50.8 months. Transplant nave patients were heavily pre-treated prior to CAR T-cell therapy (median=3.5 lines therapy; range, 1-12) with significant prior immunotherapy exposure (blinatumomab, inotuzumab, and/or CAR therapy) in patients receiving CD22 or CD19/22 constructs (88%, 15/17). Twelve patients (35%) had primary refractory disease, and the median time from CAR infusion to transplant was 54.5 days (range, 42-127). The median OS following first HSCT was 72.2 months (95% CI, 16.9-not estimable [NE]) with a median EFS of 36.9 months (95% CI, 5.2-NE).

Primary refractory disease was associated with improved OS/EFS post-HSCT (NR vs 21.9 mo, p=0.075; NR vs 12.2 mo, p=0.024).Extensive prior therapy, particularly immunotherapy, and high disease burden each individually adversely impact OS/EFS following post-CAR consolidative HSCT in transplant nave patients, primarily due to relapse. Despite this, HSCT remained an important treatment modality in long-term cure. Earlier implementation of HSCT prior to having multiply relapsed disease and incorporation of post-HSCT risk mitigation strategies in patients identified to be at high-risk of post-HSCT relapse may improve outcomes.

The aim of targeting the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells has afforded many patients the prospect of achieving deep, long-term remission and potential cures. However, many challenges remain for achieving the goal of effective immunotherapy for all cancer patients. Checkpoint inhibitors have been able to achieve long-term responses in a minority of patients, yet improving response rates with combination therapies increases the possibility of toxicity. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells have demonstrated high response rates in hematological cancers, although most patients experience relapse. In addition, some cancers are notoriously immunologically \"cold\" and typically are not effective targets for immunotherapy. Overcoming these obstacles will require new strategies to improve upon the efficacy of current agents, identify biomarkers to select appropriate therapies, and discover new modalities to expand the accessibility of immunotherapy to additional tumor types and patient populations.

Non-invasive molecular imaging of CAR T cells by positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising approach with the ability to provide spatial, temporal and functional information. Reported strategies rely on the incorporation of reporter transgenes or ex vivo biolabeling, significantly limiting the application of CAR T cell molecular imaging. In the present study, we assessed the ability of antibody-based PET (immunoPET) to non-invasively visualize CAR T cells.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: After analyzing human CAR T cells in vitro and ex vivo from patient samples to identify candidate targets for immunoPET, we employed a syngeneic, orthotopic murine tumor model of lymphoma to assess the feasibility of in vivo tracking of CAR T cells by immunoPET using the 89Zr-DFO-anti-ICOS tracer we previously reported.RESULTS: Analysis of human CD19-CAR T cells during activation identified the Inducible T-cell COStimulator (ICOS) as a potential target for immunoPET. In a preclinical tumor model, 89Zr-DFO-ICOS mAb PET-CT imaging detected significantly higher signal in specific bone marrow-containing skeletal sites of CAR T cell treated mice compared with controls. Importantly, administration of ICOS-targeting antibodies at tracer doses did not interfere with CAR T cell persistence and function.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of ICOS-immunoPET imaging for monitoring of CAR T cell therapy, a strategy readily applicable to both commercially available and investigational CAR T cells.

Additionally, the potential adverse effects of CAR T-cells highlight the need for mechanisms to modulate CAR T-cell activity. The herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) gene has previously been translated as a positron emission tomography (PET) reporter gene for imaging of T-cell trafficking in brain tumor patients. The HSV1-TK enzyme can act as a suicide gene of transduced cells through treatment with the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV). Here we report the molecular engineering, imaging, and GCV-mediated destruction of B7H3 CAR T-cells incorporating a mutated version of the HSV1-tk gene (sr39tk) with improved enzymatic activity for GCV. The sr39tk gene did not affect B7H3 CAR T-cell functionality and in vitro and in vivo studies in osteosarcoma models showed no significant effect on B7H3 CAR T-cell antitumor activity. PET/CT imaging in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma revealed tumor homing and systemic immune expansion. Bioluminescence and PET imaging of B7H3-sr39tk CAR T-cells confirmed complete tumor ablation with intraperitoneal GCV administration. This imaging and suicide ablation system can provide insight into CAR T-cell migration and proliferation during clinical trials while serving as a suicide switch to limit potential toxicities.

We identified a non-physiologic CD19+/CD3+ T-cell population in the leukapheresis product of a patient undergoing CAR T-cell manufacturing who previously received a haploidentical HSCT, followed by infusion of a genetically engineered T-cell addback product. We confirm and report the origin of these CD19+/CD3+ T cells that have not previously been described in context of CAR T-cell manufacturing. We additionally interrogate the fate of these CD19-expressing cells as they undergo transduction to express CD19-specific CARs.MAIN BODY: We describe the case of a preteen male with multiply relapsed B-ALL who was treated with sequential cellular therapies. He received an alphabeta T-cell depleted haploidentical HSCT followed by addback of donor-derived T cells genetically modified with a suicide gene for iCaspase9 and truncated CD19 for cell tracking (RivoCel). He relapsed 6months following HSCT and underwent leukapheresis and CAR T-cell manufacturing. During manufacturing, we identified an aberrant T-cell population dually expressing CD19 and CD3. We hypothesized that these cells were RivoCel cells and confirmed using flow cytometry and PCR that the identified cells were in fact RivoCel cells and were eliminated with iCaspase9 activation. We additionally tracked these cells through CD19-specific CAR transduction and notably did not detect T cells dually positive for CD19 and CD19-directed CARs. The most likely rationale for this is in vitro fratricide of the CD19+ 'artificial' T-cell population by the CD19-specific CAR+ T cells in culture.CONCLUSIONS: We report the identification of CD19+/CD3+ cells in an apheresis product undergoing CAR transduction derived from a patient previously treated with a haploidentical transplant followed by RivoCel addback. We aim to bring attention to this cell phenotype that may be recognized with greater frequency as CAR therapy and engineered alphabetahaplo-HSCT are increasingly coupled. We additionally suggest consideration towards using alternative markers to CD19 as a synthetic identifier for post-transplant addback products, as CD19-expression on effector T cells may complicate subsequent treatment using CD19-directed therapy.

Antares, a fusion of the luciferase NanoLuc to the orange fluorescent protein CyOFP, has emerged as a bright bioluminescent reporter with orthogonal substrate specificity to firefly luciferase (FLuc) and its derivatives such as AkaLuc. However, the brightness of Antares in mice is limited by the poor solubility and bioavailability of the NanoLuc substrate furimazine. Here, we report a new substrate, hydrofurimazine, whose enhanced aqueous solubility allows delivery of higher doses to mice. In the liver, Antares with hydrofurimazine exhibited similar brightness to AkaLuc with its substrate AkaLumine. Further chemical exploration generated a second substrate, fluorofurimazine, with even higher brightness in vivo. We used Antares with fluorofurimazine to track tumor size and AkaLuc with AkaLumine to visualize CAR-T cells within the same mice, demonstrating the ability to perform two-population imaging with these two luciferase systems.

Targeting CD22, an alternative B-cell antigen, represents an alternate strategy. We report outcomes on the largest patient cohort treated with CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a single-center, phase I, 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial with a large expansion cohort that tested CD22-targeted CAR T cells for children and young adults with relapsed/refractory CD22+ malignancies. Primary objectives were to assess the safety, toxicity, and feasibility. Secondary objectives included efficacy, CD22 CAR T-cell persistence, and cytokine profiling.RESULTS: Fifty-eight 51 (87.9%) after prior CD19-targeted therapy. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 50 participants (86.2%) and was grade 1-2 in 45 (90%). Symptoms of neurotoxicity were minimal and transient. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like manifestations were seen in 19/58 (32.8%) of subjects, prompting utilization of anakinra. CD4/CD8 T-cell selection of the apheresis product improved CAR T-cell manufacturing feasibility as well as heightened inflammatory toxicities, leading to dose de-escalation. The complete remission rate was 70%. The median overall survival was 13.4 months (95% CI, 7.7 to 20.3 months). Among those who achieved a complete response, the median relapse-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.5 months). Thirteen participants proceeded to stem-cell transplantation.CONCLUSION: In the largest experience of CD22 CAR T-cells to our knowledge, we provide novel information on the impact of manufacturing changes on clinical outcomes and report on unique CD22 CAR T-cell toxicities and toxicity mitigation strategies. The remission induction rate supports further development of CD22 CAR T cells as a therapeutic option in patients resistant to CD19-targeted immunotherapy.

We discuss an inability to target highly and homogenously expressed lineage-associated antigens due to risks of on-target, off-tumor toxicity, T cell dysfunction related to T cell exhaustion and the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and inefficient CAR T cell trafficking into solid tumors. As our understanding of the biology of CAR T cells improves and innovations in engineering CAR platforms emerge, next generation CAR T cell therapeutics designed to overcome these challenges will enter the clinic for testing.Expert Opinion: New approaches to address the challenges that have limited the efficacy of CAR T cell therapeutics in solid tumors are emerging. These include next-generation CAR T cell engineering to overcome antigen heterogeneity, to mitigate T cell exhaustion and to prevent suppression by the TME, and novel approaches for regional delivery to overcome limitations in tumor T cell trafficking.

The developmental origins of most pediatric cancers make them ideal targets for immune-based therapies that capitalize on the differential expression of lineage-specific cell surface molecules such as antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, or CAR T cells, while the efficacy of other therapies that depend on tumor immunogenicity such as immune checkpoint inhibitors has been limited to date. Here we review the current status of immune-based therapies for childhood cancers, discuss challenges to developing immunotherapeutics for these diseases, and outline future directions of pediatric immunotherapy discovery and development.

However, this approach does not directly prevent intracellular signalling, such as through tonic or sustained signalling after ligand engagement. Here we present an alternative approach for attenuating cell-surface receptor signalling, termed receptor inhibition by phosphatase recruitment (RIPR). This approach compels in the direct intracellular dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor target. As an example, we found that tonic signalling by the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) results in residual suppression of T cell activation, but is not inhibited by ligand-antagonist antibodies. We engineered a PD-1 molecule, which we denote RIPR-PD1, that induces cross-linking of PD-1 to CD45 and inhibits both tonic and ligand-activated signalling. RIPR-PD1 demonstrated enhanced inhibition of checkpoint blockade compared with ligand blocking by anti-PD1 antibodies, and increased therapeutic efficacy over anti-PD1 in mouse tumour models. We also show that the RIPR strategy extends to other immune-receptor targets that contain activating or inhibitory ITIM, ITSM cellular phagocytosis beyond that of SIRP blockade alone. RIPR represents a general strategy for direct attenuation of signalling by kinase-activated cell-surface receptors.

Despite intensive multimodal therapy (surgery, chemotherapy and, if age permits, radiotherapy), median survival is 17 months1,2. We show that ATRTs robustly express B7-H3/CD276 that does not result from the inactivating mutations in SMARCB1 (refs. 3,4), which SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) activity mediated by BRG1/SMARCA4. Consistent with the embryonic origin of ATRT5,6, B7-H3 is highly expressed on the prenatal, but not postnatal, brain. B7-H3.BB.z-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells administered intracerebroventricularly or intratumorally mediate potent antitumor effects against cerebral ATRT xenografts in mice, with faster kinetics, greater potency and reduced systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines compared to CAR T cells administered intravenously. CAR T cells administered ICV also traffic from the CNS into the periphery; following clearance of ATRT xenografts, B7-H3.BB.z-CAR T cells administered intracerebroventricularly or intravenously mediate antigen-specific protection from tumor rechallenge, both in the brain and periphery. These results identify B7-H3 as a compelling therapeutic target for this largely incurable pediatric tumor and demonstrate important advantages of locoregional compared to systemic delivery of CAR T cells for the treatment of CNS malignancies.

We report on the first three consecutive patients with autologous CAR19-refractory LBCL treated with a CAR+ T-cells/kg targeting CD22 (CAR22) as part of a phase I dose escalation study. CAR22 therapy was relatively well tolerated, without any observed non-hematologic adverse events higher than grade 2. Following infusion, all three patients achieved complete remission, with all responses ongoing at the time of last follow up (mean 7.8 months, range 6-9.3). Circulating CAR22 cells demonstrated robust expansion (peak range 85.4-350 cells/L), and persisted beyond three months in all patients with continued radiographic responses and corresponding decreases in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) beyond six months post-infusion. Further accrual at a higher dose level in this phase 1 dose-escalation study is ongoing and will explore the role of this therapy in patients who have failed prior CAR T-cell therapies.

Within this class, immune cell therapies are among the most advanced, having already demonstrated definitive evidence of clinical benefits in cancer and infectious disease. Numerous features distinguish these \"living therapies\" from traditional medicines, including their ability to expand and contract in proportion to need and to mediate therapeutic benefits for months or years following a single application. Continued advances in fundamental immunology, genetic engineering, gene editing, and synthetic biology exponentially expand opportunities to enhance the sophistication of immunecell therapies, increasing potency and safety and broadening their potential for treatment of disease. This perspective will summarize the current status of immune cell therapies for cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity, and discuss advances in cellular engineering to overcome barriers to progress.

Pediatric CAR studies examining cardiac toxicity are limited.We report on cardiac toxicity observed in children and young adults with hematologic malignancies enrolled in a CD19-28 CAR T-cell phase I trial (NCT01593696). All patients had a formal baseline echocardiogram. Real-time studies included echocardiograms on intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and serial troponin and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) in the select patients.From July 2012 to March 2016, 52 patients, with a median age of 13.4 years (range 4.2-30.3) were treated. CRS developed in 37/52 (71%), which was grade 3-4 CRS in nine patients (17%). The median prior anthracycline exposure was 205 mg/m2 (range 70-620 mg/m2) in doxorubicin equivalents. The median baseline left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) and baseline LV global longitudinal strain were 60% (range 50%-70%) (range 14.1%-23.5%, n=37) respectively. The 78% (29/37), of patients had a reduced GLS <19% at baseline, and 6% (3/52) of patients had baseline LVEF <53%. ICU transfers occurred in 21 patients, with nine requiring vasoactive hemodynamic support and three necessitating >1 vasopressor. Six (12%) patients developed cardiac dysfunction (defined by >10% absolute decrease in LVEF or new-onset grade 2 or higher LV dysfunction, per CTCAE v4), among whom 4 had grade 3-4 CRS. Troponin elevations were seen in 4 of 13 patients, all of whom had low LVEF. Pro-BNP was elevated from baseline in 6/7 patients at the onset of CRS, with higher levels correlating with more severe CRS. Cardiac dysfunction fully resolved in all but two patients by day 28 post-CAR.Cardiac toxicity related to CD19-28 CAR T-cell-associated CRS was generally reversible by day 28 postinfusion. Implementation of more frequent monitoring with formal echocardiograms incorporating systemic analysis of changes in GLS, and cardiac biomarkers (troponin and proBNP) may help to earlier identify those patients at highest risk of severe cardiac systolic dysfunction, facilitating earlier interventions for CRS to potentially mitigate acute cardiac toxicity.

We did a phase 1-2 study of nivolumab, a PD-1 blocking monoclonal antibody, to determine its safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumour activity in children and young adults with recurrent or refractory non-CNS solid tumours and dose-expansion, phase 1-2 trial in 23 hospitals in the USA. Eligible patients for part A (dose-confirmation phase) of the study were aged 1-18 years with solid tumours with measurable or evaluable disease (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) regardless of histology. Eligible patients for part B (dose-expansion phase) were aged 1-30 years with measurable disease (by RECIST criteria) in the following disease A and were given nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously over 60 min on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle in a rolling 6 study design with de-escalation upon dose-limiting toxicities to establish the recommended phase 2 dose. Patients in part B were given the recommended phase 2 dose. The primary outcomes were the tolerability, systemic exposure, maximum tolerated dose, and the antitumour activity of nivolumab at the adult recommended dose in children and young adults. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02304458, with follow-up ongoing and is closed to new participants.85 patients were enrolled between Feb 22, 2015, and Dec 31, 2018, and 75 patients were fully evaluable for toxicity. Median follow-up was 30 days (IQR 27-83). In part A, 13 patients were enrolled and 12 were evaluable for toxicity. There were no dose de-escalations or dose-limiting toxicities and nivolumab 3 mg/kg was confirmed as the paediatric recommended phase 2. 72 patients were enrolled in part B and 63 were evaluable for toxicity. Five (7%) patients in part B had dose-limiting toxicities. The most common overall toxicity was anaemia (35 [47%] of 75 patients; five patients had grade 3 or grade 4) and non-haematological toxicity was fatigue (28 [37%] patients; none had grade 3 or grade 4). Responses were observed in patients with lymphoma (three [30%] of ten with Hodgkin lymphoma and one [10%] of ten with non-Hodgkin lymphoma; all responders had PD-L1 expression). Objective responses were not observed in other tumour types.Nivolumab was safe and well tolerated in children and young adults and showed clinical activity in lymphoma. Nivolumab showed no significant single-agent activity in the common paediatric solid tumours. This study defines the recommended phase 2 dose and establishes a favourable safety profile for nivolumab in children and young adults, which can serve as the basis for its potential study in combinatorial regimens for childhood cancer.Bristol-Myers Squibb, Children's Oncology Group, National Institutes of Health, Cookies for Kids Cancer Foundation.

Little is known about factors that modulate the threshold for antigen recognition. We demonstrate that CD19 CAR activity is dependent upon antigen density and the CAR construct in axicabtagene-ciloleucel (CD19-CD28z) outperforms that in tisagenlecleucel (CD19-4-1BBz) against antigen low tumors. Enhancing signal strength by including additional ITAMs in the CAR enables recognition of low antigen density cells, while ITAM deletions blunt signal and increase the antigen density threshold. Further, replacement of the CD8 hinge-transmembrane (H/T) region of a 4-1BBz CAR with a CD28-H/T lowers the threshold for CAR reactivity despite identical signaling molecules. CARs incorporating a CD28-H/T demonstrate a more stable and efficient immunological synapse. Precise design of CARs can tune the threshold for antigen recognition and endow 4-1BBz-CARs with enhanced capacity to recognize antigen low targets while retaining a superior capacity for persistence.

The gold standard used to evaluate response in the United States includes morphologic evaluation and minimal residual disease (MRD) testing of aspirated bone marrow (BM) by flow cytometry (FC). This MRD assessment is usually made on a single aspirate sample that is subject to variability in collection techniques and sampling error. Additionally, central nervous system (CNS) assessments for ALL include evaluations of cytopathology and cell counts, which can miss subclinical involvement.We retrospectively compared BM biopsy, aspirate, and FC samples obtained from children and young adults with relapsed/refractory ALL to identify the frequency and degree of disease discrepancies in this population. We also compared CNS FC and cytopathology techniques.Sixty of 410 (14.6%) BM samples had discrepant results, 41 (10%) of which were clinically relevant as they resulted in a change in the assignment of marrow status. Discrepant BM results were found in 28 of 89 (31.5%) patients evaluated. Additionally, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FC identified disease in 9.7% of cases where cytopathology was negative.These results support further investigation of the role of concurrent BM biopsy, with aspirate and FC evaluations, and the addition of FC to CSF evaluations, to fully assess disease status and response, particularly in patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. Prospective studies incorporating more comprehensive analysis to evaluate the impact on clinical outcomes are warranted.

The factors contributing to gene-modified T-cell expansion and the changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) following T-cell infusion remain unclear. These studies address the immunological mechanisms of response and resistance in patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells.METHODS: Four cohorts were included to evaluate antigen expression and preconditioning on efficacy. Clinical responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1. Engineered T-cell persistence was determined by qPCR. were evaluated by immunoassay. Transcriptomic analyses and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumor biopsies from patients before and after T-cell infusion. Gene-modified T-cells were detected within the TME via an RNAish assay.RESULTS: Responses across cohorts were affected by preconditioning and intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Of the 42 patients reported (data cut-off 4June2018), 1 patient had a complete response, 14 patients had partial responses, 24 patients had stable disease, and 3 patients had progressive disease. The magnitude of gene-modified T-cell expansion shortly after infusion was associated with response in patients with high intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Patients receiving a fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen experienced increases in serum IL-7 and IL-15. Prior to infiltration; CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages in intra-tumoral leukocytes (5%) were observed in a subset of subjects at approximately 8weeks. Beyond 8weeks post infusion, the TME was minimally infiltrated with a TAM-dominant leukocyte infiltrate. Tumor-associated antigens and antigen presentation did not significantly change within the tumor post-T-cell infusion. Finally, NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells trafficked to the TME and maintained cytotoxicity in a subset of patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies elucidate some factors that underpin response and resistance to NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cell therapy. From these data, we conclude that a lymphodepletion regimen containing high doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is necessary for SPEAR T-cell persistence and efficacy. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that non-T-cell inflamed tumors, which are resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, can be treated with adoptive T-cell based immunotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01343043 , Registered 27 April [DOI 10.1186/s40425-019-0762-2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40425-019-0762-2) View details for [PubMedID 31651363](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651363) Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for B cell malignancies has surpassed expectations, driving an ever-expanding number of clinical trials and the first US Food and Drug Administration approvals of cell therapies for the treatment of cancer. This experience has illuminated some generalizable requirements for CAR T cell efficacy as well as the interplay between disease biology and clinical outcomes. Major CAR intrinsic variables affecting T cell behavior have been defined, and mechanisms of tumor resistance are increasingly understood. Here, we review the clinical experience with CAR T cells amassed to date, including but not limited to B cell malignancies, emphasizing factors associated with efficacy, resistance and major barriers to success. We also discuss how these insights are driving next-generation clinical trials, including those in solid tumors.

The CliniMACS Plus Instrument (Miltenyi Biotec) utilizes immunomagnetic isolate progenitor cells (HPCs), T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. These products are ultimately used for HPC transplantation and for the manufacture of adoptive immunotherapies. We evaluated the viable cell recovery and cell purity of selections and depletions performed on the CliniMACS Plus over a 10-year period at our facility, specifically assessing for the isolation of CD34+, CD4+, CD3+/CD56+, CD4+/CD8+, and CD25+ cells. Additionally, patient- and instrument-related factors affecting these parameters were examined. Viable cell recovery ranged from 32.3 10.2% to 65.4 15.4%, and was the highest for CD34+ selections. Cell purity ranged from 86.3 7.2% to 99.0 1.1%, and was the highest for CD4+ selections. Undesired cell fractions demonstrated a range of 1.2 0.45 to 5.1 0.4 log reductions. Red cell depletions averaged 2.12 0.68 logs, while platelets were reduced by an average of 4.01 1.57 logs. Donor characteristics did not impact viable cell recovery or cell purity for CD34+ or CD4+ cell enrichments; however, these were affected by manufacturing variables, including tubing size, bead quantity, and whether preselection platelet washes were performed. Our data demonstrate the efficient recovery of hematopoietic cellular fractions on the CliniMACS Plus that may be optimized by adjusting manufacturing variables.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown tremendous success in treating relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but this has not yet translated to treating solid tumors. This is partially due to a paucity of differentially expressed cell surface molecules on solid tumors that can be safely targeted. Here, we present B7-H3 (CD276) as a putative target for CAR T cell therapy of pediatric solid tumors, including those arising in the central nervous system.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed a novel B7-H3 CAR whose binder is derived from a monoclonal antibody that has been shown to preferentially bind tumor tissues and has been safely used in humans in early phase clinical trials. We tested B7-H3 CAR T cells in a variety of pediatric cancer models.RESULTS: B7-H3 CAR T cells mediate significant anti-tumor activity in vivo, causing regression of established solid tumors in xenograft models including osteosarcoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing sarcoma. We demonstrate that B7-H3 CAR T cell efficacy is largely dependent upon high surface target antigen density on tumor tissues and that activity is greatly diminished against target cells that express low levels of antigen, thus providing a possible therapeutic window despite low-level normal tissue expression of B7-H3.CONCLUSIONS: B7-H3 CAR T cells could represent an exciting therapeutic option for patients with certain lethal relapsed or refractory pediatric malignancies which should be tested in carefully designed clinical trials.

The effect of cryopreservation on CART characteristics is unclear. We retrospectively evaluated the effect of cryopreservation on product release criteria and invivo characteristics in 158 autologous CART products from 6 single-center clinical trials. Further, from 3 healthy donor manufacturing runs, we prospectively identified differentially expressed cell surface markers and gene signatures among fresh versus cryopreserved CARTs. Within 2days of culture initiation, cell viability of the starting fraction (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMNCs]) decreased significantly in the cryo-thawed arm compared to the fresh arm. Despite this, PBMNC cryopreservation did not affect final CART fold expansion, transduction efficiency, CD3%, or CD4:CD8 ratios. Invivo CART persistence and clinical responses did not differ among fresh and cryopreserved final products. In healthy donors, compared to fresh CARTs, early apoptotic cell-surface markers were significantly elevated in cryo-thawed CARTs. Cryo-thawed CARTs also demonstrated significantly elevated expression of mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis signaling, and cell cycle damage pathways. Cryopreservation during CART manufacture is a viable strategy, based on standard product release parameters. The clinical impact of cryopreservation-related subtle micro-cellular damage needs further study.

To investigate the biology of exhaustion in human T cells expressing CAR receptors, we used a model system with a tonically signaling CAR, which induces hallmark features of exhaustion6. Exhaustion was associated with a profound defect in the production of IL-2, along with increased chromatin accessibility of AP-1 transcription factor motifs and overexpression of the bZIP and IRF transcription factors that have been implicated in mediating dysfunction in exhausted T cells7-10. Here we show that CAR T cells engineered to overexpress the canonical AP-1 factor c-Jun have enhanced expansion potential, increased functional capacity, diminished terminal differentiation and improved anti-tumour potency in five different mouse tumour models in vivo. We conclude that a functional deficiency in c-Jun mediates dysfunction in exhausted human T cells, and that engineering CAR T cells to overexpress c-Jun renders them resistant to exhaustion, thereby addressing a major barrier to progress for this emerging class of therapeutic agents.

Immunotherapeutics targeting differentially expressed cell surface antigens could provide therapeutic benefit for such tumors. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) is a cell membrane-associated proteinase produced by the placenta that promotes fetal growth by inducing insulinlike growth factor (IGF) signaling.By comparing RNA expression of cell surface proteins in EWS (n=120) versus normal tissues (n=42), we comprehensively characterized the surfaceome of EWS to identify highly differentially expressed molecules. Using CRISPR/Cas-9 and anti-PAPP-A antibodies, we investigated biological roles for PAPP-A in EWS in vitro and in vivo in NSG xenograft models and performed RNA-sequencing on PAPPA knockout clones (n=5) and controls (n=3). All statistical tests were two-sided.EWS surfaceome analysis identified 11 highly differentially overexpressed genes, with PAPPA ranking second in differential expression. In EWS cell lines, genetic knockout of PAPPA and treatment with anti-PAPP-A antibodies revealed an essential survival role by regulating local IGF-1 bioavailability. MAb-mediated PAPPA inhibition diminished EWS growth improved the efficacy of anti-IGF-1R treatment (leg area mm2 at day IgG2a-CTRL; P<.001). PAPPA knockout in EWS cell lines induced interferon (IFN)-response genes, including proteins associated with antigen processing/presentation. Consistently, gene expression profiles in PAPPA-low EWS tumors were enriched for immune response pathways.This work provides a comprehensive characterization of the surfaceome of EWS, credentials PAPP-A as a highly differentially expressed therapeutic target, and discovers a novel link between IGF-1 signaling and immune evasion in cancer, thus implicating shared mechanisms of immune evasion between EWS and the placenta.

This paper presents a systematic evaluation developed and used to prospectively assess neurotoxicity in our phase I anti-CD22 CAR-T-cell trial and describes the symptoms of neurotoxicity identified using this methodology. Central nervous system (CNS) studies included routine lumbar punctures performed for disease evaluation pretherapy and posttherapy and a baseline brain MRI. Brief cognitive evaluations, assessing 4 domains (attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and processing speed), were administered preinfusion and postinfusion. A newly developed CAR-T-specific neurological symptom checklist (NSC) was completed by caregivers at 3 designated time-points. Serial serum cytokine levels were compared with neurotoxicity symptoms and severity. The majority of the first 22 consecutively treated subjects (ages, 7-30) demonstrated stable or improved cognitive test scores following therapy and no irreversible neurotoxicity, despite CAR-T-related antileukemic response, cytokine release syndrome, and trafficking of CAR-T cells to the CSF. The NSC allowed us to document the type and timing of symptoms and explore the etiology of neurotoxicity associated with CD22 CAR-T therapy. Cytokine profiling demonstrated that more concerning symptoms of neurotoxicity, such as hallucination and disorientation, were significantly associated with higher serum cytokine levels, supporting the hypothesis of inflammation-driven neurotoxicity. Systematic assessments of neurotoxicity were feasible in acutely ill children and young adults and served to characterize and monitor the symptoms associated with CAR-T therapy. We recommend these evaluations be incorporated into future immunotherapy protocols.

RCR detection assays are used to detect RCR in manufactured vector, transduced cell products infused into research subjects, and in theresearch subjects after treatment. In this study, we reviewed286 control (n= 4) and transduced cell products (n= 282) screened for RCR in the National Gene Vector Biorepository. The transduced cell samples were submitted from 14 clinical trials. All vector products were previously shown to be negative for RCR prior to use in cell transduction. After transduction, all 282 transduced cell products were negative for RCR. In addition, 241 of the clinical trial participants were also screened for RCR by analyzing peripheral blood at least 1month after infusion, all of which were also negative for evidence of RCR infection. The majority of vector products used in the clinical trials were generated in the PG13 packaging cell line. The findings suggest that screening of the retroviral vector product generated in PG13 cell line may be sufficient and that further screening of transduced cells does not provide added value.

Antigen loss or antigen-low escape is likely to emerge as an even greater barrier to success in solid tumors, which manifest greater heterogeneity in target antigen expression. Potential approaches to overcome this challenge include engineering CAR T cells to achieve multispecificity and to respond to lower levels of target antigen and more efficient induction of natural antitumor immune responses as a result of CAR-induced inflammation. In this article, we review the evidence to date for antigen escape and downregulation and discuss approaches currently under study to overcome these obstacles.Significance: Antigen escape and downregulation have emerged as major issues impacting the durability of CAR T-cell therapy.

Circulating NY-ESO-1c259T cells were present postinfusion in all patients and persisted for at least 6 months in all responders. Most of the infused NY-ESO-1c259T cells exhibited an effector memory phenotype following ex vivo expansion, but the persisting pools comprised largely central memory and stem-cell memory subsets, which remained polyfunctional and showed no evidence of T-cell exhaustion despite persistent tumor burdens. Next-generation sequencing of endogenous TCRs in CD8+ NY-ESO-1c259T cells revealed clonal diversity without contraction over time. These data suggest that regenerative pools of NY-ESO-1c259T cells produced a continuing supply of effector cells to mediate sustained, clinically meaningful antitumor effects.Significance: Metastatic synovial sarcoma is incurable with standard therapy. We employed engineered T cells targeting NY-ESO-1, and the data suggest that robust, self-regenerating pools of CD8+ NY-ESO-1c259T cells produce a continuing supply of effector cells over several months that mediate clinically meaningful antitumor effects despite prolonged exposure to antigen.

To increase the potency of adoptively transferred T cells, patients are conditioned with lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimens prior to adoptive T-cell transfer (ACT), and data suggest that fludarabine is an important component of an effective regimen. In a recent clinical trial using CAR-T cells engineered to target the CD19 B-cell antigen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, JCAR-015 (NCT02535364), two patient deaths due to cerebral edema led to trial suspension. The lymphodepleting agent fludarabine was suggested as the causative agent, in part due to its known association with neurotoxicity and its ability to induce greater potency. In a similar CAR-T study also incorporating fludarabine in the preconditioning regimen, ZUMA-1 (NCT02348216), one patient died of cerebral edema. However, subsequent deaths in the JCAR-015 study after removal of fludarabine and improved understanding behind the mechanisms of CAR-T-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) indicate that fludarabine is not the primary causative agent of cerebral edema and that it can be safely incorporated into the preconditioning regimen for ACT. Since entering clinical use in the late 1980s as a chemotherapy agent, fludarabine and similar analogs have been associated with lethal neurological toxicity, yet the manifestation and timing of symptoms are distinct to those observed recently in ACT. Herein, we review the history of fludarabine development as a chemotherapeutic agent, and discuss the safety of its continued use in preconditioning regimens for ACT.

Despite this early success, major challenges to the broad application of CAR-T cells as cancer therapies remain, including treatment-associated toxicities and cancer relapse with antigen-negative tumours. Targeting solid tumours with CAR-T cells poses additional obstacles because of the paucity of tumour-specific antigens and the immunosuppressive effects of the tumour microenvironment. To overcome these challenges, T cells can be programmed with genetic modules that increase their therapeutic potency and specificity. In this Review Article, we survey major advances in the engineering of next-generation CAR-T therapies for haematologic cancers and solid cancers, with particular emphasis on strategies for the control of CAR specificity and activity and on approaches for improving CAR-T-cell persistence and overcoming immunosuppression. We also lay out a roadmap for the development of off-the-shelf CAR-T cells.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells have mediated impressive clinical activity in B cell malignancies7-10, and recent results suggest benefit in central nervous system malignancies11-13. Here, we report that patient-derived H3-K27M-mutant glioma cell cultures exhibit uniform, high expression of the disialoganglioside GD2. Anti-GD2 CAR T cells incorporating a 4-1BBz costimulatory domain 14 demonstrated robust antigen-dependent cytokine generation and killing of DMG cells in vitro. In five independent patient-derived H3-K27M+ DMG orthotopic xenograft models, systemic administration of GD2-targeted CAR T cells cleared engrafted tumors except for a small number of residual GD2lo glioma cells. To date, GD2-targeted CAR T cells have been well tolerated in clinical trials15-17. Although GD2-targeted CAR T cell administration was tolerated in the majority of mice bearing orthotopic xenografts, peritumoral neuroinflammation during the acute phase of antitumor activity resulted in hydrocephalus that was lethal in a fraction of animals. Given the precarious neuroanatomical location of midline gliomas, careful monitoring and aggressive neurointensive care management will be required for human translation. With a cautious multidisciplinary clinical approach, GD2-targeted CAR T cell therapy for H3-K27M+ diffuse gliomas of pons, thalamus and spinal cord could prove transformative for these lethal childhood cancers.

Patients, however, often have leukopenia or have other disease-related complications. We evaluated the feasibility of collecting adequate numbers of CD3+ cells, risk factors for inadequate collections, and the rate of adverse events.Apheresis lymphocyte collections from patients participating in three CAR T-cell clinical trials were reviewed. Collections were performed on the COBE Spectra by experienced nurses, with the goal of obtaining a minimum of 0.6 109 and a target of 2 109 CD3+ cells. Preapheresis peripheral blood counts, apheresis parameters, and product cell counts were analyzed.Of the 71 collections, 69 (97%) achieved the minimum and 55 (77%) achieved the target. Before apheresis, the 16 patients with yields below the target had significantly lower proportions and absolute numbers of circulating lymphocytes and CD3+ lymphocytes and higher proportions of circulating blasts and NK cells than those who achieved the target (470 106 lymphocytes/L vs. 1340 106 lymphocytes/L, p = 0.008; 349 106 914 CD3+ cells/L, p = 0.001; 17.6% blasts vs. 4.55% blasts, p = 0.029). Enrichment of blasts in the product compared to the peripheral blood occurred in four patients, including the two patients whose collections did not yield the minimum number of CD3+ cells. Apheresis complications occurred in 11 patients (15%) and, with one exception, were easily managed in the apheresis clinic.In most patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy, leukapheresis is well tolerated, and adequate numbers of CD3+ lymphocytes are collected.

This variability is due in part to the contamination of the PBMC concentrates with monocytes and granulocytes.Counter-flow elutriation allows for the closed system separation of lymphocytes from monocytes and granulocytes. We investigated the use of PBMC concentrates enriched for lymphocytes using elutriation for manufacturing 8 CD19- and 5 GD2-CAR T cell products.When compared to PBMC concentrates, lymphocyte-enriched elutriation fractions contained greater proportions of CD3+and CD56+cells and reduced proportions of CD14+and CD15+cells. All 13 CAR T cell products manufactured using the elutriated lymphocytes yielded sufficient quantities of transduced CAR T cells to meet clinical dose criteria. The GD2-CAR T cell products contained significantly more T cells and transduced T cells than the CD19-CAR T cell products. A comparison of the yields of CAR T cells produced from elutriated lymphocytes with the yields of CAR T cells previous produced from cells isolated from PBMC concentrates by anti-CD3/CD28 bead selection or by anti-CD3/CD28 bead selection plus plastic adherence found that greater quantities of GD2-CAR T cells were produced from elutriated lymphocytes, but not CD19-CAR T cells.Enrichment of PBMC concentrates for lymphocytes using elutriation increased the quantity of GD2-CAR T cells produced. These results provide further evidence that CAR T cell expansion is inhibited by monocytes and granulocytes.

Clinical studies of PD-1 blockade are only now being initiated in pediatric patients, and little is known regarding programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in common childhood cancers. The authors characterized PD-L1 expression and tumor-associated immune cells (TAICs) (lymphocytes and macrophages) in common pediatric cancers.Whole slide sections and tissue microarrays were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 expression and for the presence of TAICs. TAICs were also screened for PD-L1 expression.Thirty-nine of tumors (9%) expressed PD-L1 in at least 1% of tumor cells. The highest frequency histotypes comprised Burkitt lymphoma (80%; 8 of 10 tumors), (36%; 5 of 14 tumors), and neuroblastoma (14%; 17 of 118 tumors). PD-L1 staining was associated with inferior survival among patients with neuroblastoma (P=.004). Seventy-four percent of tumors contained lymphocytes and/or macrophages. Macrophages were significantly more likely to be identified in PD-L1-positive versus PD-L1-negative tumors (P<.001).A subset of diagnostic pediatric cancers exhibit PD-L1 expression, whereas a much larger fraction demonstrates infiltration with tumor-associated lymphocytes. PD-L1 expression may be a biomarker for poor outcome in neuroblastoma. Further preclinical and clinical investigation will define the predictive nature of PD-L1 expression in childhood cancers both at diagnosis and after exposure to chemoradiotherapy.

Tcells expressing a CAR incorporating the single-chain variable fragment sequence of the ALK48 mAb linked to a 4-1BB-CD3 signaling domain lysed ALK-expressing tumor lines and produced interferon-gamma upon antigen stimulation but had limited anti-tumor efficacy in two xenograft models of human neuroblastoma. Further exploration demonstrated that cytokine production was highly dependent upon ALK target density and that target density of ALK on neuroblastoma cell lines was insufficient for maximal activation of CAR Tcells. In addition, ALK CAR Tcells demonstrated rapid and complete antigen-induced loss of receptor from the Tcell surface via internalization. Using a model that simultaneously modulated antigen density and CAR expression, we demonstrated that CAR functionality is regulated by target antigen and CAR density and that low expression of either contributes to limited anti-tumor efficacy of the ALK CAR. These data suggest that stoichiometric relationships between CAR receptors and target antigens may significantly impact the anti-tumor efficacy of CAR Tcells and that manipulation of these parameters could allow precise tuning of CAR Tcell activity.

CD22 is also expressed in most cases of B-ALL and is usually retained following CD19 loss. We report results from a phase 1 trial testing a new CD22-targeted CAR (CD22-CAR) in 21 children and adults, including 17 who were previously treated with CD19-directed immunotherapy. Dose-dependent antileukemic activity was observed, with complete remission obtained in 73% (11/15) of patients receiving 1 106 CD22-CAR T cells per kg body weight, including 5 of 5 patients with CD19dim or CD19- B-ALL. Median remission duration was 6 months. Relapses were associated with diminished CD22 site density that likely permitted CD22+ cell escape from killing by CD22-CAR T cells. These results are the first to establish the clinical activity of a CD22-CAR in B-ALL, including leukemia resistant to anti-CD19 immunotherapy, demonstrating potency against B-ALL comparable to that of CD19-CAR at biologically active doses. Our results also highlight the critical role played by antigen density in regulating CAR function.

Advanced pediatric solid tumors carry poor prognoses and resultant robust efforts to apply immunotherapy advances to pediatric solid tumors are in progress. Here, we discuss recent developments in the field using mAb and mAb-based therapies including checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen receptors (CARs).The pediatric solid tumor mAb experience targeting the diganglioside, GD2, for patients with neuroblastoma has been the most compelling to date. GD2 and alternative antigen-specific mAbs are now being incorporated into antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies and CARs for treatment of solid tumors. CARs in pediatric solid tumors have not yet achieved comparative responses to the hematologic CAR experience; however, novel strategies such as bispecific targeting, intratumoral administration and improved understanding of T-cell biology may yield enhanced CAR-efficacy. Therapeutic effect using single-agent checkpoint blocking antibodies in pediatric solid tumors also remains limited to date. Combinatorial strategies continue to hold promise and the clinical effect in tumor subsets with high antigenic burden is being explored.Pediatric immunotherapy remains at early stages of translation, yet we anticipate that with advanced technology, we will achieve widespread, efficacious use of immunotherapy for pediatric solid tumors.

We sought to assess the potential of GD2-CAR therapies to treat pediatric sarcomas. We observed that 18 of 18 (100%) of osteosarcomas, 2 of 15 (13%) of rhabdomyosarcomas, and 7 of 35 (20%) of Ewing sarcomas expressed GD2. T cells engineered to express a third-generation GD2-CAR incorporating the 14g2a-scFv with the CD28, OX40, and CD3 signaling domains (14g2a.CD28.OX40.) mediated efficient and comparable lysis of both GD2(+) sarcoma and neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro However, in xenograft models, GD2-CAR T cells had no antitumor effect against GD2(+) sarcoma, despite effectively controlling GD2(+) neuroblastoma. observed that pediatric sarcoma xenografts, but not induced large and granulocytic murine myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) that inhibited human CAR T-cell responses in vitro Treatment of sarcoma-bearing mice with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) largely eradicated monocytic MDSCs and diminished the suppressive capacity of granulocytic MDSCs. Combined therapy using GD2-CAR T cells plus ATRA significantly improved antitumor efficacy against sarcoma xenografts. We conclude that retinoids provide a clinically accessible class of agents capable of diminishing the suppressive effects of MDSCs, and that co-administration of retinoids may enhance the efficacy of CAR therapies targeting solid tumors.

Treatment for post-HCT relapse using donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has limited utility, particularly in the setting of acute leukemia, and can result in the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene product is a tumor-associated antigen that is expressed in acute leukemia and other hematologic malignancies, with limited expression in normal tissues. In this pilot trial, we assessed safety and feasibility of a WT1 peptide-loaded donor-derived dendritic cell (DC) vaccine given with DLI designed to enhance and direct the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Secondary objectives were to evaluate immunologic and clinical responses. A total of 5 subjects, median age 17 years (range, 9 to 19 years), with post-HCT relapse were enrolled. Disease subtypes included acute lymphoblastic acute myelogenous leukemia (n=1), and Hodgkin lymphoma (n=1). Successful vaccine production was feasible from all donors. DC vaccination and DLI were well tolerated. One recipient developed grade 1 skin GVHD not requiring systemic therapy. The most common adverse events included grade 1 reversible pain and pruritus at the vaccine injection and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing sites. There were no grade 3 or higher adverse events related to the research. Immune responses consisted of ELISpot response in 3 recipients and positive DTH tests to WT1 peptide cocktail in 2 subjects. Our study provides 1 of the first attempts to apply tumor-specific vaccine therapy to the allogeneic setting. Preliminary results show the DC-based vaccination is safe and feasible after allogeneic HCT, with a suggestion that this approach can be used to sensitize the repopulated allogeneic-donor immune system to WT1. Future directions may include testing of vaccination strategies in the early post-transplantation setting for relapse prevention.

In the flow cytometry cohort, patients were defined as \"positive\" for bone marrow micrometastatic disease if their CD99(+)/CD45(-) values were above the upper limit in 22 control patients. In the PCR cohort, RT-PCR on blood or bone marrow samples classified the patients as \"positive\" or \"negative\" for EWSR1/FLI1 translocations. The association between micrometastatic disease burden with clinical features and outcome was assessed. Coexpression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) on detected tumor cells was performed in a subset of flow cytometry samples.The median total bone marrow CD99(+)CD45(-) percent was 0.0012% (range 0%-1.10%) in the flow cytometry cohort, with 14 of 109 (12.8%) of Ewing sarcoma patients defined as \"positive.\" In the PCR cohort, 19.6% (44/225) patients were \"positive\" for any EWSR1/FLI1 translocation in blood or bone marrow. There were no differences in baseline clinical features or event-free or overall survival between patients classified as \"positive\" versus \"negative\" by either method. CD99(+)CD45(-) cells had significantly higher IGF-1R expression compared with CD45(+) hematopoietic cells (mean geometric mean fluorescence intensity 982.7 vs. 190.9; P < 0.001).The detection of micrometastatic disease at initial diagnosis by flow cytometry or RT-PCR is not associated with outcome in newly diagnosed patients with Ewing sarcoma.

We administered adjuvant immunotherapy to patients with metastatic and recurrent pediatric sarcomas in an effort to improve outcomes.Mononuclear cells were collected via apheresis, and tumor lysate was acquired via percutaneous biopsy at enrollment. Participants received standard antineoplastic lymphocytes, cell vaccinations recombinant human IL7. Primary outcomes were toxicity and vaccine responses. Secondary outcomes were immune reconstitution, event-free survival, and overall survival (OS).Forty-three patients enrolled and 29 received immunotherapy. The regimen was well tolerated. Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated 5-year OS of 51% with significant differences based upon histologic group (63% vs. 0% for Ewing/rhabdomyosarcoma vs. other sarcomas) and response to standard therapy (74% no residual disease vs. 0% residual disease). Five-year intent-to-treat OS of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing/rhabdomyosarcoma was 77%, higher than previously reported in this population and higher than observed in a similar group treated with an earlier adjuvant immunotherapy regimen (25% 5-year OS).

Persisting CAR-T cells generate sustained pressure against CD19 that may drive unique mechanisms of resistance. Pre-B ALL originates from a committed pre-B cell or an earlier progenitor, with potential to reprogram into other hematopoietic lineages. Here we report changes in lineage markers including myeloid conversion in patients following CD19 CAR therapy. Using murine ALL models we study the long-term effects of CD19 CAR-T cells and demonstrate partial or complete lineage switch as a consistent mechanism of CAR resistance depending on the underlying genetic oncogenic driver. Deletion of Pax5 or Ebf1 recapitulates lineage reprogramming occurring during CD19 CAR pressure. Our findings establish lineage switch as a mechanism of CAR resistance exposing inherent plasticity in genetic subtypes of pre-B-cell ALL.

CD19- and GD2-CAR T-cell manufacturing records were reviewed to identify sources of variability.CD19-CAR T cells were used to treat 43 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma and GD2-CAR T cells to treat eight patients with osteosarcoma and three with neuroblastoma. Both types of CAR T cells were manufactured using autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) concentrates and anti-CD3/CD28 beads for T-cell enrichment and simulation.A comparison of the first 6 GD2- and the first 22 CD19-CAR T-cell products manufactured revealed that GD2-CAR T-cell products contained cells than (14710210(6) vs more 18.513.7%; P=0.019). Among the first 28 CD19-CAR T-cell products manufactured, four had poor expansion yielding less than 110(6) transduced T cells per kilogram. When PBMC concentrates from these four patients were compared with the 24 others, PBMC concentrates of poorly expanding products contained greater quantities of monocytes (39.812.9% vs. 15.310.8%, P=0.0014). Among the patients whose CD19-CAR T cells expanded poorly, manufacturing for two patients was repeated using cryopreserved PBMC concentrates but incorporating a monocyte depleting plastic adherence step, and an adequate dose of CAR T cells was produced for both patients.Variability in CAR T-cell expansion is due, at least in part, to the contamination of the starting PBMC concentrates with monocytes.

While significant advances have been made in improving outcomes of patients with localized pediatric sarcomas since the addition of systemic chemotherapy to local control many decades ago, outcomes for patients with metastatic and relapsed sarcoma remain poor with few novel therapeutics identified to date. With the advent of new technologies to study cancer genomes, transcriptomes and epigenomes, our understanding of sarcoma biology has improved tremendously in a relatively short period of time. However, much remains to be accomplished in this arena especially with regard to translating all of this new knowledge to the bedside. To this end, a meeting was convened in Philadelphia, PA, on April 18, 2015 sponsored by the QuadW foundation, Children's Oncology Group and CureSearch for Children's Cancer that brought together sarcoma clinicians and scientists from North America to review the current state of pediatric sarcoma biology and ongoing/planned genomics based clinical trials in an effort to identify and bridge knowledge gaps that continue to exist at present. At the conclusion of the workshop, three key objectives that would significantly further our understanding of sarcoma were identified and a proposal was put forward to develop an all-encompassing pediatric sarcoma biology protocol that would address these specific needs. This review summarizes the proceedings of the workshop.

Hematopoietic cells contribute to this microenvironment, yet the precise initiating events responsible for establishing the pre-metastatic niche remain unclear. Here, we tracked the developmental fate of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in tumor-bearing mice. We show that a distant primary tumor drives the expansion of HSPCs within the bone marrow and their mobilization to the bloodstream. Treatment of purified HSPCs cultured ex vivo with tumor-conditioned media induced their proliferation as well as their differentiation into immunosuppressive myeloid cells. We furthered tracked purified HSPCs in vivo and found they differentiated into myeloid-derived suppressor cells in early metastatic sites of tumor-bearing mice. The number of CD11b(+)Ly6g(+) cells in metastatic sites was significantly increased by HSPC mobilization and decreased if tumor-mediated mobilization was inhibited. Moreover, pharmacologic mobilization of HSPCs increased metastasis, whereas depletion of Gr1(+) cells abrogated the metastasis-promoting effects of HSPC mobilization. Finally, we detected elevated levels of HSPCs in the circulation of newly diagnosed cancer patients, which correlated with increased risk for metastatic progression. Taken together, our results highlight bone marrow activation as one of the earliest steps of the metastatic process and identify circulating HSPCs as potential clinical indicators of metastatic niche formation.

Dose escalation cohorts received 1, 3, 5, or 10 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks in a 3 + 3 design. Response was assessed after 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and then every 3 months. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Thirty-three patients received 72 doses of ipilimumab. Patients enrolled had melanoma (n = 12), sarcoma (n = 17), or other refractory solid tumors (n = 4). Immune-related adverse events included pancreatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, and transaminitis with dose-limiting toxicities observed at 5 and 10 mg/kg dose levels. Pharmacokinetics revealed a half-life of 8 to 15 days. At day 21, subjects had increased levels of cycling T cells, but no change in regulatory T-cell populations. Six subjects had confirmed stable disease for 4 to 10 cycles (melanoma, osteosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and synovial sarcoma).Ipilimumab was safely administered to pediatric patients using management algorithms for immune-related toxicities. The spectrum of immune-related adverse events is similar to those described in adults; however, many of the pediatric toxicities were evident after a single dose. Although no objective tumor regressions were observed with ipilimumab as a single agent, subjects with immune-related toxicities had an increased overall survival compared with those who showed no evidence of breaking tolerance.

Unique features of these neuroendocrine tumours are the early age of onset, the high frequency of metastatic disease at diagnosis and the tendency for spontaneous regression of tumours in infancy. The most malignant tumours have amplification of the MYCN oncogene (encoding a transcription factor), which is usually associated with poor survival, even in localized disease. Although transgenic mouse models have shown that MYCN overexpression can be a tumour-initiating factor, many other cooperating genes and tumour suppressor genes are still under investigation and might also have a role in tumour development. Segmental chromosome alterations are frequent in neuroblastoma and are associated with worse outcome. The rare familial neuroblastomas are usually associated with germline mutations in ALK, which is mutated in 10-15% of primary tumours, and provides a potential therapeutic target. Risk-stratified therapy has facilitated the reduction of therapy for children with low-risk and intermediate-risk disease. Advances in therapy for patients with high-risk disease include intensive induction chemotherapy and myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by the treatment of minimal residual disease using differentiation therapy and immunotherapy; these have improved 5-year overall survival to 50%. Currently, new approaches targeting the noradrenaline transporter, genetic pathways and the tumour microenvironment hold promise for further improvements in survival and long-term quality of life.

We detected hemizygous deletions spanning the CD19 locus and de novo frameshift and missense mutations in exon 2 of CD19 in some relapse samples. However, we also discovered alternatively spliced CD19 mRNA species, including one lacking exon 2. Pull-down/siRNA experiments identified SRSF3 as a splicing factor involved in exon 2 retention, and its levels were lower in relapsed B-ALL. Using genome editing, we demonstrated that exon 2 skipping bypasses exon 2 mutations in B-ALL cells and allows expression of the N-terminally truncated CD19 variant, which fails to trigger killing by CART-19 but partly rescues defects associated with CD19 loss. Thus, this mechanism of resistance is based on a combination of deleterious mutations and ensuing selection for alternatively spliced RNA isoforms.CART-19 yield 70% response rates in patients with B-ALL, but also produce escape variants. We discovered that the underlying mechanism is the selection for preexisting alternatively spliced CD19 isoforms with the compromised CART-19 epitope. This mechanism suggests a possibility of targeting alternative CD19 ectodomains, which could improve survival of patients with B-cell neoplasms.

It remains unknown whether the impressive effects of CD19 CARs relate to greater susceptibility of hematologic malignancies to CAR therapies, or superior functionality of the CD19 CAR itself. We show that tonic CAR CD3- phosphorylation, triggered by antigen-independent clustering of CAR single-chain variable fragments, can induce early exhaustion of CAR T cells that limits antitumor efficacy. Such activation is present to varying degrees in all CARs studied, except the highly effective CD19 CAR. We further determine that CD28 costimulation augments, whereas 4-1BB costimulation reduces, exhaustion induced by persistent CAR signaling. Our results provide biological explanations for the antitumor effects of CD19 CARs and for the observations that CD19 CAR T cells incorporating the 4-1BB costimulatory domain are more persistent than those incorporating CD28 in clinical trials.

Engineered receptors targeting TAAs have most commonly been expressed on mature T cells, however, some have postulated that receptor expression on immune progenitors could yield T cells with enhanced potency. We generated mice (survivin-TCR-transgenic [Sur-TCR-Tg]) expressing a TCR recognizing the immunodominant epitope (Sur20-28) murine survivin during acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) occurred in 100% of Sur-TCR-Tg mice derived from 3 separate founders. The leukemias expressed the Sur-TCR and signaled in response to the Sur20-28 peptide. In preleukemic mice, we observed increased cycling of double-negative thymocytes expressing the Sur-TCR and increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells, consistent with TCR signaling induced by survivin expression in the murine thymus. 2M(-/-) Sur-TCR-Tg mice, which cannot effectively present survivin peptides on class I major histocompatibility complex, had significantly diminished rates of leukemia. We conclude that TCR signaling during the early stages of thymopoiesis mediates an oncogenic signal, and therefore expression of signaling receptors on developing thymocytes with specificity for TAAs expressed in the thymus could pose a risk for neoplasia, independent of insertional mutagenesis.

The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01593696.Between July 2, 2012, and June 20, 2014, 21 patients (including eight who had previously undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) were enrolled and infused with CD19-CAR T cells. 19 received the prescribed dose of CD19-CAR T cells, whereas the assigned dose concentration could not be generated for two patients (90% feasible). All patients enrolled were assessed for response. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as 110(6) CD19-CAR T cells per kg. All toxicities were fully reversible, with the most severe being grade 4 cytokine release syndrome that occurred in three (14%) of 21 patients (95% CI 30-363). The most common non-haematological grade 3 adverse events were fever (nine [43%] of 21 patients), hypokalaemia (nine [43%] of 21 patients), fever and neutropenia (eight [38%] of 21 patients), and cytokine release syndrome (three [14%) of 21 patients).CD19-CAR T cell therapy is feasible, safe, and mediates potent anti-leukaemic activity in children and young adults with chemotherapy-resistant B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. All toxicities were reversible and B-cell aplasia did not occur.National Institutes of Health Intramural funds and St Baldrick's Foundation.

Preclinical studies demonstrate that activation of NK cells using interleukin-15 (IL-15) plus 4-1BBL upregulates activating receptor expression and augments killing capacity. In an effort to amplify the beneficial effects of NK cells post-HSCT, we conducted a first-in-human trial of adoptive nonmyeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in children and young adults with ultra-high-risk solid tumors. aNK-DLI were CD3(+)-depleted, CD56(+)-selected lymphocytes, cultured for 9 to 11 days with recombinant human IL-15 plus 4-1BBL(+)IL-15R(+) artificial antigen-presenting cells. aNK-DLI demonstrated potent killing capacity and displayed high levels of activating receptor expression. Five of 9 transplant recipients experienced acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following aNK-DLI, with grade 4 GVHD observed in 3 subjects. GVHD was more common in matched unrelated donor vs matched sibling donor recipients and was associated with higher donor CD3 chimerism. Given that the T-cell dose was below the threshold required for GVHD in this setting, we conclude that aNK-DLI contributed to the acute GVHD observed, likely by augmenting underlying T-cell alloreactivity. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01287104.

Intensive research is underway to improve the efficacy of immunotherapeutics and to expand the application of immunotherapy to a wider array of cancers. The therapeutic options that comprise immunotherapy for cancer are vast and span monoclonal antibodies, tumor vaccines, adoptive cellular therapies, as well as therapies aimed at reversing immunosuppression and enhancing immune reactivity globally and/or locally within the tumor microenvironment. In pediatric cancer, monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated efficacy in hematologic malignancies, and neuroblastoma and bispecific antibodies that activate resident T cells, as well as adoptive cell therapy, have shown recent exciting results for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood. This review discusses the basic principles of tumor immunology driving clinical development of new immunotherapies, describes immunotherapeutics with demonstrated efficacy and several currently in clinical trials, and highlight agents that seem to be most promising for the treatment of pediatric cancer.

These agents can amplify existent antitumour immunity or induce durable antitumour immune responses in a wide array of cancers. The spectrum of immunotherapeutics is broad, spanning monoclonal antibodies and their derivatives, tumour vaccines, and adoptive therapies using T cells and natural killer cells. Only a small number of immunotherapies have been tested in paediatric cancers, but impressive antitumour effects have already been observed. Mononclonal antibodies targeting GD2 that induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity improve survival in high-risk neuroblastoma. Bi-specific monoclonal antibodies that simultaneously target CD19 and activate T cells can induce remission in acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and adoptive immunotherapy using T cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors targeting CD19 induce impressive responses in B-ALL. Efforts are underway to generate and test new immunotherapies in a wider array of paediatric cancers. Major challenges include a need to identify immunotherapy targets on the most lethal childhood cancers, to expand availability of technology-intense platforms, such as adoptive cell therapy, to optimize management of novel toxicities associated with this new class of cancer therapies and to determine how best to incorporate these therapies into standard treatment paradigms.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially life-threatening toxicity that has been observed following administration of natural and bispecific antibodies and, more recently, following adoptive T-cell therapies for cancer. CRS is associated with elevated circulating levels of several cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon , and uncontrolled studies demonstrate that immunosuppression using tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, with or without corticosteroids, can reverse the syndrome. However, because early and aggressive immunosuppression could limit the efficacy of the immunotherapy, current approaches seek to limit administration of immunosuppressive therapy to patients at risk for life-threatening consequences of the syndrome. This report presents a novel system to grade the severity of CRS in individual patients and a treatment algorithm for management of CRS based on severity. The goal of our approach is to maximize the chance for therapeutic benefit from the immunotherapy while minimizing the risk for life threatening complications of CRS.

Tumor signaling of programmed death 1 (PD1) on T cells and expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are major mechanisms of tumor immune escape. We sought to target these pathways in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. Murine RMS showed high surface expression of PD-L1, and anti-PD1 prevented tumor growth if initiated early after tumor inoculation; however, delayed anti-PD1 had limited benefit. RMS induced robust expansion of CXCR2(+)CD11b(+)Ly6G(hi) MDSCs, and CXCR2 deficiency prevented CD11b(+)Ly6G(hi) MDSC trafficking to the tumor. When tumor trafficking of MDSCs was inhibited by CXCR2 deficiency, or after anti-CXCR2 monoclonal antibody therapy, delayed anti-PD1 treatment induced significant antitumor effects. Thus, CXCR2(+)CD11b(+)Ly6G(hi) MDSCs mediate local immunosuppression, which limits the efficacy of checkpoint blockade in murine RMS. Human pediatric sarcomas also produce CXCR2 ligands, including serum CXCR2 ligands, and elevated CXCL8 is associated with diminished survival in this population. We conclude that accumulation of MDSCs in the tumor bed limits the efficacy of checkpoint blockade in cancer. We also identify CXCR2 as a novel target for modulating tumor immune escape and present evidence that CXCR2(+)CD11b(+)Ly6G(hi) MDSCs are an important suppressive myeloid subset in pediatric sarcomas. These findings present a translatable strategy to improve the efficacy of checkpoint blockade by preventing trafficking of MDSCs to the tumor site.

Immunodepletion of clinical body fluid specimens (e.g., serum/plasma) for the removal of highly abundant proteins is a reasonable and reproducible solution. Often overlooked, clinical tissue specimens also contain a formidable amount of highly abundant blood-derived proteins present in tissue-embedded networks of blood/lymph capillaries and interstitial fluid. Hence, the dynamic range impediment to biomarker discovery remains a formidable obstacle, regardless of clinical sample type (solid tissue and/or body fluid). Thus, we optimized and applied simultaneous immunodepletion of blood-derived proteins from solid tissue and peripheral blood, using clear cell renal cell carcinoma as a model disease. Integrative analysis of data from this approach and genomic data obtained from the same type of tumor revealed concordant key pathways and protein targets germane to clear cell renal cell carcinoma. This includes the activation of the lipogenic pathway characterized by increased expression of adipophilin (PLIN2) along with 'cadherin switching', a phenomenon indicative of transcriptional reprogramming linked to renal epithelial dedifferentiation. We also applied immunodepletion of abundant blood-derived proteins to various tissue types (e.g., adipose tissue and breast tissue) showing unambiguously that the removal of abundant blood-derived proteins represents a powerful tool for the reproducible profiling of tissue proteomes. Herein, we show that the removal of abundant blood-derived proteins from solid tissue specimens is of equal importance to depletion of body fluids and recommend its routine use in the context of biological discovery and/or cancer biomarker research. Finally, this perspective presents the background, rationale and strategy for using tissue-directed high-resolution/accuracy MS-based shotgun proteomics to detect genuine tumor proteins in the peripheral blood of a patient diagnosed with nonmetastatic cancer, employing concurrent liquid chromatography-MS analysis of immunodepleted clinical tissue and blood specimens.

The ability to target B-cell ALL with immunoglobulin-like binders, whether anti-CD22 antibody or anti-CD19 CAR-Ts, has impacted treatment options for some patients. The development of new ways to target B-cell antigens continues at rapid pace. T-cell ALL accounts for up to 20% of childhood leukemia but has yet to see a set of high-value immunotherapeutic targets identified. To find new targets for T-ALL immunotherapy, we employed a bioinformatic comparison to broad normal tissue arrays, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), and mature lymphocytes, then filtered the results for transcripts encoding plasma membrane proteins. T-ALL bears a core T-cell signature and transcripts encoding TCR/CD3 components and canonical markers of T-cell development predominate, especially when comparison was made to normal tissue or HSC. However, when comparison to mature lymphocytes was also undertaken, we identified two antigens that may drive, or be associated with leukemogenesis; TALLA-1 and hedgehog interacting protein. In addition, TCR subfamilies, CD1, activation and adhesion markers, membrane-organizing molecules, and receptors linked to metabolism and inflammation were also identified. Of these, only CD52, CD37, and CD98 are currently being targeted clinically. This work provides a set of targets to be considered for future development of immunotherapies for T-ALL.

Recently, complete clinical responses have been observed in small numbers of patients with B-ALL treated with adoptive immunotherapy using T cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19, a cell surface molecule present in essentially all cases of B-ALL. Preclinical data suggest that CARs targeting CD22, another antigen present in the majority of B-ALL cases, are similarly potent. Several clinical studies already under way will soon more clearly define the rate of response to this novel therapy in B-ALL. Further work is needed to identify optimal platforms for CAR-based adoptive immunotherapy for leukemia, to establish guidelines for managing toxicity, and to determine whether the remissions induced by this approach can be rendered durable.

This therapy involves the transduction of autologous T cells with a viral vector and the subsequent cell expansion. We describe a new, simplified method to produce anti-CD19-CAR T cells.T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 paramagnetic beads. After 2 days, the T cells were added to culture bags pre-treated with RetroNectin and loaded with the retroviral anti-CD19 CAR vector. The cells, beads and vector were incubated for 24 h, and a second transduction was then performed. No spinoculation was used. Cells were then expanded for an additional 9 days.The method was validated through the use of two PBMC products from a patient with B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia and one PBMC product from a healthy subject. The two PBMC products from the patient with B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia contained 11.4% and 12.9% T cells. The manufacturing process led to final products highly enriched in T cells with a mean CD3+ cell content of 98%, a mean expansion of 10.6-fold and a mean transduction efficiency of 68%. Similar results were obtained from the PBMCs of the first four patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated at our institution.We developed a simplified, semi-closed system for the initial selection, activation, transduction and expansion of T cells with the use of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads and bags to produce autologous anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells to support an ongoing clinical trial.

Immunotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of solid tumors typically generate antigen-specific responses too weak to overcome considerable tumor burden and tumor suppressive mechanisms and are in need of adjuvant assistance. Previous work suggests that inhibitors of DASH (dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity and/or structural homologs) enzymes can mediate tumor regression by immune-mediated mechanisms. Herein, we demonstrate that the DASH inhibitor, ARI-4175, can induce regression and eradication of well-established solid tumors, both as a single agent and as an adjuvant to a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) in mice implanted with the M3-9-M rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. Treatment with effective doses of ARI-4175 correlated with recruitment of myeloid (CD11b) cells, particularly myeloid DCs, to secondary lymphoid with reduced frequency of intratumoral monocytic (CD11bLy6-CLy6-G) myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In immunocompetent mice, combining ARI-4175 with a DC vaccine or ACT with tumor-primed T cells produced significant improvements in tumor responses against well-established M3-9-M tumors. In M3-9-M-bearing immunodeficient (Rag1) mice, ACT combined with ARI-4175 produced greater tumor responses and significantly improved survival compared with either treatment alone. These studies warrant the clinical investigation of ARI-4175 for treatment of sarcomas and other malignancies, particularly as an adjuvant to tumor vaccines and ACT.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) expand in cancer-bearing hosts and contribute to tumor immune evasion. They are typically described as CD11bHLA-DR in humans. We report abnormal expansions of CD11bHLA-DR myeloid cells in peripheral blood mononuclear fractions of subjects with metastatic pediatric sarcomas. Like classical fibrocytes, they display cell surface smooth muscle actin, collagen I/V, and mediate angiogenesis. However, classical fibrocytes serve as antigen presenters and augment immune reactivity, whereas fibrocytes from cancer subjects suppressed anti-CD3-mediated T-cell proliferation, primarily via indoleamine oxidase (IDO). The degree of fibrocyte expansion observed in individual subjects directly correlated with the frequency of circulating GATA3CD4 cells (R = 0.80) and monocytes from healthy donors cultured with IL-4 differentiated into fibrocytes with the same phenotypic profile and immunosuppressive properties as those observed in patients with cancer. We thus describe a novel subset of cancer-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which bear the phenotypic and functional hallmarks of fibrocytes but mediate immune suppression. These cells are likely expanded in response to Th2 immune deviation and may contribute to tumor progression via both immune evasion and angiogenesis.

Major topics of the conference included (i) cellular therapies using antigen-specific and gene-modified T cells for targeting leukemia and pediatric solid tumors; (ii) overcoming hurdles and barriers with regard to immunogenicity, immune escape, and the role of tumor microenvironment; (iii) vaccine strategies and antigen presentation; (iv) haploidentical transplantation and innate immunity; (v) the role of immune cells in allogeneic transplantation; and (vi) current antibody/immunoconjugate approaches for the treatment of pediatric malignancies. During the past decade, major advances have been made in improving the efficacy of these modalities and regulatory hurdles have been taken. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go to fully exploit the potential of immunotherapeutic strategies to improve the cure of children and adolescents with malignancies.

We demonstrate that sIL7R has moderate affinity for IL-7 but does not bind thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Functionally, sIL7R competes with cell-associated IL-7 receptor to diminish excessive IL-7 consumption and, thus, enhances the bioactivity of IL-7 when the cytokine is limited, as it is presumed to be in vivo. IL-7 signaling in the presence of sIL7R also diminishes expression of CD95 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, both regulatory molecules. Murine models confirm diminished consumption of IL-7 in the presence of sIL7R and also demonstrate a potentiating effect of sIL7R on IL-7-mediated homeostatic expansion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis exacerbation. In multiple sclerosis and several other autoimmune diseases, IL7R genotype influences susceptibility. We measured increased sIL7R levels, as well as increased IL-7 levels, in multiple sclerosis patients with the predisposing IL7R genotype, consistent with diminished IL-7 consumption work demonstrates that sIL7R potentiates IL-7 bioactivity and provides a basis to explain the increased risk of autoimmunity observed in individuals with genotype-induced elevations of sIL7R.

To test the suitability of targeting CD22 on precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), lymphoblasts from 111 patients with BCP-ALL were assayed for CD22 expression and all were found to be CD22-positive, with median CD22 expression levels of 3500 sites/cell. Three distinct binding domains targeting CD22 were fused to various TCR signaling domains an IgG heavy chain constant domain (CH2CH3) to create a series of vector constructs suitable to delineate optimal CAR configuration. CARs derived from the m971 anti-CD22 mAb, which targets a proximal CD22 epitope demonstrated superior antileukemic activity compared with those incorporating other binding domains, and addition of a 4-1BB signaling domain to CD28.CD3 constructs diminished potency, whereas increasing affinity of the anti-CD22 binding motif, and extending the CD22 binding domain away from the membrane via CH2CH3 had no effect. We conclude that second-generation m971 mAb-derived anti-CD22 CARs are promising novel therapeutics that should be tested in BCP-ALL.

One patient had grade 2 pericarditis consistent with radiation recall, and one patient developed grade 3 pneumonia with hypoxia during the second cycle. Five patients experienced stable disease for three to 24 cycles. No patients experienced complete or partial response, but several showed evidence of antitumor activity, including one patient with recurrent progressive osteosarcoma who experienced resolution of clinical symptoms and positron emission tomography activity, ongoing more than 1 year off therapy. One patient with hepatoblastoma showed a dramatic biomarker response.Pediatric patients tolerate 10 mg/kg of lexatumumab administered once every 14 days, the maximum-tolerated dose identified in adults. The drug seems to mediate some clinical activity in pediatric solid tumors and may work with radiation to enhance antitumor effects.

Congenital deficiencies in IL-7 signaling result in profound immunodeficiency, polymorphisms in IL7R modulate susceptibility to autoimmune disease, and acquired somatic activating mutations in IL7R contribute to neoplastic transformation in B cell and T cell leukemia. In response to lymphopenia, IL-7 accumulates to supranormal levels, which alters T cell homeostasis by augmenting T cell reactivity toward self and cognate antigens. This physiologic response is now routinely exploited to improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapies for cancer. Clinical trials of recombinant IL-7 have demonstrated safety and potent immunorestorative effects, and current studies are investigating whether rhIL-7 therapy can improve outcomes in chronic viral infection and in the context of cancer immunotherapies. Building upon the large fund of knowledge regarding the basic biology of IL-7, this review will discuss the many and varied roles of IL-7 in human health and disease.

Progress in basic, preclinical, and clinical arenas spanning cellular immunology, gene therapy, and cell-processing technologies have paved the way for clinical applications of chimeric antigen receptor-based therapies. This is a new form of targeted immunotherapy that merges the exquisite targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxicity, potential for expansion, and long-term persistence provided by cytotoxic T cells. Although this field is still in its infancy, clinical trials have already shown clinically significant antitumor activity in neuroblastoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and B-cell lymphoma, and trials targeting a variety of other adult and pediatric malignancies are under way. Ongoing work is focused on identifying optimal tumor targets and elucidating and manipulating both cell- and host-associated factors to support expansion and persistence of the genetically engineered cells in vivo. In pediatric oncology, CD19 and GD2 are compelling antigens that have already been identified for targeting pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia and neuroblastoma, respectively, with this approach, but it is likely that other antigens expressed in a variety of childhood cancers will also soon be targeted using this therapy. The potential to target essentially any tumor-associated cell-surface antigen for which a monoclonal antibody can be made opens up an entirely new arena for targeted therapy of childhood cancer.

We sought to determine the feasibility and efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in pediatric sarcoma populations with <25% predicted overall survival (OS). Patients with ultrahigh-risk Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), alveolar cell tumors received EPOCH-fludarabine induction, a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine/melphalan preparative regimen, and HLA matched related peripheral blood stem cells. Thirty patients enrolled; 7 did not undergo alloHSCT because of progressive disease with diminishing performance status during induction. All 23 alloHSCT recipients experienced rapid full-donor engraftment, with no peritransplantation mortality. Five of 23 alloHSCT recipients (22%) remain alive (OS of 30% by Kaplan-Meier analysis at 3 years), including 3 of 7 (42%) transplanted without overt disease (median survival 14.5 versus 29.0 months from alloHSCT for patients transplanted with versus without overt disease, respectively). Among the 28 patients who progressed on the study, the median survival from date of progression was 1.9 months for the 7 who did not receive a transplant compared with 11.4 months for the 21 transplanted (P = .0003). We found prolonged survival after posttransplantation progression with several patients exhibiting indolent tumor growth. We also saw several patients with enhanced antitumor effects from posttransplantation chemotherapy (objective response to pretransplantation EPOCH-F was 24% versus 67% to posttransplantation EOCH); however, this was associated with increased toxicity. This largest reported series of alloHSCT in sarcomas demonstrates that alloHSCT is safe in this population, and that patients undergoing alloHSCT without overt disease show higher survival rates than reported using standard therapies. Enhanced chemo- and radiosensitivity of tumors and normal tissues was observed posttransplantation.

This manuscript reviews principles that guide selection of targets for immunotherapy of cancer, emphasizing the similarities and distinctions between oncogene-inhibition targets and immune targets. It follows with a detailed review of molecules expressed by pediatric tumors that are already under study as immune targets or are good candidates for future studies of immune targeting. Distinctions are made between cell surface antigens that can be targeted in an MHC independent manner using antibodies, antibody derivatives, or chimeric antigen receptors versus intracellular antigens which must be targeted with MHC restricted T cell therapies. Among the most advanced immune targets for childhood cancer are CD19 and CD22 on hematologic malignancies, GD2 on solid tumors, and NY-ESO-1 expressed by a majority of synovial sarcomas, but several other molecules reviewed here also have properties which suggest that they too could serve as effective targets for immunotherapy of childhood cancer.

To maximize the potential of these new technologies, relevant extracellular targets must be identified. The Pediatric Oncology Branch of the NCI curates a freely accessible database of gene expression data for both pediatric cancers and normal tissues, through which we have defined discrete sets of over-expressed transcripts in 12 pediatric cancer subtypes as compared to normal tissues. We coupled gene expression profiles to current annotation databases (i.e., Affymetrix, Gene Ontology, Entrez Gene), in order to categorize transcripts by their sub-cellular location. In this manner we generated a list of potential immune targets expressed on the cell surface, ranked by their difference from normal tissue. Global differences from normal between each of the pediatric tumor types studied varied, indicating that some malignancies expressed transcript sets that were more highly diverged from normal tissues than others. The validity of our approach is seen by our findings for pre-B cell ALL, where targets currently in clinical trials were top-ranked hits (CD19, CD22). For some cancers, reagents already in development could potentially be applied to a new disease class, as exemplified by CD30 expression on sarcomas. Moreover, several potential new targets shared among several pediatric solid tumors are herein identified, such as MCAM (MUC18), metadherin (MTDH), and glypican-2 (GPC2). These targets have been identified at the mRNA level and are yet to be validated at the protein level. The safety of targeting these antigens has yet to be demonstrated and therefore the identified transcripts should be considered preliminary candidates for new CAR and therapeutic antibody targets. Prospective candidate targets will be evaluated by proteomic analysis including Westerns and immunohistochemistry of normal and tumor tissues.

Studies on the immunogenicity and immune responsiveness of pediatric tumors are limited, therefore, it remains unclear to what extent T-cell-based immunotherapy holds promise for pediatric solid tumors.A new rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (M3-9-M) was derived from an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) occurring in a C57BL/6 mouse transgenic for hepatocyte growth factor and heterozygous for mutated p53. Primary tumors and metastases derived from M3-9-M were studied for similarities to human ERMS, and for immunogenicity and immune responsiveness.Primary and metastatic tumors develop after orthotopic injection of M3-9-M into immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, which mirror human ERMS with regard to histology, gene expression, and metastatic behavior. Whole cell vaccination using irradiated M3-9-M cells or M3-9-M-pulsed dendritic cells (DC)-induced tumor-specific T-cell responses that prevent tumor growth following low-dose tumor injection, and slow tumor growth following higher doses. Administration of anti-CD25 moAbs to deplete CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells prior to tumor vaccination enhanced the potency of the ERMS tumor vaccine. Adoptive immunotherapy with M3-9-M primed T cells plus DC-based vaccination resulted in complete eradication of day 10 M3-9-M derived tumors.M3-9-M derived murine ERMS is immunogenic and immunoresponsive; regulatory T cells contribute to immune evasion by murine rhabdomyosarcoma. Adoptive immunotherapy with DC vaccination can eradicate low tumor burdens. Future work will seek to identify the tumor-associated antigens that mediate protective and therapeutic immunity in this model.

SS1P [antimesothelin(Fv)PE38] is a recombinant immunotoxin (RIT) that has potent cytotoxic activity on several cancer cell lines and clinical activity in mesothelioma patients. Pancreatic cancers express mesothelin and are known to be resistant to most chemotherapeutic agents. The goal of this study is to treat pancreatic cancer with RIT by targeting mesothelin.We measured the cytotoxic activity of an antimesothelin immunotoxin on pancreatic cancer cells. We also measured the levels of several pro- and antiapoptotic proteins, as well as the ability of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or the anti-TRAIL receptor 2 agonist antibody (HGS-ETR2) to kill pancreatic cells, and the cytotoxic activity of the two agents together in cell culture and against tumors in mice.In two pancreatic cancer cell lines, immunotoxin treatment inhibited protein synthesis but did not produce significant cell death. The resistant lines had low levels of the proapoptotic protein Bak. Increasing Bak expression enhanced the sensitivity to immunotoxins, whereas Bak knockdown diminished it. We also found that combining immunotoxin with TRAIL or HGS-ETR2 caused synergistic cell death, and together triggered caspase-8 recruitment and activation, Bid cleavage and Bax activation. Combining SS1P with HGS-ETR2 also acted synergistically to decrease tumor burden in a mouse model.Our data show that low Bak can cause cancer cells to be resistant to immunotoxin treatment and that combining immunotoxin with TRAIL or a TRAIL agonist antibody can overcome resistance.

Major topics included immune targeting of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and pediatric solid tumors, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, enhancing graft-versus-leukemia for pediatric cancers, overcoming hurdles of immunotherapy, strategies to active the innate immune system, and moving immunotherapy beyond phase I studies. Significant progress has been made in the last 2 years both in the development of novel immunobiologics such as CARs, and in establishing survival benefits of an anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody in randomized studies. Although there is much excitement going forward, a great deal of laboratory and regulatory challenges lie ahead in improving the efficacy of each of these modalities as well as getting them to patients in a timely and cost-effective fashion. The resulting discussions will hopefully lead to new collaborations and insight for further translational and clinical studies.

IL-7 is a limiting resource under normal conditions, but it accumulates during lymphopaenia, leading to increased T cell proliferation. The administration of recombinant human IL-7 to normal or lymphopenic mice, non-human primates and humans results in widespread T cell proliferation, increased T cell numbers, modulation of peripheral T cell subsets and increased T cell receptor repertoire diversity. These effects raise the prospect that IL-7 could mediate therapeutic benefits in several clinical settings. This Review summarizes the biology of IL-7 and the results of its clinical use that are available so far to provide a perspective on the opportunities for clinical application of this cytokine.

Studies in allogeneic stem cell transplantation highlight an important role for killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) mismatch in overcoming human leukocyte antigen-mediated inhibitory signals. However, other activating and inhibitory signals also modulate tumor lysis by NK cells. We used rhIL15 and artificial antigen presenting cells expressing CD137L and IL15R to activate and expand peripheral blood NK cells (CD137L/IL15 NK) up to 1000-fold in 3 weeks. Compared with resting NK cells, CD137L/IL15 NK cells show modest increases in KIR expression and substantial increases in NKG2D, tumor necrosis factor-related mediate enhanced cytotoxicity against allogeneic and autologous tumors and KIR signaling did not substantially inhibit cytotoxicity. Rather, tumor lysis by CD137L/IL15 activated NK cells was predominantly driven by NCR signaling as blockade of NCRs dramatically diminished the lysis of a wide array of tumor targets. Furthermore, tumor lysis by CD137L/IL15 NK cells was tightly linked to NCR expression levels that peaked on day 8 to 10 after NK activation, and cytotoxicity diminished on subsequent days as NCR expression declined. We conclude that KIR mismatch is not a prerequisite for tumor killing by CD137L/IL15 NK cells and that NCR expression provides a biomarker for predicting potency of CD137L/IL15 NK cells in NK cell-based View details for [DOI 10.1097/CJI.0b013e31820d2a21](https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CJI.0b013e31820d2a21) View details for [Web of Science ID 000287186200008](https://ws.isiknowledge.com/cps/openurl/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:ut/000287186200008) details for [PubMedID 21304401](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21304401) Adoptive immunotherapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes represents an effective treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. The NY-ESO-1 cancer/testis antigen, which is expressed in 80% of patients with synovial cell sarcoma and approximately 25% of patients with melanoma and common epithelial tumors, represents an attractive target for immune-based therapies. The current trial was carried out to evaluate the ability of adoptively transferred autologous T cells transduced with a T-cell receptor (TCR) directed against NY-ESO-1 to mediate tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma and synovial cell sarcoma.A clinical trial was performed with metastatic melanoma or metastatic synovial cell sarcoma refractory to all standard treatments. Patients with NY-ESO-1-positive tumors were treated with autologous TCR-transduced T cells plus 720,000 iU/kg of interleukin-2 to tolerance after preparative chemotherapy. Objective clinical responses were evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).Objective clinical responses were observed in four of six patients with synovial cell sarcoma and five of 11 patients with melanoma bearing tumors expressing NY-ESO-1. Two of 11 patients with melanoma demonstrated complete regressions that persisted after 1 year. A partial response lasting 18 months was observed in one patient with synovial cell sarcoma.These observations indicate that TCR-based gene therapies directed against NY-ESO-1 represent a new and effective therapeutic approach for patients with melanoma and synovial cell sarcoma. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of the successful treatment of a nonmelanoma tumor using TCR-transduced T cells.

Interleukin (IL)-2, the gammac prototype, can mediate antitumor effects as a single agent or in the context of multimodality regimens but is limited by side effects and a propensity for expansion of regulatory T cells. IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 each possess properties that can be exploited in the context of immunotherapy for cancer. Each has been demonstrated to mediate potent vaccine adjuvant effects in tumor models, and each can enhance the effectiveness of adoptive immunotherapies. Although the overlap among the agents is significant, IL-7 is uniquely immunorestorative and reactivity memory cells and natural cells, and IL-21 preferentially expands the inflammatory Th17 subset and may limit terminal differentiation of effector CD8 cells. Clinical trials of IL-7 and IL-21 have already been completed and, so far, demonstrate safety and biologic activity of these agents. Clinical trials of IL-15 are expected soon. Ultimately, these agents are expected to be most effective in the context of multimodal immunotherapy regimens, and careful clinical trial design will be needed to efficiently identify the proper doses, regimens, and settings in which to exploit their biologic properties for therapeutic gain.

Sunitinib diminished hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers, and enhanced Rag1(-/-) increased myeloid and lymphoid engraftment and because sunitinib-treated recipients of purified HSCs showed enhanced engraftment of secondary hosts. However, sunitinib preferentially augmented T-cell engraftment with lesser effects HSC engraftment. this, sunitinib subset in the thymus. Sunitinib did not increase engraftment in mice with deficient KIT signaling, and the pattern of more potent effects on T cell compared with HSC engraftment observed in sunitinib-treated hosts was also observed after BMT into KIT(W/Wv) mice. These results implicate KIT as a critical modulator of thymic niches. We conclude that transient, pharmacologic inhibition of KIT enhances accessibility of marrow and thymic niches, and provides a novel, noncytotoxic approach to accomplish engraftment after stem cell transplantation.

Because IL-15 is presented in trans via its high-affinity IL-15Ralpha-chain to cells expressing the IL-15Rbetagamma complex, we postulated that certain IL-15-bearing cells must be required for NK cell homeostasis. Using IL-15(WT/WT) and IL-15(-/-) mice, bone marrow chimeras with normal cellularity, and a selective depletion of CD11c(hi) dendritic cells (DCs), we demonstrate that ablation of the resting CD11c(hi) DC population results in a highly significant decrease in the absolute number of mature NK cells. In contrast, administration of Flt3 ligand increases the CD11c(hi) DC population, which, when expressing IL-15, significantly expands mature NK cells via enhanced survival and proliferation. In summary, a CD11c(hi) DC population expressing IL-15 is required to maintain NK cell homeostasis under conditions of normal cellularity and also is required to mediate Flt3 ligand-induced NK cell expansion in vivo.

Novel immune-based therapies that target pediatric malignancies offer attractive adjuncts and/or alternatives to commonly employed cytotoxic regimens of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Elucidation of the principles of tumor biology and the development of novel laboratory technologies over the last decade have led to substantial progress in bringing immunotherapies to the bedside.Current immunotherapeutic clinical trials in pediatric oncology and the science behind their development are reviewed.Most of the immune-based therapies studied to date have been well tolerated, and some have shown promise in the setting of refractory or high-risk malignancies, demonstrating that immunotherapy has the potential to overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapy.Some immune-based therapies, such as ch14.18 and MTP-PE, have already been proven effective in phase III randomized trials. Further studies are needed to optimize and integrate other therapies into standard regimens, and to test them in randomized trials for patients with childhood cancer.

Adoptive T-cell transfer has shown definite clinical benefit in the prophylaxis and treatment of viral infections that develop in pediatric patients after allogeneic transplant and in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. Developing adoptive T-cell therapies for other malignancies presents additional challenges. This article describes the recent advances in T-cell-based therapies for malignancy and infection in childhood and strategies to enhance the effector functions of T cells and optimize the cellular product, including gene modification and modulation of the host environment.

However, standard therapies are toxic to normal tissues, cancer cells commonly develop resistance to chemotherapy, and relapsed malignancy is a leading cause of mortality in pediatrics. Elucidation of the principles of the normal immune response and tumor biology, coupled with technological developments, have led to important advances in the field of cancer immunotherapy. This review summarizes the biologic basis of cancer immunotherapy and highlights recent examples of progress in the application of novel humoral and cellular immunotherapies to children and adolescents with malignancy.Clinical trials of immunotherapy for pediatric cancer have recently been initiated. To date, most immune-based therapies have been well tolerated and some have shown clinically significant activity against specific refractory high-risk malignancies.Recent clinical trial results provide proof-of-principle that cancer immunotherapy has the capacity to overcome chemotherapy resistance without the usual toxicities associated with cytotoxic regimens. Immunotherapy holds promise in the treatment of children and adolescents with cancer and has the potential to improve both survival and quality of life.

Based on a large body of preclinical evidence, it may have multiple therapeutic applications in immunodeficiency states, either physiologic (immunosenescence), pathologic (HIV), or iatrogenic (postchemotherapy and posthematopoietic stem cell transplant), and may have roles in immune reconstitution or enhancement of immunotherapy. We report here on the toxicity and biological activity of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) in humans.Subjects with incurable malignancy received rhIL-7 subcutaneously every other day for 2 weeks in a phase I interpatient dose escalation study (3, 10, 30, and 60 microg/kg/dose). The objectives were safety and dose-limiting toxicity determination, identification of a range of biologically active doses, and characterization of biological and, possibly, antitumor effects.Mild to moderate constitutional symptoms, reversible spleen and lymph node enlargement, and marked increase in peripheral CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) lymphocytes were seen in a dose-dependent and age-independent manner in all subjects receiving >or=10 microg/kg/dose, resulting in a rejuvenated circulating T-cell profile, resembling that seen earlier in life. In some subjects, rhIL-7 induced in the bone marrow a marked, transient polyclonal proliferation of pre-B cells showing a spectrum of maturation as well as an increase in circulating transitional B cells.This study shows the potent biological activity of rhIL-7 in humans over a well-tolerated dose range and allows further exploration of its possible therapeutic applications.

The duration of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, < or =500/mcL) during cycles 1 to 4 and cycle duration for all cycles were compared. Pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim and filgrastim and CD34+ stem cell mobilization were studied on cycle 1. Growth factor-related toxicity, transfusions, and episodes of fever and neutropenia and infections were collected for cycles 1 to 4.Thirty-four patients (median age, 20 years; range 3.8-25.8) were enrolled, and 32 completed cycles 1 to 4. The median (range) duration of absolute neutrophil count of <500/mcL was 5.5 (3-8) days for pegfilgrastim and 6 (0-9) days for filgrastim (P = 0.76) after VDC, and 1.5 (0-4) days for pegfilgrastim and 3.75 (0-6.5) days for filgrastim (P = 0.11) after IE. More episodes of febrile neutropenia and documented infections occurred on the filgrastim arm. Serum pegfilgrastim concentrations were highly variable. Pegfilgrastim apparent clearance (11 mL/h/kg) was similar to that reported in adults.A single dose per cycle of pegfilgrastim was well tolerated and may be as effective as daily filgrastim based on the duration of severe neutropenia and number of episodes of febrile neutropenia and documented infections after dose-intensive treatment with VDC and IE.

Previous studies concluded that lymphopenia augments adoptive immunotherapy by diminishing Tregs and increasing homeostatic cytokines. We sought to determine whether targeted therapies that replicate the physiology of lymphopenia in lymphoreplete hosts could provide a similarly supportive milieu. Pmel-1 T cells were transferred to B16-bearing lymphopenic versus lymphoreplete mice receiving alphaCD25 and/or recombinant human interleukin-7. Although CD25-based Treg depletion was inefficient because of peripheral expansion of CD4+CD25-FOXP3+ cells, outcomes were better in alphaCD25-treated lymphoreplete hosts than in lymphopenic hosts, and adoptive immunotherapy was most effective in lymphoreplete hosts receiving alphaCD25 plus recombinant human interleukin-7. Lymphopenic hosts supported increased proliferation of adoptively transferred antigen-specific T cells, but cells transferred to lymphoreplete recipients receiving targeted therapies showed superior function. Further, determinant spreading was substantial in lymphoreplete hosts but absent in lymphopenic hosts. These results demonstrate that targeted therapies delivered to mimic the \"physiology of lymphopenia\" enhance the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy in lymphoreplete hosts and provide a potentially superior alternative to the induction of lymphopenia.

Furthermore, highly metastatic MNNG-HOS cells have increased levels of beta4 integrin. Suppression of beta4 integrin expression by shRNA transfection of revert this highly metastatic phenotype in the MNNG-HOS model without significantly affecting primary tumor growth. These findings suggest a role for beta4 integrin expression in the metastatic phenotype in human osteosarcoma cells. In addition, we identified a previously uncharacterized interaction between beta4 integrin and ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeletal linker protein that is in the metastatic behavior of osteosarcoma. The beta4 integrin-ezrin interaction appears to be critical for maintenance of beta4 integrin expression. These data begin to integrate ezrin and beta4 integrin expression into a model of action for the mechanism of osteosarcoma metastases.

Environmental information received by the DCs determines the co-signals delivered to the responding adaptive cells and, ultimately, the outcome of the interaction. DCs loaded with relevant antigens have been used as therapeutic cellular vaccines, but the optimal antigen loading method has not been determined. We compared different methods to load class I and class II epitopes from the male antigenic complex, HY, onto DCs for the potency of the immune response induced in vivo. Co-incubation of female DCs with HY peptides, RNA or cell lysate from HY expressing tumor induced immune responses equivalent to male DCs. In contrast, female DCs incubated with irradiated, apoptotic HY expressing tumor cells (or male B cells) generated a stronger immune response than male DCs or female DCs loaded using any of the other methods. DC loading with apoptotic tumor resulted in complete protection against high dose HY-expressing tumor challenge whereas 100% lethality was observed in groups receiving DCs that were loaded with peptides, RNA, or lysate. We conclude that signals provided to the DCs by apoptotic cells substantially augment the potency of DC vaccines.

We hypothesized that subclinical graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) impairs immunity, but modulation of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) signaling could reverse this effect. Dendritic cell vaccines and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) were a minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched, T cell-depleted, allogeneic BMT mouse model. Animals were then challenged with H-Y expressing tumors. CD4(+) and CD8(+) responses to H-Y were diminished in vaccinated allogeneic versus syngeneic BMT recipients with DLI doses below the threshold for clinical GVHD, especially in thymectomized hosts. IFN-gamma receptor 1-deficient (IFN-gammaR1(-/-)) T cells cannot cause GVHD but also have diminished vaccine responses. Remarkably, IFN-gammaR1(-/-) bone marrow abrogates GVHD, allowing higher DLI doses to be tolerated, but improves vaccine responses and tumor protection. We conclude that tumor vaccines administered after allogeneic BMT can augment graft-versus-tumor if GVHD is avoided and that prevention of IFN-gamma signaling on donor bone marrow is an effective approach to preventing GVHD while preserving immunocompetence.

Major topics included targeting cell surface receptors, understanding and improving T-cell-based therapies, augmenting innate immune strategies, and enhancing graft-versus-leukemia for pediatric malignancies. As can be seen in the summaries of the individual presentations, significant progress has been made in developing preclinical models of pediatric tumors and a variety of novel immunobiologic therapies are approaching, or already in, the clinic. Although there is much excitement about the potential utility of these agents, a great deal of challenges lie ahead in improving the efficacy of each of these modalities and getting them to patients in a timely fashion.

However, it is not known why CD4(+) T cells undergo less-efficient homeostatic proliferation than CD8(+) T cells do. Here we show that systemic IL-7 concentrations increased during lymphopenia because of diminished use of IL-7 but that IL-7 on IL-7 receptor-alpha-positive (IL-7Ralpha(+)) (DCs) settings paradoxically diminished the homeostatic proliferation of CD4(+) T cells. This effect was mediated at least in part by IL-7-mediated downregulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II on IL-7Ralpha(+) DCs. Our results indicate that IL-7Ralpha(+) DCs are regulators of the peripheral CD4(+) T cell niche and that IL-7 signals in DCs prevent uncontrolled CD4(+) T cell population expansion in vivo.

Although uncommon, the diagnosis of a soft tissue malignancy should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of persistent pain, even if no mass is palpable. The definitive diagnosis and treatment of a soft tissue mass is aided by timely scans, appropriate biopsy for anatomic and molecular pathology, and a treatment approach guided by the specific diagnosis. Because pediatric soft tissue sarcomas are rare, cooperative groups play a crucial role in defining the standard of care through retrospective series and well-designed prospective clinical trials. Enrollment of newly diagnosed patients in clinical studies should be encouraged in order to continue to improve outcomes and understanding of these rare tumors. This review focuses on the current recommendations for management of sarcomas that typically occur in the soft tissues of pediatric and young adult patients.

While part of the problem may be that trials have focused on patients with bulky residual disease, the desire to maximize responses to the vaccine remains. APPROACH: The gamma(c) family of cytokines offer a unique opportunity to support the expansion and effector potential of vaccine-responding T-cells, as well as stimulate other effectors, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to become activated. RESULTS: Combining vaccines with cytokines seems logical but can bring unwanted toxicity, as has been observed with interleukin (IL)-2. In addition, the nonspecific activation or expansion of unwanted cell subsets, such as regulatory T-cells, can contribute to global immunosuppression and limit vaccine responses. The development of IL-7 and IL-21 for the clinic offers the promise of enhancing anti-tumor responses but with far less systemic toxicity and no expansion of regulatory T cells. Preclinical studies demonstrate that IL-15 could also improve T-cell, and especially NK-cell, responses as well. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: Future work should expand the use of vaccines with IL-7, IL-21 and hopefully IL-15 in high-risk patients, and consider treatment while in a state of minimal residual disease to maximize benefit. Identifying tumors that can signal through gamma(c) cytokines will also be essential so that induction of relapse will be avoided.

Monoclonal antibodies that antagonize or agonize immune responses mediated by human NKG2D are considered to be of broad and potent therapeutic utility. Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies to NKG2D that are suitable for clinical investigations have not been published yet. Here, we describe the generation, affinity maturation, and characterization of a fully human monoclonal antibody to human NKG2D. Using phage display technology based on a newly generated nave human Fab library in phage display vector pC3C followed by a tandem chain shuffling process designed for minimal deviation from natural human antibody sequences, we selected a human Fab, designated KYK-2.0, with high specificity and affinity to human NKG2D. KYK-2.0 Fab blocked the binding of the natural human NKG2D ligands MICA, MICB, and ULBP2 anti-human NKG2D monoclonal antibody in immunoglobulin G (IgG) format. KYK-2.0 Fab to in subnanomolar avidity for human NKG2D. KYK-2.0 IgG1 was found to selectively recognize defined subpopulations of human lymphocytes known to express NKG2D, that is, the majority of human CD8+, CD16+, and CD56+ cells as well as a small fraction of human CD4+ cells. In solution, KYK-2.0 IgG1 interfered with the cytolytic activity of ex vivo expanded human NK cells. By contrast, immobilized KYK-2.0 IgG1 was found to strongly induce human NK cell activation. The dual antagonistic and agonistic activity promises a wide range of therapeutic applications for KYK-2.0 IgG1 and its derivatives.

Interleukin-7 (IL-7), the principal homeostatic cytokine for T cells, is required for acute GVHD in murine models. In contrast to inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha), IL-7 has not been studied extensively in the clinical transplant setting relative to its relationship with acute GVHD.We evaluated the association of serum IL-7 levels with acute GVHD in 31 patients who were uniformly treated in a prospective clinical trial with reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT from human leukocyte and methotrexate. Serum IL-7 levels and lymphocyte populations were determined at enrollment, the day of transplantation before the allograft infusion, and at specified intervals through 12 months post-transplantation.As expected, IL-7 levels were inversely correlated with T-cell populations (P < .00001). Acute GVHD was significantly associated with higher IL-7 levels at day +7 (P = .01) and day +14 (P = .00003) post-transplantation as well as with the allograft CD34(+) cell dose (P = .01). IL-7 levels at day +14 also correlated with the severity of acute GVHD (P < .0001). In logistic regression models, these factors were highly sensitive (up to 86%) and specific (100%) for classifying whether patients developed acute GVHD.These data support preclinical observations that IL-7 plays a critical role in inducing acute GVHD and provide a rational basis for novel approaches to prevent and treat acute GVHD through modulation of the IL-7 pathway.

This study administered a novel immunotherapy regimen aimed at consolidating remission in these patients.Fifty-two patients with translocation positive, recurrent, or metastatic Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma underwent prechemotherapy cell harvest via apheresis for potential receipt of immunotherapy. Following completion of standard multimodal therapy, 30 patients ultimately initiated immunotherapy and were sequentially assigned to three cohorts. All cohorts received autologous T cells, influenza vaccinations, and dendritic cells pulsed with derived from tumor-specific breakpoints and E7, a peptide known to bind HLA-A2. Cohort 1 received moderate-dose recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2), cohort 2 received low-dose rhIL-2, and cohort 3 did not receive rhIL-2.All immunotherapy recipients generated influenza-specific immune responses, whereas immune responses to the translocation breakpoint peptides occurred in 39%, and only 25% of HLA-A2(+) patients developed E7-specific responses. Toxicity was minimal. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a 31% 5-year overall survival for all patients apheresed (median potential follow-up 7.3 years) with a 43% 5-year overall survival for patients initiating immunotherapy.Consolidative immunotherapy is a scientifically based and clinically practical approach for integrating immunotherapy into a multimodal regimen for chemoresponsive cancer. Patients receiving immunotherapy experienced minimal toxicity and favorable survival. The robust influenza immune responses observed suggest that postchemotherapy immune incompetence will not fundamentally limit this approach. Future studies will seek to increase efficacy by using more immunogenic antigens and more potent dendritic cells.

In preclinical studies, IL-7 therapy exerts marked stimulating effects on T cell immune reconstitution in mice and primates. First-in-human clinical studies of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) provided the opportunity to investigate the effects of IL-7 therapy on lymphocytes in vivo. rhIL-7 induced in vivo T cell cycling, bcl-2 up-regulation, and a sustained increase in peripheral blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. This T cell expansion caused a significant broadening of circulating T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity independent of the subjects' age as naive T cells, including recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), expanded preferentially, whereas the proportions of regulatory T (T reg) cells and senescent CD8(+) effectors diminished. The resulting composition of the circulating T cell pool more closely resembled that seen earlier in life. This profile, distinctive among cytokines under clinical development, suggests that rhIL-7 therapy could enhance and broaden immune responses, particularly in individuals with limited naive T cells and diminished TCR repertoire diversity, as occurs after physiological (age), pathological (human immunodeficiency virus), or iatrogenic (chemotherapy) lymphocyte depletion.

This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome traits (MST) in long-term survivors of pediatric sarcoma (SARC) who received multi-modality therapy (MMT).Thirty-two SARC survivors (predominantly Ewings; median age 36.5; median age at MMT 15) underwent body composition, activity, and psychosocial analysis. Serum endocrine and inflammatory parameters and urine beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M) were evaluated. The prevalence of MST was compared to age- and gender-matched U.S. population data.SARC survivors were more likely to have two or more MST (OR 2.38 95% CI: [1.14, 5.04]). Analysis of individual MST demonstrated old OR infinity). Survivors 18-39 years old had a higher prevalence of the MS (OR 4.29 95% CI: [1.50, 11.21]), defined as three activity (P = 0.016) and B2M (P = 0.027) increased with increasing numbers of MST. In males, total testosterone declined (P = 0.0027) as the number of MST increased. Average (P = 0.014) and maximum (P = 0.021) activity levels decreased as the number of MST increased.After a median follow up of 17 years, adult SARC survivors of MMT had an increased prevalence of MST, especially those less than 40 years old. The development of MST in this population was associated with decreased testosterone and activity levels.

Among the variety of aAPCs that have been studied, acellular beads expressing anti-CD3/anti-CD28 efficiently expand CD4+ cells, but not T cells. Cell-based aAPCs can effectively expand cytolytic CD8+ cells, but optimal costimulatory signals have not been defined. 4-1BB, a costimulatory molecule expressed by a minority of resting CD8+ T cells, is transiently up-regulated by all CD8+ T cells following activation. We compared expansion of human cytolytic CD8+ T cells using cell-based expand naive cells, anti-CD3/4-1BBL aAPCs preferentially expand memory cells, resulting in superior enrichment of Ag-reactive T cells which recognize previously primed Ags and efficient expansion of electronically sorted CD8+ populations reactive toward viral or self-Ags. Using HLA-A2-Fc fusion 4-1BBL aAPCs, 3-log expansion of Ag-specific CD8+ CTL was induced over 14 days, whereas similar Ag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion did not occur using HLA-A2-Fc/anti-CD28 aAPCs. Furthermore, when compared with cytolytic T cells expanded using CD28 costimulation, CTL expanded using 4-1BB costimulation mediate enhanced cytolytic capacity due, in part, to NKG2D up-regulation. These results demonstrate that 4-1BB costimulation is essential for expanding memory CD8+ T cells ex vivo and is superior to CD28 costimulation for generating Ag-specific products for adoptive cell therapy.

This raises the prospect that metastases derived from such tumors will also evade immunity. To investigate whether immune surveillance plays a role in preventing metastases, we studied a murine model which mimics the clinical progression of osteosarcoma: primary tumor growth in the lower extremity, amputation, minimal residual disease followed by the development of overt metastases. K7M2 implants readily escaped immune surveillance since normal BALB/c mice, T cell deficient SCID and T/NK cell deficient SCID-bg mice showed no difference in the rate of growth of primary osteosarcomas. However, both SCID and SCID-bg mice had higher rates of metastases than immunocompetent mice. Similarly, immune reconstitution following transfer of naive T cells to SCID or SCID-bg mice did not impact primary tumor growth, but significantly diminished metastatic recurrence. T cells in osteosarcoma bearing mice produced IFNgamma in response to tumor and IFNgamma production by immune reconstituting T cells was required to prevent metastases. These results demonstrate an important role for T cell based immune surveillance in preventing metastases, even when metastases develop from tumors that adeptly evade immunosurveillance. The results further suggest that T cell depleting cancer therapies may eliminate beneficial immune responses and that immune reconstitution of lymphopenic cancer patients could prevent metastatic recurrence of solid tumors.

Resistance to TRAIL has been linked to deficient expression of caspase-8 in vitro. Here, we report on the status of caspase-8 expression in tumors from patients with Ewing's sarcoma, the effect of interferon-gamma on caspase-8 expression and apoptosis, and the role and chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis in Ewing's sarcoma. Using immunohistochemistry, we show that low expression of caspase-8 is seen in about 24% of tumors. Interferon-gamma induces expression of caspase-8 at concentrations achievable in humans and sensitizes cells to TRAIL. Transfection of wild type but not mutant caspase-8 into caspase-8-deficient Ewing's sarcoma cells restored sensitivity to TRAIL, indicating that up-regulation of caspase-8 is sufficient to restore TRAIL sensitivity. In contrast, no role for caspase-8 in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was identified, because 1) transfection of caspase-8 or treatment with interferon-gamma did not alter the sensitivity of caspase-8-deficient cells to chemotherapeutics, 2) application of chemotherapy did not select for caspase-8-negative tumor cells in vivo, and 3) the caspase-8 status of tumors did not influence survival after chemotherapy-based protocols. In conclusion, our data provide a rationale for the inclusion of interferon-gamma in upcoming clinical trials with TRAIL.

However, data in children and young adults with cancer are limited.To determine the risk and clinical features of TEs in children and young adults with sarcoma, we reviewed records on 122 consecutive patients with sarcoma treated from October 1980 to July 2002.Twenty-three TEs were diagnosed in 19 of 122 (16%; 95% CI, 10% to 23%) patients. Prevalence by diagnosis was Ewing sarcoma, eight of 61 (13%); osteosarcoma, two of 20 (10%); rhabdomyosarcoma, four of 26 (15%); and other sarcomas, five of 15 (33%). TEs developed in 23% of patients with metastases at presentation versus 10% with localized disease (odds ratio, 2.59; 95% CI, 0.9 to 7.1; P < .06). Fifty-three percent of patients with thrombosis had a clot at presentation. A lupus anticoagulant was detected in four of five evaluated patients. There was a single fatality due to pulmonary embolism. Patients who were diagnosed with cancer after 1993 had a higher rate of TE (7% v 23%; P < .015). Of the 23 events, 43% were asymptomatic. Main sites of thromboses were deep veins of the extremities (10 of 23; 43%), pulmonary embolism (five of 23; vena cava (four of 23; 17%). TEs were associated with tumor compression in eight of 23 (35%) and with venous catheters in three of 23 (13%).Thromboembolism is common in pediatric patients with sarcomas. Thromboses are detected frequently around the time of oncologic presentation, may be asymptomatic, and seem to be associated with a higher disease burden. Children and young adults with sarcoma should be monitored closely for thrombosis.

As elevated IL-7 levels occur in HIV-infected individuals in addition to high Fas expression on T cells and increased sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis, we analyzed whether IL-7 has a regulatory role in Fas-mediated T cell apoptosis. We show that IL-7 up-regulates Fas expression on naive and memory T cells through a mechanism that involves translocation of Fas molecules from intracellular compartments to the cell membrane. IL-7 induced the association of Fas with the cytoskeletal component ezrin and a polarized Fas expression on the cell surface. The potential role of IL-7 in Fas up-regulation in vivo was verified in IL-7-treated macaques and in HIV-infected or chemotherapy treated patients by the correlation between serum IL-7 levels and Fas expression on T cells. IL-7 treatment primed T cells for Fas-induced apoptosis in vitro and serum IL-7 levels correlated with the sensitivity of T cells to Fas-induced apoptosis in HIV-infected individuals. Our data suggest an important role for IL-7 in Fas-mediated regulation of T cell homeostasis. Elevated IL-7 levels associated with lymphopenic conditions, including HIV-infection, might participate in the increased sensitivity of T cells for activation-induced apoptosis.

The study was designed as a prospective, single-arm study. Twelve human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children (median age, 11.8 yr) were enrolled. All subjects received stavudine, nevirapine, and ritonavir. Serial measurements included HIV thymic by computed brain CT. Baseline median CD4(+) T cell count was 589 cells/mm(3) , viral load was 3.9 log(10) HIV RNA copies/mL, and thymic volume was 16.3 cm(3) . Ten children had an undetectable viral load at week 48. Eight maintained an undetectable viral load at 96 wk. The median increase in absolute CD4(+) T cell count was 225 cells/mm(3) by week 48, and 307 cells/mm(3) by week 96. The median increase in naive (CD45RA(+) CD62L(+) ) CD4(+) T cells was 133 cells/mm(3) by week 48, and 147 cells/mm(3) by week 96. The median number of naive CD8(+) T cells increased from 205 to 284 cells/mm(3) by week 24; this increase was sustained to week 96. The number of B cells increased and was associated with a decrease in immunoglobulin levels. The number of natural killer cells was stable. There were no significant changes in thymic volume. Most children exhibited stable cognitive function over the course of the study. We conclude that, in this cohort of relatively immunocompetent HIV-infected children, an initial HAART regimen was associated with rapid and sustained increases in total CD4(+) T cells, in naive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and in B cells through 96 wk.

Median age at the time of therapy was 15.4 years (range 7.1-34.2), median age at the time of analysis was 37.4 years (17.5-55.4), and median duration of time elapsed from completion of therapy was 17.3 years (2.9-32.6). Participants underwent assessments of musculoskeletal functioning, cardiac function, metabolic and lipid analyses, renal and gonadal function, and psychological evaluation.This cohort of sarcoma survivors shows expected locoregional limitations in function of the area affected by sarcoma, and impaired global musculoskeletal functioning as evidenced by limited endurance and limited overall activity levels. The cohort also demonstrated substantial rates of cardiac dysfunction, elevated body fat index, hyperlipidemia, chronic psychological distress, and infertility in men (76%) and premature menopause (49%) in women.Sarcoma survivors demonstrate diminished locoregional and global musculoskeletal functioning which likely limit occupational opportunities and socioeconomic health. In addition, the combination of diminished cardiac reserve, limited activity levels, and lipid dysregulation in sarcoma survivors suggests that this population is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, even many years following completion of sarcoma therapy. Sarcoma survivors may benefit from life long follow-up for cardiovascular disease and from occupational counseling upon completion of therapy.

The hard palate case is the 1st and the adrenal gland the 3rd case of Ewing sarcoma family of tumors arising in these sites, in which the diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR and/or cytogenetics. Accurate diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is crucial for the management of patients, and when found in such rare locations, diagnosis should be supported by immunohistochemical and/or molecular genetic studies.

CD8+ memory T cells, as defined by CD44(hi) surface expression, are dependent on IL-15 as a positive regulator of their homeostatic maintenance. Manipulation of IL-15 signaling through gene aberration, overexpression, or receptor alterations has been shown to dramatically affect T-cell homeostasis, with overexpression leading to fatal leukemia. Here we show that TGF-beta is the critical negative regulator of murine CD8+ memory T-cell homeostasis with direct opposition to the positive effects of IL-15. This negative regulation is mediated, at least in part, by the ability of TGF-beta to modulate expression of the beta-chain of the IL-15 receptor, thus establishing a central axis between these 2 cytokines for homeostatic control of CD8+ memory T-cell populations. These data establish TGF-beta as a critical and dominant tumor-suppressor pathway opposing IL-15-mediated CD8+ T-cell expansion and potential malignant transformation.

As part of a cross-sectional study examining the late effects of pediatric sarcoma therapy, we examined whether psychological distress or posttraumatic stress symptoms are present in an adult cohort of pediatric sarcoma survivors.Thirty-four patients participated in the study, an average of 17 years after their treatment ended, each completing the SCID module for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Impact of Events Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and a questionnaire assessing sociodemographic variables and psychosocial issues.Significant persistent psychological distress characterized this cohort of patients. Seventy-seven percent scored in the clinical range on the BSI. Twelve percent met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Current psychological distress was associated with intrusive thoughts and avoidant behaviors, male gender, employment, difficulty readjusting to work/school after treatment, and enduring worries about health.

During lymphopenia, however, some mechanisms that normally serve to maintain host tolerance are temporarily suspended. Peripheral T cells proliferate in response to self-antigens in lymphopenic hosts, but proliferation toward these same antigens is prevented when T cell numbers are normal. This process, termed homeostatic peripheral expansion, augments peripheral T cell number and limits repertoire skewing during recovery from lymphopenia and also predisposes lymphopenic hosts to autoimmune disease. This paper reviews murine and human settings in which autoimmunity occurs in the context of lymphopenia. We propose a two-hit model, in which lymphopenia plus another insult is sufficient to induce autoimmune disease. Among the secondary insults that appear sufficient to induce autoimmunity during lymphopenia are overproduction of IL-21 as occurs in the NOD.SCID mouse, depletion of Tregs as demonstrated in murine colitis and gastritis models, and tissue inflammation as seen in HIV infected patients who develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Delineating critical cofactors which result in autoimmune disease during lymphopenia can provide insight into the pathophysiology of naturally occurring autoimmune diseases as well as generating testable hypothesis for inducing tumor-specific autoimmunity in lymphopenic hosts with cancer.

However, one major barrier is the delay in immune recovery that can persist for months post-transplant and results in increased susceptibility to infection and relapse of malignancy. Strategies to improve immune recovery must be balanced with the potential for those therapies to exacerbate graft vs host disease. Interleukin 7 is a member of the gammac cytokine family that is required for T-cell development and maintenance of nave T-cell populations. In addition, IL-7 plays a major role in the expansion of mature T-cells that occurs during lymphopenia and therapeutic IL-7 can enhance both quantitative and functional immune recovery following T-cell depletion. Thus, this agent holds much promise as an immunorestorative agent and as an adjuvant to vaccines or adoptive immunotherapy. Clinic trials with IL-7 are underway. Murine studies with IL-7 in the allogeneic transplant have demonstrated that the potent immune effects of this agent can also be achieved in this setting. However, these studies have indicated that the potential for IL-7 to worsen GVHD exists and that this effect may abrogate the immune benefits. Thus, careful consideration of how best to incorporate IL-7 into allogeneic trials will be needed if the full potential of this agent is to be realized.

This report is the first to describe the administration of recombinant interleukin-7 to humans and demonstrates the ability of this cytokine to mediate selective increases in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes along with a decrease in the percentage of CD4+ T-regulatory cells.

In this study, we evaluated the role of the immunoregulatory natural killer T (NKT) cells in the biology of immunosurveillance of osteosarcoma. The K7M2 mouse osteosarcoma cell wild-type and NKT cell-deficient CD1d knockout (KO) BALB/c mice, and mice were monitored for growth of primary tumors. Further, we examined the role of CD4(+) and/or CD8(+) cells by depleting the cells in vivo and measuring CTL activity in vitro. We also asked the role of interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling, including IL-13, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) by using gene-disrupted mice or treating mice with cytokine antagonists. We were surprised to find a high rate of rejection of osteosarcoma primary tumors in 88% (14 of 16) of CD1d KO mice compared with syngeneic wild-type BALB/c mice that showed rejection of tumor in <24% of mice. Further studies suggested that the rejection of tumor in CD1d KO mice was dependent on CD8(+) lymphocytes. Distinct from other murine tumor models, the negative regulation induced by CD1d-restricted NKT cells was not dependent on IL-4Ralpha-STAT6 signaling, including IL-13, or on TGF-beta. These data suggest that a novel CD1d-restricted NKT cell-mediated mechanism for tumor immunosuppression is active in the K7M2 osteosarcoma model and that NKT cells can regulate immunosurveillance through more than one pathway.

If the fusion protein is responsible for the malignant transformation, its expression cannot be lost by the tumor to escape immune responses against this tumor antigen. Here, we identify such a fusion protein breakpoint epitope in the PAX-FKHR fusion protein created by the t(2;13) translocation present in 80% of cases of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, highly aggressive pediatric soft-tissue sarcoma. cells pulsed with breakpoint fusion peptide to raise a human CTL line from a normal healthy HLA-B7+ blood donor specific for this peptide. These CTLs are CD8+ (CD4-CD56-) and CTL lyse human HLA-B7+ rhabdomyosarcoma tumor cells. Therefore, the fusion protein is endogenously processed to produce this natural epitope presented by HLA-B7 and thus this peptide is a bone fide human tumor antigen. We also define a substitution that increases the affinity for HLA-B7 without loss of antigenicity. This epitope-enhanced peptide may serve as a candidate cancer vaccine for HLA-B7+ patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

Mice and humans born lacking T(reg) cells develop severe autoimmune disease, and depletion of T(reg) cells in lymphopenic mice induces autoimmunity. Interleukin (IL)-2 signaling is required for thymic development, peripheral expansion and suppressive activity of T(reg) cells. Animals lacking IL-2 die of autoimmunity, which is prevented by administration of IL-2-responsive T(reg) cells. In light of the emerging evidence that one of the primary physiologic roles of IL-2 is to generate and maintain T(reg) cells, the question arises as to the effects of IL-2 therapy on them. We monitored T(reg) cells during immune reconstitution in individuals with cancer who did or did not receive IL-2 therapy. CD4(+)CD25(hi) cells underwent homeostatic peripheral expansion during immune reconstitution, and in lymphopenic individuals receiving IL-2, the T(reg) cell compartment was markedly increased. Mouse studies showed that IL-2 therapy induced expansion of existent T(reg) cells in normal hosts, and IL-2-induced T(reg) cell expansion was further augmented by lymphopenia. On a per-cell basis, T(reg) cells generated by IL-2 therapy expressed similar levels of FOXP3 and had similar potency for suppression compared to T(reg) cells present in normal hosts.

Following lymphocyte depletion, HC changes in quality and magnitude, resulting in homeostatic peripheral expansion (HPE), a state of widespread T-cell cycling that serves to increase T-cell number and to maintain T-cell repertoire diversity to the greatest extent possible. Recent studies delineating the requirements for HC and HPE have shown that naive CD4+ cells and naive CD8+ cells require both IL7 and TCR engagement for survival, cycling, and homeostatic expansion, whereas CD8+ memory cells are maintained and expanded by cytokine signals alone, independent of TCR engagement. While basal levels of IL15 are sufficient for HC and HPE of CD8+ memory cells, supranormal levels of IL7 will also suffice. The requirements for memory CD4+ cells remain unclear, but current models hypothesize that either IL7 or TCR triggering may be sufficient. Thus, the changes in immune physiology that are present in lymphopenic hosts can be largely accounted for by cytokine-driven signals, especially those rendered by IL7 or IL15. As the alterations in immune physiology present in lymphopenic hosts may be conducive to stronger antitumor immune responsiveness, careful delineation of the factors responsible may be expected to give rise to approaches to augment the effectiveness of current antitumor immunotherapies.

IL-7 is well poised to serve as a homeostatic cytokine because it is produced by resting stromal cells, the IL-7R is present on most T cells, and IL-7 down-regulates its own receptor. These features allow IL-7 to signal large numbers of resting T cells and to be efficiently used when supplies are limiting. Consistent with this, in normal hosts, IL-7 is required for survival of naive T cell populations, and IL-7 contributes to homeostatic cycling of naive and memory cells. In addition, lymphopenic hosts accumulate increased levels of IL-7, and the supranormal levels are largely responsible for inducing homeostatic peripheral expansion in response to lymphopenia. Thus, IL-7 plays critical and nonredundant roles in both T cell lymphopoiesis and in maintaining and restoring peripheral T cell homeostasis.

IL-7 has not been studied, to our knowledge, before now for adjuvant activity. We administered recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) to mice during immunization against the male antigen HY and compared these results with those obtained from mice immunized with rhIL-2 and rhIL-15. Administration of rhIL-7 or rhIL-15, but not rhIL-2, increased effector cells directed against these dominant antigens and dramatically enhanced CD8(+) effectors to subdominant antigens. The mechanisms by which the cytokines augmented effector pool generation were multifactorial and included rhIL-7-mediated costimulation and rhIL-15-mediated augmentation of the proliferative burst. The contraction phase of the antigen-specific response was exaggerated in cytokine-treated mice; however, CD8(+) memory pools in rhIL-7- or rhIL-15-treated groups demonstrated superior long-term survival resulting in quantitative advantages that remained long after the cytokines were discontinued, as demonstrated by improved survival after challenge with an HY-expressing tumor undertaken several weeks after cytokine cessation. These results confirm the adjuvant activity of rhIL-15 and demonstrate that rhIL-7 also serves as a potent vaccine adjuvant that broadens immunity by augmenting responses to subdominant antigens and improving the survival of the CD8(+) T cell memory pool.

In order to clarify the role of combining chemotherapy with aggressive local control using surgery and/or radiation, we reviewed our institutional experience with the treatment of advanced pediatric NRSTS.We reviewed the charts of all patients less than 21 years treated for an advanced NRSTS at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) between 1983 and 2003. Tumor pathology was confirmed and demographic, disease, and treatment data were abstracted. Survival was calculated using standard methods.Of the 25 patients who were treated over the study period, 15 had metastatic disease and 10 had unresectable or incompletely resected disease at presentation. Twenty-one patients received chemotherapy consisting of the combination of vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide, and the remaining 4 received regimens that included doxorubicin. Twenty patients (80%) had a complete (5/25) or partial (15/25) response after chemotherapy alone. After the combination of chemotherapy and local control, 14 patients (56%) had a complete response (CR). The estimated 5-year overall and event-free survival (EFS) for all patients was 0.50 (standard error = 0.11) and 0.34 (standard error = 0.10), respectively.The combination of chemotherapy with aggressive local control in this cohort of pediatric patients with advanced NRSTS yielded results comparable to those observed in patients with advanced sarcomas that are chemotherapy responsive. Prospective randomized trials are needed to quantify the contribution of chemotherapy and to determine the ideal regimen.

The recovery of T cells when this balance is disrupted provides insight into the mechanisms that govern homeostasis. In a long-term, single cohort study, we assessed the role of thymic function after autologous transplant in adults, correlating serial computed tomography imaging of thymic size with concurrent measurements of peripheral CD4(+) T cell populations. We established the age-dependent incidence, time course, and duration of thymic enlargement in adults and demonstrated that these changes were correlated with peripheral recovery of naive CD45RA(+)CD62L(+) and signal-joint TCR rearrangement excision circle-bearing CD4(+) populations with broad TCR diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that renewed thymopoiesis was critical for the restoration of peripheral CD4(+) T cell populations. This recovery encompassed the recovery of normal CD4(+) T cell numbers, a low ratio of effector to central memory cells, and a broad repertoire of TCR Vbeta diversity among these memory cells. These data define the timeline and consequences of renewal of adult thymopoietic activity at levels able to quantitatively restore peripheral T cell populations. They further suggest that structural thymic regrowth serves as a basis for the regeneration of peripheral T cell populations.

Whereas the uncontrolled transfer of a nontolerant donor immune system results in GVHD in many cases, strategies which diminish GVHD also diminish immune reconstitution. Thus, the reliable, rapid and safe transfer of immunity from donor to host remains a major challenge for the field. Advances in the understanding of the biology of immune reconstitution have elucidated that thymic-dependent immune reconstitution can restore global immunity, but is especially vulnerable to toxicities associated with transplant. Alternatively, homeostatic peripheral expansion can be exploited for targeted immunity toward pathogens and tumors, but is difficult to manipulate without exacerbating GVHD risk. New translatable strategies are needed to safely augment one or both of these pathways in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.

Although age-associated involution diminishes thymic reserve and HIV is clearly thymotoxic, clinical trials have nonetheless shown that large proportions of patients who sustain adequate control of viral replication with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) will demonstrate some evidence for thymic-dependent immune reconstitution, which is associated with improved immune competence. Furthermore, patients with insufficient or absent immune reconstitution following HAART generally lack evidence for thymopoiesis. Current studies are focused on improving our understanding of the causes for thymic failure in HIV infection. Recent work has demonstrated that some HIV strains, especially those that are CXCR4 trophic, are more thymotoxic and may contribute to irreversible thymic damage in this population.

To determine the in vivo efficacy of TRAIL receptor agonists in Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors, mice with orthotopic xenografts were treated with anti-TRAIL-R2 monoclonal antibody or TRAIL/Apo2L in a model that can identify effects on both primary tumors and metastases. Administration of either agonist slowed tumor growth in 60% of animals and induced durable remissions in 11 to 19% but did not alter the incidence of metastatic disease. Response rates were not improved by concurrent doxorubicin treatment. Cells recovered from both TRAIL receptor agonist-treated and nontreated tumors were found to be resistant to TRAIL-induced death in vitro unless pretreated with interferon (IFN) gamma. This resistance coincided with a selective down-regulation of TRAIL receptor expression on tumor cells. In vivo treatment with IFNgamma increased tumor expression of TRAIL receptors and caspase 8, but did not increase the antitumor effect of TRAIL receptor agonists on primary tumors. However, IFNgamma treatment alone or in combination with a TRAIL receptor agonist significantly decreased the incidence of metastatic disease and the combination of TRAIL receptor agonist therapy with IFNgamma-mediated impressive effects on both primary tumors and metastatic disease. These data demonstrate that in vivo growth favors TRAIL resistance but that TRAIL receptor agonists are active in Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors and that the combination of TRAIL receptor agonists with IFNgamma is a potent regimen in this disease capable of controlling both primary and metastatic tumors.

T cells are regenerated via a dynamic interplay between thymopoiesis and thymic-independent homeostatic peripheral expansion (HPE). Using athymic mice subjected to T-cell depletion, we observed that HPE is critically dependent on dendritic cells (DCs) for presentation of antigen, raising the possibility that the availability of DCs might be limiting in vivo for HPE to occur efficiently. Indeed, flt3 ligand (flt3L) treatment of athymic mice subjected to T-cell depletion (without DC depletion) substantially enhanced HPE and improved immune competence. Following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in athymic hosts, both dendritic cells and T cells were profoundly depleted and flt3L therapy restored DC numbers and enhanced HPE. In addition, thymus-bearing BMT recipients treated with flt3L regenerated increased numbers of thymic-dependent progeny with increased numbers of T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC)-positive T cells, indicating increased thymopoiesis. Therefore, flt3L is a potent immunorestorative agent thymic-dependent thymic-independent pathways of regeneration.

Understanding whether tumor immune escape primarily represents T-cell neglect, anergy/tolerance, or quantitative limits of an existent immune response is central to developing new strategies to enhance antitumor immunity. The authors studied the immune response to MB49, a tumor that naturally expresses HY. Immune surveillance was effective following low-dose tumor inocula, since normal female mice showed a diminished incidence and slower growth rate of MB49 compared with T-cell-depleted female mice and male mice. Following high-dose tumor inoculation, females developed large, progressive tumors but continued to demonstrate immune responses to class I and class II restricted HY epitopes. The HY reactive T cells remained capable of executing HY immune responses since T cells adoptively transferred from MB49-bearing animals mediated accelerated HY skin graft rejection compared with those taken from naive mice. Thus, MB49 does not induce immune tolerance to HY but rather escapes immune surveillance largely due to quantitative limits of the immune response. Treatment of tumor-bearing animals with rhIL7 significantly increased the number of T cells responding to HY but did not alter tumor growth rate. These results demonstrate that escape from immune surveillance does not necessarily imply immune tolerance to tumor antigens and that immunotherapy need not overcome tumor-induced tolerance per se, and suggest that substantial opportunities remain in tumor-bearing hosts to amplify weak but persistent antitumor immune responses.

Founder line TgA, with the lowest level of IL-7 overexpression, showed enhanced alphabeta T-cell development. In contrast, in the highest overexpressing founder line, TgB, alphabeta T-cell development was disturbed with a block at the earliest intrathymic precursor stage. This was due to decreased progenitor proliferation as assessed by Ki-67 staining and (BrdU) in T-cell-committed progenitors in all Tg lines, and accounted for greater numbers of double positive (DP), CD4 single positive (SP), and CD8SP thymocytes in TgA mice where, in contrast to TgB mice, thymocyte progenitor proliferation was normal. Mixed marrow chimeras using TgB(+) and congenic mice as donors, and experiments using anti-IL-7 monoclonal antibody (MAb) in vivo, confirmed the role of IL-7 protein in the observed TgB phenotype. In conclusion, at low Tg T-cell development survival, while at high overexpression IL-7 reduces their proliferation, inducing a dramatic block in DP production. These results show for the first time in vivo a dose effect of IL-7 on alphabeta T-cell development and have implications for IL-7 in the clinical setting.

Naive CD8+ T cells transferred to lymphopenic mice acquire a memory-like phenotype, raising the possibility that IL-7 is the biological mediator of this effect. Here, we provide direct evidence that IL-7 induces the acquisition of memory-cell markers not only in CD8+ T cells but also in CD4+ T-cell subsets in immune-competent Indian rhesus macaques. The increase of these memory-like populations was dependent on the dose of the cytokine, and these cells were found in the blood as well as secondary lymphoid organs. Memory-like CD4+ and CD8+ T cells acquired the ability to secrete tumor necrosis factor alpha and, to a lesser extent, gamma interferon following stimulation with a cognate antigen. The phenotypic change observed in naive T cells was promptly reversed after discontinuation of IL-7. Importantly, IL-7 induced cycling of both CD4+ and CD8+ central memory and effector memory T cells, demonstrating its contribution to the maintenance of the entire T-cell pool. Thus, IL-7 may be of benefit in the treatment of iatrogenic or virus-induced T-cell depletion.

We have generated TSLPR knockout (KO) mice and found that although these mice had normal lymphocyte numbers, gamma(c)/TSLPR double KO mice had a greater lymphoid defect than gamma(c) KO mice. This indicates that TSLP contributes to lymphoid development and accounts for some of the residual lymphoid development in gamma(c) KO mice and presumably in patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. Injection of TSLP into gamma(c) KO mice induced the expansion of T and B cells. Moreover, sublethally irradiated TSLPR KO mice showed weaker recovery of lymphocyte populations than wild-type (WT) littermates, even when neutralizing anti-IL-7 antibodies were injected. Interestingly, TSLP preferentially stimulated the proliferation and survival of CD4(+) single positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells in vitro. Additionally, CD4(+) T cells from TSLPR KO mice expanded less efficiently than WT CD4(+) T cells in irradiated hosts, and TSLP preferentially expanded CD4(+) T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, as compared with other known cytokines, TSLP is distinctive in exhibiting a lineage preference for the expansion and survival of CD4(+) T cells.

Neuroblastoma cells express platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), stem cell factor (SCF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and their respective receptors, PDGFR, c-Kit, and Flk-1. We therefore evaluated the effects of mesylate (imatinib), a selective inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase of c-Kit and PDGFR, on the growth of neuroblastoma cells in vivo and in vitro.We tested seven human neuroblastoma cell lines for their sensitivity to imatinib. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. Apoptosis was evaluated by nuclear staining, flow cytometry, and western blotting. Protein assays blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunohistochemistry. mRNA expression was assessed by northern blotting. We used a xenograft model in SCID mice (10 mice per group) to evaluate the effects of imatinib oral therapy (50 or 100 mg/kg every 12 hours for 14 days) on neuroblastoma tumor growth. All statistical tests were two-sided.All seven neuroblastoma cell lines treated with imatinib displayed concentration-dependent decreases in cell viability, which coincided with an induction of apoptosis, and with ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Kit and PDGFR. The imatinib concentrations that caused 50% inhibition of growth and 50% inhibition of ligand-induced phosphorylation of these receptors were 9-13 micro M and 0.1-0.5 microM, respectively. Expression of VEGF, but not phosphorylation of Flk-1, its receptor, was reduced in neuroblastoma cells treated with imatinib at 10 microM or higher. Mice treated with imatinib at 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg had statistically significantly smaller tumors than control mice treated with vehicle (mean tumor volume in mice treated with imatinib at 50 mg/kg = 1546 mm3, in = 657 to 2159 mm3; P<.001; mean tumor volume in mice treated with imatinib at 100 mg/kg = 463 mm3; mm3; P<.001).Imatinib inhibited the growth of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition was associated with suppression of PDGFR and c-Kit phosphorylation and inhibition of VEGF expression.

We looked for tumor-specific immunity vs. tolerance in patients with Ewing's sarcoma. Circulating T cells from patients with progressively growing Ewing's tumors displayed MHC restricted tumor-induced proliferation and robust tumor lysis. Tumor-reactive T cells reside within the memory CD3+CD8+ subset are CD28-/4-1BB+. Autologous Ewing's tumors expressed 4-1BBL, and tumor-induced T cell proliferation and activation required costimulation by 4-1BBL. Stimulation of PBL with anti-CD3/4-1BBL, but not anti-CD3/anti-CD28 induced tumor lytic effectors. Similarly, in a xenograft model, anti-CD3/4-1BBL expanded T cells controlled primary growth and prevented metastasis of autologous tumors while nonactivated and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 activated CD8+ cells did not. These results question prevailing models of tumor induced tolerance accompanying progressive tumor growth; rather, we show coexistence of progressive tumor growth and anti-tumor immunity, with costimulation provided by the tumor itself. They further demonstrate a potential new therapeutic role for 4-1BBL mediated costimulation in expanding tumor reactive CTLs for use in the adoptive immunotherapy of cancer.

Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and their receptors (PDGFR) are involved in the induction and proliferation of numerous solid tumors and are the potential candidates for novel targeted antitumor therapy. Since a relation was reported between PDGF-C and EWS/FLI1, we sought to characterize the PDGF signaling pathway in ESFT. Eight out of nine ESFT cell lines were found to express significant levels of beta-PDGFR. Interestingly, none of the tested cell lines expressed alpha-PDGFR, which is the receptor isotype required for PDGF-C binding. By immunohistochemical staining 47 of 52 (90.4%) archival tumor samples from patients with ESFT were positive for beta-PDGFR. ESFT cell lines were treated with PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB ligands to evaluate downstream phosphorylation of PLC-gamma, PI3Kp85 and were detected only in PDGF-BB-stimulated cells that express beta-PDGFR. Receptor function was further evaluated using chemotaxis assays that showed TC-32 cell migration PDGFR kinase inhibitor AG1295 blocked beta-PDGFR activation, downstream signaling, growth in cell culture and chemotaxis of TC-32 cells. AG1295 also delayed tumor formation and prolonged survival in an ESFT animal model. We conclude that ESFT express beta-PDGFR and that this is a functional and potentially crucial signaling pathway. Therefore, beta-PDGFRs may provide a novel therapeutic target in ESFT that can be utilized to design better treatment modalities.

Recent evidence has indicated that IL-7 also plays an important role as a regulator of T-cell homeostasis. Here we report the immunologic effects of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) therapy in normal and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected nonhuman primates. Cynomolgus monkeys receiving 10 days of rhIL-7 showed substantial, reversible increases in T-cell numbers involving a dramatic expansion of both naive and nonnaive phenotype CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets. Although IL-7 is known to have thymopoietic effects in mice, we observed marked declines in the frequency and absolute number of T-cell receptor excision circle-positive (TREC(+)) cells in the peripheral blood and dramatic increases in the percentage of cycling T cells in the peripheral blood as measured by Ki-67 expression (baseline less than 5% to approximately 50% after 6 days of therapy) and ex vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Similarly, moderately CD4- depleted SIV-infected macaques treated with rhIL-7 also had significant increases in peripheral blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells following rhIL-7 therapy. Thus, rhIL-7 induces dramatic alterations in peripheral T-cell homeostasis in both T-cell-replete and T-cell-depleted nonhuman primates. These results further implicate IL-7 as a promising immunorestorative agent but illustrate that a major component of its immunorestorative capacity reflects effects on mature cells. These results also raise the possibility that IL-7 therapy could be used to temporarily modulate T-cell cycling in vivo in the context of immunotherapies such as vaccination.

Here we demonstrate a clinically applicable molecular targeting strategy that not only increases caspase 8 expression ex vivo in NB cell lines but also in the tumor tissues of NB patients receiving IFN-gamma treatment. We identify the functional caspase 8 promoter, which is different from the methylated region reported previously, and show promoter activity is up-regulated by IFN-gamma through a IFN-gamma activation site-containing region. IFN-gamma also induces TRAIL expression in NB cell lines. However, the IFN-gamma restoration of caspase 8 in some NB cells revealed persistent TRAIL resistance in most NB cell lines examined. This additional lesion in the TRAIL path is because of a loss of cell membrane TRAIL receptors (TR1/TR2) not only in cell lines but in most of the NB tumor tissues evaluated. Restoration of TR2 expression by transfection enhances IFN-gamma-induced TRAIL sensitivity. Furthermore, we have found that we can improve TRAIL sensitivity in NB by reconstituting caspase 8 with IFN-gamma and TR2 with chemotherapeutic agents.

In this study, we show that the physiologic lymphopenic environment existing in neonatal mice also supports CD4 T cell proliferation. Strikingly, naive CD4 T cells that proliferate within neonates acquire the phenotypic and functional characteristics of memory cells. Such proliferation is inhibited by the presence of both memory and naive CD4 T cells, is enhanced by 3-day thymectomy, is independent of IL-7, and requires a class II MHC-TCR interaction and a CD28-mediated signal. CD44(bright) CD4 T cells in neonates have a wide repertoire as judged by the distribution of Vbeta expression. Thus, lymphopenia-induced T cell proliferation is a physiologic process that occurs during the early postnatal period.

However, by 12 weeks of age, thymic cellularity had reverted to that of mice deficient in IL-7R alone. The BH3 only proteins, Bad and Bim, were also part of the death pathway repressed by IL-7.

The identification of therapies that can enhance immune reconstitution by increasing thymopoiesis is critical to solving this problem. Interleukin 7 (IL-7) is the most potent thymopoietic cytokine identified thus far. To study the effects of IL-7 on immune reconstitution and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic we administered recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) in a murine parent into an F1 model. Results showed that rhIL-7 therapy lowered the \"threshold\" T-cell dose required to induce both clinical signs of GVHD as well as lethal GVHD. Histologic analysis of GVHD target tissues revealed that rhIL-7 increased the degree of inflammation and tissue damage observed at all T-cell doses studied, but did not change the pattern of organs affected or the histologic appearance of the GVHD within target organs. In addition, we evaluated the capacity for rhIL-7 to enhance thymopoiesis in the setting of allogeneic T cell-depleted (TCD) and T-cell-replete BMT. We thymic function in TCD allogeneic BM transplant recipients, but not in animals that received even modest doses of T cells presumably due to thymic toxicity of the graft-versus-host reaction. Thus, caution must be exercised as IL-7 is developed clinically as an immunorestorative agent for use in the setting of allogeneic BMT. These results suggest that use of IL-7 should be limited to the setting of TCD BMT to obtain the greatest benefit on immune competence with the least toxicity.

Following countercurrent centrifugal elutriation, an apheresis product comprised predominantly of monocytes but containing small numbers of circulating immature dendritic cells was pulsed with peptides derived from the breakpoint region of the fusion proteins. Vaccines were administered intravenously concomitant with continuous intravenous rhIL-2 at 9 x 10(6) IU/m(2)/day.Toxicity was limited to IL-2 related effects and was generally mild. Following vaccination, all patients showed progressive disease, most in a rapid fashion following the first vaccine. One patient showed evidence of an immunologic response and another showed a mixed clinical response. Patients enrolled on this tumor vaccine trial showed significant immunosuppression and large bulky tumors.Peptide vaccination as administered in this trial did not alter the dismal clinical outcome for patients with recurrent pediatric sarcomas. Future trials of tumor vaccines in this population should target patient populations with improved immune competence and smaller tumor burdens.

Furthermore, T-cell-depleted humans have a unique inverse relationship between the peripheral CD4(+) T-cell count and the level of circulating IL-7.

Purging was accomplished using immunomagnetic-based depletion. Monitoring of the function of residual hematopoietic progenitors and T cells was performed using functional assays.MoAb 8H9 shows binding to Ewing's sarcoma but spares normal hematopoietic tissues. Nested real-time PCR is capable of detecting contaminating Ewing's sarcoma cells with a sensitivity of one cell in 10(6) normal cells. After 8H9-based purging, a 2- to 3-log reduction in contaminating Ewing's sarcoma was shown by real-time PCR, with purging to PCR negativity at levels of contamination of 1:10(6). Levels of contamination in clinical samples ranged from 1:10(5) to 10(6). Therefore, 8H9-based purging of clinical samples is predicted to reduce tumor cell contamination to a level below the limit of detection of PCR.These results demonstrate a new approach for purging contaminated cellular products of Ewing's sarcoma and demonstrate the capacity of real-time PCR to provide accurate quantitative estimates of circulating tumor burden in this disease.

Molecular genetic studies have been particularly insightful, revealing genetic rearrangements, such as chromosomal translocations, which may be the seminal event leading to deregulated cell growth for many childhood and adult cancers. These findings have led to new diagnostic and prognostic tools but have been slow to be translated into new therapeutic modalities. This article reviews a variety of methods now under development to exploit genetic changes in cancer to develop specific anticancer agents using gene therapy, viral therapy, and immunotherapy approaches. As many of these strategies inevitably enter the clinic, it will be imperative for health care professionals to be familiar with these novel approaches as they help patients navigate the likely broad array of treatment options.

Recent work also has shown it to potently enhance thymic-independent peripheral expansion and to restore immunocompetence in athymic T-cell-depleted hosts. We hypothesized that endogenous IL-7 could contribute to the restoration of T-cell homeostasis following T-cell depletion. To analyze this, we evaluated circulating IL-7 levels and lymphocyte subsets in multiple clinical cohorts with T-cell depletion of varying etiologies. In pediatric (n = 41) and adult (n = 51) human immunodeficiency virus-infected CD4-depleted patients, there were strong inverse correlations between IL-7 levels and CD4 counts (r = -0.77, P <.0001, and r = -0.68, P <.0001). Declines in IL-7 were temporally correlated with recovery of CD4 counts. Similar patterns were observed in CD4-depleted patients receiving cancer chemotherapy (r = -0.65, P =.009). Therefore, in 2 disparate clinical scenarios involving CD4 depletion, IL-7 levels dynamically respond to changes in CD4 T-cell number, making this cytokine uniquely suited as a candidate regulator of T-cell homeostasis. Furthermore, in patients with idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia, a much weaker relationship between IL-7 levels and peripheral blood CD4 counts was observed, suggesting that an impaired IL-7 response to CD4 depletion may contribute to the impaired lymphocyte homeostasis observed in this population. In light of the known effects of IL-7 on T-cell regeneration, we postulate that increased availability of IL-7 could play a critical role in restoring T-cell homeostasis following T-cell depletion.

In all cases, the diagnosis of this family of tumors was confirmed by histopathologic review.In 58 patients, the presence of a translocation associated with this family of tumors was confirmed using RT-PCR. Specifically, there were 45 Ewing sarcoma (EWS)-FLI type 1 translocations, four EWS-FLI type 2 EWS-ERG translocations, and four less common EWS-FLI variants. Of patients with a confirmed translocation, four were confirmed only after nested RT-PCR techniques were used. In five patients who initially underwent needle biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed only after open biopsy or repeat needle biopsy was undertaken. Samples from 18 patients were translocation-negative. Of these, seven samples were deemed inadequate for RT-PCR testing as a result of inappropriate tissue handling or the presence of necrotic material. Five patients were found to have a different diagnosis after complete histopathologic and molecular characterization. Six samples remained, in which adequate tissue was obtained with no evidence of a characteristic translocation.In apparently translocation-negative samples, close attention should be given to the possibility of an alternative diagnosis, the potential need for nested RT-PCR, and the possibility of an inadequate sample. Strong consideration should be given to the use of open biopsy as opposed to needle biopsy to avoid the need for repeat biopsies and the potential for inaccurate assessment of molecular marker status.

We have studied the expression and functionality of the TRAIL apoptotic pathway in Ewing's sarcoma. We demonstrate that tumors from patients with Ewing's sarcoma express receptors TRAIL-R1 and -R2. Using a panel of nine Ewing's sarcoma cell lines TRAIL could induce apoptosis in seven cell lines. Preincubation with interferon-gamma rendered the two resistant cell lines sensitive. TRAIL was the most potent inducer of apoptosis when compared to Fas ligand or TNF. TRAIL-mediated apoptosis could be inhibited by various caspase-inhibitors. No difference in the surface expression of TRAIL-receptors was observed between sensitive and resistant cell lines. Also, all cell lines had similar levels of expression of Flice-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) on immunoblot. However, the two resistant cell lines had only very low level expression of caspase 8 on RNA and protein level. In summary, we show that Ewing's sarcoma expresses receptors for TRAIL, and that cells are exquisitely sensitive to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. These results may warrant clinical trials with TRAIL in Ewing's sarcoma once the safety of TRAIL for humans has been established.

The degree to which this thymic-independent pathway can restore immune competence remains poorly understood but has important implications for a number of clinical conditions including stem cell transplantation and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A model of HY-mediated skin graft rejection by athymic, TCD mice was used to show that restoration of naive and recall responses via peripheral expansion requires transfer of only 25 x 10(6) lymph node (LN) cells representing approximately 10% of the T-cell repertoire. Constitutive expression of bcl-2 in the expanding inocula restored recall responses to HY at a substantially lower LN cell dose (1 x 10(6)), which is normally insufficient to induce HY-mediated graft rejection in athymic hosts. Interestingly, bcl-2 had no effect on primary responses. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) potently enhanced thymic-independent peripheral expansion and led to HY graft rejection using an LN cell dose of 1 x 10(6) in both primary and recall models. The restoration of immune competence by IL-7 appeared to be mediated through a combination of programmed cell death inhibition, improved costimulation, and modulation of antigen-presenting cell (APC) function. These results show that immune competence for even stringent antigens such as HY can be restored in the absence of thymic function and identify IL-7 as a potent modulator of thymic-independent T-cell regeneration.

Many vaccines are inherently safe and do not require phase I dose finding trials. Patients with advanced cancers and compromised immune systems are not good candidates for assessing either the toxicity or efficacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines. The rapid pace of development of new vaccine candidates and the variety of possible adjuvants and modifications in method of administration makes it important to use efficient designs for clinical screening and evaluation of vaccine regimens. We review the potential advantages of a wide range of clinical trial designs for the development of tumor vaccines. We address the role of immunological endpoints in early clinical trials of tumor vaccines, investigate the design implications of attempting to use disease stabilization as an end point and discuss the difficulties of reliably utilizing historical control data.

These pathways are interregulated such that peripheral T-cell expansion is increased in thymectomized versus thymus-bearing hosts after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This study shows that this interregulation is due to competition between progeny of these 2 pathways because depletion of thymic progeny leads to increased peripheral expansion in thymus-bearing hosts. To test the hypothesis that competition for growth factors modulates the magnitude of antigen-driven peripheral expansion during immune reconstitution in vivo, a variety of T-cell active cytokines were IL-7), IL-2 modestly increased peripheral expansion in the face of increasing numbers of thymic emigrants, whereas IL-7 potently accomplished this. This report also demonstrates that the beneficial effect of IL-7 on immune reconstitution is related to both increases in thymopoiesis as well as a direct increase in the magnitude of antigen-driven peripheral expansion. Therefore, the administration of exogenous IL-7, and to a lesser extent IL-2, abrogates the down-regulation in antigen-driven peripheral expansion that occurs in thymus-bearing hosts after BMT. These results suggest that one mechanism by which T-cell-depleted hosts may support antigen-driven T-cell expansion in vivo is via an increased availability of T-cell-active cytokines to support clonal expansion.

Investigators in the field of tumor immunology are currently utilizing at least three distinct approaches toward this goal. In the first approach, molecular targets of cytolytic T cells which spontaneously develop in tumor-bearing patients have been identified and are subsequently used as immunogens in immunotherapy trials. Whereas this approach originally focused upon the identification of tumor antigens in the immune-responsive tumors malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, it surprisingly led to the identification of a variety of molecules that are now known to be expressed in other common pediatric and adult tumors. In the second approach, tumor-specific molecules (eg, mutant p53 and chromosomal translocations) that have been identified in individual tumors during the study of neoplastic transformation are used as immunogens. Because chromosomal translocations are common in pediatric tumors, such targets may be of particular interest in pediatric oncology. In the third approach, immunization with whole tumor cell components is undertaken with the assumption that the most immunogenic molecules within the tumor will dominate the immune response induced. The benefits and limitations for each approach, particularly as it pertains to the development of immunotherapy for pediatric tumors, are discussed in this article.

In this report, we evaluated immune reconstitution in a series of patients treated with sequential cycles of high-dose chemotherapy, followed by autologous PBPC 7.2 [range 2-29.3]). Although patients experienced rapid reconstitution of B cells and CD8(+) T cells, we observed CD4 depletion and diminished immune responsiveness in all patients for several months after completion of therapy. Mature CD4(+) T cells contained within the grafts did not appear to contribute substantially to immune reconstitution because CD4 counts did not differ between recipients of unmanipulated T-cell replete infusions versus CD34 selected, T-cell-depleted infusions. Rather, at 12 months after therapy, total CD4 count was inversely proportional to age (rho = -0.78, P =.04), but showed no relationship to CD34 cell dose (rho = -0.42, P =.26), suggesting that age-related changes within the host are largely responsible for the limited immune reconstitution observed. These results demonstrate that in the autologous setting, the infusion of large numbers of PBPCs is not sufficient to restore T-cell immune competence and emphasize that specific approaches to enhance immune reconstitution are necessary if immune-based therapy is to be used to eradicate minimal residual disease after autologous PBPC transplantation.

In general, these translocations generate fusion transcription factors. Because cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte receptors recognize peptide fragments bound to major histocompatibility complex Class 1 molecules, it is possible that unique peptides spanning the translocation breakpoint region may be processed, bound to major histocompatibility complex Class I molecules and displayed on the tumor cell surface where they could be susceptible to cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte killing. The authors have investigated the PAX-3-FKHR fusion product seen in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and the EWS-FLI-1 fusion product seen in Ewing's sarcoma. Peptides spanning these fusion regions contain potential major histocompatibility complex Class 1 and Class II binding motifs suggesting they may serve as novel T cell antigens. Preliminary mouse experiments suggest that cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes specific for the PAX-3-FKHR fusion peptide can be generated and can recognize and kill tumor cells bearing the PAX-3-FKHR fusion protein. Clinical trials are ongoing to determine whether this approach will be useful.

Fas ligand expression by tumors has been implicated in the abrogation of the host antitumor response by killing of Fas-positive effector lymphocytes. We have studied the presence and functional status of Fas and Fas ligand in Ewing's sarcoma. All Ewing's sarcoma cell lines tested expressed Fas on their surface. Three of the cell lines were readily killed after ligation of the Fas receptor. Four additional cell lines exhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis after preincubation with IFN-gamma and/or cycloheximide, whereas two cell lines were resistant to Fas-mediated killing. With regard to Fas ligand, all cell lines examined were positive for protein by immunoblot, and specificity was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR. However, using flow cytometric analysis, Fas ligand could only be detected in Ewing's sarcoma cells after permeabilization. Furthermore, the cell lines were not capable of inducing apoptosis of Fas-sensitive Jurkat cells. In addition, Ewing's sarcoma cell lines were able to serve as stimulators for the generation of cytotoxic effector lymphocytes and were susceptible to lysis by them. Therefore, Fas ligand is expressed in Ewing's sarcoma but is not functional, suggesting that Ewing's sarcoma is a potential target for immunotherapy.

In this report, thymic function was studied in aged vs. young adult mice after lethal irradiation and administration of T cell-depleted bone marrow (BM) from young mice. Abnormalities observed in aged thymi (reduced thymocyte numbers, histologic abnormalities) were not reversed by administration of young BM via bone marrow transplantation (BMT), but aged thymi displayed a normal thymocyte subset distribution and appropriately deleted MIs-reactive T cells after BMT. Aged BMT recipients regenerated significantly reduced numbers of splenic T cells compared to young recipients and showed increased peripheral expansion of thymic emigrants since a higher proportion of BM-derived T cells expressed a memory phenotype in aged vs. young BMT recipients. Because peripheral expansion of thymic emigrants could substantially increase the number of thymic progeny present in the spleen, we sought to measure thymic T cell regenerative capacity after BMT in a setting devoid of peripheral expansion. To do this, TCR-transgenic (Tg+) T cell-depleted BM was administered to aged and young recipients lacking antigen specific for the Tg+ TCR. Aged recipients regenerated approximately 50 % of the TCR Tg+ cells regenerated in young BMT recipients, providing evidence that even very aged thymi retain the capacity to regenerate significant numbers of mature T cell progeny. Therefore, thymic function is reduced with aged but it is not lost, suggesting that therapeutic approaches to enhance thymic function may be successful even in very aged hosts.

Recurrent chromosomal translocations are common features of many human malignancies. While such translocations often serve as diagnostic markers, molecular analysis of these breakpoint regions and the characterization of the affected genes is leading to a greater understanding of the causal role such translocations play in malignant transformation. A common theme that is emerging from the study of tumor-associated translocations is the generation of chimeric genes that, when expressed, frequently retain many of the functional properties of the wild-type genes from which they originated. Sarcomas, in particular, harbor chimeric genes that are often derived from transcription factors, suggesting that the resulting chimeric transcription factors contribute to tumorigenesis. The tumor-specific expression of the fusion proteins make them likely candidates for tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and are thus of interest in the development of new therapies. The focus of this review will be on the translocation events associated with Ewing's sarcomas/PNETs (ES), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), melanoma of soft parts (MMSP) (clear sarcoma), desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), synovial sarcoma (SS), and liposarcoma (LS), and the potential for targeting the resulting chimeric proteins in novel immunotherapies.

In humans, recent studies have shown that declines in thymic T-cell regenerative capacity begins relatively early in life, resulting in a limited capacity for T-cell regeneration by young adulthood. As a result, adult humans who experience profound T-cell depletion regenerate T cells primarily via relatively inefficient thymic-independent pathways, resulting in prolonged CD4 depletion, CD4+ and CD8+ subset alterations, limited TCR repertoire diversity and a propensity for activation induced cell death. These limitations in T-cell regeneration have significant clinical implications in the setting of HIV infection and bone marrow transplantation and may also contribute to immunologic abnormalities associated with normal aging. While the mechanisms responsible for thymic aging are not well understood, current evidence suggests that changes within the thymus itself are primary, while age-related changes in marrow T-cell progenitors and inhibitory factors within the extrathymic host milieu contribute to a lesser extent. The development of therapies which can reverse thymic aging are critical for improving outcome in clinical settings of T-cell depletion, and could potentially improve immunologic function in normal aged hosts.

Instead, peripheral mechanisms are generally sufficient to maintain normal T-cell number, function and adequate TCR repertoire diversity in healthy hosts. Studies of T-cell regeneration in animals, however, have shown that full restoration of T-cell homeostasis after profound T-cell depletion is primarily dependent upon thymopoiesis. In this setting, thymic-deficient hosts have prolonged reductions in total T-cell number, restricted TCR repertoire diversity, and limited immunocompetence. In humans, age-related reductions in thymic regenerative capacity as early as young adulthood result in incomplete restoration of T-cell homeostasis after T-cell depletion.

Chemotherapy resulted in a greater than 60% reduction in total CD4 T cells and, in particular, a greater than 90% loss of the CD45RA+ CD4 cells. CD4 recovery was protracted, achieving less than 50% of pretreatment levels after 12 to 14 months. Two facets of the CD4 recovery were notable. First, generation of CD45RA+ CD4 cells played only a minor role in the first year, suggesting that thymic production was not the main route of CD4 regeneration. Indeed, recovery of CD45RA+ CD4 cell levels remained limited in half of the patients even after 2 years. Second, expansion of the mature peripheral CD4 cells (CD45RO+) remaining after chemotherapy was the main source of early CD4 repopulation, peaking at 3 to 6 months postchemotherapy. This expansion was limited in duration, however, and was followed by a secondary decline, such that the total CD45RO+ CD4 levels at 9 to 12 months were lower than at 6 months. When stimulated by mitogens, an increased susceptibility to apoptosis was observed in postchemotherapy CD4 cells as compared with those from normal donors. The elevated expression of markers such as HLA-DR during chemotherapy and for several months postchemotherapy is consistent with the presence of an activated T-cell population. CD4 apoptotic frequency correlated with the frequency of HLA-DR expression on T cells. Thus, CD4 recovery is constrained in adults by a limited thymic regenerative capacity and by an increased susceptibility to apoptosis within the expanding peripheral CD4 population.

Herein, we demonstrate that dendritic cells could be expanded from the bone marrow of -/- mice and littermate controls. Bone marrow from -/- mice also gave rise to LC after transfer into lethally irradiated recipients. Thus, the LC defect in TGFbeta1 null mice does not result from an absolute deficiency in bone marrow precursors, and paracrine TGFbeta1 production is sufficient for LC development. Several approaches were used to assess the suitability of -/- skin for LC localization. A survey revealed that although a number of cytokine mRNAs were expressed de novo, mRNAs to mobilize LC from and TNFalpha) were not strikingly overrepresented In addition, bone marrow-derived LC TGFbeta1 null skin after engraftment onto BALB/c nu/nu recipients. Finally, the skin of transgenic mice expressing a truncated loricrin promoter-driven dominant-negative TGFbeta type II receptor contained normal numbers of LC. Because TGFbeta1 signaling in these mice is disrupted only in keratinocytes and the keratinocyte hyperproliferative component of the TGFbeta1 -/- phenotype is reproduced, these results strongly suggest that the LC defect in TGFbeta1 null mice is not due to an epidermal abnormality but reflects a requirement of murine LC (or their precursors) for TGFbeta1.

Recent evidence indicates, however, that the applicability of conclusions drawn from this model to human BMT may be limited. While mice retain essentially normal thymic function well past sexual maturity, humans show significant age-related declines in thymic function relatively early in life. Therefore, thymic-deficient mice may provide a more accurate model for study of the immunobiology of BMT. T-cell regeneration in thymic-deficient mice occurs primarily via antigen-driven expansion of mature peripheral T cells resulting in limited immune competence due to quantitative deficiencies in T-cell number and severe restriction in the diversity of the regenerated T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Similarly, immune reconstitution in adult humans after BMT is marked by quantitative T-cell deficiencies, especially in the CD4+ subset, and loss of TCR diversity. Taken together, prevailing evidence suggests that thymic function is suboptimal in most BMT recipients, and that thymic-independent pathways of T-cell regeneration are generally limited in their ability to restore host immune competence. New strategies to enhance thymic function in man after BMT would hold great therapeutic potential.

Here we sought to determine whether similar limitations exist for CD8+ T-cell regeneration. After intensive chemotherapy, CD8+ T cells had a faster effective doubling time than CD4+ T cells (median, 12.6 v 28.2 days, P < .05). Accordingly, at 3 months posttherapy, mean CD8+ T-cell number had returned to baseline, CD4+ T-cell number was only 35% of pretherapy values (P < .05). These differences were primarily due to very rapid expansion of CD8+CD57+ and CD8+CD28- subsets. At 3 months posttherapy, there was no relationship between age and CD8+ T-cell number (R = -.02), whereas CD4+ T-cell number was inversely related to age (R = -.66) and there were no discernible differences in CD8+ recovery among patients with or without thymic enlargement, whereas CD4+ recovery was enhanced in patients with thymic enlargement after chemotherapy (P < .01). Therefore thymic-independent pathways of T-cell regeneration appear to rapidly regenerate substantial numbers of CD8+, but not CD4+ T cells, resulting in prolonged T-cell subset imbalance after T-cell depletion. These inherent distinctions between CD4+ v CD8+ T-cell regeneration may have significant implications for immunotherapeutic strategies undertaken to eradicate minimal residual neoplastic disease after cytoreductive chemotherapy.

The contribution of MHC class II antigens to the genesis of this phenotype has been determined by crossing the TGF-beta1-null [TGF-beta1(-/-)] genotype into the MHC class II-deficient homozygous for both the TGF-beta1 null allele and the class II null allele [TGF-beta1(-/-);MHC-II(-/-)] are without evidence of inflammatory infiltrates, circulating autoantibodies, or glomerular immune complex deposits. Instead, these animals exhibit extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis with progressive splenomegaly and adenopathy, surviving only slightly longer than TGF-beta1(-/-);MHC-II(+/+) mice. The role of CD4+ T cells, which are also absent in MHC class II-deficient mice, is directly demonstrated through the administration of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies in class II-positive, TGF-beta1(-/-) mice. The observed reduction in inflammation and improved survival emphasize the significance of CD4+ cells in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune process and suggest that the additional absence of class II antigens in TGF-beta1(-/-);MHC-II(-/-) mice may contribute to their extreme myeloid metaplasia. Thus, MHC class II antigens are essential for the expression of autoimmunity in TGF-beta1-deficient mice, and normally may cooperate with TGF-beta1 to regulate hematopoiesis.

Using a murine bone marrow transplantation model, we present evidence that thymic-independent T cell regeneration occurs primarily via expansion of peripheral T cells and is Ag driven since significant expansion of CD4+ or CD8+ transgenic (Tg+)/TCR-bearing cells occurs only in the presence of Ag specific for the TCR. Such expansion resulted in skewing of the regenerated repertoire with 40 to 65% of the regenerated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells expressing the Tg+/TCR in thymectomized hosts after bone marrow transplantation. In experiments in which nontransgenic population are used as T cell inocula, we noted decreased CD4 expansion when Class II MHC was blocked by mAb treatment in vivo, an CD8 expansion failed to occur in Class I MHC-deficient hosts providing evidence that T cell regeneration in thymic-deficient hosts largely occurs via TCR-MHC-mediated selection of peripheral T cell populations. This process results in a T cell repertoire comprised exclusively of T cells recently activated by the antigenic milieu of the host, with negligible numbers of residual \"naive\" cells bearing TCRs for Ags absent at the time of expansion. These findings have important implications for approached to enhance T cell regeneration in humans and provide evidence that vaccine strategies could skew the T cell repertoire toward a specific antigenic target if administered to thymic-deficient hosts during immune reconstitution.

Breast cancer patients received 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FLAC) followed by either GM-CSF, PIXY321, or no cytokine. Marrow was obtained before and after one or two cycles of FLAC once blood cell counts had recovered. Colony-forming units for granulocytes and macrophages (CFU-GM) were used to indicate the effect of therapy on recovery of committed progenitor cells responsible for early blood cell recovery. The frequency and number of CFU-GM in marrow obtained after FLAC + PIXY321 were significantly lower than in marrow obtained after FLAC+GM-CSF or FLAC without cytokine. CD34+ cell numbers were also reduced after FLAC + PIXY321. CFU-GM production in marrow long-term cultures (LTC) was used to assess the effect of therapy on primitive progenitors. After 5 weeks the number of CFU-GM in LTC of post-therapy marrow from all three treatment arms was < 15% of the number in pre-therapy LTC. Suppressive effects of FLAC on primitive progenitors were observed even when committed progenitors and CD34+ cells had recovered to pre-therapy levels. These results demonstrate that cytokine treatment did not ameliorate suppressive or toxic effects of FLAC on the functional integrity of the marrow.

There are two main possibilities: bone marrow-derived progenitors could reconstitute the lymphocyte population using a thymus-dependent pathway, or thymus-independent pathways could predominate. Previous studies have suggested that the CD45RA glycoprotein on CD4+ T lymphocytes is a marker for progeny generated by a thymus-dependent pathway.We studied 15 patients 1 to 24 years of age who had undergone intensive chemotherapy for cancer. The absolute numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and the expression of CD45 isoforms (CD45RA and CD45RO) on these lymphocytes were studied during lymphocyte regeneration after the completion of therapy. Radiographic imaging of the thymus was performed concomitantly.There was an inverse relation between the patients' ages and the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts six months after therapy was completed (r = -0.92). The CD4+ recovery correlated quantitatively with the appearance of CD45RA+CD4+ T lymphocytes in the blood (r = 0.64). There was a higher proportion of CD45RA+CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with thymic enlargement after chemotherapy than in patients without such enlargement (two-sided P = 0.015).Thymus-dependent regeneration of CD4+ T lymphocytes occurs primarily in children, whereas even young adults have deficiencies in this pathway. Our results suggest that rapid T-cell regeneration requires residual thymic function in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy.

The animals appear normal during the first 2 weeks of life but develop a rapid wasting syndrome and die by 3 to 4 weeks of age. All of the knockout mice have a multifocal inflammatory disease in many tissues. The heart and lungs are most severely affected. Increased adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium of pulmonary veins is the initial lesion seen at day 8 postnatally and is soon followed by perivascular cuffing as well as inflammatory infiltrates in lung parenchyma. The lesions in the heart begin as endocarditis and then progress to myocarditis and pericarditis. Within the lung, chronic inflammatory infiltrates consist of T and B lymphocytes, including plasma cells, whereas macrophages are the primary inflammatory cell type in the heart. Increased expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and II proteins is seen in pulmonary vascular endothelium as early as day 8. An immunoblastic response in mediastinal and mandibular lymph nodes and spleen is also seen. In the absence of any pathogens, this massive inflammatory disease, together with overexpression of major histocompatibility complex class I and II proteins and overproduction of immunoglobulins by lymphocytes, offers circumstantial evidence for an autoimmune etiology.

Because T-cell depletion is associated with similar clinical events in human immunodeficiency virus infection and after bone marrow transplantation, we have analyzed peripheral blood lymphocyte populations in a series of patients during treatment with intensive chemotherapy for cancer. Although neutrophil, monocyte, and platelet numbers consistently recovered to greater than 50% of pretreatment values after each sequential cycle of therapy, lymphocyte numbers did not recover within the same time period. B cells decreased rapidly from a mean value of 149 +/- 46/mm3 before chemotherapy to 4 +/- 1/mm3 during chemotherapy (P = .01). CD4+ T cells decreased from a mean of 588 +/- 76/mm3 before chemotherapy to 105 +/- 28/mm3 during chemotherapy (P = .0002) and CD8+ T cells decreased from a mean of 382 +/- 41/mm3 before chemotherapy to 150 +/- 46/mm3 during chemotherapy (P = .0009). Natural killer cell numbers did not show significant declines (171 +/- 30/mm3 before, 114 +/- 24/mm3 during, P = .19). Based on the history of opportunistic complications in patients with other disorders who display similar degrees of CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia and preliminary observations in this population, immune incompetence could surface as a dose-limiting toxicity for highly dose-intensive chemotherapy regimens.

Associated with this phenotype is a multifocal infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages into target organs, especially the heart, lungs, and salivary glands. To explore the consequences of TGF-beta 1 deficiency on the immune system, lymphocyte phenotype and function were analyzed. Initially, lymphoid organ architecture seemed to be normal and, as symptoms developed, the thymus decreased in size, whereas lymph nodes were enlarged. Phenotypically, the TGF-beta 1(-/-) lymphoid cells seemed to be more differentiated in the thymus and activated in the lymph nodes, but remarkably unaffected in the spleen. Moreover, TGF-beta 1(-/-) spleen and lymph nodes displayed enhanced numbers of proliferating cells, as measured by proliferating cell nuclear Ag and/or cyclin-dependent kinase levels. Consistent with this hyperproliferative response, constitutive levels of IL-2 mRNA were elevated in the thymus and both IL-2 and IL-2R mRNA were increased in the lymph nodes. In contrast with the activation profile of TGF-beta 1(-/-) lymphoid cells in vivo, mitogen challenge of these cells in vitro revealed suppressed proliferation that was associated with a defect in inducible IL-2 mRNA expression and IL-2 secretion. Moreover, the addition of rIL-2 restored the deficient mitogen-induced proliferation. The mechanism leading to T cell anergy remains unclear; however, these data confirm the essential role for TGF-beta 1 in maintaining normal immune function.

LN cell expansion was the predominant source for T-cell regeneration in thymectomized hosts but was minimal in thymus-bearing hosts. Analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) expression on LN progeny showed a diverse V beta repertoire. Therefore, peripheral T-cell progenitors exist within V beta families, but expansion of these progenitors after BMT is downregulated in the presence of a functional thymus.

The perfusate was aerated initially progressive decreases in arterial O2 content (CaO2) were produced in a stepwise fashion by substituting N2 for O2 in the aerating gas mixture. If, for a specified set of experimental conditions, no change in ventricular function occurred after the initial decrease in CaO2, it was concluded that the heart was oxygenated adequately prior to the first CaO2 decrement. Accordingly, with perfusate flow constant at 35 ml/min, adequate oxygenation was achieved during aeration of perfusate with 95% O2 when ventricular contraction rate was 30 beats/min and temperature (T) 22 degrees C. The preparation may have been just marginally O2 sufficient when rate was 60 beats/min (T, 25 or 30 degrees C), but probably was hypoxic when contraction rate was 120 beats/min (T, 30 or 37 degrees C). Perfusion with pressure kept constant at 80 mmHg did not appear to alleviate this hypoxia when metabolism was elevated (rate, 120 beats/min; T, 37 degrees C). Thus, unless the contraction rate is very low, the addition of an O2-carrying vehicle to the perfusate appears to be necessary if O2 delivery to the isolated rabbit heart preparation is to be supramaximal.
