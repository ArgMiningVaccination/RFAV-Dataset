But how do we quiet the screeching monkeys jumping around and chattering non-stop in our heads so we can start meditating? This was me when I first tried to meditate - mind all over the place, trying to focus on my breath but the thoughts kept churning. What am I going to cook for dinner? Breathe in. Did I run out of quinoa? Breathe out. Maybe I could go for a walk later. Breathe in. I should do a Facebook post about the benefits of exercise. Breathe out. And the monkeys kept screaming. I couldn't focus so I gave up. Then I discovered guided meditation. It's the only form of meditation that keeps me on track. Guided sessions vary in length and lead us into a state of relaxed concentration and visualisation. Being in this state enables the mind to become still, clear and reflective. There's no better way to overcome anxiety or a racing mind than by taking the time to practice meditation. The heart rate slows down, blood pressure returns to the normal range and inner peace and calm is restored. And it keeps getting better - the more often you practice meditation, the greater the benefits. It's important to find meditations you enjoy listening to. There's a load of meditation apps on offer nowadays and I've downloaded many, but here's a list of some of my favourites.
