Defective Equipment or Medical Devices Covered Under Warranty We don't pay for defective medical equipment or medical devices under warranty if either of these apply: They're replaced at no cost by the warrantor The patient could get an acceptable replacement at no cost under the warranty but they bought the replacement instead Exceptions When a hospital or other provider replaces defective equipment or medical devices under warranty, we may cover them in situations like these: When a replacement from another manufacturer is substituted because the warranty-offered replacement is unacceptable to the patient or their physician If the warrantor supplied defective equipment or medical devices and they impose a charge or a pro rata payment, we may make a partial payment We limit payment to the warranty amount the hospital or other provider would've paid if they could have purchased an acceptable replacement at reduced price under a warranty, but either of these applies instead: They paid full price to the original manufacturer A different manufacturer or other source purchased a new replacement Advance Beneficiary Notices You must issue an Advance Beneficiary Notice of Non-coverage (ABN) to a patient before providing items or services we usually cover but may not cover in specific situations, like if an item or service isn't medically necessary for the patient. The ABN helps patients decide whether to get an item or service and informs them about their financial liability. We may hold you financially liable if you're required to issue an ABN but you don't issue it to the patient. You don't need to notify a patient before you provide items or services we never cover or aren't a Medicare benefit. But, we recommend you issue a voluntary ABN or similar notice as a courtesy to inform the patient about their financial liability. The Advance Beneficiary Notice of Non-coverage Tutorial shows you how to correctly complete an ABN form, and the Medicare Advance Written Notices of Non-coverage booklet explains the ABN notice types, uses, and timing.MLN Booklet Items & Services Not Covered Under Medicare MLN906765 June 2022 Page 19 of 19Resources Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 6 Medicare Claims Processing Manual Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual Medicare Secondary Payer Manual Section 20.2 of Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 30 Medicare Learning Network\u00ae Content & Product Disclaimer, and Department of Health & Human Services Disclosure The Medicare Learning Network\u00ae, MLN Connects\u00ae, and MLN Matters\u00ae are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS).
