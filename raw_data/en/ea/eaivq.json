The objective of this chapter is to extract from the complex and rapidly evolving eld of immunology the main concepts that are useful to better address these important questions. How do vaccines mediate protection? Disease control or elimination requires the induction of protec-tive immunity in a suf cient proportion of the population. This is best achieved by immunization programs capable of inducing long-term protection, a hallmark of adaptative immunity that contrasts to the brisk but short-lasting innate immune responses. Long-term immunity is conferred by the maintenance of antigen-speci c immune effectors and/or by the induction of immune memory cells that may be suf ciently ef cient and rapidly reactivated into immune effectors in case of pathogen exposure. Vaccine-induced immune effectors (Table 2-1) are essentially antibodies\u2014produced by B lymphocytes\u2014and capable of binding speci cally to a toxin or a pathogen. 1 Other potential effectors are cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes* (CTL) that may limit the spread of infectious agents by recognizing and killing infected cells or secreting speci c antiviral cytokines. The generation and maintenance of both B and CD8 + T cell responses is supported by growth factors and signals provided by CD4+ T helper (Th) lymphocytes, which are commonly subdivided into T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) subtypes* (Table 2-1). These effectors are controlled by regulatory T cells (Treg) that are involved in maintaining immune tolerance. 2 Most antigens and vaccines trigger both B and T cell responses, such that there is no rationale in opposing antibody production ('humoral immunity') and T cell responses ('cellular immunity'). In addition, CD4 + T cells are required for most antibody responses, while antibodies exert signi cant infl uences on T cell responses to intracellular pathogens.3 Which are the main effectors of vaccine responses? The nature of the vaccine exerts a direct infl uence on the type of immune effectors that are predominantly elicited and mediate protective ef cacy (Table 2-2). Capsular polysaccharides (PS) elicit B cell responses in what is classically reported as a T-independent manner*, 4,5 although increasing evidence supports a role for CD4+ T cells in such Claire-Anne Siegrist Introduction To generate vaccine-mediated protection is a complex chal-lenge. Currently available vaccines have largely been devel-oped empirically, with little or no understanding on how they activate the immune system. Their early protective ef cacy is primarily conferred by the induction of antigen-speci c anti- bodies (Box 2-1). However, there is more to antibody-mediated pro-tection than the peak of vaccine-induced antibody titers. The quality of such antibody responses, e.g., their avidity, has been identi ed as a determining factor of ef cacy. In addition, long-term protection requires the persistence of vaccine anti-bodies and/or the generation of immune memory cells capable of rapid and effective reactivation upon subsequent microbial exposure. The determinants of immune memory induction, as well as the relative contribution of persisting antibodies and of immune memory to protection against speci c diseases, are thus essential parameters of long-term vaccine ef cacy. The predominant role of B cells in the ef cacy of current vaccines should not shadow the importance of T cell responses: T cells are essential to the induction of high-af nity antibodies and immune memory, and novel vaccine targets have been identi ed against which T cells are likely to be the prime effectors. New methods have emerged allowing us to assess a growing number of vaccine-associated immune parameters, including in humans. This development raises new questions relative to the optimal markers to assess and their correlation with vaccine-induced protection. The identi cation of immune correlates\u2014 or at least surrogates\u2014of vaccine ef cacy is a major asset for the development of new vaccines or the optimization of immunization strategies using available vaccines. Thus, their determination generates a considerable amount of interest at all levels, from the immunologist working at the bench to the physician wishing to optimize a vaccine schedule for a speci- c patient. The tailoring of vaccine strategies for speci c vulner- able populations, being the very young, the elderly or the immunosuppressed, is also largely relying on a better understanding of what supports or limits vaccine ef cacy under special circumstances. Last, the exponential development of new vaccines raises many questions that are not limited to the targeted diseases and the potential impacts of their prevention, but address the speci c and non-speci c impacts of such vaccines on the immune system, and thus on health in general. These immune-related concerns have largely spread into the population and questions related to the immunological safety of vaccines, i.e., to their capacity of triggering non-antigen speci c responses possibly 18 Section 1 General aspects of vaccination Box 2-1 Main Immunological De nitions Adjuvant: Agents which increase the stimulation of the immune system by enhancing antigen presentation (depot formulation, delivery systems) and/or by providing co-stimulation signals (immunomodulators). Aluminium salts are most often used vaccines. Af nity, avidity: The antibody af nity refers to the tendency of an antibody to bind to a speci c epitope at the surface of an antigen, i.e., to the strength of the interaction. The avidity is the sum of the epitope-speci c af nities for a given antigen. It directly relates to its function. Af nity maturation: Processes through which antigen-speci c B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and af nity-based selection, resulting into B cells that produce antibodies with increased af nity over germ-line antibodies. Antibodies: Proteins of the immunoglobulin family, present on the surface of B lymphocytes, secreted in response to stimulation, that neutralize antigens by binding speci cally to their surface. Antigen presenting cells: Cells that capture antigens by endo- or phagocytosis, process them into small peptides, display them at their surface through MHC molecules and provide co-stimulation signals that act synergistically to activate antigen-speci c T cells. Antigen presenting cells include B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, although only dendritic cells are capable of activating na\u00efve T cells. B lymphocytes: Cells that originate in the bone marrow, mature in secondary lymphoid tissues, become activated in the spleen/nodes when their surface immunoglobulins bind to an antigen and differentiate either in antibody secreting cells (plasma cells) or in memory B cells. Carrier protein: A protein that is used as a template to which polysaccharide moieties are chemically conjugated to generate glycoconjugate vaccines. It is currently considered that carrier proteins provide antigenic epitopes for recognition by CD4 + helper T cells, in particular follicular helper T cells. CD4+ T helper 1 lymphocytes: CD4+ T cells that upon activation differentiate into cells that mainly secrete IL-2, IFN- and TNF- , exerting direct antimicrobial functions (viruses) and essentially providing support to cytotoxic T cells and macrophages. CD4 + T helper 2 lymphocytes: CD4+ T cells that upon activation differentiate into cells that mainly secrete IL-4, IL-6, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, exerting direct antimicrobial functions (parasites) and essentially providing support to B lymphocytes. Central memory T cells: Memory T cells traf cking through the lymph nodes, ready to proliferate and generate a high number of effector cells in response to speci c microbial peptides. Chemokines: Small secreted proteins that function as chemoattractants, recruiting cells that express the corresponding chemokine receptors at their surface and thus migrate towards higher concentrations of chemokines. Costimulatory molecules: Molecules that become expressed at the surface of antigen presenting cells upon activation and deliver stimulatory signals to other cells, namely T and B cells. Dendritic cells: Cells that constantly sample the surroundings for pathogens such as viruses and bacteria, detect dangers and initiate immune responses. Immature patrolling DCs have a high endocytic activity and low T cell activation potential. Contact with a pathogen induces maturation and the expression of certain cell-surface molecules, greatly enhancing their ability to activate T cells.Effector memory T cells: Memory T cells patrolling through the body to detect speci c microbial peptides and capable of an immediate cytotoxic function in case of recognition. Extrafollicular reaction: B cell differentiation pathways that occur outside of germinal centers, in response to protein or polysaccharide antigens. Rapid, it generates B cells that are short-lived (days) and produce low-af nity antibodies, without inducing immune memory. Follicular dendritic cells: Stromal cells in spleen and nodes that upon activation express chemokines (notably CXCL13) attracting activated antigen-speci c B and T cells, and thus nucleate the germinal center reaction. FDCs provide anti-apoptotic signals to GC B cells and support their differentiation into plasma cells or memory B cells. Follicular helper T lymphocytes: CD4 + T cells that upon activation migrate towards follicular dendritic cells and provide a most critical help to germinal center B cells, infl uencing isotype switching, af nity maturation and differentiation. Germinal centers: Dynamic structure that develop in spleen/nodes in response to an antigenic stimulation and dissolves after a few weeks. GCs contain a monoclonal population of antigen-speci c B cells that proliferate and differentiate through the support provided by follicular dendritic cells and helper T cells. Immunoglobulin class switch recombination, af nity maturation, B cell selection and differentiation into plasma cells or memory B cells essentially occur in GCs. Isotype switching: Switch of immunoglobulin expression and production from IgM to IgG, IgA or IgE, occurring during B cell differentiation through DNA recombination. Marginal zone: The marginal zone is the area between the red pulp and the white pulp of the spleen. Its major role is to trap particulate antigens from the circulation and present it to lymphocytes. Regulatory T cells: T cells that upon activation differentiate into cells that express speci c cytokines (IL-10, TGF- /surface markers) and act to suppress the activation of the immune system through various mechanisms, maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance to self antigens. Somatic hypermutation: Process that introduces random mutation in the variable region of the B cell receptor (i.e., immunoglobulin) locus at an extremely high rate, during B cell proliferation. This mechanism occurs through the infl uence of the activation-induced cytidine antibody diversi cation. T lymphocytes: Cells that originate in the thymus, mature in the periphery, become activated in the spleen/nodes if 1) their T cell receptor bind to an antigen presented by an MHC molecule and 2) they receive additional costimulation signals driving them to acquire killing (mainly CD8 + T cells) or supporting (mainly CD4+ T cells) functions. T-independent B cell responses: Differentiation pathway of B cells, mainly elicited by polysaccharides, that takes place in the marginal zone and extrafollicular areas of spleen/nodes. Its hallmarks are to be rapid (days) but to elicit the transient (months) production of antibodies of low af nity, without inducing immune memory. T-dependent B cell responses: Differentiation pathway of B cells elicited by protein antigens that recruits T and B cells into germinal centers of spleen/nodes. Its hallmarks are to be slow (weeks) but to elicit long-lasting (years) production of antibodies of high af nity, and immune memory. Toll-like receptors: Family of 10 receptors (TLR1 to TLR10) present at the surface of many immune cells, which recognize pathogens through conserved microbial patterns and activate innate immunity when detecting danger.19 Vaccine immunology2Chapter 2 responses.6-8 The conjugation of bacterial PS to a protein carrier (e.g., glycoconjugate vaccines) provides foreign peptide antigens that are presented to the immune system and thus recruits antigen-speci c CD4 + Th cells in what is referred to as T- dependent antibody responses*.9,10 A hallmark of T-dependent responses, which are also elicited by toxoid, protein, inactivated or live attenuated viral vaccines (Table 2-2), is to induce both higher-af nity antibodies and immune memory. In addition, live attenuated vaccines usually generate CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The use of live vaccines/vectors or of speci c novel delivery systems (e.g. DNA vaccines) appears necessary for the induction of strong CD8 + T cell responses. Most current vaccines mediate Table 2-1 Effector Mechanisms Triggered by Vaccines /H17039 Antibodies prevent or reduce infections by extra- and intracellular agents and clear extracellular pathogens through : /H17034 binding to the enzymatic active sites of toxins or preventing their diffusion /H17034neutralizing viral replication, e.g. preventing viral binding and entry into cells /H17034promoting opsonophagocytosis of extracellular bacteria, i.e. enhancing clearance by macrophages and neutrophils /H17034activating the complement cascade /H17039 CD8+ T cells do not prevent but reduce, control and clear intracellular pathogens by: /H17034directly killing infected cells (release of killing infected cells through antimicrobial cytokine release /H17039 CD4+ T cells do not prevent but participate to the reduction, control and clearance of extra- and intracellular pathogens IL-2 and IL-3 and supporting activation and differentiation of B cells, CD8+T cells and macrophages (Th1 cells) /H17034producing IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and supporting B cell activation and differentiatio n (Th2 cells) Table 2-2 Correlates of Vaccine type Serum T Hepatitis A killed ++Hepatitis B : polysaccharide VLP : virus-like-particleNote : this table may not be exhaustive and only includes currently licensed vaccines.20 Section 1 General aspects of vaccination their protective ef cacy through the induction of vaccine- speci c antibodies, whereas BCG-induced T cells produce cytokines that contribute to macrophage activation and control of M. tuberculosis. 11 The induction of antigen-speci c immune effectors (and/or of immune memory cells) by an immunization process does not imply that these antibodies, cells or cytokines represent surrogates\u2014or even correlates\u2014of vaccine ef cacy. This requires the formal demonstration that vaccine-mediated protection is dependent\u2014in a vaccinated individual\u2014upon the presence of a given marker such as an antibody titer or a number of antigen-speci c cells above a given threshold. Antigen- speci c antibodies have been formally demonstrated as conferring vaccine-induced protection against many diseases 12 (Table 2-2). Passive protection may result from the physiological transfer of maternal antibodies (e.g., tetanus) or the passive administration of immunoglobulins or vaccine-induced hyperimmune serum (e.g., measles, hepatitis, varicella, etc.). Such antibodies may neutralize toxins in the periphery, at their site of production in an infected wound (tetanus) or throat (diphtheria). They may reduce binding or adhesion to susceptible cells/receptors and thus prevent viral replication (e.g., polio) or bacterial colonization (glycoconjugate vaccines against encapsulated bacteria) if present at suf ciently high titers on mucosal surfaces. 13 The neutralization of pathogens at mucosal surfaces is mainly achieved by the transudation of vaccine-induced serum IgG antibodies. It requires serum concentrations to be of suf cient af nity and abundance to result in 'protective' antibody titers in saliva or mucosal secretions. As a rule, such responses are not elicited by PS bacterial vaccines but achieved by glycoconjugate vaccines, which therefore prevent nasopharyngeal colonization in addition to invasive diseases. Under most circumstances, immunization does not elicit suf ciently high and sustained antibody titers on mucosal surfaces to prevent local infection. It is only after having infected mucosal surfaces that pathogens encounter vaccine-induced IgG serum antibodies that neutralize viruses, opsonize bacteria, activate the complement cascade (Table 2-1) and limit their multiplication and spread, preventing tissue damage and thus clinical disease. That vaccines fail to induce sterilizing immunity is thus not an obstacle to successful disease control, although it represents a signi cant challenge for the development of speci c vaccines such as against HIV-1. 14 Current vaccines mostly mediate protection through the induction of highly speci c IgG serum antibodies (Table 2-2). Under certain circumstances, however, passive antibody-mediated immunity is inef cient (tuberculosis). BCG is the only currently used human vaccine for which there is conclusive evidence that T cells are the main effectors. 11 However, there is indirect evidence that vaccine-induced T cells contribute to the protection conferred by other vaccines. CD4 + T cells seem to support the persistence of protection against clinical pertussis in children primed in infancy, after vaccine-induced antibodies have waned. 15-18 Another example is that of measles immunization in 6-month-old infants. These infants fail to raise antibody responses because of immune immaturity and/or the residual presence of inhibitory maternal antibodies, but generate signi cant IFN- producing CD4 + T cells.19-21 These children remain susceptible to measles infection, but are protected against severe disease and death, presumably because of the viral clearance capacity of their vaccine-induced T cell effectors. Thus, prevention of infection may only be achieved by vaccine-induced antibodies, whereas disease attenuation and protection against complications may be supported by T cells even in the absence of speci c antibodies. The understanding of vaccine immunology thus requires appraising how B and T cell responses are elicited, supported, maintained and/or reactivated by vaccine antigens.From innate to adaptative immunity activation: the rst steps after immunization The induction of antigen-speci c B and T cell responses requires their activation by speci c antigen presenting cells (APC), essen- tially dendritic cells (DC) that must be recruited into the reac-tion. Immature DCs patrol throughout the body. When exposed to pathogens, they undergo a brisk maturation, modulate spe-ci c surface receptors and migrate towards secondary lymph nodes, where the induction of T and B cell responses occurs. The central role for mature DCs in the induction of vaccine responses refl ects their unique capacity to provide both antigen-speci c and costimulation signals to T cells, these 'danger signals' being required to activate na\u00efve T cells. 22 The very rst requirement to elicit vaccine responses is thus to provide suf cient danger signals through vaccine antigens and/or adjuvants* (Fig. 2-1), to trigger an infl ammatory reaction that is mediated by cells of the innate immune system. 23 DCs, monocytes and neutrophils express a set of receptors directed against evolutionarily conserved pathogen patterns that are not contained in self-antigens and thus readily identi ed as 'danger.' Through these receptors, among which Toll-like receptors* play an essential role (Table 2-3), 24 these host cells sense the potential danger when they encounter a pathogen and become activated (Fig. 2-2). They modulate the expression of their surface molecules and produce proinfl ammatory cytokines and chemokines. 25 This results into the extravasation and attraction of monocytes, granulocytes and natural killer cells, and generates an infl ammatory microenvironment (Fig. 2-1) in which monocytes differentiate into macrophages and immature dendritic cells become activated. 26 This activation modi es the expression of homing receptors at their surface and triggers DC migration towards the draining lymph nodes (Fig. 2-2). In the absence of danger signals, DCs remain immature : upon contact with na\u00efve T cells, T cells do not differentiate into immune effectors but into regulatory CD4 + T cells which maintain immune tolerance.2 Live viral vaccines ef ciently trigger the activation of the innate immune system, presumably through pathogen-associated signals (such as viral RNA) allowing their recognition by pattern recognition receptors (Table 2-3). Following injection, viral particles rapidly disseminate throughout the vascular network and reach their target tissues. This pattern is very similar to that occurring after a natural infection, including the initial mucosal replication stage for vaccines administered through the nasal/oral routes. Following the administration of a live viral vaccine and its dissemination, dendritic cells are thus activated at multiple sites, migrate towards the corresponding draining lymph nodes and launch multiple foci of T and B cell activation. This provides a rst explanation to the generally higher immunogenicity of live versus non-live vaccines (Table 2-4). Another consequence of this early diffusion pattern is that the site and route of injection of live viral vaccines are of minor importance: for example, the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of measles vaccine is similar following intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. 27 Live bacterial vaccines, such as BCG, multiply both at the site of injection, where they generate the induction of a prolonged infl ammatory reaction, and at distance\u2014with preponderance for local draining lymph nodes. Non-live vaccines, whether containing proteins, poly- saccharides, glycoconjugates or inactivated microorganisms (Table 2-2), may still contain pathogen recognition patterns capable of initiating innate responses. 28 In the absence of microbial replication, however, vaccine-induced activation remains more limited, both in time and space. Non-live vaccines essentially activate innate responses at their site of injection 21 Vaccine immunology2Chapter 2 (Fig. 2-1). Their site and route of administration are thus more important. The high number of DCs in the derma allows a marked reduction (e.g., 10-fold) of the antigen dose in intradermal immunization, an advantage that is applied to the prevention of rabies in many countries. It however generally results in lower vaccine antibody responses 29, which might be associated to the preferential induction of Th1 responses by skin DCs. Patrolling DCs are also numerous in the well-vascularized muscles, which is the preferred route of injection for most vaccines. They are fewer in adipose tissues, such that subcutaneous injections may be less effective than intramuscular injections under conditions of limited immunogenicity, such as for adult immunization against hepatitis B. 30 Despite many efforts, immunization through the mucosal route is currently limited to a few live vaccines. The extreme dif culty in producing non-live mucosal vaccines refl ects the need to overcome a large number of physical, immunological and chemical barriers, which requires the use of strong adjuvants. 31 This is not trivial, as unfortunately illustrated by the association of a novel adjuvanted inactivated intranasal infl uenza vaccine with Bell's palsy. 32 Following their activation, DCs migrate towards the local draining lymph nodes, e.g., towards the axillary and the inguinal area following deltoid and quadriceps injection, respectively. That primary immune responses to non-live vaccines are essentially focal and unilateral is likely to contribute to the fact that the simultaneous administration of several distinct vaccines may take place without immune interference if vaccines are administered at sites draining into distinct lymph node areas. Most non-live vaccines require their formulation with speci c Ag/AdjAg/Adj AgMuscular tissue Lymph node 54321 Ag Ag AgAgAg Ag Ag Ag Ag Ag AgFigure 2-1 Initiation of a vaccine response. Following injection (1), the pathogen-associated patterns contained in vaccine antigens attract dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophils that patrol throughout the body (2). If vaccine antigens/adjuvants elicit suf cient 'danger signals,' this activates monocytes and dendritic cells (3) which changes their surface receptors and induces their migration along lymphatic vessels (4), to the draining lymph nodes (5) where the activation of T and B lymphocytes will take place. Table 2-3 Recognition of Vaccine Determinants by Pattern Recognition Receptors Receptors Ligands Demonstrated ligands in vaccine antigens Section 1 General aspects of vaccination adjuvants to include danger signals and trigger a suf cient activation of the innate system. These adjuvants may be divided into two categories: delivery systems that prolong the antigen deposit at site of injection, recruiting more DCs into the reaction, and immune modulators that provide additional differentiation and activation signals to monocytes and DCs. 26 Although progress is being made, none of the adjuvants currently in use trigger the degree of innate immune activation that is elicited by live vaccines, whose immune potency far exceed that of non-live vaccines.Germinal centersSpleen/lymph nodes Blood Bone marrow IgGIgG IgA IgG IgA IgA+IgG+Ag 1 2 356 7 48Ag Ag Th BBTfh FDC Figure 2-2 Extrafollicular and germinal center responses to protein antigens. In response to a protein antigen reaching lymph nodes or spleen, B cells capable of binding to this antigen with their surface immunoglobulins (1) undergo a brisk activation. In an ext rafollicular reaction (2), B cells rapidly differentiate in plasma cells (3) that produce low-af nity antibodies (of the IgM +/ IgG/IgA isotypes) that appear at low levels in the serum within a few days after immunization (4). Antigen-speci c helper T cells (5) that have been activated by antigen- bearing dendritic cells trigger some antigen-speci c B cells to migrate towards follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (6), initiating the germinal c enter (GC) reaction. In GCs, B cells receive additional signals from follicular T cells (Tfh) and undergo massive clonal proliferation, switch from IgM towards IgG, IgA or IgE, undergo af nity maturation (7) and differentiate into plasma cells secreting large amounts of antigen-speci c antibodies (8). At the end of the GC reaction, a few plasma cells exit nodes/spleen and migrate to survival niches mostly located in the bone marrow, where they survive through signals provided by supporting stromal cells (9). Table 2-4 Determinants of Primary Vaccine Antibody Responses in Healthy Individuals Determinants Mechanisms (presumed) Vaccine type Live vs inactivated Higher intensity of innate responses, higher antigen content following replication and more prolonged antige n persistence generally result into higher Ab responses to live than inactivated vaccines. Protein vs polysaccharide Recruitment of T cell help and induction of GCs results into higher Ab responses to protein or glycoco njugate than to PS vaccines. Adjuvants Modulation of antigen delivery and persistence (depot or slow-release formulations) or enhancement of Th responses (immunomodulator) may support or limit Ab responses. Antigen nature Polysaccharide antigens Failure to induce GCs limit immunogenicity. Protein antigens Inclusion of epitopes readily recognized by B cells (B cell repertoire), inclusion of epitopes readily recogniz ed by follicular helper T cells, elicitation of ef cient follicular T cell help and the capacity of antigen to associate/ persist in association to FDCs result into higher Ab responses. Antigen dose As a rule, higher Ag doses increase the availability of Ag for B / T cell binding and activation, as well as for association with FDCs. Vaccine schedule Interval between doses A 3 week minimal interval between primary doses avoids competition between successive waves of primary responses. Genetic determinants The capacity of Ag epitopes to associate to a large panel of MHC molecules increases the likelihood of responses in the population. MHC restriction may limit T cell responses. Gene polymorphisms in molecules critical for B and T cell activation/differentiation are likely to affect Ab responses. Environmental factors Mostly yet identi ed. Age at immunization Early life immune immaturity or age-associated immune senescence.23 Vaccine immunology2Chapter 2 Vaccine antibody responses How are primary antibody responses elicited? B cells are activated in the lymph nodes that have been reached by vaccine antigens, upon diffusion and/or in association to migrating DCs. Protein antigens activate both B and T cells, which results in the induction a highly ef cient B cell dif- ferentiation pathway speci c structures (germinal centers, GCs) in which antigen-speci c B cells proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells or memory B cells. Polysaccharide antigens that fail to activate T cells into the response do not trigger GCs, such that they elicit weaker and shorter antibody responses, and no immune memory. T-dependent responses to protein antigens The extrafollicular reaction Na\u00efve B cells generated in the bone marrow circulate until they encounter a protein antigen to which their speci c surface IgM receptor may bind. Antigen binding initiates B cell activation and triggers the upregulation of CCR7, a chemokine receptor that drives antigen-speci c B cells towards the outer T cell zone of secondary lymphoid tissues. 33 At this location, vaccine antigen-speci c B cells are exposed to recently ( <24 h) activated DCs and T cells that have up-regulated speci c surface mole- cules and thus provide B cell activating signals. This T cell help rapidly drives B cell differentiation into Ig secreting plasma cells that produce low-af nity germline antibodies, in what is called the extrafollicular reaction (Figs 2-2 and 2-3). 34 Immunoglobulin class-switch recombination from IgM towards IgG, IgA or IgE occurs during this differentiation of B cells, through the upregulation of the activation-induced deaminase (AID) enzyme. Both CD4 + Th1 and Th2 cells exert essential helper functions during the extrafollicular differentiation pathway, and the engagement of their CD40L molecules with CD40 on B cells may skew class-switch recombination into particular Ig classes and subclasses. In rodents, IFN- producing Th1 T cells promote a switch towards IgG2a, whereas Th2 cells essentially support the generation of IgG1 and IgE (via IL-4) and IgG2b and IgG3 (via TGF- ). 35 The situation is less clear-cut in humans, where IgG1 antibodies frequently predominate regardless of the polarization of T cell help. The extrafollicular reaction is rapid, and IgM and low-level IgG antibodies appear in the blood a few days after primary immunization (Figs 2-2 and 2-3). These antibodies are of germline af nity, as there is no hypermutation/selection process during the extrafollicular reaction. This extrafollicular reaction is short-lived, as most cells die from apoptosis within a few days. Consequently, it probably plays a minor role in vaccine ef cacy. The germinal center reaction Antigen-speci c B cells that receive suf cient help from antigen- speci c T cells proliferate in specialized structures called ger- minal centers (GCs) in which they differentiate into plasma cells. The induction of GCs is initiated as a few antigen-speci c activated B cells up-regulate their expression of CXCR5 and migrate towards B cell follicles, being attracted there by CXCL13-expressing follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). FDCs play an essential role in B cell responses: they attract antigen-speci c B and T cells and capture/retain antigen for extended periods. B cells that are attracted by Ag-bearing FDCs become the found-ers of GCs (Fig. 2-2). Receiving additional activation and sur-vivals signals from both FDCs and follicular T cells, they undergo massive clonal proliferation\u2014such that each GC is constituted by the progeny of a single antigen-speci c B cell. This intense proliferation is associated to two major events: Ig class-switch recombination from IgM towards IgG, IgA or IgE, and maturation of the af nity of B cells for their speci titer *IgG, log10) 0 10d 30d2 3 4 0 30d7d 6mo6 TimeSecondary immune response Booster antigen exposure7 58 Figure 2-3 Correlation of antibody titers to the various phases of the vaccine response. The initial antigen exposure elicits an extrafollicular response (1) that results in the rapid appearance of low IgG antibody titers. As B cells proliferate in germina l centers and differentiate into plasma cells, IgG antibody titers increase up to a peak value (2) usually reached 4 weeks after immunization . The short life span of these plasma cells results in a rapid decline of antibody titers (3), which eventually return to baseline levels (4). In sec ondary immune responses, booster exposure to antigen reactivates immune memory and results in a rapid ( <7 days) increase (5) of IgG antibody titer. Short-lived plasma cells maintain peak Ab levels (6) during a few weeks\u2014after which serum antibody titers decline initially with the same r apid kinetics as following primary immunization. Long-lived plasma cells that have reached survival niches in the bone marrow continue to produc e antigen- speci c antibodies, which then decline with slower kinetics. Note: this generic pattern may not apply to live vaccines trigger ing long-term IgG antibodies for extended periods of time.24 Section 1 General aspects of vaccination This results into the higher production of antibodies of a higher antigen binding capacity (Fig. 2-3). The maturation of B cell af nity results from an extensive somatic hypermutation process within the variable-region segments of immunoglobulin genes. In most B cells, this stochastic process results inadvertently into a decline of the af nity of B cell Ig for antigen. In a small minority of B cells, however, the introduction of mutations in their Ig genes increases the af nity of their surface IgG for antigen. This enables these B cells to ef ciently compete for binding to the small amounts of vaccine antigens that are associated to the surface of FDCs (Fig. 2-2). B cells process these vaccine antigens into small peptides that they display at their surface through MHC class II molecules. MHC-peptides complexes thus become available for binding by a speci c subset of CD4 + T cells, follicular helper T cells (Tfh).36 These Tfh, which express CXCR5, have migrated towards CXCL13-expressing FDCs. Differing from Th1 and Th2 cells by their chemokine receptors, transcription factors, surface markers and interleukins, 36 they are uniquely equipped to provide a most ef cient B cell help through a series of costimulation molecules, including CD40L, ICOS, the IL-10 B cell growth factor and IL-21. 36 The cellular interactions between antigen-speci c GC B cells, antigen- bearing FDCs and antigen-speci c Tfh cells (Fig. 2-2) result in the proliferation, survival and selection of B cells that have the highest possible antigen-speci c af nity. They also provide the signals required for the subsequent differentiation of GC B cells either towards plasma cells secreting large amounts of speci c antibodies or towards memory B cells. The development of this GC reaction requires a couple of weeks, such that hypermutated IgG antibodies to protein vaccine antigens rst appear in the blood 10-14 days after priming (Fig. 2-3). 37 Feedback mechanisms terminate GC reactions within 3-6 weeks, a period during which a large number of antigen-speci c plasma cells will have been generated. It is the magnitude of GC responses, i.e., the quality of DC, B cell, Tfh cell and FDC interactions, which controls the intensity of B cell differentiation into plasma cells, and thus the peak of IgG vaccine antibody reached within 4-6 weeks after primary immunization (Fig. 2-3). T-independent responses to released from the injection site essen-tially reach the marginal zone of the spleen/nodes through the blood, an area that is equipped by macrophages exhibiting a unique set of scavenger receptors. There, PS bind to marginal zone B cells and their repetitive structure cross-links the Ig receptors at the B cell surface. 34 This activates marginal zone B cells in extrafollicular foci (Fig. 2-4).34 During the week follow- ing immunization, B cells differentiate into plasma cells, undergo some degree of isotype switching from IgM to IgG/IgA and\u2014in rodents\u2014rapidly produce essentially low-af nity, germline antibodies. PS vaccines are gener- ally known as triggering T-independent responses character-ized by the induction of moderate titers of low-af nity antibodies, and the absence of immune memory. In humans, PS immunization does generate the production of intermediate-af nity IgG antibodies bearing some somatic mutations in their variable regions. 38,39 The production of mutated antibodies is not expected during a T-independent immune response, as somatic mutations essentially take place in germinal centers (GC). One hypothesis is that PS immunization activates 'memory' B cells that have been previously primed by cross-reacting PS bacterial antigens somehow linked to protein moieties\u2014and thus eliciting GC responses. 40 An alternative possibility is that the IgM+, IgD+, CD27+ 'memory' B cells that appear in the blood in response to PS immunization may be re-circulating splenic marginal zone B cells. 41 These cells would diversify their Ig receptor to a certain extent in the absence of cognate T-B interaction. 41 This hypothesis is concordant with the fact that bacterial PS vaccines are poorly immunogenic in young children, i.e., prior to the maturation of the spleen marginal zone. 42,43 After their differentiation in the extrafollicular pathway, PS- speci c plasma cells move towards the red pulp of the spleen (Fig. 2-4) where they persist for some time, prior to their death by apoptosis and the waning of corresponding antibody responses after a few months. As PS antigens do not induce GCs, bona de memory B cells are not elicited. Consequently, subsequent re-exposure to the same PS results into a repeat primary response that follows the same kinetics in previously vaccinated as in na\u00efve individuals. 44 Revaccination with certain bacterial PS\u2014of which group C N. meningitidis is a prototype\u2014 may even induce lower antibody responses than the rst immunization, a phenomenon referred to as hyporesponsiveness and whose molecular and cellular bases are not yet fully understood. 45,46 Which are the determinants of primary vaccine antibody responses? Numerous determinants modulate the intensity of vaccine- induced GCs\u2014and thus of peak antibody responses (Table 2-5). The main determinants are the nature of the vaccine antigen Spleen/lymph nodes IgMIgM+ IgG+ IgA+IgG+ IgA+1PS to polysaccharide antigens. B cells use their speci c Ig surface receptors (1) to bind to the repetitive structures of polysaccharides reaching the marginal zone of spleen/nodes. In the absence of antigen-speci c T cell help, B cells are activated, proliferate (2) and differentiate in plasma cells (3) without undergoing af nity maturation in germinal centers. These plasma cells migrate towards the red pulp of the spleen (4) where they survive for a few weeks / months, secreting low levels of low af nity IgM, IgG or IgA antibodies (5).25 Vaccine immunology2Chapter 2 and its intrinsic immunogenicity. As an example, tetanus toxoid is intrinsically a stronger immunogen than diphtheria toxoid, which becomes apparent when immunocompetence is more limited, such as in preterm infants. 47 Whether this refl ects a higher capacity of tetanus toxoid to provide antigenic epitopes that may be bound by na\u00efve B cells, to generate cognate T cell help for B cells, and/or to associate to FDCs is unknown. The drastically distinct outcomes of immunization with plain bacterial PS or with protein-conjugated glycoconjugates highlight the differences between the extrafollicular and the GC reactions. It is only when capsular PS are conjugated to a protein carrier driving effective Th differentiation that PS-speci c B cells are driven towards GC responses, receive optimal cognate help from carrier-speci c Tfh cells and differentiate into higher- af nity antibody producing cells, longer-lived plasma cells and/or memory B cells. Protein antigens exhibit markedly distinct carrier properties\u2014regardless of their capacity to induce B and Th cell responses. 48 That these differences may refl ect differences in Tfh induction is an interesting hypothesis which is supported by the enhanced immunogenicity of a synthetic polyepitope carrier containing optimal Th epitopes. 49 The limited number of potent carrier proteins implies that an increasing number of conjugate vaccines rely on the same molecules (e.g., CRM 197, tetanus or diphtheria toxoids), with the risk of limiting anti-PS responses to individual conjugate vaccines (carrier-mediated epitope suppression). 50 This phenomenon may be abrogated by replacing full-length proteins by peptides lacking B-cell epitopes, 51 suggesting that carrier-mediated epitope suppression essentially refl ects the competition of carrier- and PS-speci c B cells for activation/ differentiation signals and factors. Another determinant of the magnitude of primary vaccine antibody responses (Table 2-5) is the use of an optimal dose of vaccine antigen, which may only be experimentally determined. As a rule, higher doses of non-live antigens\u2014up to a certain threshold\u2014elicit higher primary antibody responses. This may be particularly useful when immunocompetence is limited, e.g., for hepatitis B immunization of dialysis patients. 52,53 Remarkably, a limiting dose of vaccine antigen may restrict primary antibody responses but increase B cell competition for FDC-associated antigens, and thus result into a more stringent selection of higher af nity GC B cells and into stronger secondary responses (see below). Little is yet known on factors which support or limit the af nity maturation process. Interestingly, carrier proteins 54 and adjuvants may modulate the af nity maturation process, as recently observed following the addition of CpG oligonucleotides to an alum-adsorbed hepatitis B vaccine.55 The nature of the vaccine directly infl uences the activation of innate immunity and thus vaccine responses.26 The strongest antibody responses are generally elicited by live vaccines that better activate innate reactions and thus better support the induction of adaptative immune effectors. Non-live vaccines frequently require formulation in adjuvants, of which aluminum salts are particularly potent enhancers of antibody responses, and thus included in a majority of currently available vaccines. This is likely to refl ect their formation of a deposit from which antigen is slowly de-absorbed and released, extending the duration of B and T cell activation, as well as the preferential induction of IL-4 by aluminum-exposed macrophages. 56 Genetic determinants directly infl uence the vaccine antibody responses of healthy individuals, as exempli ed by twin studies.57-61 Apart from MHC restriction, few genetic determinants of vaccine antibody responses have yet been identi ed. 58 Immune competence obviously affects vaccine antibody responses, which are limited at the two extremes of life (see below), by acute or chronic diseases, by acute or chronic stress and by a variety of factors affecting innate and/or B and T cell immunity. Very few non-live vaccines induce high and sustained antibody responses after a single vaccine dose, even in healthy young adults. Primary immunization schedules therefore usually include at least two vaccine doses, optimally repeated at a minimal interval of 3-4 weeks to generate successive waves of B cell and GC responses. These priming doses may occasionally be combined into a single 'double' dose, such as for hepatitis A or B immunization. 62,63 In any case, however, vaccine antibodies elicited by primary immunization with non-live vaccines eventually wane (Fig. 2-3). What controls the persistence of vaccine antibody responses? Antigen-speci c plasma cells elicited in spleen/nodes after immunization only have a short life span, such that vaccine antibodies rapidly decline during the rst few weeks and months after immunization. A fraction of plasma cells that dif-ferentiated into GCs however acquire the capacity to migrate towards long-term survival niches mostly located within the bone marrow (BM), from where they may produce vaccine anti-bodies during extended periods. 64 Some GC-induced plasma cells are attracted toward the BM compartment by speci c BM stromal cells that provide the Table 2-5 Determinants of the Duration of Vaccine Antibody Responses in Healthy Individuals Determinants Mechanisms (presumed) Vaccine type Live vs inactivated Live vaccines generally induce more sustained Ab responses, presumably through Ag persistence within the host. Polysaccharide antigens Failure to generate GCs limits the induction of memory responses and of high-af nity long-live plasma cells. Vaccine schedule Interval between primary doses A minimal interval of 3 weeks between primary doses allows development of successive waves of Ag- speci c primary responses without interference. Interval before boosting A minimal interval of 4 months between priming and boosting allows af nity maturation of memory B cells, and thus higher secondary responses. Age at immunization Early life immune immaturity and age-associated immunosenescence limit the induction/persistence of long-live plasma cells Environmental factors ?26 Section 1 General aspects of vaccination signals required for their long-term survival.65 In such BM niches, plasma cell survival and antibody production may persist for years. Whether the persistence of vaccine-induced plasma cells refl ects the long-term persistence of the plasma cells that were initially generated, or the maintenance of a BM reservoir of plasma cells through homeostatic mechanisms, is yet unde ned. 66 Regardless of the exact mechanisms supporting BM plasma cell survival, the duration of antibody responses is proportional to the number of long-lived plasma cells generated by immunization: in absence of subsequent antigen exposure, antibody persistence may be reliably predicted by the antibody titers that are reached 6-12 months after immunization, i.e. after the end of the short-term plasma cell response (Fig. 2-3). This is illustrated by the accuracy of mathematical models predicting the kinetics of anti-HBsAg 67 or anti-hepatitis A68 antibodies. A few determinants of the persistence of vaccine antibody responses (Table 2-5) have been identi ed.66 The nature of the vaccine plays a crucial role: only live attenuated viral vaccines induce antibody responses that persist for several decades, if not life-long, in absence of subsequent antigen exposure and reactivation of immune memory. This could refl ect the in vivo persistence of viral antigens that continuously trigger B cell responses, although other mechanisms may be at play. In contrast, the shortest antibody responses are elicited by PS antigens, which fail to trigger GC responses and thus do not elicit high-af nity plasma cells capable of reaching the BM survival niches. Vaccine schedules also control antibody magnitude and persistence. Closely spaced (1-2 weeks) primary vaccine doses may be administered when a rapid induction of protection is desirable, e.g., prior to travel. However, this raises less persisting responses than when the same number of vaccine doses are given at longer (1-2 months) intervals, 69,70 refl ecting the generation of fewer post-GC B cells capable of long-term survival and thus requiring later boosting. Age at immunization also modulates vaccine antibody persistence, which is shorter at the two extremes of life (see below). Certain disease conditions may also limit the persistence of vaccine antibody responses because of an enhanced catabolism (malaria) or the loss of antibodies in the urinary or digestive tracts. An interesting recent observation is that human immunization with tetanus toxoid results into a transient release of resident BM plasma cells into the blood, 71 suggesting the existence of a competition for BM survival niches between newly induced and BM resident plasma cells. The identi cation of the mechanisms that support or limit the persistence of vaccine antibody responses represents a major challenge for vaccinologists, as resources are lacking for most immunization programs throughout the world to include the booster doses otherwise required to maintain vaccine ef cacy. Which are the hallmarks of B cell memory responses? Memory B cells are generated during primary responses to T- dependent vaccines. They do not produce antibodies, i.e., do not protect, unless re-exposure to antigen drives their differen-tiation into antibody producing plasma cells. This reactivation is a rapid process, such that booster responses are characterized by the rapid increase to higher titers of antibodies that have a higher af nity for antigen than antibodies generated during primary responses (Table 2-6). With the possible exception of responses to live viral vaccines, vaccine antibody responses are deemed to wane and eventually decline below protective thresholds, unless repeat antigen exposure reactivates immune memory. Memory B cells are generated in response to T-dependent antigens, during the GC reaction, in parallel to plasma cells (Fig. 2-5). At their exit of GCs, memory B cells acquire migration properties towards extrafollicular areas of the spleen and nodes. 72 This migration occurs through the blood, in which post-immunization memory B cells are transiently present on their way towards lymphoid organs. It is essential to understand that memory B cells do not produce antibodies\u2014i.e., they do not protect. Their participation to vaccine ef cacy requires an antigen-driven proliferation and differentiation process. 72 This reactivation may occur in response to endemic or frequent pathogens, to colonizing or cross-reacting microorganisms ('natural boosters'), or to booster immunization. The antigen-driven activation of memory B cells results in their rapid proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells that produce very large amounts of higher-af nity antibodies. 72 As the af nity of surface Ig from memory B cells is increased, their requirements for reactivation are lower Table 2-6 Hallmarks of Memory B cell Responses Are only generated during T-dependent responses inducing GC responses. Memory B cells are resting cells that do not produce antibodies. Memory B cells undergo af nity maturation during several (4-6) months. Memory B cells rapidly (days) differentiate into antibody- secreting plasma cells upon re-exposure to antigen. Memory B cells differentiate into PCs that produce high(er) af nity antibodies than primary plasma cells. Blood Secondary responsePrimary response IgG IgG FDC BB BFigure 2-5 Generation of B cell memory responses. Memory B cells are generated in response to T-dependent antigens (1), during the GC reaction (2), in parallel to plasma cells. At their exit of GCs, these B cells do not differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells but in memory B cells (3) that transiently migrate through the blood (4) towards the extrafollicular areas of spleen and nodes (5). They persist there as resting cells until re-exposed to their speci c antigens (6). Upon secondary antigen exposure, memory B cells readily proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells (7) secreting large amounts of high-af nity antibodies that may be detected in the serum (8) within a few days after boosting.27 Vaccine immunology2Chapter 2 than for na\u00efve B cells: memory B cells may thus be recalled by lower amounts of antigen and without CD4+ T cell help. Antigen-speci c memory cells generated by primary immuniza- tion are much more numerous (and better t) than na\u00efve B cells initially capable of antigen recognition. Thus, a rst hallmark of memory responses (Table 2-6) is to generate signi cantly higher antibody levels than primary immunization. Should this not be the case, the effective generation of memory B cells should be questioned. 72 The reactivation, proliferation and differentiation of memory B cells occur without requiring the induction and development of GC responses. This process is thus much more rapidly completed than that of primary responses. A window of 4-7 days after Haemophilus infl uenzae b PS immunization was reported as suf cient for high levels of PS-speci c vaccine antibodies to appear in the blood of previously primed infants. 73 The rapidity with which antigen-speci c antibodies appear in the serum is thus another hallmark of secondary responses (Table 2-6). Slower kinetics suggests that memory B cell induction, persistence and/or reactivation may have been suboptimal. Another hallmark of memory B cells is to display and secrete antibodies with a markedly higher af nity than those produced by primary plasma cells, as a result of somatic hypermutation and selection. 72 The af nity maturation process which is initiated within the GCs extends during several months after the end of the GC reaction. Consequently, vaccine antibodies with higher than baseline avidity (de ned as the sum of epitope-speci c af nities) for antigen are only induced when suf cient time has elapsed after priming. 62,74,75 A 'classical' prime-boost immunization schedule is thus to allow 4-6 months to elapse between priming and booster doses, hence the generic '0-1-6 months' schedule. Secondary antigen exposure (Table 2-6) thus results in the production of higher af nity antibodies than primary responses. 76 To note, this may not be the case when 'natural' priming, e.g., through cross-reactive bacteria, has taken place prior to immunization. Which are the determinants of B cell memory responses? The factors that drive the differentiation of antigen-speci c GC B cells towards either plasma cells or memory B cells are yet poorly understood. 64 In response to protein antigens, both cell populations are generated in the same GCs, and their differen-tiation pathway only differs late in the GC reaction. As a rule, factors enhancing plasma cell differentiation and primary anti-body responses therefore also support the induction of memory B cells (Table 2-7). Post-booster antibody titers are therefore higher in individuals with stronger primary responses. As an example, higher post-booster anti-HBsAg responses are observed in individuals with high (e.g. = 100 UI/l) rather than intermediate (10-99 UI/l) anti-HBsAg post-primary responses. 77,78 This is likely to refl ect the induction of a larger pool of antigen-speci c memory B cells. An interesting question is whether this may confer speci c advantages in terms of pro- tection: the protective threshold of serum antibodies could be reached more rapidly upon the reactivation of a larger number of memory B cells. The dose of antigen is an important determinant of memory B cell responses (Table 2-7). At priming, higher antigen doses generally favor the induction of plasma cells, whereas lower doses may preferentially drive the induction of immune memory. 79 Thus, a lower antigen content may be preferred if the rapid induction of protection is not required. Closely spaced primary vaccine doses may also be bene cial for early post- primary antibody responses but not for post-booster antibody responses, as illustrated with meningococcal group C glycoconjugates. 80 As a rule, accelerated schedules in which a 4-6 months window is not included between priming and boosting result into signi cantly lower booster responses 62 (Table 2-7). At time of boosting, a higher antigen content raises stronger booster responses, presumably by recruiting more memory B cells into the response. This is illustrated by higher antibody responses of children primed with a glycoconjugate vaccine and boosted with PS (20-50 g of PS) than glycoconjugate (1-3 g of PS) vaccines. 81,82 Residual titers of vaccine antibodies present at time of boosting directly infl uence vaccine antibody responses. As a rule, secondary responses to live attenuated viral vaccines are minimal, as pre-existing antibodies mostly neutralize the vaccine load prior to its in vivo replication. Consequently, even multiple doses of live attenuated vaccines remain without undesirable effects. Responses to non-live vaccines are also negatively infl uenced by residual vaccine antibody titers. This may refl ect the formation of antigen-antibody complexes which reduce the load of antigen available for B cell binding and/or antibody-mediated negative feedback mechanisms acting directly on B cells. Consequently, individuals with residual antibodies to a given antigen may only show a limited increase of their antibody responses\u2014such that vaccine responses are better described by the proportion of individuals above a given threshold than by those showing a 2- or 4-fold increase of their antibody titers. The persistence of memory B cells is of utmost importance for long-term vaccine ef cacy. Antigen persistence (Table 2-7) contributes to the duration of immune memory, 83 probably by extending the period during which antigen remains available for memory B cell induction and reactivation. This is likely to contribute to the extended (inde nite?) memory to live attenuated vaccines, recently exempli ed by repeat administration of smallpox vaccines decades after priming. 84 Table 2-7 Determinants of Secondary B cell Responses Determinants Mechanisms (presumed) Post-primary antibody titers As plasma cells and memory responses are generated in parallel in GCs, higher post-primary Ab titer s refl ect stronger GC reactions and generally predict higher secondary responses. Residual antibodies at boosting Neutralization of live viral vaccines; negative feedback mechanisms on non-live vaccines. Lower antigen dose at priming A limited quantity of antigen may induce B cell differentiation away from PCs, towards memory B ce lls (?). Longer intervals before boosting A minimal interval of 4-6 months is required for optimal af nity maturation of memory B cells. Higher antigen dose at boosting A higher availability of antigen may drive higher numbers of memory B cells into differentiation . Antigen availability Exogenous exposure Exposure to exogenous antigens may reactivate or favor the persistence of memory B cells.In vivo persistence Antigen persistence may reactivate or favor the persistence of memory B cells.28 Section 1 General aspects of vaccination Fortunately, memory B cells survive for prolonged periods (e.g., several decades) even in the absence of re-exposure to antigen. 85 It has been suggested that memory B cells undergo a certain degree of homeostatic polyclonal activation.86 Although this does not appear suf cient to maintain antibody responses, i.e., to drive their differentiation to Ig secreting cells, it may contribute to their persistence. The demonstration of the persistence of memory B cells long after vaccine antibodies have eventually disappeared, and of their brisk reactivation upon antigen exposure, has direct consequences for immunization programs. First, it implies that an immunization schedule should never be started 'all over again'\u2014but continued where interrupted, regardless of the duration of the interruption. Consequently, regular booster doses are not required to maintain immune memory during low-risk periods, which has direct implications for travellers who may simply need a single booster dose prior to departure. Second, it implies that certain immunization schedules may not need to include booster doses, should exposure provide regular natural boosters. Importantly, however, successful immunization programs may eventually reduce opportunities for natural boosters and consequently modify booster requirements. This issue will doubtlessly be an area of intense investigation in the next decades. Last, the long-term persistence of immune memory implies that booster vaccine doses may not be needed in situations where the reactivation of immune memory by offending pathogens is suf ciently rapid and effective to interrupt microbial invasion. Immune memory and vaccine-induced protection: a race between reactivation and microbial invasion? All existing vaccines, with the exception of T-independent PS, induce immune memory. Nevertheless, vaccine ef cacy may be short-term, as illustrated following infant immunization against group C meningococcus. 87 Demonstration of priming\u2014or 'boostability'\u2014is therefore not a surrogate marker for long-term vaccine ef cacy. This requires identifying the determinants that contribute\u2014or limit\u2014the persistence of vaccine ef cacy. It is generally considered that protection by toxoid-based vaccines requires the presence of antitoxin antibodies at time of toxin exposure. This is supported by the observation that despite the occurrence of many adult cases of diphtheria during a large outbreak in the former Soviet Union, a single vaccine dose raised strong antibody responses to this relatively poor immunogen. This con rmed that most patients had been immunized in childhood and had lost vaccine antibodies over time, but had persistent immune memory. 88 This immune memory was however not suf cient to protect against diphtheria, a disease characterized by a short incubation period (1-5 days). The same requirement for protective antibodies at time of exposure is frequently applied to protection against tetanus. However, tetanus does not seem to occur in previously immunized (i.e., 3 doses as adults) individuals. Whether this refl ects a longer incubation time or the frequent administration of a booster dose at time of wound is unknown. Persisting immune memory is not suf cient to protect against acute hepatitis B after the waning of vaccine-induced antibodies. When anti-HBsAg antibodies reach titers <10 IU/L, acute viral infection occurs, refl ected by the appearance of anti-HBc antibodies. 89-91 However, progression to chronic liver disease has not been reported in fully immunized vaccine responders. This suggests that viral replication and re-exposure to HBsAg ef ciently drives vaccine-induced memory cells into effector cells prior to the end of the viral incubation period (4-12 weeks). This process requires a suf cient number of HBsAg-speci c memory B cells to be elicited, to persist and to be capable of reactivation even several decades after infant priming. Analyses of secondary responses elicited late after priming demonstrate that earlier and stronger booster responses are achieved when post-primary anti-HBsAg antibodies had reached higher titers. 77,78 This suggests the induction and long-term persistence of a higher number of memory B cells, such that protective neutralizing antibody thresholds are reached faster. Whether this confers an advantage in the race against chronic hepatitis is open to investigation. Another essential unresolved issue is whether the size of the pool of memory B cells elicited by primary immunization infl uences their long-term persistence, particularly in absence of antigen exposure, e.g., in low-endemicity countries. It also remains to be de ned whether T cell memory responses contribute to the maintenance of vaccine-induced protection after waning of anti-HBsAg antibodies. Glycoconjugate vaccines against encapsulated bacteria illustrate the importance of immune memory for vaccine ef cacy, as well as some of its limitations. Glycoconjugate priming elicits a bona de GC reaction, with the induction of high-af nity memory B cells that can be rapidly (4-7 days) recalled upon PS immunization. 73 Ef cient priming, i.e., induction of immune memory, is readily demonstrated in children primed in infancy. 92,93 However, immune memory is also evidenced in children with Hib vaccine failure,94 indicating that their reservoir of memory B cells failed to protect them against invasive disease. The discrepancy between the existence of memory B cells and the lack of protection may again refl ect the race against microbial invasion: the time required for production of suf cient levels of circulating antibodies could be too long to interrupt bacterial invasion. Notably, secondary vaccine failures have been relatively rare, and primarily observed in countries using an early accelerated infant schedule without a booster dose, 95 the use of DTPa/Hib vaccines with lower Hib immunogenicity resulting in additional risks.96 Thus, these priming conditions are not optimal for sustained individual protection: it is tempting to conclude that they may not elicit a suf ciently large pool of memory B cells for a suf ciently rapid interruption of bacterial invasion. Similarly, glycoconjugate vaccines against group C meningococcal disease proved much more ef cacious during the rst year after infant priming than during the following 3 years. 87 Thus, infant immunization fails to induce sustained protection against group C meningococcus, despite the demonstration of the induction and persistence of immune memory. 97 The requirement for boosters to confer long-term vaccine protection is also well illustrated for pertussis, where boosters are required to extend protection beyond childhood. 98 The prompt reactivation of immune memory is also not suf cient to control viral replication in the digestive tract: fecal excretion patterns were similar in subjects who were seronegative at time of oral challenge with poliovirus vaccine, whether or not they raised prompt anamnestic serum antibody responses attesting to the persistence of immune memory. 99 Live attenuated viral vaccines (measles, rubella) are considered as the prototype inducers of life-long immunity. This derives in part from the induction of sustained antibody responses, which however tend to slowly decline in the absence of recurrent exposure 100 and might eventually result in a growing proportion of seronegative vaccinated young adults, including women of childbearing age. Whether the reactivation of immune memory will be suf cient to curtail the replication process and confer protection against measles, rubella or varicella or whether adult booster doses may become needed after microbial control are essential questions. These questions, which are central to sustained vaccine ef cacy, are usually unresolved at time of registration of a new vaccine. As an example, the relative contribution of vaccine antibodies and of immune memory to the duration of vaccine-induced protection against human papillomaviruses may currently not be predicted. Altogether, one may thus expect questions related to the nature (size, type, responsiveness) of the pool of memory cells elicited by various immunization 29 Vaccine immunology2Chapter 2 schedules and the relative contribution of long-term antibodies and immune memory to protection to be at the core of many vaccine studies in the next decade. T cell vaccine responses How do vaccines induce CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses? T cell vaccine responses are elicited in parallel to B cell responses (Table 2-1), through interactions with activated DCs. With the exception of PS, all vaccines induce CD4 + T cells, e.g., Th1 and/ or Th2 cells that essentially support the differentiation of B cells (Th2) or of CD8 + T cells (Th1). Live vaccines also elicit CD8+ T cells capable of killing infected cells. The induction of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is essentially controlled by the nature of the initial infl ammatory reaction, i.e., by vaccine adjuvants. Vaccine antigens are taken up by immature dendritic cells (DCs) activated by the local infl ammation, which provides the signals required for their migration to draining lymph nodes (Fig. 2-1). During this migration, DCs mature and their surface expression of molecules changes. 101 Simultaneously, antigens are processed into small fragments and displayed at the cell surface in the grooves of MHC (HLA in humans) molecules. As a rule, MHC class I molecules present peptides from antigens that are produced within infected cells, whereas phagocytosed antigens are displayed on MHC class II molecules. 102-104 Thus, mature DCs reaching the T cell zone of lymph nodes display MHC-peptide complexes and high levels of costimulation molecules at their surface. 105 CD4+ T cells recognize antigenic peptides displayed by class II MHC molecules, whereas CD8+ T cells bind to class I MHC-peptide complexes (Fig. 2-6).106 Their recognition is restricted to short peptides (8-11 [CD8+] or 10-18 [CD4+] amino acids) displayed on speci c MHC class I or II molecules, respectively. Antigen-speci c T cell receptors may only bind to speci c MHC molecules (e.g., HLA A2), which differ among individuals and populations. Consequently, T cell responses are highly variable within a population. These T cell epitopes may be generated from any region of the vaccine antigens, whether the peptide sequence is located within or at the surface of the protein. This is in contrast to B cell recognition, which is essentially limited to conformational determinants constituted by amino acids at the antigen surface. This MHC-peptide signal (signal 1) is not suf cient for T cell activation, which remain anergic or become tolerized in absence of co- stimulation (signal 2). This ensures that only na\u00efve T cells binding to the surface of activated DCs, i.e., DCs that have sensed 'danger signals' through their Toll-like receptors and responded by a modulation of their surface or secreted molecules, receive the costimulation signals required for their activation. 105 Activated CD4+ T cells essentially exert supportive functions for DCs\u2014to which they provide signals (CD40L, etc.) resulting in further activation, for B cells (Fig. 2-2) and for CD8 + cytotoxic T cells (Fig. 2-6 and Table 2-8). They are elicited by each vaccine type, with the exception of unconjugated PS, and the demonstration of post-immunization CD4 + T cell responses does not imply a direct role in vaccine ef cacy. CD4+ T cell activation by DCs triggers their differentiation along two distinct and mutually exclusive differentiation pathways. 105 Th1-type CD4+ T cells essentially produce IFN- and TNF- , participating to the elimination of intracellular pathogens both directly (cytokine responses) and indirectly via their support to macrophage activation and CD8 + T cells differentiation (Fig. 2-6).107 Th2-type CD4+ T cells essentially produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 which are directly implicated in the defense against extracellular pathogens such as helminths. 108 Both Th1 and Th2 cells support B cell activation and differentiation during extrafollicular responses, whereas follicular (Tfh) CD4 + helper T cells provide help to GC B cells (Fig. 2-3).36 In experimental animal models, numerous factors infl uence the preferential differentiation of CD4+ T cells towards the Th1 or Th2 pathways.109 These determinants include the dose of antigen, lower vaccine doses being classically associated with preferential Th1 responses, and the route of administration, which targets distinct populations of DC. However, the main determinant of CD4 + T cell differentiation is the extent and type of DC activation by the innate system.105 Consequently, speci c adjuvants may preferentially skew CD4+ responses Th1 or Th2 responses, requiring their careful selection. CD8+ T cell responses are essentially (although not exclusively, as a result of cross-presentation) elicited by vaccines that introduce antigens within the cell cytosol, ensuring their access to MHC class I molecules. 110 The induction of strong CD8+ T cell responses is thus currently limited to infectious, live attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines. However, novel delivery systems Cytotoxic responses. Antigens are phagocytosed by DCs (1), processed into small peptides and displayed at the cell surface in the groove of MHC class I and/or class II molecules (2). CD4 + T cells with the appropriate MHC-peptide speci city are activated, provide activation signals to DC (3) and differentiate in effector cells (4) that produce preferentially Th1 or Th2 cytokines. Th1 CD4 + T cells support (5) CD8+ T cell differentiation, which is in contrast inhibited (6) by Th2-like cytokines. CD8 + T cells recognize MHC class I-peptide complexes (7) and differentiate into cytotoxic effector cells (8) capable of killing infected cells (8) or pathogens.30 Section 1 General aspects of vaccination such as live-vectored vaccines or DNA vaccines are now in human trials.111 As CD8+ T cells are unique in their ability to kill cells that are chronically infected, novel vaccine targets such as HIV, HCV or malaria require their induction. In addition to CD4 + Th, follicular (Tfh) and possibly CD8+ T cells, vaccine may also elicit regulatory T cells (Tregs), of which CD4 +CD25+ Treg cells and type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells are the best characterized (Table 2-8). These regulatory T cells are elicited in an antigen-speci c manner. CD4 +CD25+ Treg cells potently suppress the proliferation and IFN- production by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, probably by direct cell-to-cell contacts and inhibition of IL-2 production.2 Tr1 cells produce high levels of IL-10 and TGF- , which mediate their suppressive function in both Th1- (e.g., autoimmune diseases) and Th2- (e.g., allergic responses) mediated pathologies. These regulatory T cells are induced by DCs that capture antigen in the absence of danger signals and thus remain immature during their migration to lymph nodes. In the absence of signal 2, na\u00efve T cells do not differentiate into effector but into regulatory T cells. These Tregs play essential roles in preventing autoimmune diseases as well as allergic responses. By suppressing immune responses against self or non-self antigens, they may also limit the ef cacy of vaccines when danger signals are not suf cient to elicit immunity, e.g., in chronic infections or cancer. This was recently formally demonstrated in humans by the enhancement of anti-cancer vaccine responses following Tregs depletion. 112 Numerous studies are thus currently ongoing to de ne the determinants of Tregs differentiation, which could lead to novel immunization strategies. Which are the determinants of vaccine-induced T cell memory? Effector T cell responses are short-lived, and most ( >90%) effec- tor T cells die of apoptosis within a few days. Thus, immune memory is essential to T cell vaccine ef cacy. It is dependent upon three main parameters: the frequency of antigen-speci c memory T cells, their phenotype and their persistence 111 (Table 2-9). Memory T cells may persist life-long even in the absence of antigen exposure. The frequency of memory T cells refl ects the magnitude of the initial T cell expansion\u2014and that of its subsequent contraction during which few surviving cells differentiate towards memory T cells. The main determinant of the expansion phase is the amount of antigen present during priming. 113 This is a major limitation for non-replicating vaccines, which fail to reach suf cient antigen content and typically require adjuvantation and/or booster doses. The contraction phase occurs soon after antigen is cleared\u2014which occurs faster for Table 2-8 T cell Responses to Vaccines Type Mechanisms (presumed) Function CD4+ helper T cells Th1 IFN- production Extrafollicular B cell help Th1 Cell contact, IFN- Activation of CD8+ T cells Th1/Th2 contact, CD40L DC activation Th2 IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 Extrafollicular B cell help Th2 Cell contact, IL-4 Suppression of CD8+ T cells CD4+ follicular helper T cells Th1 help Th2 IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 Germinal center B cell help T Treg Cell contact, IL-2 responses IFN-, TNF- Killing cells Effector memory T cells Th1/Th2 cytokines, perforin Rapid secondary effector responses in periphery Central memory T cells IL-2, IL-10, CD40L Delayed activation/proliferation in lymph nodes Table 2-9 Determinants of Memory T cell Responses Main factors Determinants Frequency of memory T cells Magnitude of T cell expansion (initial antigen load, antigen persistence) Phenotype of memory T cells Effector memory Induction favoured by prolonged antigen persistence Central memory Induction favoured by rapid antigen clearance Persistence of memory T cells Supported by IL-15 ,IL-731 Vaccine immunology2Chapter 2 non-replicating vaccines. Current efforts are thus oriented towards the optimization of the primary expansion phase through booster administration. As vaccine-induced immunity limits the subsequent take of a live vaccine by inducing its rapid neutralization, one attractive approach is the use of distinct vaccines for priming and boosting. 114-116 The phenotype of memory T cells is also of importance. Two types of memory T cells have been identi ed (Table 2-8), based on their phenotype and function.117 Effector memory cells (Tem) traf c through non lymphoid organs, where they monitor tissues for the presence of speci c microbial peptides.118 They have a high cytotoxic potential that enables them with immediate action upon pathogen recognition. In contrast, central memory T cells (Tcm) preferentially traf c through lymph nodes and bone marrow, do not exhibit much cytotoxic capacity, but have a high proliferative potential. Their role is to recognize antigens transported by activated DCs into lymph nodes and to rapidly undergo massive proliferation, generating a delayed but very large wave of effector cells. 118 Antigen persistence essentially controls the proportion of Tcm and Tem memory cells (Table 2-9): Tcm cells predominate when antigen is rapidly cleared, whereas Tem cells become preponderant when antigen persists, such as in chronic infections. 111 This is also a challenge for novel non-replicating vaccines that should induce and maintain suf cient Tem cells for immediate clearance in infected tissues. The long-term persistence of memory T cells is well established. Through homeostatic proliferation supported by speci c cytokines such as IL-15 and IL-7, memory T cells may persist lifelong even in absence of antigen exposure. 119 Recent studies of the persistence of vaccinia-induced immune memory have con rmed that this applies to humans. 120-122 How speci c are vaccine immune responses? The speci city of vaccine responses is at the center of many debates. Ideally, one would wish vaccine-induced responses to be both suf ciently broad to extend protection to non-vaccine strains (e.g., for infl uenza, rotavirus, S. pneumoniae or human papillomavirus vaccines) and suf ciently restricted not to elicit cross-reactions to allergens or self-antigens, or other undesir-able non-speci c effects. The speci city of vaccine responses has received added interest as a number of studies reported either positive or negative non-speci c effects of vaccinations in low income countries. 123,124 As B cells recognize conformational epitopes constituted by distant amino acids, they may bind to antigenic peptides with very distinct sequences: it has been estimated that roughly 5% of monoclonal antibodies made against 15 different kinds of viruses cross-reacted with human proteins. 125 That any viral infection is not followed by the induction or fl are of an autoimmune disease highlights the importance for regulatory mechanisms to suppress responses directed against self-antigens. Indeed, the speci city of antibody responses is well controlled. Although polyclonal stimulation was suggested as capable of activating memory B cells of distinct speci cities, 86 which could contribute to their homeostasis, this non-speci c activation was not associated to antibody responses. Similarly, the administration of hepatitis B vaccine with CpG oligonucleotides, i.e., a potent DC activating adjuvant, did not drive pre-existing tetanus-speci c B cells into antibody- producing plasma cells. 55 Vaccination with tetanus toxoid was found to expand both speci c and bystander memory T-cells, but did not modulate antibody responses to unrelated antigens such that antibody production remained vaccine-speci c. 126 Altogether, this indicates that the induction of cross-reactive antibody responses is extremely limited, which may be of importance to prevent undesirable reactions but limits the ef cacy of vaccine-induced antibody responses to very few non- vaccine serotypes. 127T cells need to recognize only a few amino acids of antigenic peptides displayed by MHC molecules, which offers a much greater potential for cross-reactivity. It has been estimated that each T lymphocyte could potentially bind to millions of different peptides. 125 In addition, memory T cells readily respond to homeostatic cytokines, such that bystander memory T cells of distinct antigen-speci city may be transiently activated and expand during a fl u-like illness or an immunization process. 126,128 Despite the likelihood of cross-reactive responses to infectious agents or vaccines and the relative ease with which auto-reactive lymphocytes may be elicited, vaccine-induced exacerbations of autoimmune diseases remain extremely rare, which probably refl ects the ef cacy of regulatory mechanisms limiting their intensity, scope and duration. 2,129 The induction of cross-protective T cell-mediated responses has been repeatedly observed in murine experimental models, which suggested that wide spectrum viral vaccines could be based on T cell responses. 130 Convincing examples of heterologous protective immunity in humans are much more limited: neonatal BCG protects against leprosy 131 and individuals vaccinated against smallpox appear protected against monkeypox. 132 In contrast, the sharing of several T cell determinants is not suf cient for a single oral polio vaccine strain to confer cross-protection. It is thus tempting to conclude that heterologous protective immunity essentially comes at play for T-cell rather than for antibody-mediated protective responses. Accordingly, the heterosubtypic immunity conferred by live attenuated infl uenza vaccines 133,134 could be mediated by T cells and/or by mucosal IgA antibodies. Non-speci c effects of vaccines are occasionally associated to the fear of immune overload and subsequent enhanced vulnerability to infections, a theory which is not supported by any evidence. 135,136 Similarly, a series of observational studies linking morbidity and mortality patterns to vaccination in several low-income populations, particularly in West Africa, has generated some debate. 123,124 However, they have essentially failed to convince due to the dif culty in comparing essentially non-comparable populations, vaccinated individuals being different in many ways from those not vaccinated. Vaccine responses at the extremes of age The challenges of neonatal and early life immunization According to WHO estimates, 2.5 to 3 million infants are born healthy but succumb to acute infections between the age of 1 and 12 months. These early deaths are caused by a limited number of pathogens, such that the availability of a few addi-tional vaccines that would be immunogenic soon after birth would make a huge difference on this disease burden. Although antigen-speci c B and T cell responses may already be elicited in utero, early life responses markedly differ from those elicited in mature hosts. These differences do not merely refl ect the antigen na\u00efvety of the immune system, but a true immaturity of B cells, T cells and of the microenvironment in which they differentiate. Early life immune responses are characterized by age- dependent limitations of the magnitude of responses to all vaccines (Table 2-10). Antibody responses to most PS antigens are not elicited during the rst 2 years of life, which is likely to refl ect numerous factors including the slow maturation of the spleen marginal zone, 43,137 limited expression of CD21 on B cells and limited availability of the complement factors.138 Although this may be circumvented in part by the use of glycoconjugate vaccines, even the most potent glycoconjugate vaccines elicit markedly lower primary IgG responses in young infants. 139 Early life antibody responses are directly determined by both the prenatal (e.g., gestational age140) and the post-natal age at time of immunization.138 Accelerated infant vaccine schedules in which 3 vaccine doses are given at a 1 month interval (2, 3, 4 or 32 Section 1 General aspects of vaccination 3, 4, 5 months) result into lower responses than schedules in which more time elapses between doses (2, 4, 6 months), or between the priming and boosting dose (3, 5, 12 months). However, the magnitude of infant antibody responses to multiple dose schedules refl ects both the time interval between doses, with longer intervals eliciting stronger responses, and the age at which the last vaccine dose is administered. That post-natal immune maturation is required for stronger antibody responses is thus best demonstrated by comparing antibody responses to single dose vaccines given to antigen-na\u00efve infants of various ages. 20,141 These studies may be confounded by the persistence of maternal antibodies, which negatively infl uence infant antibody responses in epitope-speci c and titer-speci c dependent manners.142 Thus, multivariate analyses on a large number of infants are required to identify the main determinants of vaccine antibody responses. The induction of strong antibody responses to a single vaccine dose that would be given soon after birth unfortunately currently remains an elusive goal, and adult-like responses may eventually be only elicited in older infants. Factors that limit the magnitude of early life antibody responses are dif cult to study in human infants. Studies in which human infant vaccines were administered at various stages of the postnatal maturation of infant mice indicated that the same limitations of antibody responses affect early life human and murine responses. 138 These neonatal immunization models demonstrated that limitations of antibody responses in early life result from the limited and delayed induction of GC in which Ag-speci c B cells proliferate and differentiate. This was shown to essentially refl ect the delayed development of FDCs required to nucleate and support GC reactions. 143 This would explain the stepwise increase of antibody responses elicited in older infants, although direct evidence is dif cult to collect and thus still limited 137 in human infants. Importantly, neonatal immune immaturity allows the induction of immune memory, and neonatal priming may have been used to initiate vaccine responses against hepatitis B or poliomyelitis. Whether neonatal priming would similarly enhance responses to subsequent infant doses of pertussis or pneumococcal vaccines is currently under study. Although immune priming may be elicited at birth, memory responses elicited in early life could nevertheless quantitatively differ from those elicited later. This would indeed be expected: the limited magnitude of GC reactions, refl ected by lower antibody responses elicited in the rst year of life, is likely to be associated to the induction of a lower number of memory B cells. Whether this affects the persistence of immune memory has important implications, especially for infant immunization programs such as hepatitis B that are intended to protect throughout adult life. The duration of such responses (e.g., the boostability of hepatitis B vaccine antibody responses primed in infancy) extends for at least one decade. Whether it persists throughout a second decade is likely to be the focus of numerous studies in the next future. Antibody responses elicited before 12 months of age rapidly wane and antibody titers soon return close to baseline levels, 97,144 which may be associated with a resurgence of vulnerability to infection. 87 This short duration of infant responses refl ects the limited survival of antigen-speci c plasma cells. This hypothesis was recently con rmed in infant mice,143 in which early life bone-marrow stromal cells fail to provide suf cient survival signals to plasma cells reaching bone-marrow niches.145 Whether this similarly limits the induction of long-lived plasma cells in human infants is unknown, but short-lived antibody responses are a hallmark of early life immunization with most\u2014although not all (e.g., hepatitis B)\u2014vaccines. Isotype switching and somatic hypermutation, i.e., the af nity maturation of vaccine induced B cells, are already functional in the rst year of life, 75,146-148 including in preterm infants.140 Few studies have yet compared the af nity maturation process of vaccine responses in infants and adults, which seems to be similar (our own unpublished observations). However, several months are required for af nity maturation of vaccine antibody responses even in adults, 55 such that high-af nity responses are not observed in very young infants.Table 2-10 Limitations of Vaccine Responses at the Extremes of Life (Mechanisms Presumed) In early life Limited magnitude of Ab responses to PS Immaturity of marginal zone, low CD21 expression on B cells, limited availability of complement Limited magnitude of Ab responses to proteins Limited GC responses (? delayed FDC development).

Whether neonatal CD4 + T cells have higher intrinsic requirement for antigen-speci c activation and how immune immaturity affects human neonatal CD8+ T cell vaccine responses requires further investigations. Such studies will be especially important for the development of novel T-cell based vaccines. Importantly, the induction of early life B and T cell vaccine responses takes place in an environment that may be infl uenced by the presence of antibodies of maternal origin. IgG antibodies are actively transferred through the placenta, via the FcRn receptor, from the maternal to the fetal circulation. 155 Upon immunization, maternal antibodies bind to their speci c epitopes at the antigen surface, competing with infant B cells and thus limiting B cell activation, proliferation and differentiation. The inhibitory infl uence of maternal antibodies on infant B cell responses affects all vaccine types, although its infl uence is more marked for live attenuated viral vaccines that may be neutralized by even minute amounts of passive antibodies. 156 This inhibition is epitope-speci c, such that infant responses to non-immunodominant maternal epitopes may still be elicited. 157 Consequently, maternal antibodies to carrier proteins (i.e., to tetanus toxoid) mediate a speci c inhibitory infl uence on infant responses to TT, but not to the HIB polysaccharide moiety.158,159 The inhibitory infl uence of maternal antibodies is antibody titer dependent, or rather refl ects the ratio of maternal antibodies to vaccine antigen.55 This was elegantly demonstrated in a study where Israeli infants were immunized with hepatitis A vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months and bled immediately before each vaccine dose and at 7 months of age. 160 The rst vaccine dose only induced detectable infant responses in those immunized in the absence of detectable maternal antibodies. The second vaccine dose induced detectable infant responses in those primed in the presence of maternal antibodies <1999 mIU/mL, and the third dose in those primed in the presence of maternal antibodies <3999 mIU/mL. Infant responses were only elicited when maternal antibodies reached a threshold of 300-400 mIU/mL. 160 The maternal antibody titer at which infant responses may be elicited can only be de ned experimentally by comparing antibody responses in infants strati ed according to maternal antibody titers at time of priming. The extent and duration of the inhibitory infl uence of maternal antibodies therefore increase with gestational age, 140 e.g., with the amount of transferred immunoglobulins, and declines with post-natal age, as maternal antibodies wane. 55 Increasing the dose of vaccine antigen may also be suf cient to circumvent the inhibitory infl uence of maternal antibodies, as illustrated for hepatitis A161 or measles162 vaccines. Although maternal antibodies interfere with the induction of infant antibody responses, they may allow a certain degree of priming, i.e., of induction of memory B cells. This likely refl ects the fact that limited amounts of unmasked vaccine antigens may be suf cient for priming of memory B cells but not for full-blown GC activation, although direct evidence is lacking. Importantly, however, antibodies of maternal origin do not exert their inhibitory infl uence on infant T cell responses, which remain largely unaffected or even enhanced. 19,163,164 This is best explained by the fate of maternal antibodies-vaccine antigen complexes: immune complexes are taken up by macrophages and dendritic cells, dissociate into their acidic phagolysosome compartment and are processed into small peptides. These peptides are displayed at the surface of antigen-presenting cells, thus available for binding by CD4 + and CD8+ T cells. Thus, the challenges for a further improvement of early life immunization strategies are to identify vaccine formulations and strategies capable of inducing after 1-2 early doses the strong primary antibody responses required for defense against certain early life pathogens. To elicit prolonged vaccine ef cacy, such formulations/strategies will have to overcome the inhibitory infl uence of maternal antibodies for suf cient priming to occur, and to elicit more long-lived plasma cells despite the limitations of the early life bone marrow compartment. T-cell based infant vaccines will have to meet the challenge of bypassing the factors that limit the induction of Th1 early life responses. Importantly, these immunological objectives should be reached by formulations/strategies demonstrated as safe in immunologically immature hosts, adding to the challenges. Age-associated changes in vaccine responses Innate and adaptative antibody and T cell-mediated cellular immune responses decline with age, which increases the fre-quency and severity of infections and reduces the protective effects of vaccinations. Aging affects the magnitude and the persistence of antibody responses to protein vaccines, 165,166 as refl ected by lower serum antibodies to infl uenza,167,168 tetanus or TBE vaccines.169 It also affects responses to pneumococcal PS vaccines, although differences in methodological issues have yielded contradictory results. 170 In contrast to infants whose antibody responses are quantitatively limited but appear quali-tatively similar as those of mature individuals, limitations of antibody responses in the elderly are also associated to qualita-tive changes that affect antibody speci city, isotype and af nity (Table 2-10). 171,172 The limitations of antibody responses result from the infl uence of a large number of underlying events.166,173 Responses to T-independent PS vaccines are directly conditioned by a decline in the reservoir of IgM + memory B cells that are present at reduced numbers, differentiate less ef ciently into antibody producing cells and thus limit the IgM responses to PS of aged individuals. 174 Antibody responses relying on the induction of germinal centers are also limited in senior subjects. This limitation of GCs limits B cell proliferation and differentiation, limiting the magnitude of antibody responses. It also restricts hypersomatic mutations in Ig genes, such that antibodies are of weaker af nities/functional capacities than those generated in younger individuals. 172 Last, limitations of GCs prevent ef cient Ig class switching, resulting into age- associated differences in IgG1 and IgG2 subclass antibodies, e.g., to pneumococcal PS. 175 Numerous factors contribute to limit the induction of GCs in elderly persons, including factors that are intrinsic to B cells 176 and which affect other cell types. As an example, studies in aged mice have convincingly demonstrated the existence of age-related changes in FDCs, whose molecular interactions with B cells are critical for the induction and maintenance of GCs. 177,178 The limited ability of aged subjects to generate high af nity antibody responses also refl ects changes in their antibody repertoire, as a result of differences in both B and CD4+ T cell response capacity.178,179 Age-associated changes in T cell responses are refl ected by a progressive decline in na\u00efve T cells, refl ecting declining thymic output. This is associated to a marked accumulation of large CD8 + clones presumably resulting from prior infections. These 34 Section 1 General aspects of vaccination large T cell clones, e.g., elicited in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) have reached a state of replicative senescence and homeostatic mechanisms negatively infl uence the size of the na\u00efve and effector memory T cell subsets. 166 In response to infl uenza immunization healthy elderly mount CD4+ responses initially similar to those of young adults, but which fail to maintain or expand such that T cell responses assessed 3 months after immunization are markedly lower than in younger adults. 180 This does not refl ect a functional impairment of CD4+ T memory cells181 but a shift of the T cell pool from na\u00efve to memory effector CD4+ T cells. The failure to maintain CD4+ responses refl ects a lower induction of new effector memory T cells, in relation to lower IL-7 levels.180,181 Other studies indicated that frail elderly subjects mount blunted and delayed Th1 responses to infl uenza vaccination, which correlated positively with their reduced total and IgG1 Ab response.182 Limitations also affect the expansion of infection driven infl uenza-speci c CD8+ T cells.182 Strategies to enhance vaccine-induced protection in aging individuals thus include the development of vaccine formulations capable of a stronger induction of speci c B and T cell responses, for example through the selection of speci c adjuvants. Nevertheless, changes in the repertoire may prove dif cult to circumvent and limitations of effector memory responses and of GC responses may continue to require the more frequent administration of certain vaccine boosters (e.g., against tetanus or TBE 182) to compensate for the brevity of B and T cell vaccine-induced responses in elderly individuals.
