Naturopathic medicine is a primary form of health care that emphasizes prevention and the self-healing process through the implementation of healthy living practices and natural therapies. It blends ancient knowledge with a philosophy that nature is the most efficient healer, while acknowledging and using current research on health and human systems. Dr Dang's specialties [Dr Ha Dang, ND, LAc](/dr-ha-dang-nd), specializes in chronic, complex illnesses such as: Lyme Disease Mold Disease Autoimmune Disease Naturopathic doctors (ND's) focus on identifying the underlying causes of disease, utilizing a combination of modalities that are individualized to each patient, including: Nutritional Therapies Botanical Medicine Bio-therapeutic Drainage Remedies Zone technique principles of naturopathy First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere) Use methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects; Avoid, when possible, the harmful suppression of symptoms; Acknowledge and respect the individual's healing process, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat illness. Prevention Naturopathic physicians emphasize disease prevention, assessment of risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interventions to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine strives to create a healthy world in which humanity may thrive. Wellness Wellness follows the establishment and maintenance of optimum health and balance. Wellness is a state of being healthy, characterized by positive emotion, thought and action. Wellness is inherent in everyone, regardless of disease(s). If wellness is recognized and experienced by an individual, it will more quickly heal a given disease than direct treatment of the disease alone. (The wellness principle was adopted by [Bastyr University](https://bastyr.edu/academics/naturopathic-medicine) and added to the six principles.) Meet our naturopath: [Dr ha dang, nd, lac](/dr-ha-dang) The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) Naturopathic medicine recognizes the body's inherent ability to heal itself. Naturopathic physicians identify and remove obstacles to recovery to facilitate this healing ability in patients. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam) The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than eliminate or merely suppress symptoms. Doctor as Teacher (Docere) Naturopathic physicians educate the patient and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also acknowledge the therapeutic value inherent in the doctor-patient relationship. Treat the Whole Person Naturopathic physicians treat each individual by taking into account physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental and social factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual path. "}
