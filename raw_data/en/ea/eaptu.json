The CDC currently recommends pregnant women get a Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, acelluar pertussis) shot in their third trimester. The goal is to stimulate a fresh immune response so that the antibodies the mother makes are then passed across the placenta to the fetus, thereby giving a [newborn a bit of protection](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2015/05/11/pertussis-vaccine-remains-best-way-to-prevent-whooping-cough-especially-for-babies/#6f34b5fb69d5) against pertussis before their first DTaP vaccine at 2 months. This strategy is not only effective at reducing newborns' risk of pertussis, it's also [safe](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2015/10/20/pertussis-booster-in-every-pregnacy-safe-for-mother-and-child-study-finds/#20d4c56560bf) for [mother](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2014/11/25/safety-of-flu-and-pertussis-vaccines-in-pregnancy-assessed/#33c4d34573fd) and [baby](http://www.redwineandapplesauce.com/2014/11/25/safety-of-the-tdap-in-pregnancy-and-exploring-the-evidence-for-pertussis-cocooning/) and ensures that the mother's immunity is in tip top shape. Mothers are second [only to siblings](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2015/09/08/siblings-give-babies-more-pertussis-than-moms-do/#4996267770b6) in transmitting pertussis to babies. Also known as whooping cough, or the \"100-day cough,\" pertussis is most dangerous in babies under 2 months old. These young infants have the highest risk of death from pertussis. But premature babies are at an even higher risk for pertussis infections and serious complications or death from the disease. The findings of a new, albeit small, study in Pediatrics suggests that preemies gain a benefit from mothers' pertussis vaccination as well. \"It comes down to how premature they are because the lungs are still developing,\" said Mark Slifka, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology at Oregon Health & Science University, who was not involved in the study. \"It's known that preemies are more susceptible to respiratory infections. That's why they give the anti-RSV antibody to preemies.\" The study focused on a group of British women who were already involved in a different study about a different vaccine, but all the women had been offered a Tdap vaccine at 28 weeks of pregnancy during routine prenatal care. Among 160 mothers of preemies, 31 of the mothers (19%) agreed to receive the vaccine. (They actually got a Tdap combined with an inactivated polio vaccine, but women in the U.S. only receive the Tdap by itself.) The babies were all born between 28 and 35 weeks of pregnancy. The researchers, led by Alison Kent, MD, at the University of London, then measured the infants' antibodies against each of the antigens (the components that cause the immune system to make antibodies) in the vaccines before and one month after the children received their doses at 2 months. Their antibodies levels were measured again at 5 months old. At 2 months old, the infants whose mothers were vaccinated had significantly higher antibodies levels against pertussis than the babies born to unvaccinated mothers. This was true for all the vaccines\u2014tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. \"The tough thing about pertussis is that we don't know at what level you have the protection,\" Slifka said. That is, scientists don't know how high the antibodies levels need to be to ensure that a person is protected against pertussis infection if they're exposed to pertussis bacteria. After the babies received their first DTaP (the infant version of the Tdap), both groups of babies showed increased antibodies against pertussis, but the group whose mothers were vaccinated had a slightly lower concentration against one of the pertussis antigens and the diphtheria antigen. \"This study corroborates what other studies that have shown\u2014a transient blunting of immune response to active immunization of infants\u2014but that this blunting doesn't affect the immune response achieved by the infant after completion of the full series,\" explained Jessica Atwell, PhD, an assistant scientist at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and in the Center for Immunization Research, who also was not involved in the study. Scientists have known for a long time that \"vaccines don't work as well if you already have high levels of antibodies,\" Slifka said, and the infants of vaccinated mothers would already have higher levels than the babies whose mothers were not vaccinated. But by 12 months old, the infants in both groups who received all their pertussis vaccine doses had similar antibodies levels against the disease. \"What's important is that the infant is protected at the time when they're at greatest risk of complications from pertussis\u2014so if maternal antibodies are present in a high enough concentration to partially blunt vaccine response from the first dose, hopefully that would also translate to protection against severe disease,\" Atwell said. The trick, of course, is ensuring that mothers get the vaccine early enough for their immune system to respond and make antibodies, which is about two weeks. Most of the mothers who were vaccinated received their Tdap dose around three weeks before giving birth. \"As long as they're vaccinated early enough for the mom to mount a immune response, you're still going to get those maternal antibodies at high levels even in a preemie,\" Slifka said. \"It's a very small study, but it's supportive of the current practices.\" Slick recommends that mothers continue to follow the CDC recommendations while recognizing that even an early arrival doesn't prevent the baby from reaping the benefits of prenatal Tdap vaccination. The antibodies the infants receive from the placenta are IgG antibodies, which are different from the IgA antibodies that babies receive through breastmilk. Breastfeeding cannot confer the kind of protection against pertussis that maternal antibodies transferred across the placenta can. \"These results are promising and support what we've seen in other studies, but additional data would of course be helpful,\" Atwell pointed out. One limitation, for example, is the researchers didn't measure the babies' pertussis antibodies at birth\u2014only at 2 months. \"Ideally, we would want to know what the maternal antibody concentration on the day of delivery was, what the cord blood concentration was and then measure monthly through 12 months,\" Atwell said. Having antibody concentrations for the mothers would be even more beneficial, she added. Despite the small size and other limitations, such as lacking antibody levels at birth and not knowing the levels required for protection, the study still shows that preemies aren't left behind when mothers get the Tdap vaccine in pregnancy. \"This is good news, as protecting premature infants is certainly a concern,\" Atwell said.
