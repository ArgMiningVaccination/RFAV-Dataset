Part One: Stress, Stressors & the Stress Continuum What is Stress? Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous. Stress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand. In the healthcare field, our work comes with stress!

When is stress becoming problematic?What Stress Can Look LikeDefinitions of Common Terms Stress A sense that something is not right and something needs to change. Distress When the stress overwhelms. Burnout When stress, distress, or a disorder leads to not being able to cope at work. Disorder When you need outside help.

Complex Trauma Cumulative trauma often over long periods of time. Second Victim Healthcare workers experience trauma through their patient's experience.Definitions of Common Terms Coping Mechanisms/Skills Tools we can use to carry ourselves through (positive or negative). Resilience A combination of support and care from outside and within, plus positive coping skills that allow us to heal after the crisis has passed.The Stress Continuum Distress Sometimes life is harder than we expected We experience deep loss (death of a parent or friend) or a life change (divorce, health) Requires additional support (some people seek counseling or spiritual guidance to learn additional coping skills, or medication) Disorder Mental disorders are also known as mental illness or psychiatric disorders Experience symptoms that meet the criteria of a diagnosis, ex. PTSD, Depression, Substance Use Disorder Assessed and treated by behavioral health clinician, may warrant medications to treat symptoms Stress Happens to everyone, every day General response to stressful situations (tough commute, work problems, moving, etc.) Most people develop coping mechanisms (tools to get us through the experience) Stress Response Continuum Ready (Green) Reacting (Yellow) Injured (Orange) Ill (Red) Good to go Well trained Prepared Cohesive units Families are readyDistress or impairment Mild, transient Anxious or irritable Behavior changeMore severe or persistent distress or impairment Leaves lasting evidence (Mood, Sleep, Appetite; personality change)Stress injuries that don't heal without intervention Diagnosable PTSD Depression Anxiety Addictive disorder Leadership ResponsibilityChaplain & Medical ResponsibilityIndividual ResponsibilityExample of Stressors Witnessing intense pain, isolation, and loss on a daily basis Few opportunities for rest and breaks Surge in care demands PPE (Lack of personal physical safety, emotionally/psychologically draining and disconnect from patients/barrier, not feeling seen, abandonment, physical discomfort) Psychological stress in the outbreak settingsWorkplace (Pandemic) Remote learning is hard 24-hour childcare responsibilities on top of work Can't unwind with friends, go to the movies, or any of the things that typically relieve stress Having to be \"on\" all the time for my family and friends Hard to stop my brain when my head hits the pillowHome Keeping my family safe Getting enough food and medication Fear of dying Going back too soon Emotional fallout (can happen after we recover physically) Constantly reading the news and social media Lack of answers about the illness and recoveryQuarantine Pulse Check How has COVID -19 been for you?

Trauma An emotional response to a terrible event like an accident, rape, loss, or natural disaster. Immediately after the event, shock and denial are typical. Longer term reactions include unpredictable emotions, flashbacks, strained relationships and even physical symptoms like headaches or nausea.

A natural response to losing something or someone important to us. Each loss is unique. Everyone experiences grief differently. Common symptoms and reactions include cognitive, emotional, behavioral, physical, and spiritual, and will likely change over time. There is no right way to grieve. But there are healthy ways to deal with the grieving process.What Grief Can Look LikeComplicated Grief Intense longing for and intrusive thoughts/images of the loved one Denial of the death or sense of disbelief Imagining that their loved one is aliveSearching for them in familiar places Avoiding things that act as reminders Extreme anger or bitterness over the loss Feeling that life is empty or meaninglessSuicide Suicidal Thoughts During COVID -19 We are all under tremendous stress. It is important to note that during a crisis like this, suicidal or morbid thoughts can be normal.Identifying Colleagues At Suicide Risk Be alert to problems that increase suicide risk. You may notice problems facing your co -workers that may put them at risk for suicide. There are a large number of risk factors. Some of the most significant risk factors include: Prior suicide attempt(s) Alcohol and drug abuse Mood and anxiety disorders (e.g. depression, PTSD) Access to a means to kill oneself (i.e. lethal means)Common Warning Signs of Suicide At Suicide Risk When a person is talking, mentions suicide, feeling hopeless, experiencing unbearable pain, being a burden, or having no reason to live, feeling trapped A person may exhibit behaviors such as withdrawing, increased use of alcohol and drugs, giving away possessions, calling to say good bye, sleeping less or too much Person appears agitated, anxious, depressed, not themselves, angry Any sharp changes in a colleague warrant a check -inWhen Speaking with Them Colleagues at Suicide Risk Ask how he or is she is doing and listen without judging.Mention changes you have noticed in their behavior and say you are concerned about their emotional well - being.Suggest they talk with someone in the EAP, the HR Department, or another mental health professional. Offer to help arrange an appointment and go with them. Continue to stay in contact with them and pay attention to how they are doing.LINK STAFF MEMBER TO AVAILABLE RESOURCES Tier 3 resources, including EAP, BH hotline Potential on -site evaluations based on facilityH+H Suicidal Guidance Our staff deserve support, but our role is different than with patients.
