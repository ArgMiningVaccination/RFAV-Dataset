Central African Healing Traditions Zablon, nganga lunga , and his apprentice Davidi, work with two patients at their clinic in Kikungu, Manianga region, Lower Congo. Ancient Egypt was in Africa Kush and Meroe in Sudan synthesized medical ideas from regions to the west and south with Egyptian, Greek, Roman and ancient Near Eastern ideas and practices. Islamic \"Greek\" and \"Prophetic\" medicine reached NE Africa over 1200 years ago Scribes in this Sheik's maseed in Khartoum write Koranic verses for the preparation of medicinal and teas.Africa has known Christian healing for 2000 years The Church of the Holy Spirit in Africa, of Lower Congo, practices healing, blessing, and \"weighing of the spirit\"Post-Enlightenment Western medicine has been practiced for a century in Africa The ancient tradition of foraging for medicinal plants continues in Central Africa Kitembo, North Kongo healer -herbalist of Balari region, Luozi Territory, Lower Congo, emerges from the dense underbrush of a forest where he has harvested plants he will use in a treatment. Domestication of plants, food production, and settlement, a 3,000 year history North Kongo village of Kumbi, in Kivunda Commune, demonstrates extensive plantings in clusters behind houses. Domestication of medicinal plants: Nzoamambu Oscar, Lower Congo Nzoamambu Oscar, Kongo nganga -nkisi, left, has transplanted a herbarium of nearly 100 decorative, symbolic, household, food, and medicinal plants into his settlement. Medicinal plant collection Nganga Kitembo of Balari Commune, North Manianga, instructs chief Kusikila and Dr. Arkinstall on collection of plants for identification. A total of 183 plants were collected for identification by botanists at Lovanium University, Kinshasa.Domestication of Medicinal Plants: Kivu Research Institute, Bukavu, Eastern Congo The herbarium of the Kivu Research Institute, cultivates dozens of medicinal plants known by healers and researchers to be helpful in treatments for human and livestock conditions. Scientific research and pharmaceutical production from known medicinal plants Congolese pharmacist, author, and entrepreneur Byamungu Lufungula, left, oversees research in his pharmaceutical lab in Bukavu, where 23 products are marketed in several pharamacies in the region. Adaptations to arid regions This Fulani pastoralist in the Senegalese Sahel depends must figure out how to keep his cattle over the long dry season. Medicines for people and livestock draw from this environment and reflect understanding of the powers of plants, minerals, and substances from animals. Markets across Central Africa feature medicines from West Africa's arid regions Nganga Tambwe Antoine and his assistant purchase Sahelian and West African savanna medicinal materials at Kinshasa market from a member of the large Hausa community of merchants.*-puta-, wound; *-duad -, *-donda -,to suffer; Physical injury and existential suffering are in the ancient vocabulary of Central Africa.*-pemba -, caolin, a state of purity of body/person The notion of whiteness or clarity, often represented in caolin, is used to define a bodily, personal, or social situation that is transparent, open, and accessible to the spirit world, as in this novice to the Zebola cult of the Upper Congo river region.*-pod-, to cleanse, to cool down The verb kupoka , meaning \"to cognate -*pod -with wide Western ) to draw out the heat of pollution, to cool down the heat of conflict and confusion in this young woman's case.\"Flow & blockage\" In Nzoamambu's anatomy of the person (see Quest for Therapy) he represents the body as a channel through which flows food and all liquids. Flow and exchange are life -giving, blockage in bodily and social functions is destructive and deadly .Dichotomy and continuum of causal attributes in Kongo thought , natural human \"... kia Nzambi\" \"... kia Muntu\" Nzambi, Nature, the order as it is Bisimbi, Water and nature spirits Bakisi, Medicine spirits Bankuyu, Errant ghosts of the dead Bakulu, Ancestor shades fixed lineage cemetery Bandoki, Human witches powerful mostly malific Bantu, Human responsibility and social conflict*-dok-, *-dog-, the power of words and will This proto -Bantu cognate everywhere in Bantu languages conveys the power of language and will. In Kikongo, ku-loka means to take an oath or swear; in Zulu, kuthaka has the same meaning. This concept of the power of language and the intention behind it is used to describe powerful persons, ndoki , who have kindoki , or in Zulu, buthakani. Chiefs and kings and powerful orators have this. With colonialism, ndoki took on a negative connotation of \"witch\" and kindoki of witchcraft. *-zambi -, *-yambe -, *-kulu-, *-lunga Multiple terms for God suggest relatively late appearance of monotheism and of this source of causal attribution in illness.Kongo medicine categories techniques with invoked or spiritual linkage; ngoma/nkonko ,corporate drums and curing societies How the elements are combined: All ngoma or nkonko are min'kisi; all bilongo contain minti and makaya; s ome bilongo are not plant substances; many makaya and minti are not part of c ognates, -,-kayi-.Bilongo compounds Mama Mankomba draws sap from a cactus tree which she will mix with soapy water for a purgative to treat congestive heart failure. Bilongo compounds range from this relatively simple to up to a dozen ingredients, such as Mankomba's follow -up treatment that incorporates seven different plants. Bilongo -asperges Collection of historic asperges from ca. 1920s in Kimpese Museum, Lower Congo Zablon, nganga lunga , applies medicine to area that he will massage. This asperge contains three plants.Nkisi, Minkisi: An nkisi is a technique, in Kongo historical thinking, that derives its power from ancestral or spiritual sources, revealed to an individual, or purchased from such an individual, or transmitted in a family or to an apprentice by a master nganga. The nkisi usually has a container or instrument, which may be a sack, a sculpture (as shown here), or an object suggestive of a technique or medicine (as the asperge shown here on the back of a personified nkisi). The nkisi is considered to be personified, with a name, and highly individualized attributes. Like an Orthodox icon, the nkisi must be used in its original revelation, or else it loses its power, is ineffective, or dangerous. This nkisi is in the Kimpese Museum in Lower Congo. *-kiti-, *-kici- As it distribution suggests, this cognate is of Western Bantu derivation after the spread of cultivators from the Cameroon Highlands. In its NW distribution it denotes charm, container, technique with a spirit source; in its SE expansion it denotes spirit, and spirit possessed healing.Nkisi Mpolo, the cupping horn With the cupping horn, one kuhola mpoka , to suck with mpolo, to purify the polluted individual. Impurities result from broken social codes and relational observances. The cupping horn is used to suck impurity from the body through cut made in the skin with a razor. In Nkisi Mpolo the purity of the individual is considered a way to return to right relationships. Nganga nkisi Bayindula here sucks at cuts in the patient's joints, where he has made incisions and thus \"traced her personhood\" *-goma -, *-ngoma, drum, performance The widespread distribution of this cognate indicates its proto -Bantu status. However, the restricted distribution of ngoma as song -dance performance suggests an Eastern Bantu development of the \"drum of affliction\" *-ganga, * -ganga, doctor, medicine The widespread distribution of both meanings of this term suggests a proto -Bantu origin and Western and Eastern Bantu expansion, with subsequent inventions and adaptations of many kinds of practices and medicines. *-banda -, *-mbanda -, spirit, healer *-buka -, heal, divine The distribution of these terms for spirit, healer, healing and divining, support their origin and spread in Western Bantu societies. Banda is particularly prevalent in the Great Lakes Kubandwa cult, in Angola, and in New World forms in Brazilian Umbanda.Divination The ngombo divining basket is a classical technique of the Western Equatorial & Southern Savanna regions .*-gido-, -gida-, - gidu-, prohibitions This concept is rooted in the verb *- gid-, to interdict, refuse, to create interdiction, abstain from food, activities, contacts. Many health - related practices incorporate such prohibitions. The distribution of the root suggests it is of proto -Bantu origin, and therefore a widespread and deep concept in common culture and awareness.Diseases & their Etiologies in Rwanda Causes Physical Mystical Broken prohibitions PoisoningDiseases Parasitic Microbial Systemic Accidents Claver Rwangabo, Ph.D PharmacologyThe quest for therapy The Kin group meeting episodes marked with an asterisk indicate that the kin groups sought the assistance of a inspirational diviner or ngunza to sort out the issues and to determine the appropriate next step.African healers in public health education These South African sangoma healers participate in an AIDS training workshop sponsored by USAID, typical of many similar programs. Healers are generally able to promote prevention of risky behaviors in the language and concepts of the common people.Healing in the aftermath of war Reburial of the remains, and reverent commemoration of those massacred in the Rwandan genocide calms the community. The survivors of those who died a violent death are less inclined to visit vengeance upon the perpetrators. "}
