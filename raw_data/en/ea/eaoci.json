I am very excited to be part of the Scheideman Chiropractic team. I've lived in the area since 2000, been in practice since 2001. I am originally from Mantorville, Minnesota. My husband Ryan and I along with our four children Wyatt, Tucker, Myles, and Griffin reside in Otsego.

With strong adjusting skills and an empathetic approach, I hope to strengthen the foundation that Dr. Brent has created. I am especially excited to work in a clinic with strong rehabilitation and nutritional programs. I truly believe that this multi-directional approach to healing will give our patients superior results. I first knew I wanted to become a chiropractor after my first chiropractic adjustment.

Chiropractic has been such a rewarding profession, allowing me to help thousands of people and educate them about chiropractic. The same way I was helped and educated. I look forward to meeting you and helping you to reach your true "}
