Health- care practitioners can now receive clinically useful safety information on medical products from FDA by: - Subscribing to FDA's MedWatch - Downloading audio broadcasts (podcasts) During the past several years, the FDA indicates that they have been working to harness informatics, with the goal of achieving an electronic environment for all of their regulatory activities, including commu- nicating timely safety information to providers and patients. For example: - In January 2006, FDA began making update prescription drug labels available to physi- cians free of charge through the National Library of Medicine's DailyMed Web site at http://dailymed .nlm.nih.go v - In March 2007, the FDA hosted a public meet- ing to explore opportunities for collabora- tions with private healthcare organizations to develop a nationwide electronic network sup- porting rapid access to, and analysis of, med- ical product adverse events and the dissemi- nation of timely risk communications. According to the FDA, drug and device manu- facturers are also turning to electronic methods to disseminate safety information to healthcare pro- fessionals in a timely, targeted, and secure manner. The FDA supports the use of electronic methods to disseminate medical product safety information, whether it is by industry or the FDA itself. If you would like additional information about FDA activi- ties in this area, please contact Dr. Norman Marks at safetyinformation@f da.hhs .govor 301-827-1512.The board has recently reviewed an increasing number of disciplinary cases related to failure by licensees to meet the continuing education requirements that are mandated by law and spelled out in administrative rules. As a reminder, here are pertinent facts related to audits of continuing edu- cation. The board randomly selects licensees from the pool of those who renew on time each month. The board also audits all persons who renew late, between the expiration of the license and the 15th of the following month. And the board re-audits all persons who submitted late credit in a previous audit. Any licensee who fails to submit materials requested in a continuing education audit, or who fails to submit make-upFAILURE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION AUDITS credit to cover any deficits found in an audit, are routed to the enforcement division. Failure to comply can result in fines of $50 for each missing contact hour, up to a maximum of $1000. Failure to pay the fine, and to submit additional con- tact hours required by the board through disciplinary action, can result in suspension of the license until these conditions are met.Page 4 - Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter - February, March, April 2008 QUESTIONS ABOUT CONTACT Your license renewal or reactiva- Phone 515-281-3264 tion in process Chris.osman@io wa.go v Lost/stolen licenses License Verification Name/address changes Phone 515-281-4826 Application for license renewal or ibon@io wa.go v reactivation Inactive status Application forms for licensure Phone 515-281-6488 examination or endorsement newnurs@io wa.go v ARNP application and renewal Foreign applicants for licensure Your application in process Continuing education rules Phone 515-281-8808 Continuing Education provider Chr is.New ell@io wa.go v rules Special approval of Continuing Phone 515-281-8258 Education courses Donna.Br own@io wa.go v Audits Disciplinary issues Phone 515-281-6472 Sanctioned cases enforce@io wa.go v Roster and label orders Iowa Board of Nursing newsletter Phone 515-281-4823 Margaret.Armagost@io wa.go v Scope of nursing practice in Iowa Phone 515-281-4828 nsg prac@io wa.go v Formal nursing education in Iowa 515-281-4828 NCLEX\u00ae test modifications nsgeduc@io wa.go v Lynn.Linder@io wa.go v NCLEX accommodationsCOMMUNICATING WITH THE IOWA BOARD OF NURSING The Iowa Board of Nursing requests that licensees and the public use the board web site www.sta te.ia.us/nursing or telephone verification system 515-281-3255 for 24- hour access to online license renewal and verification, address changes and general information.

Questions may be directed to 515-281-6488 or newnurs@io wa.go vNURSE LICENSURE COMPACT The Iowa Board of Nursing is pleased to be a member of the nurse licensure compact. This new form of licensure and regulation will better protect the public by: Allowing competent nurses to provide care both physical- ly and electronically wherever care is needed; Providing the public ready access to and a choice of qual- ified nurses; Protecting clients against incompetent nurses or unsafe nursing care through better communication between boards of nursing, cooperative disciplinary investigations and prompt reporting of disciplinary action; Benefiting employers of nurses by having a more mobile workforce and a convenient centralized database for verifica- tion of licensure credentials. Understanding the Basics \u0013KThe nurse licensure compact allows a nurse who resides in a compact state to hold ONE license in the nurse's primary state of residence and practice in all other states in which the compact is in effect. Primary state of residence is where the nurse holds a driver's license, pays taxes and/or votes. \u0013KThe compact requires the nurse to practice according to the laws and regulations of the state in which the nurse provides care where the patient is located at the time the care is provided. The practice laws and regulations for many states are available online. \u0013KA nurse who is under discipline may be in a monitoring agreement, which restricts practice across state lines. \u0013KIf you hold a license in a COMPACT state and RESIDE in that COMPACT state, your license is a multistate license which authorizes you to practice in any other compact state. \u0013KIf you hold a license in a COMPACT state, but do not RESIDE in that compact state (reside in a non-compact state), your license is a single state license and it authorizes you to practice only in that compact state. For example, if you hold an Iowa nursing license, but do not live in Iowa, the license is a single state license and does not grant you the privilege to practice in any other state. \u0013KIf you are licensed in both Iowa and another compact state and RESIDE in the other compact state, your Iowa nurs- ing license will be administratively placed on inactive status immediately. Only one active license can be held by a licens- ee among the compact states. \u0013KThe compact does not supersede federal law. There- fore if you are employed in military service or work for the federal government, you may continue to hold a nursing license in any state you choose. If you are working as a nurse in a nongovernmental capacity, you are required to contact the state board of nursing in that state to determine if a nurs- ing license is required. \u0013KIf you move from one compact state to another com- pact state and practice nursing, you must obtain a license in your new home state. However, you may continue to prac- tice under the former home state license and the multistate licensure privilege in the new home state for a period not t o exceed 30 da ys. a. The 30-days shall begin with the date of hire/employment in the new primary state of resi- dence. b. If the licensee begins employment before changing primary state of residence, the 30-days begins upon the date that the licensee establishes the new pri- mary state of residence. For updates on compact information or a list of compact states go to: www.ncsbn.or g/nlc/inde x.aspFebruary, March, April 2008 - Iowa Board of Nursing Newsletter - Page 11 LPN SUPERVISION IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES In order for an LPN to supervise in an intermediate or skilled health care facility, the LPN MUST satisfactorily com- plete the board approved LPN Supervisory Course within six (6) months of employment in the supervisory role. The course is designed specifically for the supervision role in the long term care patient setting. A board approved nursing program or an approved provider of continuing education must provide the course. The area community colleges offer courses. It is the responsibility of the licensed practical nurse to maintain his or her certificate documenting completion of the course. A licensed practical nurse is entitled to supervise without the educational requirement outlined above if the licensed practical nurse was performing in a supervisory role on or before October 6, 1982. Verification is required. If licensees are unable to obtain the course within the first six months of employment, the LPN must write to the Board explaining the reason a waiver of the LPN Supervisory Course is being requested. Licensed practical nurses who are enrolled full-time in a registered nurse program are not exempt from the course. However, an LPN who is a full-time student in an RN program and/or who is scheduled to graduate within one year, may request a waiver by writing to the board office. The request for a waiver must state the number of credit hours to be taken each semester and include the student's expected date of graduation. Individuals who do not graduate from the RN program as scheduled or who are not successful on the RN-NCLEX\u00aemust take the next available course.LICENSE RENEWAL . . . ONLINE The Iowa Board of Nursing has made renewing licenses easier for many nurses in Iowa through online license renew- al. Although many nurses are taking advantage of this serv- ice, there are still many more nurses who could benefit from it. There are many advantages to online renewal including: \u0013It is easy. Just go to the website at: www.iowa.go v/nursing \u0013All you need is your license number, social security number, date of birth, MasterCard, VISA or a debit card. Answer all the questions. Pay the $104.00 fee, which includes a $5.00 online convenience fee. \u0013It is fast. Once the online renewal process is complete your license is immediately renewed and will be mailed in three to five working days. \u0013It is convenient. You can renew on your computer at home, at midnight or on a holiday if you choose. If you do not have a computer at home, you could renew on the computer at your local library or at your work place. \u0013Your information is secured/masked to protect your privacy. \u0013Online renewal reduces errors. The system will not let you move forward until all questions are answered. \u0013Online renewal is available for RNs and LPNs only.\u0013Late online renewal is also available through the 15th of the month following the expiration date on the wallet card.
