Focusing on your wholistic wellness is an important way to minimize your risk of getting cancer. There are many connections between your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. For example, outdoor activities like gathering plants, fishing or hunting benefit you physically, but they also support your mind and spirit. A number of factors influence your chances of getting cancer, such as genetics, your age and what you eat. These are often referred to as risk factors. Some risk factors, such as genetics and age, are outside of your control. Others, like the food you eat or your activity levels, are within your control and can be influenced by healthy environments and strong support systems. You can positively impact your health and well-being by doing activities that make you feel balanced and spending time with people who make you feel good. Each person's wellness priorities and journey will be different, and should be respected.Doing things for your wellness can help you at any age and any stage - including when you are healthy and when you are healing. Your health and wellness are influenced by the world around you, including your family, community and the land and environments in which you live and work. Think about how you can support your own wellness while also connecting with your family, community and environment as part of your overall health and wellness journey.

Many Indigenous communities and individuals have experienced - and continue to experience - trauma. It is possible to heal and transform trauma. Participating in land-based practices and drawing on the support of traditional knowledge keepers, cultural leads, Elders and family are some pathways for healing. Being active Being active is an important part of wellness. Even small amounts of exercise make a big difference, and they benefit your mental health too. Walking is a great way to get started. If there are children and youth in your life, you can do physical activities with them. This is a fantastic way to strengthen your relationships with them while being a good role model for an active lifestyle. Eating well Eating well is about more than just the foods we put in our bodies. Food is a way of sharing health, strengthening family and community connections, claiming sovereignty, giving back, demonstrating resilience and sharing information, culture and language. Try eating foods from the land, whether traditionally harvested or locally grown. Choosing a variety of different foods (such as unprocessed foods like fruit, vegetables, beans, grains, eggs, lean meats, fish and wild game) is the easiest way to meet our nutrient and energy needs. When you're thirsty, make water your first choice to stay hydrated. Gathering, preparing and eating food together is a family-strengthening activity. Ask for support from a health provider if you need more information about shopping on a budget, gardening, gathering traditional foods, canning and cooking. You can also call 8-1-1 to speak with a registered dietitian. Nurturing your mind and spirit Nurturing your mind and spirit is an essential part of wholistic wellness as mental and physical health are closely interconnected. It can be helpful to seek out support to heal from trauma, manage stress and find balance. Spending time in nature, participating in cultural activities and being with people you trust and look up to can bring greater peace and confidence. Connecting with Elders, knowledge keepers and healers can support your spiritual wellness. Smudging, brushings, sweat lodges, spirit baths, traditional dancing and drumming are examples of cultural activities or ceremony that can support your mind and spirit. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 9 >Healing from trauma >Being active >Eating well >Nurturing your mind and spiritCancer prevention pathways 10 | COMMUNITY MEMBERCancer prevention pathways Respecting tobacco Respecting tobacco means respecting the cultural uses of the natural tobacco plant within some First Nations communities and reducing the use of addictive commercial tobacco like cigarettes and chewing tobacco. It can be challenging to quit commercial tobacco and it may take many attempts to reach this goal. To learn about medications that can support your decision to quit commercial tobacco, call First Nations Health Benefits at 1-855-550-5454. Getting the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Getting the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is one of the best ways to prevent cervical cancer and other cancers of the anus, throat, mouth, penis, vagina and vulva. This vaccine helps your body prepare for and fight the virus that can trigger these kinds of cancer. The vaccine is available to all children at 11 to 12 years of age as well as eligible adults. Call First Nations Health Benefits at 1-855-550-5454 to learn more about vaccine coverage.Reducing alcohol Reducing alcohol can decrease your chances of getting cancer and other chronic diseases. Thinking about how much alcohol you drink, and how often and why you drink, is the first step in setting mindful goals, such as planning when to drink and setting a drink maximum based on factors specific to you and your circumstances. Talk to your health care provider about how much alcohol is best for you based on your age, your health and any other factors you and your health care provider consider important. Finding ways other than alcohol to manage stress, like going on a walk with a friend, can help. Reducing your alcohol consumption can have positive impacts on the wholistic health of you, your family and your community. Practicing sun safety Practicing sun safety protects your skin and eyes and reduces your chances of having cancer of these body parts. Setting an example and helping children and youth practice sun safety is important, as sunburns during childhood greatly increase the risk of skin cancer later in life. A good way to catch skin cancer is to regularly check your skin for irregular-looking moles or marks. Make it a habit on your outings to put on sunscreen, slip on a shirt, slap on a hat, slide on sunglasses and seek shade! HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 11 >Respecting tobacco >Getting the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine >Reducing alcohol >Being sun safe Cancer prevention pathways 12 | COMMUNITY MEMBERCancer prevention: Spotlight on the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common virus that is easily spread through intimate touching and sexual activity. Some types of HPV infections can cause cancer. Getting HPV vaccines as a preteen or adult can help prevent these cancers from developing. HPV infection is related to: >Almost all cases of cervical cancers >About 80%-90% of anal cancers >40% of vaginal and vulvar cancers >40%-50% of penile cancers >25%-35% of mouth and throat cancers >Over 90% of genital warts The HPV vaccine can help prevent cancers of the cervix, anus, mouth, throat, penis, vagina and vulva. The vaccine helps prepare the body to fight off an HPV infection if the body is later exposed to this virus. All people benefit from the HPV vaccine. It is available to all children starting at 11 to 12 years of age to build immune protection early. HPV vaccines are given as two or three doses over a six-month time period. The HPV vaccine is well studied and safe. HPV vaccination is offered for free to: >All children in Grade 6 >Youth/adults born in 2006 or later who missed their Grade 6 vaccination >HIV positive people between the ages of 9 and 26 >Transgender or two-spirit people between the ages of nine and 26 >Males between the ages 9 and 26 who: >are not yet sexually active but are questioning their sexual orientation >have sex with other men The HPV vaccine is helpful for all people.

A key question you may wish to ask is whether there are any potential interactions between the medicines you are taking or may need to take. Mental wellness and culturally grounded care Thinking about having a cancer screening test or waiting for screening results can bring up many thoughts and feelings. You may want to draw on the supports that are right for you. That could mean reaching out to a friend, health care provider, family member or Elder/cultural support person; going for a walk; or doing an activity that grounds you. Cultural and traditional health practices can help you prepare for a cancer screening appointment. Talking to an Elder, receiving a brushing, or participating in ceremony before or after a cancer screening procedure might be helpful for you. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 15Friends, family, Elders, knowledge keepers and mental health providers can provide you with support during cancer screening. Cultural and traditional health practices can help prepare you or make you feel safe for cancer screening. Talk to your health care providers about your wishes and decisions.Mental wellness and culturally grounded care 16 | COMMUNITY MEMBERCultural safety in health care Colonialism and discrimination continue today in the health care system. There is a need to improve cultural safety and humility in health care services, from cancer prevention and screening through to survivorship and end of life. Culturally grounded health resources like this flipbook are one way of supporting safer care. Cultural safety is the outcome when a community member feels safe and respected when receiving health information and care in an environment free of racism and discrimination. Person-centered decision-making is central to culturally safe care. Person-centered decision-making means community members receive reliable health information, have the safety and space to ask questions and share perspectives, and have their beliefs, priorities and decisions respected by their health providers. This flipbook aims to promote respectful conversations about cancer screening and to offer reliable and easy to understand information to support community members in their decisions about cancer screening. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 17The goal of cultural safety is for all people to feel safe and respected when receiving health information and care in an environment that is free of racism and discrimination. Cultural safety in health care 18 | COMMUNITY MEMBERYou have the right to receive respectful and high-quality care when accessing cancer screening. Your questions, priorities and concerns matter.

It is important to know that cancer can be: >preventable >detectable (it can be found with tests) >treatable >beatable (you can recover from cancer) Stay in touch with your body and see your health care provider as soon as possible if you have symptoms that could be a sign of cancer. Your symptoms may not be cancer at all, but a checkup and tests can help you know more. Cancer symptoms could include things like: >A change in bowel or bladder habits >A sore that doesn't heal >Unusual bleeding or discharge >A lump or swelling of the breast or other body part >A nagging cough >Indigestion or trouble swallowing >Skin changes >A recent change in a wart or mole >Unexplained weight loss or gain >Unexplained fever, tiredness or painCancer is a disease that starts in our cells. It can occur in almost any organ or tissue of the body. Cancer happens when a damaged or abnormal cell is not repaired by our body. The cancer cell is able to make copies of itself and these damaged cells can grow quickly and take over nearby tissues and organs. Over time, cancer cells can clump together and spread to other parts of the body. If you are not sure, speak with your health care provider. Regular cancer screening is the best way to identify cancer early on. Knowing the results of your screening tests will enable you to make informed decisions about your health.

That's why it's important to pay attention to potential cancer symptoms and to be screened regularly for cancer. What is cancer? 26 | COMMUNITY MEMBERFirst Nations cancer trends in BC In BC, we can learn from First Nations-specific cancer data. Trends in screening rates and cancer diagnoses are essential to understand the health and wellness of First Nations people across BC and to support strategies and services that better meet local needs. We are seeing an increase in certain cancers among First Nations people. For many types of cancer, there is a lower chance of survival after diagnosis for First Nations people in BC. This signals a need to ask more questions about access to health care and the responsiveness of the health system. It is important to note that as more First Nations people participate in cancer screening, the number of cancer diagnoses may increase. We expect to see an increase in cancer diagnoses when screening rates go up because the purpose of screening is to find cancer in the body. Without screening, some cancers would be left undiagnosed. Cancer information that is important for First Nations people in BC to know about includes: >Rates of cervical cancer and colorectal cancer are higher among First Nations people in BC compared to other residents >First Nations men and women have an increasing rate of lung cancer >Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers among First Nations women and people with breasts >Some cancers, such as cervical cancer, are diagnosed later in their progression in First Nations in BC, illustrating the need for greater access to primary care and screening >First Nations people in BC have a lower rate of overall cancer diagnoses compared to other residents, when looking at all types of cancer diagnoses together. This may be due to a number of reasons, including lower screening rates. The FNHA is exploring these reasons further >Access to care can be affected by physical distance, the availability of trusted health providers, the safety and trustworthiness of providers and service, and individuals' past experiences with health services >Early access to screening and treatment may contribute to positive health outcomes, such as increased survival rates after diagnosis. More work is needed to support cultural safety and humility in the health system, and to increase the availability of screening and care in all areas throughout BC, including in rural and remote areas Source: www.fnha.ca/WellnessSite/WellnessDocuments/Cancer-and-First-Nations-Peoples-in-BC.PDF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 27There are higher rates of the following cancers among First Nations people in BC: >Colorectal cancer >Cervical cancer For many types of cancer, there is a lower chance of survival after diagnosis for First Nations people in BC. More research needs to be done on access to care and cultural safety.First Nations cancer trends in BC 28 | COMMUNITY MEMBERWhat is cancer screening? There are many ways to screen for cancer Cancer screening looks at what's going on inside your body as you age. It can involve X-ray images of body parts, or analyzing samples of blood, cells or stool. The goal of cancer screening is to find cancer early, before you have symptoms and before the cancer has a chance to grow and spread. Early detection can help improve your chances for effective treatment and recovery. Cancer screening is available to people in specific age groups or who have certain known risk factors. You may need to get cancer screening more often if you have a family history of cancer or have higher personal health risks. Your health care provider can let you know what kind of screenings you should have and how often you should be screened. Getting screened regularly can bring peace of mind for you and your family. Many cancer screening tests come back with no concerns. If your cancer screening test results come back with irregularities, this does not mean that you have cancer. It means more testing is needed to learn more about what is happening in your body. Talk to your health care provider about what the screening results mean for you and the potential next steps. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 29Cancer screening refers to different tests used to look for signs of cancer in your body. The goal of cancer screening is to find cancer early, before you have symptoms and before the cancer has a chance to grow and spread. Many cancers can be treated more easily and with better chances of a good recovery if they are found early or before they have a chance to develop. Even if you do not have a family history of cancer, it's important to get regular cancer screenings to protect your health.What is cancer screening? 30 | COMMUNITY MEMBERPreparing for screening Going to a cancer screening appointment is an important decision for your health and wellness.

If a cancer screening test comes back with an unusual result and your doctor believes that further tests are needed, you will be referred for diagnostic testing. Diagnostic tests gather more information about what is going on in your body. They may involve a range of tests and could include collecting cell samples that will allow doctors to see what the cells in your body are doing using a microscope. Being referred for diagnostic testing does not necessarily mean that you have cancer. Some cancers can be treated more easily and with a better chance of recovery when found early with diagnostic tests. Some cancers can be prevented if found and treated early.A biopsy is a test to collect cells from a body part for analysis. This test is done by putting an instrument into the specific body part, like a needle into your breast tissue. Some tests may be uncomfortable. Be sure to ask if there are ways you can be made more comfortable during the test. Talk with your health care provider about any questions you have about cancer screening and diagnostic testing. Refer to the \"Your rights\" and \"Preparing for screening\" sections for other ideas. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 35Diagnostic testing is follow-up testing if you have an unusual screening result.

Breast cancer screening is called a mammogram. Mammograms are X-rays of the breasts. Getting regular mammograms is useful because it allows health care providers to compare images of your breast tissue over time and identify any changes early on. Mammograms can find potentially cancerous lumps when they are very small and you cannot feel them. Finding cancerous lumps when they are small means the cancer is less likely to have spread and is more likely to be treated with good results. Mammograms are available for women and people with breasts who are 40 years of age and older in BC. A mammogram is recommended every two years, but if your mom, sister or daughter has had breast cancer, you should be screened every year.

CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING Cervical Cancer ScreeningCervical screening The cervix is a doughnut-shaped organ that connects the vagina and the uterus. Menstrual blood during your period comes from your uterus and is shed through your cervix. Cervical cancer screening is done with a Pap test. A Pap test involves taking a swab of your cervical cells, which are then sent to a lab for analysis with a microscope. A Pap test can find pre-cancerous or cancer cells in the cervix. If these unusual cells are found and treated early, cervical cancer can be stopped from growing and you have better chances of a good recovery. Women and people with a cervix who are between the ages of 25 and 69 should get a Pap test every three years. Making time to get regular Pap tests is an important step in taking charge of your health. Pap tests are done in a clinic. You should have a Pap test if: >You've been through menopause and are under 70 >You've ever been sexually active, even if you are not sexually active right now >You've had the HPV vaccine >You're in a same-sex relationship >You're a transgender or two-spirit person with a cervix Currently, First Nations people in BC have a higher rate of cervical cancer than other residents.

It is the lower part of your digestive system where your body absorbs water and nutrients from broken down food and moves waste out of your body as stool. Colon screening helps to catch cancer at its early stages. Early detection is key when it comes to colon cancer and can lead to more successful treatments. When colon cancer is found at its earliest form, there is a 90 percent chance of recovery and survival. First Nations men and women in BC have higher rates of colon cancer than the other residents, making it very important to screen for colon cancer. Colon screening is recommended every two years for people between the ages of 50 and 74. Colon cancer screening can be done using a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), which involves collecting a sample of your stool to be looked at under a microscope for signs of blood. For people with a significant family history of colon cancer or with a personal history of colon growths (polyps), a different screening test called a colonoscopy is recommended every three to five years, depending on each person's situation. A referral from a doctor or nurse practitioner is needed for both types of screening. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 59FNHA.ca/Cancer Screen for colon cancer regularly. Early detection can save your life.

The entire visit takes between two and three hours, and the procedure itself will take 20-45 minutes. You will be given instructions about what you can eat and drink before the test. You will also be given a prescription for a laxative that you will need to pick up from a pharmacy several days before the colonoscopy. You will take the laxative to clear the stool out of your body so that your colon is easy to see. On the day of the screening, you will be asked to put on a hospital gown. You will be given medication through a vein to make you sleepy and help you feel comfortable during the procedure. You will be asked to lie down and a doctor will put a tube with a small camera into your anus and up into your colon to see inside. Tissue samples or growths in your colon may be removed and looked at under a microscope. The colonoscopy can make you feel gassy or cause cramping. You will need someone to bring you home after as you may be sleepy.

Lung screening may help to identify cancer early. Early detection is key when it comes to lung cancer and can lead to more successful treatments. Early detection of lung cancer can increase the chances of survival by 20 per cent. Lung cancer symptoms usually do not appear until the cancer has grown and spread, so being screened to catch things early on is important. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in BC. Cancer data shows that lung cancer diagnoses among First Nations people in BC have increased in recent years. Lung screening is recommended for people who are 55 to 74 years of age and who have a smoking history of 20 years or more.To contact the Lung Screening Program, call 1-877-717-5864. You will be sked a series of questions about your age, overall health and smoking habits. If you have an increased risk of lung cancer, you may be encouraged to have low-dose x-rays taken of your lungs. Reducing or quitting smoking is an important way to take care of your lungs. There are resources to help you on this journey. www.fnha.ca/Documents/FNHA-Are-You-Trying-To- Stop-Smoking-Or-Vaping.pdf HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 71 FNHA.ca/Cancer HONOUR YOUR ANCESTORS Screen for lung cancer regularly.

They will ask you questions about your smoking and health history. These questions will assess your overall health and chances of getting lung cancer. You do not need to answer any question(s) you are uncomfortable with. If you smoke and are interested in quitting, you will receive information to help you quit commercial tobacco use. If you are considered to have a greater chance of getting lung cancer, the next step will be to get an appointment for a lung scan through a referral. The scan will be at a hospital. During your scan, you will lie on a table and a doughnut-shaped scanner will take pictures of your lungs. The scan takes less than 10 seconds and is not painful. You will rest your arms above your head and hold your breath for a few seconds while the scan is happening. You can wear your own clothes during the scan, but you must remove metal objects, such as a belt or a bra with underwire. Loose-fitting clothing is recommended.

There are three main ways to treat cancer. Surgery: The physical cutting out and removal of cancer from the body, possibly including the removal of nearby tissue and glands. Cancer drugs (chemotherapy): The use of powerful drugs to kill unusual cancer cells in your body. Chemotherapy drugs can be given by pills, shots, creams, medicine through your veins or directly on your tumour. Radiation: The use of high-intensity energy waves to kill unusual cancer cells and shrink tumours in your body. Radiation is applied directly on the cancer through a beam from a machine. Cancer treatment options depend on factors like the type, size, stage and spread of the cancer. Your cancer care providers will share information about the treatment options that are available to you. They are there to answer your questions and support your decisions. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER | 81Treatment may involve travelling to a special cancer centre or other locations for care.
