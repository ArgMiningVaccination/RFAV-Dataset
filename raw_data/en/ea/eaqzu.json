These foods can boost your body's natural ability to heal and fight off certain illnesses.", "sitename": "Greatist", "date": "2020-05-15", "cleaned_text": "Remember a time when we chose ingredients based solely on how they tasted? Now, in the midst of a global pandemic, it's no surprise you're looking to fill your virtual grocery cart with anything that gives your immune system an extra kick in the pants. Eating a bunch of superfoods won't keep COVID-19 away. But filling your diet with immune-boosting foods is a gold star move for your overall health, regardless. What makes an immune-boosting food? A combo of powerful antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, protein, and plant compounds that help your beautiful bod keep the nasties at bay. Here are 22 to ease your mind: These bad boys bring more than a little crunch to your salad. Bell peppers are bursting with [vitamin C](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-benefits). This antioxidant actually boosts the activity of [phagocytes](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/fun-facts), immune cells that can \"swallow\" nasty bacteria. It also helps out your [lymphocytes](https://www.healthline.com/health/lymphocytes), a type of immune cell that can attack enemies in your blood. Pro tip: Reach for color. A cup of chopped red bell pepper has [190 milligrams](https://g.co/kgs/1eKxR4) of [vitamin C](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-benefits) \u2014 more than double your daily recommended intake \u2014 and a whole yellow one packs 341 milligrams. Vitamin C can get destroyed with heat, so enjoy them raw for the biggest boost. Yep, still talking about [vitamin C](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-benefits). Since your bod doesn't produce or store it, you'll need to get it in a variety of ways. It's not all about oranges! Lemons, limes, grapefruit, tangerines, and clementines are all bomb sources of cold- and infection-fighting vitamin C. Pro tip: While we're #blessed by citrus all year round, this fruit group really shines in the winter. Give cold and flu season a kick out the door with a [winter citrus salad](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013001-winter-citrus-salad-with-honey-dressing), which keeps vitamin C-destroying heat away from the goods. Grab your crab crackers! Some shellfish are super high in [zinc](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/zinc), an essential mineral (meaning you don't produce it naturally or store it) that is responsible for the development and function of your immune cells. Zinc promotes healthy inflammation response, can shorten a cold, and reduces [oxidative stress](https://www.healthline.com/health/oxidative-stress) \u2014 the imbalance of [free radicals and antioxidants](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explainedhttps://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained). Your best bets for zinc are: - lobster - crab - clams - oysters - mussels Pro tip: Aim for 8 milligrams (for women) or 11 milligrams (for men) a day. Just be careful not to overdo it \u2014 too much of this good thing can actually slow your immune system's roll. Tiny as they may be, sunflower seeds pack a serious punch of [vitamin E](https://www.healthline.com/health/all-about-vitamin-e), a powerful [antioxidant](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained) that helps your body fight off infection. Adults should aim for 15 milligrams of vitamin E a day, but it only takes an ounce of these little guys to help you hit 49 percent of that. Pro tip: Toss shelled seeds on top of salads, add them to your fave granola mix, or try your hand at [homemade sunflower butter](https://detoxinista.com/how-to-make-sunflower-seed-butter-oil-free/). Gingerol (real creative guys...) is the active ingredient in [ginger](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-ginger) that's been shown to [help fight infections](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23123794/), including the [RSV virus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23123794/). Along with the [there's evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665023/) that other compounds like shoagols and paradols contribute to the anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-oxidative benefits of this powerful root. Some animal studies also suggest ginger can help protect brain function. Pro tip: Brew some immune-boosting tea, whip up a [ginger health tonic](https://wholefully.com/honey-ginger-lemonade-health-tonic/), or up your rice game with this [sizzled ginger rice](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/sizzled-ginger-rice). [Garlic](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-health-benefits-of-garlic) has been hailed for its medicinal properties for literal centuries, but modern scientists now know the secret sauce lies in special sulfur compounds like allicin, diallyl disulfide, and S-Allyl cysteine that get released when garlic is crushed, chewed, or chopped. These unique compounds [give white blood cells a disease-fighting boost](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417560/) and [reduce the severity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22280901/) of colds and flu. It's also full of [antioxidants](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained) and may even [help get rid of heavy metals](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-7843.2011.00841.x). Pro tip: Heat could damage those sulfur compounds, so crush your garlic and let it stand for 10 minutes before throwing it in the pan. Mom wasn't moonlighting as a [broccoli](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/broccoli) pusher just to be a jerk. These little trees are seriously one of the most nutrient-packed veggies you can put on a plate. Along with high levels of [potassium](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-does-potassium-do), [folate](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate), and a bunch of [antioxidants](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained), broccoli is a great source of immune-boosting [vitamin C](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-benefits). Pro tip: Just don't scorch the stuff, or you'll lose that disease-fighting power. This [broccoli Caesar salad](http://bonappetit.com/recipe/broccoli-caesar) keeps all that vitamin C intact and couldn't be farther from a sad side of steamed stalks. Get those live and active cultures, baby! All that good [probiotic](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/probiotics-101) bacteria in yogurt has been shown to help [stimulate and regulate your immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5418745/) and help kick it in the anti-inflammatory direction. But get outta here with those fake, sugar-laden flavors. Instead, try a stir of natural, [antiviral honey](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/manuka-honey-uses-benefits) for a extra sweetness. Pro tip: Plain yogurt not your jam? Here are [5 healthy yogurt parfaits](https://thecleaneatingcouple.com/5-healthy-yogurt-parfaits/) to up your breakfast/lunch/snack game. [Spinach](/eat/spinach-recipes/) is another vitamin C overachiever. It's also chock full of [antioxidants](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained) and [beta carotene](https://www.healthline.com/health/beta-carotene-benefits), which could give your immune system's infection-fighting abilities a boost. Like broccoli, you'll get the most out of spinach when it's eaten raw or cooked as gently as possible \u2014 light cooking helps release nutrients like [vitamin A](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-a). Pro tip: Here's a [spinach salad](https://sweetphi.com/spinach-salad-dressing-recipe/) you'll actually look forward to making and eating. We already talked about how [vitamin E](https://www.healthline.com/health/all-about-vitamin-e) is key to helping your body fight the nasties, but almonds are especially awesome: Vitamin E is fat-soluble, so it needs fat in order to be absorbed. [Almonds](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-proven-benefits-of-almonds) are full of [good fats](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-super-healthy-high-fat-foods) \u2014 around 14 grams per ounce \u2014 that help deliver those infection-fighting benefits. Pro tip: An ounce of almonds will check off 37 percent of your daily vitamin E goals. Try a handful as a snack, a crunchy salad topping, or try these [almond meal pancakes](https://detoxinista.com/almond-flour-pancakes/) as a [low carb](/health/how-many-carbs-per-day-to-lose-weight), high nutrient breakfast. Who are we kidding \u2014 pancakes are an all-day-every-day food. Go ham. There's a reason it's not just called *SOUP* for the soul. [Chicken](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/protein-in-chicken) is truly the magic ingredient in what could be the oldest home remedy in the book. It's not all folklore \u2014 chicken is high in [vitamin B-6](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-b6-benefits), a key player in more than 100 enzyme reactions, including those that keep your immune system firing on all cylinders. For one, it cheers on the production of [lymphocytes](http://lymphocytes). Cooking chicken releases cysteine, an amino acid that, on the chemical level, looks like the bronchitis drug [acetylcysteine](https://www.healthline.com/health/acetylcysteine-inhalation-solution). Pair that with the gut-happy [gelatin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319124) from boiling chicken bones and the mucus-thinning properties of warm liquid, and you've got yourself a fighting chance against cold and flu season. Pro tip: Here's a [healing chicken soup](http://candacekennedy.com/slow-cooker-healing-chicken-soup/) that you can make in the slow cooker. These little cuties are basically bursting with [vitamin C](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-benefits): one cup of this juicy little fruit accounts for around 273 percent (!) of your daily recommended intake. [Potassium](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-does-potassium-do), [folate](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate), and [vitamin K](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-k1-vs-k2) also contribute to [kiwifruit's](https://www.healthline.com/health/7-best-things-about-kiwi) health halo, and [one study shows](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjpp-2012-0303#.XqZ7upNKi8r) that kiwi not only support immune function, but may actually reduce the severity and the likelihood of developing cold- or flu-like sickness in higher-risk groups (like your parents). Pro tip: You could always slice 'em and start snacking, but this [kiwi sorbet](https://tasty.co/recipe/kiwi-sorbet) is way more 'grammable. [Papayas](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-proven-papaya-benefits) are another [vitamin C](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-benefits) superstar, with 224 percent of your daily reco hanging out in just one of these bad boys. This sunshiney fruit is also home to the aptly named papain, an anti-inflammatory digestive infection-causing fungi. Pro tip: Sure, they're good on their own, but have you ever thought of roasting them? Martha did. Give her [roasted papaya recipe](https://www.marthastewart.com/315387/roasted-papaya-with-brown-sugar) a shot. EGCG, a powerful natural antioxidant, is the secret sauce that makes [green tea](/eat/tea-types-beginners-guide/) a helping hand in fighting off [myriad conditions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28864169/). It works by reducing free radicals from forming in your body, which protects your cells from damage. It's also a hella anti-inflammatory. Pro tip: With every sip, you'll also benefit from the [L-theanine](https://www.healthline.com/health/l-theanine), an amino acid [shown to improve](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772912/) immunity and immune-system function. These purple berries may have skyrocketed to flu-fighting fame in the past few years, but it's not for nothing. [Sambucus](/live/alternative-medicine-cold-and-flu/), its fancy plant name, checks all the disease-fighting boxes. It's antiviral, antifungal, and [evidence shows](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21352539/) it's got what it takes to fight off two types of strep bacteria while working to stop the spread of the influenza virus. Pro tip: How to take it? Dealer's choice! [Gummies](https://amzn.to/3cyZByE), [lozenges](https://amzn.to/2ArcjRZ), and [syrups](https://amzn.to/2zDhE8s) are all widely available. If you're feeling adventurous, you could try your hand at [homemade elderberry syrup](https://blog.mountainroseherbs.com/elderberry-syrup-recipe). Just don't chug it, ok? [Mushrooms](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/are-mushrooms-good-for-you) a medicinal go-to for centuries. Shitake and maitake mushrooms are usually the stars of the show when we talk about healing, but let's not underestimate the humble white mushroom. These little buttons are a good source of [vitamin D](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-101) and are packed with a crazy good variety of immune-boosting [antioxidants](/health/what-are-antioxidants/), including vitamin C, tip: These [garlic butter mushrooms](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/15-minute-garlic-butter-mushrooms/) are as comforting as they are healthy. Remember when [a\u00e7ai](https://www.healthline.com/health/acai-berry-facts) was having a moment? Like other blue and purple produce, a\u00e7ai (pronounced AH-sigh-EE, BTW) berries are seriously high in antioxidants. Anthocyanins, found in the rich, dark skin of these little berries, help neutralize free radicals that could damage cells. Pro tip: That immune-boosting skin is super tough, which is why you'll find a\u00e7ai berries in the form of [pur\u00e9e or powder](https://amzn.to/2WPMW3G). Use it to create an [easy a\u00e7ai bowl](https://theforkedspoon.com/acai-bowl/) that will be as good for your insta as it is for your immune system. You thought it was just a cute summer treat, but watermelon packs a healthy punch. It's full of vitamin C, [lycopene](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lycopene) (more than tomatoes!), carotenoids (like [beta carotene](https://www.healthline.com/health/beta-carotene-benefits) that converts to vitamin A), and cucurbitacin E, an anti-inflammatory plant compound. It's also super hydrating, as a bonus. Pro tip: You can totally just grab a slice and dig in, but this [sweet and spicy grilled watermelon](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-grill-watermelon-234733) will make your brain go . [Wheat germ](https://www.healthline.com/health/wheat-germ-benefits) is solid source of [zinc](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/zinc), and [phosphorous](https://www.healthline.com/health/phosphorus-in-diet), but the big immune-booster at work here is free radical-fighting vitamin E. It's also high in [fiber](/eat/high-fiber-lunches-that-keep-you-full-til-dinner/) and good for your cardiovascular system which is never a bad thing. Pro tip: You can add it raw to smoothies, salads, and yogurt, but it's also used as a binder in baked goods. Toast it up and try it in these [wheat germ and banana muffins](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/wheat-germ-and-banana-muffins-843). [Sweet potatoes](https://greatist.com/health/carbs-in-potatoes/) have a lot going for them: they're full of fiber and healthy minerals, and there's even a good amount of vitamin C. But for your immune system, sweet potatoes deliver with three powerful antioxidants: anthocynanins (like in a\u00e7ai berries), chorlogenic acid, and which converts to A](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-a), the \"anti-inflammatory vitamin.\" Vitamin A is [crucial for](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6162863/) both the development and the regulation of your immune system, so bow down. Pro tip: When in doubt, bake 'em out. While cooking can lower the [beta carotene](https://www.healthline.com/health/beta-carotene-benefits) count, [vitamin C](/eat/how-much-vitamin-c-can-you-take-in-a-day/) Try [this healthier version](https://www.skinnytaste.com/loaded-baked-sweet-potato/) of a loaded sweet potato. Your favorite sushi bar starter is as good for you as it is tasty. [Miso](/eat/miso-recipes-that-go-beyond-soup/) is made from fermented soybeans, which means it's full of probiotics that are good for gut health and your immune system. Out of balance gut bacteria is associated with a host of issues including [IBS](/health/ibs-symptoms-in-females/), [food allergies](https://www.healthline.com/health/allergies/common-food-allergies), and even [some cancers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3695331/). And since about [70 percent of the immune system hangs out in the gut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515351/), balanced gut flora makes for a strong immune system. Pro tip: Dissolve miso in hot broth to make soup, or use it in marinades and salad dressings, like this [miso-marinated short rib](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/miso-and-mayo-marinated-short-ribs-with-spicy-sauce) situation. [Pomegranates](/eat/pomegranate-deseed-trick/) are home to powerful punicalagin, an antioxidant found in the juice and the peel. These guys have [three times](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11052704/) more antioxidant chutzpah than red wine or green tea. Pomegranates are also seriously anti-inflammatory and are shown to be [antifungal and antibacterial](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/606212/). Oh, it also has great levels of vitamin C and E, which you're now a total expert on because you made it this far.
