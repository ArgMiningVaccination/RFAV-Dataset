Executive Summary The Community Health Needs Assessment Requirement The Affordable Care Act requires hospitals to assess and address the health needs of the communities they serve. This Community Health Needs Assessment meets the first component of these requirements, providing a report of the process, methods and results of a comprehensive assessment of the needs of the community served by Montefiore Medical Center. The second component, which will be developed over the next few months, will encompass the Implementation Strategy, which will further discuss the significant health needs of the community, describe the programs and strategies to address these significant health needs, and delineate the metrics to be used to evaluate the impact of these strategies. Montefiore Medical Center's Community Commitment Montefiore is a leader in community health and has a long history of developing innovative approaches to care and tailoring programs to best serve the changing needs of its community. These include, but are not limited to the following: Community Service Plan, Community Services Strategy, Accountable Care Organization, Patient -Centered Medical Home, Disease Management Programs, and Community Outreach. The integratio n of these innovative approaches serves Montefiore well in its services to its community. Montefiore embraces its social responsibility and defines its role broadly, promoting wellness in addition to treating disease and addressing needs ranging far beyon d medical care. We extend this responsibility to the care of our employees and medical staff, many of whom live in the surrounding community. The population Montefiore serves is one of the most diverse in the nation. Montefiore has been an incubator fo r programs that improve patients' access to culturally appropriate services, and its progressive financial aid policy and robust entitlement enrollment program support access to care for those in need. Historically, Montefiore has viewed community service and community health improvement as a delivery system challenge, reaching out to serve the under -resourced. Services to the community are an explicit and essential component of Montefiore's mission and one of its most valued traditions. The medical cen ter has a long history of reaching beyond the walls of its hospitals to identify and meet the needs of its community and has been a national leader in organizing and expanding community -based services. Our commitment to the community has required a multifa ceted, continually evolving response, in which the unique capacities of the academic medical center are mobilized to improve the lives of the people and the communities we serve -- not just medically, but socially, economically and environmentally, whereve r and whenever our resources can make a difference. For much of our history, community service at Montefiore has been a vital grassroots movement. When pressing needs arose that lay beyond the purview of traditional health care, physicians, nurses, soci al workers, staff and community partners have stepped in to address them. These programs tackle a remarkable range of health problems in the Bronx; from the 5 epidemics of diabetes and obesity to high rates of teen pregnancy. They come in an equally impress ive range of sizes; from an online guide to hundreds of social services to complex federally -funded agencies with hundreds of staff. With the understanding that the practice of medicine is a service to the community, we have defined community service to i nclude those efforts at preventing disease, enhancing wellbeing and enacting social change that go beyond traditional health care and its fee -for-service reimbursement system. Montefiore participates in a variety of organized partnerships and collaborativ es, working with other providers in the Bronx, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, community -based organizations in the Bronx and members of the community in planning and developing initiatives aimed at improving the health of the pe ople of the Bronx. Definition a nd Description of the Community Montefiore has identified the Bronx as its primary service area. More than 85% of Montefiore's hospitals' discharges are residents of the Bronx, and it is within this geographic area that Mon tefiore has distributed the vast majority of its community -based primary care and specialty ambulatory services. The Bronx has been an epicenter of the asthma, HIV, and drug epidemics and also has excess mortality rates from heart disease, stroke, and dia betes compared to city -wide and national averages. As the Bronx mortality rates remain significantly high, the number of physicians in the Bronx continues to dwindle. Bronx County is New York City's first borough to have a majority of people of color and it is the only borough with a Latino majority. The Bronx is also the youngest county in New York State with 39.2% children and one of only five U.S. counties with more than 30% single family households. Furthermore, with the Bronx has qualified as a Whole County Health Professions Shortage Area (HPSA) by HRSA, since 2008, as almost half (45%) of our population is currently living in a geographic area that is a documented federally designated HPSA. Assessment of Community Health Need s The process to identi fy the needs of the community involved the collectio n of secondary and primary data . Multiple conversations and meetings were convened internally and with external partners, and a thorough review of the data was conducted , all of which will frame the d evelopment of the Implementation Strategy . In this Community Health Needs Assessment, these collaborations and partnerships are described. Multiple data sources were used to support the identification and selection of the priority items which were identi fied, selected, and reviewed with the partners. A listing and brief summary of the data sources used to complete the secondary data analysis that were used to identify the issues of concern beyond experience and direct observation are included in this rep ort. 6 The collection of primary data from a representative sample of the Bronx residents was an important element of the development of the Community Health Needs Assessment. The Bronx is an ethnically diverse borough with a population of 1.37 million that despite economic and environmental improvements since the 1970's continues to include numerous groups with difficulties such as low health literacy, limited income, English proficiency, and lack of insurance or insurance knowledge. To capture the voices of various sectors of Bronx community residents and workers from various perspectives, a mixed -methods approach to data collection consisting of online surveys, focus groups and participation in directed community forums were used . Montefiore contracted with the Bronx Health Link, a not for profit 501c3 organization in the Bronx , to facilitate the implementation of the primary data collection process for the Community Health Needs Assessment within the Bronx and to assist in the facilitation of these com munity level connections. Using data collected through Montefiore, the District Public Health Office and other sources, the impact on the community's health by the interventions implemented can be measured and analyzed. As the borough with the smallest n on-Hispanic White population in New York City, focusing on disparities is inherent in everything that Montefiore accomplishes. The priority areas selected and each of the planned interventions focus on specific priority populations and address the ethnic and cultural disparity defined in the indicators for the population served by Montefiore. Collaborations/Partnerships Through collaborations with large stakeholder partner groups and awareness of the status of Bronx County, as the county with the lowest r anking health status in New York State (62 out of 62), as reported in the 2013 County Health Rankings from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, stakeholder groups have agreed on the significant health issues impacting the community. The significant areas a re among the identified areas for which both the data and Montefiore have determined a community need. Montefiore collaborated with the New York City Department of Health as a part of identifying the Take Care New York 2016 Priorities and identifying the points of alignment between the New York State priorities, the New York City Goals and the needs identified through the Community Health Needs Assessment process. In reviewing the full list of items from New York State and New York City, it was very clear that many of their targeted areas, such as Healthy Eating: Active Living, Tobacco Free Living, and Children and Youth agenda items were areas that there was inter -organizational synergy. In addition to this collaboration with the New York City Departme nt of Health and Mental Hygiene that Montefiore had used to gain input, Montefiore worked closely with its communities and ensured that community participation occurred by working with a variety of community advisory boards (CABs). Montefiore participates in a variety of organized partnerships and collaboratives, working with other providers in the Bronx, and we worked 7 extensively with representatives of the affected communities through these CABs to identify health care needs and determine the appropriate configuration of services. Beyond the formal structure that Montefiore established to gain input from the communities it serves, the medical center participates in a variety of organized partnerships and collaboratives, working with other providers in the Bronx, the NYCDOHMH, community -based organizations in the Bronx and members of the community in planning and developing initiatives aimed at improving the health of the people of the Bronx. Montefiore has developed additional approaches to the assessment of community needs and health priorities and to the establishment of partnerships with community organizations. In addition, Montefiore developed a community level approach involving relevant organizations, which are in the specific community and are i nterested in the particular health issues being addressed. This provides for a closer alignment between the community level goals of Montefiore and the organizational goals of the community organizations. This approach is the Collective Action to Transfo rm Community Health (CATCH) Program, which is a community level coalition bringing together aspects of the community that may have a significant impact on community health. The report provides information on the individuals, groups and organizations tha t are participating in the focused Implementation Plan activities that evolve out of the CHNA process. As the CHNA process was conducted simultaneously with the New York State Community Service Plan (CSP) review, there is strong alignment between the area s of focus in this report and the areas presented in the CSP. Montefiore will continue to work with its partners on existing program initiatives . Prioritization of Community Health Needs The primary and secondary data collection process illuminated four major categories of health needs that were both important across the populations surveyed and reflected in the data as critical. The four areas identified are: (1) Improve Overall Health Status and Reduce Health Disparities, (2) Prevention of Chronic Di sease, (3) Prevent HIV/STD's Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Healthcare Associated Infections, and (4) Promotion of Healthy Women Infants and Children . Measures and Identified Resources to Meet Identified Needs Internal Resources and Measures Montefior e is a leader in community health and has a long history of developing innovative approaches to care and tailoring programs to best serve the changing needs of its community. These include, but are not limited to the following: Community Service Plan, Comm unity Services Strategy, Accountable Care Organization, Patient -Centered Medical Home, Disease Management Programs, and Community Outreach. The integration of these innovative approaches serves Montefiore well in its services to its community. 8 Montefior e has a vast portfolio of programs and services that address a majority of the significant community health needs identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment. The breadth and depth of the programs and services vary, but each address a need identif ied in the community. Across the identified significant priority areas , numerous indicators with associated metrics are described which will be utilized to demonstrat e improvement s needed to provide evidence of the impact of Montefiore's efforts in addres sing the health needs of its community . New York State Health Improvement Plan - Implementation Plan and Measures As a part of the Montefiore submission for the New York State Health Improvement Plan for 2014 -2017, required by the New York State Departme nt of Health, four broad focus areas in two priority areas - Preventing Chronic Disease and Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children, in addition to the large array of services provided by Montefiore , were identified. These broad focus areas are (1) Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults, (2) Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure (3) Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settin gs, and (4) Improving Maternal and Infant Health. Across these focus areas, six goal s, with specific interventions, performance measures and time frames, were identified . External Resources and Linkages In addition to the multiple resources that have be en developed at Montefiore independently and through partnership with other organizations, there is an extensive set of resources that are available to meet the needs of Bronx residents which cannot be met entirely by Montefiore programs and services, or t hat choose to utilize external organizations. Furthermore, as Montefiore is an organization that works with complex health needs and whose community faces multi -factorial crises that impact upon overall health, a list of external resources has been develo ped to provide additional information on available resources to address community needs. 9 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2. Introduction As the University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore is a premier academic medical cen ter nationally renowned for its clinical excellence, scientific discovery and commitment to its community. Recognized among the top hospitals nationally and regionally by U.S. News & World Report, Montefiore provides compassionate, patient - and family -cent ered care and educates the healthcare professionals of tomorrow. The Children's Hospital at Montefiore is consistently named in U.S. News' \"America's Best Children's Hospitals,\" and is second among those in the New York metro area. With four hospitals, 1, 491 beds and 90,000 annual admissions, Montefiore is an integrated health system seamlessly linked by advanced technology. State -of-the-art primary and specialty care is provided through a network of more than 140 locations across the region, including th e largest school health program in the nation and a home health program. Montefiore's partnership with Einstein advances clinical and translational research to accelerate the pace at which new discoveries become the treatments and therapies that benefit pa tients. The medical center derives its inspiration for excellence from its patients and community, and continues to be on the frontlines of developing innovative approaches to care. 2a. Montefiore's Mission Statement and Strategy : In January, 2009, Mo ntefiore Medical Center completed a comprehensive review and update of its strategic plan. That process included the development and approval by its Board of Trustees of revised statements of the medical center's Mission, Vision and Values. Mission: To Heal, To Teach, To Discover and to Advance the Health of the Communities We Serve . Vision: To be a premier academic medical center that transforms health and enriches lives . Values: Humanity, Innovation, Teamwork, Diversity and Equity As part of that process, Montefiore established five Strategic Goals, setting out Montefiore's course for the decade to come 1. Advance our partnership with the Einstein College of Medicine 2. Create notable Centers of Excellence 3. Build specialty care broadly 4. Develop a seamless delivery system with superior access, quality, safety and patient satisfaction 5. Maximize the impact of our community service The inclusion of an explicit statement affirming Community Service as part of Montefiore's Mission Statement is not new. It has always been one of the core elements of Montefiore's mission. What has changed is the explicit reference to \"advancing the health of the communities we serve\", focusing on making a measurable difference in the health of those 10 populations and communities. This is further sharpened by the inclusion as one of the five strategic goals the imperative, to \"maximize the impact of our community service\". In pursuing that goal, Montefiore has tasked itself: to better coordinate and focus its resources on speci fic high prevalence/high impact problems affecting its community, to work internally and with community partners to identify priority health needs, and to develop and implement more effective broad -based plans of action to address them, and to advanc e the health of the communities we serve. The rationale behind this change was the realization that we must focus our efforts, if we are to make a real, measurable difference in the health of populations, and communities. That is essentially the same logi c as underpins the state's revised Community Service Plan process. Historically, Montefiore has earned a reputation as a leader in the region, state and nation in providing services to its community, by developing and operating an extraordinary array of needed services to the poor and underserved, and to specific at -risk populations (eg. children, the elderly, the HIV -infected, the homeless and victims of domestic violence). In its updated Strategy, Montefiore included a strategic goal - \"Maximize the im pact of our community service\" - that is focused on improving performance in this critical area. It has led to the creation of a new institutional focus for community health improvement activities - the Montefiore Office of Community and Population Health, charged to oversee, and support and coordinate Montefiore's diverse portfolio of community health improvement programs and activities, enhance Montefiore's capacity to assess and measure the health needs of the communities it serves, identify, asses s and select a limited number of top -priority health needs in the communities Montefiore serves for specific focus, and lead and coordinate Montefiore -wide efforts, and, where possible working, together and with community partners to make a difference, t o measurably improve the health of the communities we serve. The Office of Community and Population Health was established in the Fall, 2009. It is a new and important function at Montefiore, and its formation parallels other changes at Montefiore, and at Einstein, including: Creation of a new Montefiore Office of Community Relations; Consolidation and integration of responsibility for Health Education and Community Outreach, coupled with the re -organization of the staffing for Montefiore's eleven comm unity advisory boards to improve their effectiveness and ability to provide meaningful input regarding how our hospitals and major ambulatory care sites and services can better serve their diverse communities; and Improved coordination of Montefiore's c ommunity health efforts with those of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, including the Institute for Community and Collaborative Health and the Hispanic Center for Excellence. 11 The goals and directions of Montefiore coincide with and reinforce those articulated by the New York State D epar tment of Health's Prevention Agenda and in its revised approach to the Community Service Plan and the federal requirements of the Accountable Care Act for community benefit acco untability . 2b. Enhancing Community Access to Health Insurance Montefiore Medical Center has taken a proactive approach to conducting outreach and education of individuals in the community that might be eligible for health insurance coverage through the New York State of Health - New York's Health Insurance Marketplace. Montefiore's planning focused on two key constituencies - external Bronx and lower Westchester Community and internal Montefiore staff. Externally, Montefiore's strategy was to work wi th our partners in the community to sponsor and execute outreach and education events throughout our catchment area. To date, Montefiore has participated in or helped to sponsor six different educational events targeting different members of the Bronx and Lower Westchester Community specifically related to the Marketplace, with more to come. Partners have included elected officials, other providers (in particular funded Navigators in the Bronx, such as Bronx Community Health Network and Community Service Society of New York), health plans, and others. In addition, Montefiore created several resources for patients that are used throughout the institution and provided at community -based events, including: Printed over 2,500 flyers and tri -folds on the New York State of Health, in both English and Spanish, provided at events and in physician offices and clinics for patients. Created a patient -facing webpage on Montefiore's internet site describing the Exchange and posting useful materials. Launched a serie s of E -Screens across all campuses which provide a snapshot of important information on the Marketplace. Conducted PR and press on the Exchange targeting both English and Spanish regional press outlets. Internally, Montefiore's goals were 1) to educate associates who will have interaction with patients who may have questions; 2) to educate associates who will be a source of information for their communities. To that end, Montefiore launched a series of associated education and awareness efforts: Develo ped a seminar on the Basics of the New York State of Health. o This seminar has been delivered (or is scheduled to be delivered) in -person to staff across the institution at health centers, to social workers, call center employees, and other various depart ments upon request. o The presentation has been recorded in voice -over webinar format, and is to be made available online through Montefiore's intranet site for associates. 12 o Montefiore Intranet Site - Montefiore created an internal webpage where information a bout the Exchange, Navigator and In -Person Assistance programs, free internet action sites and other important information is made available to associates. o Internal Periodicals - Articles and information were included (or will be included) in Montefiore's internal periodicals, such as Montefiore Update, Inspired Medicine, and using Montefiore's internal networking engine, Yammer. Finally, Montefiore expects to train over 100 associates that currently are employed as Medicaid Specialists and Financial Aid specialists to become Certified Application Counselors (CAC). In doing so, these individuals will be permitted by the State to actually help patients enroll in health coverage through the Marketplace. Montefiore has also submitted paperwork to become a C AC training site, which will be an important resource for newly hired Montefiore staff as well as other community -based organizations in the Bronx and lower Westchester that also need to have staff trained. III. Definition and Description of the Communit y/Service Area Montefiore has identified the Bronx as its primary service area. More than 85% of Montefiore's hospitals' discharges are residents of the Bronx, and it is within this geographic area that Montefiore has distributed the vast majority of its community -based primary care and specialty ambulatory services. Defining a \" Hospital Service Area\" for Montefiore, however, is not as straightforward as it may be for a freestanding community hospital, which is aligned with and serves a discrete geograph ic community. To begin with, Montefiore operates four hospitals (Moses, Weiler and Wakefield Hospitals, and the Children's Hospital at Montefiore), each of which serves as a \"community hospital\" for quite different communities in the Bronx. An additional division of Montefiore is an ambulatory care facility, which includes a freestanding emergency department at Westchester Square. In addition, each hospital has a nearby specialty ambulatory care center; and serves as a referral center for the Bronx and t he wider region, serving patients who need specialty ambulatory and inpatient care. Beyond its hospital campuses, Montefiore operates a large number of in -community services sites. Montefiore operates over 25 community -based primary care centers, located in communities across the Bronx and southern Westchester. Each of these primary care centers has its own service area, providing comprehensive primary care services to a specific population drawn from its surrounding community, tailoring its services to the needs of the patients and communities it serves. 13 Montefiore also operates a range of programs focusing on the needs of special populations: Montefiore's School Health Program (MSHP) provide s comprehensive primary care to a population of element ary, middle and high school students throughout the Bronx. Founded in 1983, the MSHP is the largest and most comprehensive school -based health program in the country and a major community outreach program for children living in the Bronx. Currently, the MS HP provides a range of medical, mental health, reproductive and health promotion services to 25,000 students who make over 80,000 visits per year. Together, Montefiore and Einstein operate an 11 -site substance abuse treatment program that offers drug treat ment and rehabilitation services and comprehensive primary care to a population of 4,500 recovering substance abusers in communities across the Bronx. Finally, Montefiore provides a wide array of targeted outreach services to at -risk populations within its service area, including programs serving the homeless and victims of domestic violence, as well as services to homebound and/or fragile seniors in community -based settings throughout the Bronx. The Bronx is a large and diverse urban setting, with many su b-populations and communities that evidence tremendous variation from one to another. Those communities are served by many providers - hospitals/systems, and community health centers - with overlapping service areas. General concepts like \"service area\" an d a \"service area population\" based on a simple geographic definition (e.g. a set of zip codes) are difficult to apply in a setting like the Bronx, or to a health care delivery system like Montefiore. In such a setting, one must focus on the specific healt h needs of specific populations, in specific communities, working with specific partners. That has been Montefiore's historical approach to developing and operating its 14 programs of community health, and that is the approach we have taken in developing this Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy . 3a. The Population of the Bronx According to the 2012 American Community Survey of the U.S. Census, the Bronx with 1.4 million residents is the nation's poorest urban county . The demographic data for Bronx County indicates that the Bronx i s overwhelmingly impacted by the social determinants of healt h, as defined by the World Health Organization, showing poorer outcomes in areas including social gradients such as life expectancy, increased rep orted stress, lower levels of early childhood development, increased reported social exclusion, higher rates of unemployment, decreased reported social support networks, higher rates of addiction, decreased availability of healthy food and decreased access ibility to health transportation. The poverty rate is 31% (compared to 19.4% city -wide) and median income $32,450 (compared to $51,270 city -wide). There are 44.5% of Bronx children living below poverty, also one of the highest child poverty rates in the U nited States. There are 7.37% of Bronx households on public assistance, twice the percentages in New York City (4.15%) and New York State (3.40%). There are 84.18% of Bronx students eligible for reduced -fee and free lunch programs. The Bronx unemployment rate of 11.9% is one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Despite the high poverty and unemployment rates, 27% of Bronx residents ages 25 and older have received their high school diploma or GED, higher than citywide (24%) and statewide (26.9% ) attainment rates. The Bronx is ethnically diverse. Its population is 54.3% Hispanic, 33.2% African -American, 10.6% White, 3.7% Asian, and 3.3% Other. Almost one -third (34.7%) of its residents are foreign -born and 40.7% of the births are to foreign -born mothers. Among these immigrants, more people speak a foreign language at home (predominantly Spanish) than speak \"only English.\" Its new immigrants come from diverse corners of the globe (in order of their numbers): Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico, Ecuador, Guyana, Ghana, Honduras, Italy, Trini dad & Tobago, and Bangladesh. The Bronx was New York City's first borough to have a majority of people of color and is the only borough with a Latino majority. Only three counties in the eastern United Stat es have a lower portion of Non -Hispanic whites and only one has a higher proportion of Latinos. The Bronx is also the youngest county in New York State with 39.2% children and one of only five U.S. counties with more than 30% single family households. 15 3b. Health Disparities in the Bronx The Bronx has been an epicenter of the asthma, HIV, and drug epidemics and also has excess mortality rates from heart disease, stroke, and diabetes compared to city -wide and national averages. As the Bronx mortality rate s remain significantly high, the number of physicians in the Bronx continues to dwindle. Mortality Rates : According to the New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Vital Statistics of New York State report in 2011, the Bronx has a higher age -adjus ted mortality rate (639.8 per 100,000) than New York City (622.7 per 100,000) as a whole. According to the Community Health Rankings in 2010, the Bronx ranks as a county with one of the highest mortality rates in New York State. From the list of 62 NY coun ties with the lowest to highest mortality outcome (with 1 as the lowest and 62 as the highest), the Bronx ranked at number 60. The leading cause of death among Bronx residents is due to coronary heart disease (206.1 per 100,000). Asthma : According to th e New York City Department of Health's (NYCDOH) Community Health Survey in 2011, 17.9% of total Bronx adults reported that they had asthma. The percentage of Bronx adults with asthma was higher than the New York City percentage of 11.9%. According to the NYSDOH, the average (age -adjusted) rate of asthma emergency department visits per 100,000 from 2008 -2010 was 231.4 in the Bronx, significantly higher than the New York City rate of 131.5 and statewide rate of 87.1. The age -adjusted death rate due to chronic lower respiratory diseases among Bronx residents was 25.6 per 100,000 in 2009; higher than the New York City rate of 18.1. In 2010, the Bronx rate increased to 29.9; remaining higher than the NYC rate of 20.9. Diabetes : According to the NYCDOH, 13.1% of adults in the Bronx reported that they were diagnosed with diabetes in 2011. 15.2% of Bronx adults reported that they were diagnosed with diabetes in 2012. From 2011 -2012, the diabetes percentage among Bronx adults remained higher than the citywide diabet es rate of 10%. According to the NYSDOH, the average (age -adjusted) rate of diabetes hospitalization per 10,000 from 2009 -2011 was 399.1 in the Bronx, significantly higher than the New York City rate of 270.5 and statewide rate of 226. The age -adjusted de ath rate due to diabetes was 28 per 100,000 Bronx residents in 2009; higher than the New York City rate of 19.5 and statewide rate of 16.6. In 2010, the death rate among Bronx residents decreased to 26.8. Despite the decrease in death rate due to diabetes among Bronx residents in 2010, the Bronx rate remained higher than the NYC rate of 20.2 and statewide rate of 16.6. 16 3c. Medically Underserved Community Health Insurance : According to the New York State Department of Health, 19.79% of Bronx adults did not have health insurance in 2011, higher than the national rate of 15.1%. During the same year, 4.37% of Bronx children did not have health insurance, lower than the national rate of 7.5%. Physician Shortage : In 2013, the Health Resources and Services A dministration (HRSA) considered nine population groups and eight facilities in Bronx County to be Primary Care Health Professions Shortage Areas (HPSAs). This marks an increase in the number of population groups (four in 2011 to nine in 2013) and a decrea se in the number of service areas (four in 2011 to zero in 2013) and facilities (ten in 2011 to eight in 2013) considered to be HSPAs in 2011. In 2013 the following nine population groups were considered HPSAs: Medicaid Eligible \u2014Fordham/Norwood, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Highbride, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Hunts Point/Mott Haven, Medicaid Eligible \u2014 Morris Heights, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Morrisania, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Soundview, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Tremont, Medicaid Eligible \u2014West Farms, Medicaid Eligible \u2014Parkchester/Throgs Necks. In 2013, the following service areas were considered HPSAs: Highbridge, Huntspoint/Mott Have, Morris Heights, Morrisania. Before HRSA's 2008 regulation changes designating Health Professions Shortage Areas (HPSAs), almost half (45%) of our population liv ed in federally designated HPSAs . More importantly, now the Bronx is qualified as a Whole County HPSA. 4. Assessment of Community Health Need 4a. Description of Process and Methods Multiple conversations and meetings were convened internally and with ex ternal partners , including a thorough review of the data, which determined the activities that would be the focus over the CHNA implementation period. A comprehensive discussion of the identified areas will be included in the Implementation Strategy repor t. In this Community Health Needs Assessment , the documentation of organizations and partners documents those individuals,groups and organizations with whom implementation activities were planned. 4.a.i Data Sources Multiple data sources were used to sup port the identification and selection of the priority items , which were identified, selected, and reviewed with partners. A listing and brief summary of the data sources used to complete the secondary data analysis that were used to identify the issues of concern beyond experience and direct observation are listed below. i.

American Community Survey New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Bronx County Indicators for Tracking Public Health Priority Areas 2013 -2017 Findings are provided by 2010 Bureau of U.S. Census data. The Census data is collected every 10 years using a detailed survey method that counts every resident throughout the U.S. Detailed information provided by the Census survey results d escribe each U.S. community's entire population, including cross -tabulations of age, sex, households, families, relationship to householder, housing units, and race/ethnic groups. This NYSDOH report also includes data and the 2017 targets for numerous indi cators for the five major prevention agenda areas: preventing chronic diseases; promote a healthy and safe environment; promoting healthy women, infants and children; promote mental health and prevent substance abuse; and, prevent HIV/STDs, vaccine -prevent able disease and health care -associated infections. The 2011 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the NYSDOH Public Health Priority Areas report can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013 -2017/about.htm . The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) This comprehensive database was established in 1979 as a result of cooperation between the health care industry and government. SPARCS collects patient level data on hospital discharges, patient characteristics, diagnoses and treatments, and health care services. This database system also collects data on charges for ever y hospital discharge, ambulatory surgery patient, and emergency department admission in New York State. This database features the World Health Organization's Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD -9), an official set of codes used by physicians, hospitals, and allied health workers to indicate diagnosis for all patient encounters. The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid's DRG (Diagnosis -Related Groups) coding system is also featured in the SPARCS data. DRGs group patients by diagnosis, treatment, age, and other characteristics. Hospitals are paid a set fee for treating patients in a single DRG category. Detailed information on the SPARCS data can be fou nd at http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/sparcs/ . NYS Community Health Indicator Reports Reports were provided by the New York State Cancer Registry and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance S ystem (BRFSS). The NYS Cancer Registry was established in 1976 to track statewide data of all patients diagnosed with cancer. Data collected from this registry include exposure risks, stages at diagnosis, treatment information, and death rates. Each time a person is diagnosed with a tumor, the hospital(s) where that person is diagnosed and/or treated is required by the Public Health Law Section 2401 to report information about the person and tumor to the Cancer Registry within six months of patient diagnosi s. The most recent year for 18 which data on new cases and cancer deaths are available is 2010. Detailed information on the NYS Cancer Registry can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/statis tics/cancer/registry/ . The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone surveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non - institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. The survey is conducted in all 50 states and U.S. terr itories. New York State has participated annually since 1985. Statewide representative samples are collected monthly and aggregated into yearly datasets. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and much more are all available at http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/ . The 2010 data is the latest Bronx -specific BRFSS data illustrated by the NYSDOH. New York City Department of Health and Hygiene (NYCDOH) Community Health Survey The Community Health Survey (CHS) is an annual telephone survey that provides essential data used by the NYCDOH to monitor the health of New Yorkers, evaluate the outcomes of public health initiatives, and guide policy decisions. The survey provides citywide and borough -specific estimates of health indicators and risk factors. Each year, approximately 9,000 adults ages 18 and older are randomly selected to participate in the CHS. The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Questionnaires, datasets, survey resul ts, documentation and much more are all available at http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/data/survey.shtml . County Health Rankings This project is a collaboration between the Robert Johnson F oundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Additional data measures used in the rankings were provided by surveys and databases from other organizations such as the National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, Dartmouth Institute , U.S. Census Bureau, and U.S. Department of Agriculture. This database generates health rankings of every U.S. county and illustrates the correlations between local health outcomes, health factors, and socioeconomic factors. The county rankings are based on summary scores calculated from individual data measures. The overall Health Outcomes summary score consists of data on the county's mortality and morbidity. The overall Health Factors summary score consists of data on the county's health behaviors, clin ical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. The 2010 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the County Health Rankings can be found at http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach . Community Health Needs Assessment This project was developed by the Advancing the Movement organization and the Center for Applied Research and Environmental Systems (CARES) as a web -base d toolkit designed to hospitals, state and local health departments, and other organizations seeking to better understand the needs and assets of their communities. County -level data retrieved from institutions such as the CDC, U.S. Census Bureau, and the Public Health Institute are formulated into customized data reports. The Full Health Indicators Report illustrates the health needs 19 assessment profiles of U.S. counties using local demographics, socioeconomic factors, physical environment data, clinical ca re data, health behavior factors, and health outcomes. The 2010 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the Community Health Needs Assessment can be found at CHNA.org . NYC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) This survey is conducted through an ongoing collaboration between the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the Department of Education (DOE), and the National Cent ers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The New York City's YRBS is part of the CDC's National Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). Based on the protocol developed by CDC, the survey has been conducted in odd -numbered years since 1997 to monitor priority health risk behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and social problems among youth in New York City. Students complete a self - administered, anonymous questionnaire that measures a variety of behaviors, inc luding tobacco, alcohol and drug use, unintentional injury and violence, sexual behaviors, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. The results are representative of public high school students in grades 9 through 12. The NYC YRBS can provide prevalence d ata for the city as a whole, for each of the five boroughs starting in 2003, and since 2005 for three high -risk neighborhoods - the South Bronx, North and Central Brooklyn, and East and Central Harlem in Manhattan - where the DOHMH has its District Public Health Offices (DPHOs). The 2011 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the NYCDOH's YRBS can be found at http://www.nyc.gov/ html/doh/html/data/youth -risk-behavior.shtml . CDC's Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance This report documents statistics and trends for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the United States through 2011. This publication is intended as a refere nce document for policy makers, program managers, health planners, researchers, and others who are concerned with the public health implications of these diseases. The surveillance information in the latest report is based on the following sources of data: (1) notifiable disease reporting from state and local STD programs; (2) projects that monitor STD positivity and prevalence in various settings, including regional Infertility Prevention Projects, the National Job Training Program, the STD Surveillance Ne twork, and the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project; and (3) other national surveys implemented by federal and private organizations. The STD surveillance systems operated by state and local STD control programs, which provide the case report data for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, are the data sources of many of the figures and most of the statistical tables in this publication. Detailed information on the CDC's Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/default.htm . NYSDOH's Annual HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report The Annual Surveillance Report presents recent data on newly diagnosed HIV cases and persons living with diagnosed HIV infection in New York State. Twenty -two sets of tables are grouped by major geographic division (New York State (NYS), New York City (NYC), NYS excluding NYC, Ryan White Regions1, NYC boroughs). Most sets feature three tables on separate pages - (A) living HIV and AIDS cas es, (B) new HIV diagnoses and (C) new AIDS diagnoses. The historical table 20 (Table 1) includes HIV and AIDS diagnoses, and deaths among persons with AIDS. This report is produced by the Bureau of HIV/AIDS Epidemiology (BHAE), AIDS Institute, New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH). Access to this publication is available through the Internet at the following address: http://www.nyhealth.gov/diseases/aids/statistics/index.htm . American Community Survey (ACS) Developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, the ACS is an ongoing survey that collects annual data on the major characteristics of communities throughout the U.S. The data collected is categorized into four categories: social, econom ic, demographic, and housing. Social characteristics include topics such as education, disability status, and health insurance status. Economic characteristics describe the income, employment status, and poverty level of U.S. communities. Demographic chara cteristics include age, sex, and race/ethnicity information. Housing characteristics include topics such as occupancy and vacancy, monthly rent, and household size. Approximately 3.5 million U.S households are randomly selected to participate in the ACS ea ch year. The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and more detailed information are available at https://www.census.go v/acs/www/ . 4.a.ii Collaboration and Participants As the Community Health Needs Assessment was being developed, a simultaneous process was evolving as Montefiore was charged with the development of its New York State Community Service Plan submission fo r the period of 2013 -2017 for the New York State Health Department's Prevention Agenda. For this process, Montefiore collaborated with the New York City Department of Health as a part of identifying the Take Care New York 2016 Priorities and identifying t he points of alignment between the New York State priorities, the New York City Goals and the needs identified through the Community Health Needs Assessment process. In reviewing the full list of items from New York State and New York City, it was very cl ear that many of their targeted areas, such as Healthy Eating: Active Living, Tobacco Free Living, and Children and Youth agenda items were areas that there was inter -organizational synergy. Through collaborations with large stakeholder partner groups a nd awareness of the status of Bronx County, as the county with the lowest ranking health status in New York State (62 out of 62), as reported in the 2013 County Health Rankings from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, stakeholder groups have agreed that ta ckling issues impacting improved nutrition, increased physical activity and tobacco -use cessation efforts would be where the greatest impact could be achieved and two New York State Priority areas were then chosen, to Prevent Chronic Disease and to Promote Health Women, Infants and Children. These areas are among the identified areas for which the data has shown and Montefiore ha s determined a community need . In addition to this collaboration with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene that Montefiore had used to gain i nput , Montefiore worked closely with its communities and ensured that c ommunity participation occurred by working with a variety of community advisory boards (CABs). Montefiore participates in a variety of organized 21 partne rships and collaboratives, working with other providers in the Bronx, and we worked extensively with representatives of the affected communities through these CABs to identify health care needs and determine the appropriate configuration of services. Beyo nd the formal structure that Montefiore established to gain input from the communities it serves, the medical center participates in a variety of organized partnerships and collaboratives, working with other providers in the Bronx, the NYCDOHMH, community -based organizations in the Bronx and members of the community in planning and developing initiatives aimed at improving the health of the people of the Bronx. Montefiore has developed additional approaches to the assessment of community needs and health p riorities and to the establishment of partnerships with community organizations. Montefiore developed a community level approach involving relevant organizations, which are in the specific community and are interested in the particular health issues bei ng addressed. This provides for a closer alignment between the community level goals of Montefiore and the organizational goals of the community organizations. This approach is the Collective Action to Transform Community Health (CATCH) Program, which is a community level coalition bringing together four aspects of the community that may have a significant impact on community health. The four elements are: Partner Role Montefiore/ Albert Einstein College of Medicine Coordinating community site Able to provide sample data to represent sample of the community and results of interventions within a smaller timeline NYC District Public Health Office Provide data, epidemiological support, access to NYCDOH programs and access to the NYCDOHMH Community Health Profiles survey Local Community Board Represent the interests of local community, local business and local government in the implementation of any intervention Local Community Based Organizations Provide direct representation of the constituency to be reached through the interventions and a base for community initiated interventions to be supported by the other coalition members Through collaboration, this four part coalition, working in individual communities delineated by the Montefiore Medical Group primary care site located within a specific neighborhood, identifies interventions that can be worked on both collaboratively and independently to transform the community's health. Using data collected through Montefiore, the District Public Health Offic e and other sources, the impact on the community's health by the interventions implemented can be measured and analyzed. Furthermore, in reflecting upon the population that resides in and is serviced by Montefiore, according to the 2012 American Community Survey of the U.S. Census , 54.3% of the population is Hispanic, 33.2% African -American, 10.6% White, 3.7% Asian, and 3.3% Other. As the borough with the smallest non -Hispanic White 22 population in New York City, focusing on disparities is inherent in ever ything that Montefiore accomplishes. The priority areas selected and each of the planned interventions focus on specific priority populations and address the ethnic and cultural disparity defined in the indicators for the population served by Montefiore . 4.a.ii.1 Partners/Organizations 4.a.ii.1.a Partners/Organizations As indicated in Section 4a, the partners listed in this section comprise the individuals, groups and organizations that are participating in the focused Implementation Plan activities that evolve out of the CHNA process. As the CHNA pro cess was conducted simultaneously with the New York State Community Service Plan (CSP) development , there is strong alignment between the areas of focus in this report and the areas presented in the CSP. In Section 7, it is clearly documented that Montefiore will continue to work on the over 85 existing program initiatives , as each of those initiatives have partners, metrics, and meeting schedules. For sake of organization wide focus and priority, the fou r major groupings, their partner organizations and their process are listed below. Implementation Plan Area of Focus: Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults For the Implementation Area - Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults , a new group was conceptu alized in April of 2012 when Dr. Steven Safyer submitted an opinion commentary through one of the local New York City periodicals http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ winning -obesity -battle -article -1.1056892 detailing the strategies he proposed would lead to victory in the battle over obesity. This call to action mobilized New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene leadership to call for a meeting and joint ly in partnership with the Bronx Borough President, the Honorable Ruben Diaz Jr. and New York State Senator Gustavo Rivera - (D) 33rd District, the decision was made to gather through leaders on this issue to define and work on solutions. Fifteen sector i ssue key stakeholder organizations were invited to participate in the initial meeting held on June 25, 2013. The leaders were: Organization Leaders 1. Office of the Bronx Borough President The Honorable Ruben Diaz, Jr. Melissa Cebollero 2. New York State Senator: The Honorable Gustavo Rivera 3. Montefiore Medical Center: Dr. Steven Safyer, President & CEO 4. New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene: Commissioner of Health, Dr. Thomas A. Farley 5. Urban Health Plan, Inc. : Ms. Paloma Hernandez, Pres & CEO 6. Morris Heights Health Center Ms. Verona Greenland, MPH, Pres & CEO 7. Health First Pat Wang, JD, CEO 23 8. 1199SEIU/HCWE George Gresham, President 9. Furco Food Corp. Rudy Fuertes 10. Jerome -Gun Hill BID Ruben Luna 11. CTG/Bronx Borough Lead Dr. Neil Calman 13. Bronx Clergy Task Force Bishop Angelo Rosario 14. Health and Hospitals Corporation Dr. David Stevens 15. YMCA of NYC Jack Lund, CEO 16. Dept. of Education (DOE) Lindsey Ha rr 17. Greater New York Diabetes Association 18. New York State Health Foundation, Jim Knickman 19. Greater New York Hospital Assoc. Lloyd Bishop Amy Osorio This group was supplemented with staff from each of the lead organizations. At this me eting, after a presentation from the four principals and clinical experts for the New York City Department of Health and Mental hygiene and Montefiore Medical Center, this group agreed to tackle collectively and collaboratively the issues surrounding obesi ty in children and adults through the Bronx Campaign to Prevent and Control Obesity. Impl ementation Plan Area of Focus: Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure According to the NYCDOH Community Health Survey (2012), 15.8% of adults in the Bronx reported being current smokers as compared to 15.5% of New York City adults reported being current smokers. As tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of premature death in the United States, account ing for 19% of these deaths, more than obesity, infections (including HIV/AIDS), motor vehicle accidents, homicide, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse combined, we have selected Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure as the second focus area . Montefiore will continue with its strong supportive partnership with Bronx BREATHES ( BRonx Einstein Alliance for Tobacco Free Health and Environmental Services). Bronx BREATHES was established in 2004 as the Bronx Tobacco Cessation Center and is one of nineteen designated tobacco cessation centers in New York State, funded by the New York State Department of Health Bureau of Tobacco Control. Montefiore participates in the Bronx BREATHES Monthly Staff and Partnershi p meeting, which is led by the Bronx BREATHES staff and its Principal Investigator, Dr. Alvin 'Hal' Strelnick, and attended by representatives of the following partner organizations: 24 Albert Einstein College of Medicine American Cancer Society Bronx C ommunity Health Network Bronx County Medical Society Bronx CREED Bronx Lebanon Hospital Bronx Lesbian & Gay Health Resource Consortium Bronx Psychiatric Center Clinical Directors Network Emblem Health Plan of New York Health People Jacobi Medical C enter Lehman College -Department of Nursing Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center Montefiore Medical Center Morris Heights Health Center Morrisania Diagnostic & Treatment Center New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene North Central Bro nx Hospital NYC Coalition for a Smoke -Free City Office of the Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr. Project Samaritan AIDS Services Segundo Ruiz Belvis Diagnostic & Treatment Center South Bronx Asthma Partnership St. Barnabas Hospital The Bronx He alth Link Urban Health Plan Representatives from this group meet on a monthly basis, traditionally on the second Monday of each month. At the last meeting of the group, on October 14, 2013, Montefiore's commitment to continue addressing tobacco relat ed concerns as a part of its Community Service plan was roundly approved as it would continue to support the strides that the coalition has made in reducing tobacco use across multiple populations in the Bronx. Implementation Plan Area of Focus: Increa se Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings The Bronx has New York City's highest rates of pre -diabetes, diabetes and it is suspected to have equally high rates of undiagnosed diabetes among its 1.4 million residents. Montefiore, as the University Hospital for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine , was selected as one of the initial 27 clinical centers across the nation selected to participate in the original Diabetes Prevention Progra m (DPP) study which found that participants who lost a modest amount of weight through dietary changes and increased physical activity sharply reduced their chances of developing diabetes. Participants in the lifestyle intervention group - those receiving intensive individual counseling and motivational support on effective diet, exercise, and behavior modification - reduced their risk of developing diabetes by 58 percent. This finding was true across all participating ethnic groups and for both men and wom en. Lifestyle changes worked particularly well for participants aged 60 and older, reducing their risk by 71 percent. About 5 percent of the lifestyle intervention group developed diabetes each year during the study period, compared with 11 percent of thos e in the placebo group. The DPP's results indicate that millions of high -risk people can delay or avoid developing Type 2 diabetes by losing weight 25 through regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories (National Diabetes Information Clearing house). Montefiore has embraced implementation of the national YMCA of New York City's Diabetes Prevention Program (Y -DPP) to arrest the development of this chronic disease within our population. In partnership with the YMCA of New York City we began ref erring our patients into the Y's in the Bronx. As this area is reflecte d in the primary and secondary d ata collection process as important and relevant, Montefiore accepted the invitation to participate in the South Bronx Community Referral Task Force (SB CRT) which has met on December 12, 2012, July 1, 2013 and October 1, 2013, with informal meetings and small group collaborations between the task force meetings. The SBCRT 's membership includes representatives from the following organizations as well a s three private clinician practice groups: YMCA's DPP City Harvest Montefiore Medical Center Cornell Cooperative Extension Lincoln Hospital Bronx Health Reach St. Simon Stock Roman Catholic Church Hope of Israel Senior Center Shape Up New York City Dr. Es sen Dr. Patel Uptown Medical Group In agreement with this membership, Montefiore has selected Diabetes Prevention as its measure for increasing access to high quality diabetes preventive care and management in both clinical and community settings, which is a reaffirmation and expansion of the work we proposed in the New York State 2010 -2013 Community Service Plan where the organizational focus was on pediatric diabetes. Implementation Plan Area of Focus: Maternal and Infant Health As one of the larges t delivery hospitals in the Bronx, while we have demonstrated a strong commitment to maternal and infant health, mothers in the Bronx continue to report lowered ongoing breastfeeding rates. Montefiore has invested to improve maternal and infant health, including a partnership with the March of Dimes to reduce rates of low birth -weight and premature births, and operation of one of the city's largest WIC programs, providing health education and nutrition support to poor mothers, infants and children. Montefi ore has embraced the Latch On NYC program at each of our delivery hospitals, which has been formally 26 endorsed by the New York State Department of Health, Greater New York Hospital Association, Academy of Family Physicians, New York County Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics, District II, New York State and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, New York State Chapter. In partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Montefiore is one of twenty -six hospitals partic ipating in the partnership. In support of this initiative, Montefiore has participated in the Latch -On NYC initiative which has a requirement to hold a region -wide monthly breastfeeding meeting for internal and external provides in the region. This meeti ng is led by Dr. Deborah Campbell, Montefiore's Chief , Division of Neonatology and the membership includes: clinical leaders from Montefiore New York City Bureau of Maternal and Infant and Reproductive Health Bronx District Public Health Office, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Bronx Regional Perinatal Center Bronx Health Link Montefiore also has a representative that serves on the Operational Board of the Bronx Health Link (who was contracted to assist with the primary data collectio n in this CHNA report). For the past twelve years the Bronx Health Link was awarded the county wide Comprehensive Prenatal Perinatal Network Services contract from the New York State Department of Health as well. BHL also is the Bronx County recipient of the Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative award and serves as the major contractor for the sub -contracts issued across the county. The Bronx Health Link's Board meets monthly on the second Friday morning of each month. 4.a.ii.1.b Summary of Input Provide d by Primary Data Sources Montefiore engaged with the Bronx Health Link, www.bronxhealthlink.org , a 501c3 organization in Bronx County, to facilitate the primary data collection process for Bronx residents, i rrespective of the affiliation with Montefiore , for the period April 6, 2013 through November 15, 2013. Three modalities were chosen for this data collection process - Community Forum/Town Hall Sessions, an online survey in English and Spanish and a seri es of focus groups also conducted in English and Spanish. Each activity will be summarized separately , below . Community Forum: The Community Forum was held on April 6, 2013 as a part of the First Annual Bronx Health Summit coordinated by the Office of th e Bronx Borough President, the Honorable Ruben Diaz Jr. Over 40 individuals participated in the forum with 32 individuals completing surveys. The questions and process will be described in further detail in Section 5.b.i. which describes the Primary Data Analysis Process. The most common themes arising from the forum were: problems with doctor -patient communication, discrimination, and quality of care barriers related to payments, hours, transportation, and physical access, 27 insufficient translators of the primary languages of consumers, and inadequate access to healthy foods. Focus Group Discussion: Four focus groups, two in English and two in Spanish, were conducted for community residents and facilitated by non -Montefiore affiliated facilitators. T he English Language focus groups were held on September 30 and October 5, 2013 with a total of 15 participants and the Spanish Language focus groups were held on October 9 and October 12 with a total of 17 participants. The sessions were held on a combina tion of days, evenings and Saturdays to accommodate the schedules of potential participants. The results from the English Language and Spanish Language groups of the analysis were blended to determine what was important to patients. Participants express ed that diabetes, cancer, lack of physical activity, obesity, mental health/depression, substance abuse, asthma, and tobacco use were the most important health issues of concern for residents of all ages living in the Bronx. For children residing in the Br onx, obesity, asthma, lack of physical activity, substance abuse, injury & violence, and diabetes were the most important health issues identified by participants. Participants felt that the most important health issues for teenagers were substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, injury & violence, birth control/family planning, mental health/depression, obesity, and HIV. Participants in all groups had concerns about mental health treatment, availability of mental health services , and treatment o ptions available to people in the Bronx and that mental illness was being underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed in the Bronx. They felt more community education and outreach about mental health is needed. In term s of healthcare services in the Bronx, English -speaking participants felt that specialty care, children's healthcare, mental healthcare, dental and vision care and prevention programs were difficult to access. There was also concern that the quality of healthcare services in the Bronx was less than optima l and that this negatively impacted local access to healthcare services. Participants voiced mixed opinions about how information about health is advertised and promoted in the Bronx. Some felt that health information was available, while others felt that the health information was not being properly advertised or promoted to reach enough people in the Bronx. Participants also voiced concern about the lack of health insurance coverage as a major barrier to access to healthcare. Participants in the two Sp anish -language focus groups expressed serious concerns about the inadequacy of translation and interpretation services for communications between healthcare providers and patients, and for official documents that patients must sign. Online Survey: An onli ne survey was conducted in English and Spanish between October 3 and October 25, 2013 gathering 150 respondents. The survey consisted of 21 questions in a SurveyMonkey format with the explicit purpose of soliciting the most important health issues as perc eived by Bronx residents, the quality of management of mental health, gaps in healthcare availability and the availability of information on where to access healthcare. 28 The full results will be explored in Section 5 .b.iv. The prevailing health issues fo r all ages chosen by participants in the English -language focus groups were Diabetes, Cancer, Lack of Physical Activity, Obesity, and Mental Health/ Depression . The Spanish -language focus groups shared three of these priorities: Diabetes, Cancer and Obesit y. They as also identified Substance Abuse and Asthma as high ranking concerns. The survey group rated Obesity, Diabetes, Asthma, Mental Health/ Depression, and Cancer as their highest concerns. Among survey respondents, different health issues were cluste red at the top five. However, among both English - and Spanish -language focus group participants, there was very little clustering of highly -rated issues outside of the top five. Some notable trends were identified as common problems with the healthcare sy stem in the Bronx: Members of the Spanish -language focus groups and some of the community forum participants expressed great distress over seriously inadequate Spanish interpretation and translation in hospitals and other healthcare settings. Among all the groups, there were concerns about the inadequate availability of certain types of healthcare, difficulties in paying for care, a lack of preventative health programs (forum participants specifically mentioned inadequate access to healthy foods), and a lack of information about available health services. Forum and focus group participants also pointed to barriers to healthcare access caused by limited hours, inadequate transportation options, and problems with physical accessibility. Focus group members expressed concerns with mental health misdiagnosis, lack of community mental health outreach and education, and mixed feelings about the education materials on mental health issues available within Bronx hospitals. Forum participants also mentioned sever al specific problems with doctor -patient relationships, including poor communication, discrimination, and quality of care. It should also be noted while only a quarter of the online survey respondents reported problems with healthcare access, among the pa rticular issues of most concern were providers that would not accept their insurance and insurance policies that did not cover the services they needed. 4.a.ii.1. c Representation of Organizations Serving Medically Underserve d, Low Income Populations Montefiore engaged with a number of organizations and groups to assess identify and prioritize the Community Health Needs of Bronx County. In doing, so, and as reflected in Section 3 of this document, all of the groups that participated with and that servic e the population of Bronx County represent medically underserved , low income and minority populations. This is evidenced by Bronx County's standing as New York City's first borough to have a majority of people of color and it is the only borough with a La tino majority. Only three counties in the eastern United States have a lower portion of Non -Hispanic whites and only one has a higher proportion of Latinos. The Bronx is also the youngest county in New York State with 39.2% children and one of only five U .S. counties with more than 30% single family households. 29 Furthermore, the Bronx has qualified as a Whole County Health Professions Shortage Area (HPSA) by HRSA, since 2008, as almost half (45%) of the population is currently living in a geographic area th at is a documented federally designated HPSA. With the primary data collection process, the participants across the three primary data collection venues were majority of ethnic minority status and reflected communities, as identified by zip code, that a re typically medically underserved and low income. 5. Identification of Community Health Needs The process to identify the needs of the community involved the collection of secondary and primary data . Examining a variety of factors, the following series of indicators, identified with rate, source, and comparison to New York State and national data (when available) is provided. 5a. Secondary Data Analysis The secondary data collected was gathered from the sources indicated in Section 4.a.i. The source data is from Federal, New York State, New York City, and national foundation databases generally accepted as accurate and to the extent possible certified and are presented as reflecting the most accurate data available when they were acquired. The links for all sources have been provided to facilitate review. The New York State Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) data provides information on the utilization of hospital inpatient and emergency services. The data below describes th e top 25 inpatient diagnoses, top 20 i npatient ambulatory sensitive discharges , and the top 25 emergency department visit diagnoses . Preventable Hospital Stays: Top 25 Inpatient Diagnoses Table 1a illustrates 25 diagnoses with the highest total number of inpatient admissions throughout the Bronx from 2010 -2012. The total number of patients with each of the top 25 diagnoses represents hospital discharges among all Bronx residents. These conditions were categorized using the ICD -9 coding system. From 2010 -2012, Single LB -Hosp W/O CD (Single Live Births in Hospital without Cesarean Section) had the highest total number of inpatient diagnoses in the Bronx.

Primary Data Analysis The collection of primary data from a representative sample of the Bronx residents was an important element of the development of the Community Health Needs Assessment . The Bronx is an ethnically diverse borough with a population of 1.37 million that , despite economic and environmental improvements since the 1970's , continues to include numerous groups with difficulties such as low health literacy, limited income, English proficiency, and lack of insurance or insurance knowledge. To capture the voices of various sectors of Bronx community residents and workers from various perspectives, a mixed -methods approach to data collection consisting of online surveys, focus groups and participation in directed community forums were used. For each of the data collection venues, it was clearly expressed and understood that participation was open to both consumers and providers who live and/or worked in the Bronx and that were 18 years old and above. While many of the questions used in the three methods were similar, some were unique to each format, based on the feasibility of exploring certain quest ions in Bureau American Community Survey (2012) Figure 18b. Means of Commuting to Work by Percent, 2012. Drove Alone Public Transportation Other Percentage 83 Montefiore Medical Center contracted with the Bronx Health Link, a not for profit 501c3 organization in the Bronx , to facilitate the implementation of the primary data collection process for the Community Health Needs Assessm ent within the Bronx and to assist in the facilitation of these community level connections . To assist in the review of each of the modalities used in the primary data collection process, the process, methods, demographics and results for each area (1 - focus group, 2 - community forum and 3 - online survey), will be presented as a complete unit for the ease of the reader . 5.b.i Focus Groups 5.b.i.1. Process The focus groups with Bronx community residents were conducted to ascertain and understand current community views on the most pressing health issues and the availability and quality of healthcare in the Bronx. Specifically, we sought community opinions on (1) the most important health problems among the community in general, among children, and amo ng adolescents, (2) the quality of management of mental health in the community, (3) gaps in healthcare availability in the Bronx, (4) the availability of information on where to access various types of healthcare, and, (5) among Spanish speaking participa nts, how well translation services are functioning in Bronx healthcare settings. The sample population consisted of Bronx residents and workers ages 18 and over, both English - and Spanish -speaking. To collect the data of interest, focus group methodology was utilized because: 1) open -ended questions enable capturing participants' wording and experiences with less bias from researchers, 2) the group participants' engagement in the dialogue stimulates participants to recall issues surrounding health and hea lthcare that they deem most important, and 3) focus groups facilitate the reaching of more participants than one -on-one interviews. 5.b.i.2. Methods A discussion guide was designed and translated into Spanish to meet the specific data collection needs o f the project. Separate recruitment flyers were prepared to recruit for the English - language and Spanish -language focus groups. The flyers were circulated to a wide range of community -based organizations in the Bronx and telephone calls were made to follo w up on the flyer distribution. The information was posted in various e-newsletter s and other electronic communications . In addition, flyers were distributed at a preconception care conference and was shared with the Bronx Community Research Review Board. A total of four focus groups were conducted with English -speaking (two focus groups) and Spanish -speaking (two focus groups) adults who live and/or work in the Bronx to collect data on their views regarding the most important health issues in their commu nities. The groups were each conducted at different times, dates and locations in order to reach a diverse group of participants. Each group lasted approximately one hour. A total of 31 individuals (21 women and ten men) attended the four groups: 15 in th e English -speaking groups, and 17 in the Spanish -speaking groups. 84 Table 1.

The su rvey data were analyzed separately for the English - and Spanish -language focus groups. The recordings of the focus groups were transcribed and transcript ions were reviewed for accuracy. T he transcriptions were analyzed using a qualitative data analysis software program (QSR NVivo Versions 9 and 10). Questions and responses were examined for topics, themes, concepts and ideas. Code (category) labels were made for each topic, theme, concept and idea identified, and the interview segments were categorized i nto these codes. Codes labels were created a priori, based on the topic of each question, as well as \"on the fly,\" that is, grounded in the comments of the participants, a method which allows the participants' beliefs and experiences to emerge without sole ly being predetermined by the interview guide and researchers' hypotheses or presuppositions. The data were then grouped and examined by code label. Data in the major codes are summarized below. 5.b.i.3 Demographic Background of Participants All partic ipants were asked to complete surveys to assess their socio -demographic backgrounds. Below are the data from the English -speaking groups, followed by the data from the Spanish -speaking groups (percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number). In general, compared to the participants in the English -language groups, the participants in the Spanish -language groups were slightly more female; they were older; they had a broader range of educational levels with less higher education; they had lower inc omes; they were more likely to speak Spanish in their homes; and they were less ethnically diverse. 85 English -speaking Participants Living in the Bronx The majority of participants (87%; n=13) stated they lived in the Bronx.

An additional person who did not complete the survey said in his introduction that he was from Mexico. Additionally, during the introductions of the two Spanish -language focus groups, the participants were asked ho w long they had lived in the Bronx. Of 19 people who responded to this question, the median length of time in the Bronx was 30 years. The range was one year to 65 years. Only three people said they lived in the Bronx for less than ten years. Fourteen individuals said they have lived in the Bronx over twenty years. The person who lived in the Bronx for one year lived in a European country for a time after leaving her country of origin.

Everyone was handed three identical lists of 17 health issues (in Engl ish or Spanish), developed by Montefiore Hospital based on data about health status in the Bronx, and asked to choose what they considered the five most important for each of three age groups: (1) all ages, (2) children and (3) teenagers. 91 The health issues were read aloud to minimize the impact of literacy issues. Participants were also invited to add any issue not listed that they considered in the top five. The results were as follows. Community Health Issues for People in the Bronx of All Ages In the responses from the focus groups conducted in English, the most highly endorsed health issue of concern for people of all ages in the Bronx by focus group participants was Diabetes (71%). Ten of the 15 participants rated this as one of the top five health i ssues in the Bronx. Cancer (57%) and Lack of physical activity (57%) were the second highest endorsed health issues in the Bronx. Eight participants each rated these as important health issues for people in the Bronx. The fourth highest (50%) endorsed hea lth issue of concern among the focus group participants was Obesity. Seven participants rated Obesity as one of the top five health issues in the Bronx. The fifth highest rated health issue was tied three -ways between Mental Health/Depression (n=5), Subst ance Abuse (n=5), and Tobacco Use (n=5). Only one response (Medical Insurance Coverage) was written in by a participant. [see next page] 92 Chart 10: Five most important community health issues (English) 93 The Spanish -speaking focus groups were asked the same question about the top five health issues of concern for people of all ages in the Bronx. All 15 respondents included Diabetes (100%) among their top five issues. Cancer and Obesity (67% each) were each selected by ten participants. Substance a buse (53%) was listed by eight participants. Asthma (47%) was listed by seven participants. Only one person (7%) listed Lack of Physical Activity as one of their top five concerns. One person wrote in the issue of Alzheimer's disease . Chart 11: Five m ost important community health issues (Spanish) Thus, the issues endorsed in common among the top five (counting the three tied for fifth place in the English groups) by both sets of language groups were Diabetes, Cancer, Obesity, and Substance Abuse. A significant difference in the responses was that Asthma was cited by nearly half of the Spanish -language participants, but by none of the English -language participants. Conversely, Mental Health/Depression and Tobacco Use were endorsed by a third of the English -language participants, but by none of the Spanish -language participants. 94 Community Health Issues for Children in the Bronx Participants were also asked to list (in no particular order) the top five health issues of concern for children living in the Bronx. Among participants in the English -language focus groups, Obesity (79%; n=11) was the most highly endorsed health issue, followed by Asthma (71%; n=10), Lack of physical activity (64%; n=9), Diabetes and Injury & Violence (36%; n=5). Chart 12: Five most important community health issues for children (English) 95 The responses regarding children's health issues from the Spanish language focus group participants were similar to those from the English language group. The most freq uently listed issue was Obesity (88%; n=15), followed by Asthma (77%; n=13), Injury & Violence (71%; 12), Substance Abuse (53%; n=9), and Lack of Physical Activity (47%; n=8). Diabetes came in sixth at 35% (n=6). No other topics were added to the origina l 17 listed. Some participants may have misunderstood the question: one person listed stroke as one of the top five problems for children. Chart 13: Five most important community health issues for children (Spanish) Thus, the issues endorsed in com mon among the top five for children by both sets of groups were Obesity, Asthma, Lack of Physical Activity, and Injury & Violence. Diabetes was in the top-5 among English -language participants, and sixth in the Spanish -language group. Community Health Iss ues for Adolescents in the Bronx Finally, participants were asked to list the top five health issues of concern for teenagers living in their community (i.e., the Bronx). In the English -language groups, the most highly endorsed health issues were Birth Co ntrol/Family Planning (73%; n=11) and Substance Abuse (73%; (60%; n=9), Mental Health/Depression (53%; n=8) and Injury & Violence were the third, fourth and fifth most important health issues endorsed by participants, respectively. Chart 14: Five most important community health issues for teenagers (English) 97 The Spanish -language focus groups had somewhat different responses to the question about adolescent health issues. Substance Abuse was selected by 86% (n= 14) of the participants, followed by Sexually Transmitted Infections (69%; n=11), Obesity (56%; n=9). HIV and Injury & Violence tied for fourth place (each 50%; n=8). No items were added to the original list of 17 issues. Chart 15: Five most importa nt community health issues for teenagers (Spanish) Thus, the issues endorsed in common among the top five for teenagers by both sets of groups were Substance Abuse, Sexually Transmitted Infections, and Injury & Violence. Unlike the English -language focu s group, Birth Control/Family Planning and Mental Health/Depression were not included among the top five issues by Spanish -language participants, whereas a majority of the latter included Obesity and HIV in their top -five lists. 98 Mental Health Issues In the focus group discussions, all participants were asked, \"How well do you think mental health issues are being dealt with in your community?\" There were two main themes that emerged from the English -language focus group discussions regarding how well men tal health issues were being dealt with in the community. Participants expressed concerns about mental health treatment/treatment options in the Bronx and concerns about underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis of mental health issues in the Bronx community. While these issues were of concern to Spanish - language group participants, they emphasized the inadequate availability of mental health services and the need for outreach and health education about mental health issues. Concerns about Mental Health Treatment o r Treatment Options Participants in both the English - and Spanish -language groups felt that the treatment options available or offered to residents in the Bronx were limited to psychotropic medication and that less attention was focused on therapy to off er strategies for coping with mental health issues. There was also concern among participants that psychiatrists in the Bronx may not be providing mental health patients with the proper dosages of medication for all people. They felt that in addition to pr escription medication to help deal with mental issues, support groups and other therapies allowing people to talk about how they feel are important parts of mental health treatment and are underutilized in the Bronx. One female participant (English, Sept . 30, 2013) said: I think that the doctor prescribes the medication, but if you are going to prescribe a lower dose so the person can manage, then you need other things to support them. You need a support group or you need to make sure they are going to the therapist. But these doctors, they have 30 to 40 patients. [The doctor] ha[s] 10 minutes with you. They don't have time to really investigate what's going on and really give you a complete [treatment plan]. Another male (English, Sept. 30, 2013) comm ented: There is someone living...not far down the block. I see this guy...and he has a problem with his mother...he take[s] medicine, but the same thing is happening and re -happening. Two or three weeks home [and then his mother would call] the police [and the y] would come and get him...and make him go [to the hospital]. He'd come back, [for] a week he is good and then he's back to the same thing. 99 A female (Spanish, Oct. 12, 2013) commented: Yes, I have seen, in the short time that I've been here, that the area of mental health assistance is really loose here. Like they don't pay enough attention to people with mental health problems...I've seen families that are in chaos, that have ...mental disabilities like pathological lying, that causes a lot of problems in the family. Because if there is a family member who only tells lies, that becomes something mental, a mental health problem. And then that person gets sick and makes those around them sick, it creates nervous problems, they begin to fight. Then when they need help, they should be able to go to the psychologist or psychiatrist for therapy on how to manage their problem, but I don't see that. I just see that they just get in more conflict day after day and they create more problems. Every time they go to their medical appointment they get medication, just medication, and no trying to treat that mental behavior they have, their way of acting. Concern about treatment options was also echoed for children living in the Bronx. One male participant (English , Oct. 5, 2013) said about an 8 -year old boy that was diagnosed with autism: \"After the whole diagnostic part, I have not noticed any kind of progress. They found out that there was a problem with him, but they haven't been able to move forward to treat it properly. So the diagnostic part, to reach a conclusion, has been perfect, but how about the solution?\" Another male participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) said about treating mental disorders in children: \"Maybe they haven't chosen the right treatment. [I am a teacher and]...I think that some [treatments] have worked very well because I experience it and I work with it every day but some aren't right for everyone.\" A female participant (Spanish, Oct. 12, 2013) commented on a problem she has observed: I know of a four -year -old girl who is developing mental problems, in her behavior, so her grandmother, who she lives with, is looking for care for her. Wherever she goes, they toss her out. They throw her here, they throw her there. Four years old! No! \"W ait until she is five.\" When she is five is when she qualifies to see the psychiatrist. I found it so strange but yes, she has to wait until she is five. Why? I find that...it shouldn't be like that, so I think it's better for them to strengthen it [menta l healthcare services], a reinforcement. Mental Illness Underdiagnosed among Adults in the Bronx Some English -language participants were concerned about the need for more accurate diagnosis of mental illnesses among people living in the Bronx. This conce rn was specifically targeted toward adults rather than children, as some participants felt that children had more access and better quality mental health diagnosis. Participants felt that the issue of mental health was being adequately addressed for childr en mostly because school -age children are 100 monitored and observed by adults (i.e., teachers) who would be more likely to notice mental health issues. One female participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) commented: \"Because obviously children are going to school and there are a lot of adults paying attention to them, but for adults, it's like you are on your own, so unless you speak up about it, about how you are feeling, no one is going to notice.\" Along those same lines, another female participant (English, Oc t. 5, 2013) said: \"...because mental illness is not really something that you can see, so [health issues] that have symptoms [are] well -treated...but since mental illness isn't something that you can see...a lot of people are in the closet about [their mental he alth issues] so I don't think it's diagnosed well.\" There was a definite consensus among participants that mental health conditions were under -diagnosed among teenagers and adults. Concerns about Causes of Mental Health Problems, Insufficient Availabili ty of Care, and the Need for Health Education and Outreach In both Spanish -language groups, the open -ended question about how mental health is being managed in the Bronx was first met with responses about how mental health problems are mainly due to insuf ficient parental discipline. A few people in the Spanish groups felt that there is enough mental healthcare, and that the problem is that people do not seek care. Others felt that people are just not aware enough about mental health in general and thus d o not see a need to get care. This issue connects with the need for health education about mental health, as people may not be aware that someone near them has a mental health problem or may prefer not to let anyone else know that the problem exists. A woman (Spanish, Oct. 9, 2013) explained: Here, what there is, many times parents are afraid to begin to educate their children. You see three kids born in this country. When I came, I had been taught by my parents, when I got here I began to contribute, to work, and my husband worked outside of the city....but that was no reason for me to fear my own children, and [not] tell them what time to be home. Obedience is primary... A male participant (Spanish, Oct. 12, 2013) commented: In my building there are you ng men, you know? They don't want to study, they are 19, 20. Their grandfather sells ices and... they sell drugs. Where the problem is, is the grandfather doesn't say anything, he is afraid, it seems, because he is [illegally] selling ices, so what's happe ning there, they want $60 pants and sneakers from $1oo or so to $200, where the problem is, is the grandfather can't control his grandsons. He doesn't set a limit, he doesn't teach them that if there's no money, there's no money. 101 A female participant in t he same group (Spanish, Oct. 12, 2013) continued: I'm getting at it, continuing what he was saying. Mostly it comes from families...who don't help them. For example, youth here, they're a little more rebellious than in other places and the parents...they do n't guide them. They don't have that guide, that education, and they tend to get depressed because they don't feel they can trust people at home. They can't vent with their parents. A female participant (Spanish, Oct. 9, 2013) commented that silence abo ut mental health problems is common in Hispanic communities: We as a community, the majority of Hispanics, we as a group, some Spanish - speaking communities and other minority communities, we have certain taboos about the topic of mental health, and they t ry to keep it hidden. There isn't enough information in the community to let them know that it is a disease like any other. If you have it, if you get treatment and you keep going to support groups, you can survive the illness. That's one thing that affe cts it, that escalates it so that the illness and the family and community problems get a little bigger. A few participants were adamant that they see no gaps in the quality or availability of mental healthcare in the Bronx. Two female participants (Spani sh, Oct. 12, 2013) commented: And about mental health, there's a lot, a lot of help, and especially for children I have, personally, my personal idea is that in this country, no one, no one can complain because the help that exists here for the elderly, f or children, for everybody, is perfect, I would say, to me it's perfect. Here there's help, what happens is that you have to look for it. You have to look for it. You have to look for the place where there is help, talking with counselors at a hospital... I go to the counselor and ask them to advise me where to go. Other participants see problems in the community's knowledge about mental health and the availability of services. A female participant (Spanish, Oct. 9, 2013) responded to the question about h ow well mental health is managed in the Bronx with the following statement: Mediocre. Because for my part I would like to see more education on this theme. More services. Generally that's not what I see. I see people in the street, in my neighborhood, that I know need help for mental situations they have, but I know they lack services....I don't know everything, but let's say there is very little information. The people don't know where to go, what to do, what are the steps to take, for this or that con dition, right in my neighborhood. Mediocre... 102 Another female participant in the same Spanish group (Oct. 9, 2013) commented: There aren't enough services. And if there are services, people don't know where to get them. And even if there are services, there aren't enough services for people of low income...my neighbor had postpartum depression. She began medicine and treatment and it took time, but she was getting worse...Once a person has emotional problems, that affects the whole family and then there are no services, there are no places where they can live, especially those who are alone, without a family. And finally the person with a mental illness ends up alone...It affects the family. The daughter ended up having to take care of her siblings...it's a tr auma, as much for the person who has the illness as for the whole family. A female participant (Spanish, Oct. 12, 2013) commented: ...More attention is needed in that area, in mental health. It's not that there isn't any [attention]. Nor that a person co uldn't get confused because here there are a lot of services - for physical health. There's plenty. That can't be denied. Even free if you have insurance, whatever, but for mental health, I find that from my point of view that there is very little infor mation, or guidance. Although there are services I see too many problems here with mental health. So, if the information were all over, there would be fewer [problems]. There would be fewer. Access to Healthcare Services Participants were asked to loo k at a list of different types of healthcare services (e.g., general medical care, mental healthcare, children's healthcare, maternity and infant care, sexual health/family planning, dental care, vision care, other specialty care [i.e., diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS], and programs to prevent illnesses like cancer, diabetes, asthma) and were asked to think about people they know who live in the Bronx who needed any of these types of care but could not get it and to discuss the reason(s) why they couldn't get th e healthcare. Participants mentioned a range of healthcare services - including specialty care for fibromyalgia, endometriosis, children's healthcare, mental health, Alzheimers' disease, prevention programs for cancer and other illnesses and dental and vi sion care - for which access is inadequate in the Bronx. Participants also felt that there was little to no access to programs (education, counseling, medical testing) focused on preventing illnesses until after a person was already diagnosed with the i llness. One female participant (English, Sept. 30, 2013) said: \"I don't think there's enough programs, like, that's in our faces. Like, for example, I been out of school for about 11 years now and there 103 was never no type of programs about preventing like cancer and other illnesses. We only had like a sex education type of class.\" Another male participant (English, Sept. 30, 2013) agreed with her, saying: I agree with you on that. It's not enough...when you are [diagnosed with an illness] then they giv e all [the information] to you, but before you [are diagnosed], you don't get no...like the doctor's preventive medicine...you know how you get preventive medicine money? We don't get that, cause we don't get that information...to know nothing about preventati ve, until something actually happens to you and you are put in that situation. A male participant (Spanish, Oct. 9, 2013), stated: Part of it, what I don't think is seen around here...we have to work on the medical problem of obesity. If in our community we eat really differently, a lot of flour, a lot of fat...that [nutritional] service in adults, for children, and for the elderly, ....we can eat better and prevent obesity, prevent diabetes and other complications, high blood pressure...We need nutritional serv ices and they are really limited here in the county of the Bronx...You get an appointment for an interview and to enroll in nutrition services - in four or five months if you can get it. Sometimes you even have to go someplace else. Quality of Healthcare i n the Bronx Some participants felt that some healthcare services were available in the Bronx, but they worried about the quality of care people received. For example, one male participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) remarked: \"I don't think that it's they co uldn't get [access to a healthcare service], but it's that you feel as a personal preference that the hospitals in the Bronx aren't the best. ...If I have to go to the doctor, I will go to St. Luke's because I feel that it's a better hospital.\" Information about Healthcare Services Referring again to the list of types of healthcare services, participants were asked: \"How do you feel about the amount of information that is available about how to find these services in the Bronx? Can you think of any situatio n among people that you know where someone didn't know where to get a health service?\" Advertising and Promoting Information about Health Participants had mixed feelings about the amount of information that is available about healthcare services in the Bronx. Some participants felt that there is enough information, especially from hospitals and organizations like Bronx Health Link. Some participants said these places are where they most often receive information about healthcare services. One female 104 participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) said that she found information about different healthcare services at a clinic in a hospital: The number one place is the hospital. They have all the service there and I didn't know that until I started going to the clini c and they had the diabetes class there and they have each one of them, cancer center, asthma, eye/vision, for cancer, they even do blood pressure...but if I wasn't going to that clinic, I wouldn't have even known that they had [those resources] out there. Some participants felt that the information was available, but that people in the Bronx have to really seek out the information in order to get it. A male participant (English, Sept. 30, 2013) said: \"A lot of people ain't willing to do what it takes to get information...\" Other participants felt that there was information about healthcare services, but that it was not properly disseminated and promoted in the community. These participants felt that the information had to be actively sought out by residents i n the Bronx. Participants said there is information available on the Internet, but that a lot of people in the Bronx don't have access to the Internet. A male participant with a disability (Spanish, Oct. 12, 2013) explained how he seeks the information he needs: I always go to the politicians, they can find anything on the Internet. I talk with them and they look for it for me on the Internet and they give me the address and everything and that's how I get to those places. [Facilitator: So what you d o is call the office of the Assembly?] I go there personally and they help me on the Internet, they tell me where to go, they tell me what bus, and with that information, you see, that's how I get to the examination. In several of the groups, there was a lot of discussion about how and where healthcare information was advertised to people in the Bronx. Participants commented that there is an abundance of advertisements for fast food, beer and cigarettes in the Bronx, but far fewer advertisements promoting information about healthcare services. One male participant (English, Sept. 30, 2013) said: \"If they advertise, then they are not advertising things like [healthcare services]. They are advertising things like cigarettes. And beer.\" Another male participa nt (English, Sept. 30, 2013) said: \"Like in this area of the Bronx, you see advertising for you young guys, beers and stuff but there's not advertising for health things that could help you properly.\" Another female participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) said : \"If you go out on one of these streets on a billboard, you will either see advertising for cigarettes or liquor. I have not seen anything for hospitals or different type of care service.\" A female participant (Spanish, Oct. 12, 2013) suggested, \"they co uld advertise that these services exist on television. Then people would see it. \" 105 One female participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) said about mobile health clinic vans that are sometimes seen providing services throughout the Bronx: \" Like for the van thing . They are...approaching people on the street and people have somewhere to go, something to do and they don't really have time to...stop and look at a van and ...talk to a person in a van. So I guess that's not really a good approach because people cannot really just stop in the street when they got to go somewhere.\" Another male participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) said about the mobile health clinics: I know there [are] vans with health and stuff...and I know they go around and whatnot, I know there [are] vans... but I don't think it's...distributed...like how many people can a van see a day? How many people can it actually be shown to? Like if it's...usually stationed at one place,...what if it's two blocks down and you didn't get a chance to see it? You won't know that i nformation or that that is available to you. There's not enough promotion or information to go around. Participants suggested that a peer -to-peer approach might be a more effective way of getting information about healthcare services and prevention progra ms to residents of the Bronx, especially young people. One male participant (English, Sept. 30, 2013) said: \"You need someone on the inside to see what's really going on and to talk to these people and somebody who can actually relate to these people.\" Another female participant (English, Sept. 30, 2013) concurred, saying: \"Peer -to-peer counseling versus having and adult telling them [about healthcare].\" Another male participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) said that the peer -to-peer approach is actually how he was informed about his child's pediatrician: \"Usually, I get it from a family member. For example, we chose our pediatrician for the baby based on our other family members' experience and referral. That's how that information got to me.\" Participants als o expressed concern that health information, particularly preventive information, was only available to people after they are diagnosed with an illness. One female participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) said: \"like prevention programs...you don't really have a ccess to that until you actually have the problem.\" Another male participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013) said: \"[Healthcare providers] never told [a participant] anything about it until she was diagnosed with diabetes so she basically never had access to a pr evention program.\" Health Insurance Coverage Participants were asked: \"Is there anything we have not covered that you think is important concerning the health and well -being of community residents, whether infants, children, teenagers, adults, or senior s, or services needed by them? Participants brought up health insurance as a major issue concerning the health and well -being of community residents. Participants felt that not having insurance was a major barrier to accessing healthcare services. One m ale participant (English, Sept. 30, 2013 ) said: \" Every hospital should have like flyers with different information on them, services... I know that clinics 106 have that but I haven't seen that in hospitals. But some people can't go to clinics because they don't have insurance.\" Participants felt that many people in the Bronx may not even attempt to deal with the health issues that they have because they don't have insurance coverage and are concerned not about getting treatment (i.e., they feel they would be tr eated), but how they would pay for healthcare services after being treated. One female participant (English, Oct. 5, 2013 ) said if she didn't have health insurance, she would not go to the doctor: \"because you are going to get a bill. How are you going to pay that bill? If you had money you would get the insurance to pay for it. If you had money you would get the insurance.\" While one woman in the Oct. 12 Spanish group commented that there is free care for those who don't have insurance, another woman in the same group said that if a person doesn't have insurance and is undocumented, their access to care is limited. I think that if one doesn't have insurance or if one doesn't have papers, too. That affects it. Because there are people who don't have h ealth insurance, and maybe the appointment is very expensive and they go to the doctor and the appointment...you have to pay for the visit and buy the medicine and that can be a factor. And the other thing is papers, there are people that are afraid that if they go to the hospital something will happen to them. They're going to... [pauses] [Facilitator: Deport them?] Yes. Or have them arrested. So that has a lot to do with it for people who don't have papers and because they are afraid to look for that he lp....That is what happened to me and my mother when we first came to this country [ten years ago]. We didn't have papers or insurance, and we didn't have money to go to the doctor. Language and Translation Issues In the Spanish -language focus groups, the participants were asked how well translation services were working. While a few people mentioned that translation services work well in some settings, most people offered criticism and details of what they have experienced, which included: being asked to translate for other patients or seeing other patients being asked to translate; being asked to translate formal clinical language for other patients; being given papers to sign in English with no translation offered; observing that some translators are untrained and do not translate well; having to \"wait all day\" for a translator; and feeling frustrated that so many providers in the Bronx do not speak Spanish. A female participant (Spanish, Oct. 12, 2013) explained, referring to healthcare providers: They have to be looking for a person that speaks the language so that the person knows to be able to, for them to explain to the person, what is it they have to do, what the doctor is saying. Because sometimes they become really rude and one says, 'I don' t know English' and then 'I don't know Spanish either.' Then the person becomes inhibited and wants to leave...then the person doesn't want to 107 look for help because the people treat you badly, because the people who work with the public should have a little more politeness. A woman in the Oct. 9 Spanish group responded to the question, \"how are translation services working?\" as follows: Terrible. Terrible. You go to the doctor and if you don't know the other language, they choose any other patient to inter pret, who doesn't know medical terminology, so that what they are saying is just nonsense. I've seen it just last month. More than that, that was last week that was the last time I saw it. They grabbed a...I was in the clinic, I have an ear infection. And they chose another patient, they don't care about your business, they don't care about your [private] information. How can you choose one patient to interpret for another? Here in the Bronx! In a very well -known clinic. Another female participant (Spa nish, Oct. 9, 2013) described being in pain and being asked to translate: What happened to me was I was going to have my son. I'm bilingual, I speak Spanish and English. They had me walk to open [up my cervix]. While I was walking, a doctor stopped me so that I could translate for a woman they were going to discharge that day. I'm a patient, I have to tolerate the pains of contractions, to translate for another woman who is there. That's what happened to me. A male participant (Spanish, Oct. 9, 2013) added: This is really bad because, like she says, I've seen it a lot in the hospital where they call whatever person to translate - and I don't know anything about translating, because sometimes the doctor talks to you in a language, even in Spanish, for example, I know English and Spanish, and in the way the doctor talks to you about illness that you don't understand, it has to be not just a translator, but a person who knows clinically what you're talking about because I can translate but I can't...[becaus e they use] I think really formal, clinical words. A female participant (Spanish, Oct. 9, 2013) described what she has observed: I've seen it in the hospital. Someone comes in with a pain, they are yelling in pain, they don't understand the nurse. 'I do n't know English.' But you see a person is shouting in pain, find someone who can speak Spanish so that they know what the person has. But they don't get anyone and they just ignore them, they walk away, and they don't attend to the person. They don't lo ok for anyone, the person [patient] themselves is looking. I see it in the hospital, it has 108 happened to me in the hospital, I'm really sick, and I see all that, and I say, 'Oh, my God.' Another female participant (Spanish, Oct. 9, 2013) stated: That's a really big problem. I've have seen people go to the doctor. They get there at 9:00 in the morning and they have to leave at 5:00 because they have to wait for an interpreter the whole day and if there is no interpreter, they make an appointment for anoth er day because the doctor doesn't speak Spanish or they don't have someone, they don't have an interpreter. Because, the truth, they can't get some other person to come tell the information to the doctor because that's against the law. So I've seen other p eople who have to come back another day... Combining the results of both the English - and Spanish -language groups, participants felt that diabetes, cancer, lack of physical activity, obesity, mental health/depression, substance abuse, asthma, and tobacco u se were the most important health issues of concern for residents of all ages living in the Bronx. For children residing in the Bronx, obesity, asthma, lack of physical activity, substance abuse, injury & violence, and diabetes were the most important heal th issues identified by participants. Participants felt that the most important health issues for teenagers were substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, injury & violence, birth control/family planning, mental health/depression, obesity, and HIV. Participants in all groups had concerns about mental health treatment, availability of care, and treatment options available to people in the Bronx and that mental illness was being underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed in the Bronx. They felt more community education and outreach about mental health is needed. In term of healthcare services in the Bronx, English - speaking participants felt that specialty care, children's healthcare, mental healthcare, dental and vision care and prevention programs were diffic ult to access. There was also concern that the quality of healthcare services in the Bronx was less than optimal and that this negatively impacted local access to healthcare services. Participants voiced mixed opinions about how information about health i s advertised and promoted in the Bronx. Some felt that health information was available, while others felt that the health information was not being properly advertised or promoted to reach enough people in the Bronx. Participants also voiced concern about the lack of health insurance coverage as a major barrier to access to healthcare. Participants in the two Spanish -language focus groups expressed serious concerns about the inadequacy of translation and interpretation services for communications between healthcare providers and patients, and for official documents that patients must sign. 109 5.b.ii Community Forum 5.b.ii.1 Purpose/Process The Community Forum conducted as a part of the first Bronx Health Summit was to explore another venue for understa nding current community views on the most pressing health issues and the availability and quality of healthcare in the Bronx. Specifically, the purpose for the event was to elicit community opinions on (1) the most important health problems among the commu nity (2) gaps in healthcare availability in the Bronx, (3) the availability of information on where to access various types of healthcare, and, (4) how well translation services are functioning in Bronx healthcare settings. To collect the data of intere st, the methodology of a community forum was utilized because: 1) open -ended questions enable capturing participants' wording and experiences with less bias from researchers, 2) the group participants' engagement in the dialogue stimulates participants to recall issues surrounding health and healthcare that they deem most important, and 3) such forums facilitate the reaching of more participants than one -on-one interviews. 5.b.ii.2 Methods To recruit participants for the Bronx Borough President's Bronx Health and Wellness Summit, recruitment flyers were prepared and circulated via email to a wide range of community -based organizations in the Bronx, including the Bronx Community Research Review Board. Additionally, the information was posted repeatedly in Bronx Health Link's e -newsletter and on the agency's website. The Borough President's office also engaged in extensive outreach efforts through the media and various community and institutional contacts. The discussion guide, including demographic sur vey questions, were developed based on discussion guides used by other organizations that have performed Community Health Needs Assessments, as well as suggestions from Judy Wessler, former Director, Commission on the Public's Health System (NYC). The demo graphic survey data was analyzed by transcribing the written surveys into Surveymonkey.com, an online survey software tool. The event was held at Fordham University on April 6, 2013 to address the health needs and issues of Bronx residents. Consumers and health providers living in and serving the Bronx shared experiences, suggestions and opinions about health services in the community. The Summit addressed concerns relative to healthcare access and quality of care. During the Summit, Bronx Health Link or ganized two back -to-back workshops, each 90 minutes long, titled, \"Are Your Health Needs Being Met?\" The goal was to offer a venue for Bronx consumers and providers to provide input to the Community Health Needs Assessment through a series of structured qu estions, following brief presentations by a provider and a community leader to provide context for the discussion. Participants were also invited to add written comments on a survey form. A total of 40 people attended the two sessions. 110 Two Bronx -based sp eakers presented at the sessions , one a longtime patient advocate, the other an emergency room doctor, to make comments at the start of both sessions to set a context for the discussion. 5.b.ii.3 Demographics Participants were asked to complete written forms to assess their socio -demographic backgrounds. Of the 40 Forum participants in the two sessions, 32 completed a demographic survey, yielding a response rate of 80%. Zip Code Due to the location of the forum, the highest proportion (16.1%) of in dividuals who attended, live in the immediate location with which the forum took place - Fordham University (10458). Of note, there were 2 participants that did not live in the Bronx, designated by their stated zip code of 10029 (East Harlem). 111 Source o f healthcare services The response rate to this questions was very low at 47% (N=15). Of the participants who did answer, the most common answer to this open -ended question was Montefiore Hospital (N=7, 22%). Other responses included such Bronx instit utions as Bronx -Lebanon, Einstein, Morris Heights Health Center, and Lincoln Hospital, as well as Manhattan Physicians Group, Metropolitan Hospital, and Roosevelt Hospital. Of note is that the two non -Bronx residents did list their healthcare center as one in Manhattan. Gender and Race/ Ethnicity The forum was largely attended by women (87%, N=27), very few male participants (13%, N=4) 112 In response to the question \"How do you describe yourself\", 50.8% of respondents identified as Latino/Hispanic. The second highest at 22.6% identified as African American/ Black American, followed by 16.1% as Non -Latino/Hispanic Caribbean, and 6.5% Non -Latino/Hispanic White European American. No one at the event identified as African or Asian. 113 Age Group The largest percentage of respondents fell in the 40 -54 age range (43.3%). No one below the age range of 25 attended the forum, and only one person within the 25 -39 age range. There were 9 individuals in the 55 -64 age group and 7 individuals in the 65 or olde r age group. Household Income 114 In the question of household income, 25.8% (N=8) of respondents reported $20,000 to $29,999 - barely exceeding the 22.6% of individuals who chose not to answer. Due to this fact, the individuals who did not answer could easily change the order of the income categories. Keeping this in mind, 12.9% of participants said their household earned $30,000 to $49,999. Both the categories of Less than $10,000 and $50,000 or more were answered by 9.6% of participants. Lastly, 19.4% of participants reported household earnings of $10,000 to $19,999. 5.b.ii.4 Results The discussion in the two sessions was very broad -ranging. While there were no simple statements from respondents about which health issues were considered the most impo rtant in the Bronx, many problems that they had experienced with the healthcare system were voiced. Four common themes were evident from the discussions and written feedback: problems with doctor -patient communication, discrimination, and quality of care barriers related to payments, hours, transportation, and physical access, insufficient translators of the primary languages of consumers, and inadequate access to healthy foods. Problems with doctor -patient communication, discrimination, and quality of care Speaker Dennis Terry, a co -founder of Bronx Health Link and former board chair of Bronx - Lebanon Hospital, explained that a significant problem with several healthcare organizations is their lack of adoption of electronic medical records. \"Why is it t hat the same institutions ask the same questions [of patients]?\" He noted that this takes up valuable time during a doctor's appointment. Mr. Terry also said that some doctors do not listen well to patients. Several consumers voiced their similar concern s about doctor -patient relationships. They said that doctors need to be more attentive to, and have proper communication with, their patients. In addition, there were complaints about racial discrimination and cultural insensitivity by some care providers. Comments: \"Doctors need to be more respectful and there needs to be better dialogue.\" \"Doctors need to better understand the communities they serve. That's the only way people are going to have a better relationship with their doctor.\" \"I asked my d octor how I should lose weight, and the doctor responded rudely.\" \"Relations of doctors to patients need to be better. Some doctors are incompetent. 'I don't know' is not the right answer. Lead me to the direction.\" 115 \"Some foreign doctors (Indian and oth ers) bring with them their culture of talking down to patients. This needs to change.\" \"Doctor's aren't trained in cultural sensitivity. What can we do to change the culture of other doctors?\" \"There's systematic discrimination in the hospital [against p eople of color]. People need to feel they are coming to a place where they are welcomed. Or else they won't come.\" \"Our societal disenfranchisement, we get that already [outside healthcare institutions], and so now when you come into people who care for your health, that just kind of adds on to the list of ways people in the community have been systemically discriminated against. Where's the love?\" \"There needs to be more and better service for the elderly. Nursing homes are horrible.\" \"Seniors [are] no t receiving the proper health services.\" \"Seniors needs someone to advocate for them.\" \"The things I hear are that the doctors don't hear [their patients]. Voice your opinions.\" Barriers related to payments, hours, transportation, and physical access: Speaker Dr. Vanessa Calderon, Chief Resident at Jacobi Hospital and representative of the Committee of Interns and Residents, said that emergency rooms are overcrowded largely because most patients don't have insurance and/or a primary care doctor. She gav e examples of healthcare facilities in the Bronx that offer care for the uninsured or underinsured, including undocumented immigrants Speaker Dennis Terry added that ER waiting times and time between clinic appointments could be reduced by expanding the h ours of other healthcare facilities. Several consumers echoed these concerns. In the course of the discussion, one person said most people don't realize that if one does not have insurance, one can go to federally funded health care centers that are requ ired by law to ensure that all people are served (see NYS list at www.chcanys.org ). It was also mentioned that The New York Immigration Coalition ( www.thenyic.org ) works to prote ct the rights of immigrants and has information about access to healthcare. It was also noted that all hospitals in NY State that have an ER are required to have a Charity Care Policy. Sliding fee scales must be available for those who cannot afford care or are uninsured. 116 A repeated theme by consumers was the lack of adequate information about consumers' rights to affordable care and the locations of clinics that serve all regardless of ability to pay. Mr. Terry also noted that the Affordable Care Act i ncludes small pilot programs that experiment with providing access to more preventive care. He urged consumers to ask their doctor to implement such programs - \"they will if more people demand it.\" He also remarked that some healthcare facilities lack acce ssibility for disabled patients. In particular, he cited a lack of compatible transportation, the lack of ramps, and doors that are not wide enough for wheelchairs to navigate. Comments: \"ER room experiences are disastrous, horrendous -- 6 plus hours to have things done. Why? Why can't the system do better?\" \"Patients must be treated better within the emergency rooms and should not have to wait 10 hours to see a physician.\" \"People who show up to the emergency with no health insurance should receive the same proper health services that others attain.\" \"We need more 24/7 clinical practices in NYC.\" \"Whoever created Urgent Care [Centers] needs to win a Nobel Prize - they help. Is there a way we can get a list of clinics that provide urgent care? I th ink the people need more info about them.\" \"I'm from zip code 10466, a huge immigrant community. Health care is non -existent. A lot of undocumented people suffer from mental illnesses, work -related stress, immigration stress. No one cares about immigrants , so how do we build that partnership?\" (A consumer advocate said:) \"A number of private hospitals, including Montefiore, tell the uninsured to go to the public hospitals. And that's a violation of Manny's Law\" [a state statute requiring that hospitals of fer discounted medical service on a sliding scale for people with income up to $62,000 for a family of 4]. \"I hope you update a booklet put out years ago where you surveyed health clinics and published their services, costs, coverage, etc. It was very h elpful.\" \"There's a shortage of primary care in the Bronx. More 24/7 pharmacies would be useful. We have to wait 2 to 3 weeks for prescriptions, and doctors prescribe medicine that's too expensive. And when you ask how much prescriptions cost, doctors nev er know. Why?\" 117 (A doctor said:) \"The truth is, doctors don't know how much medicine costs, it varies everywhere. When being prescribed, always ask for the generic, it is cheaper. Also, ask your doctor if your insurance will cover it, they can find out. Wh en in doubt, ask your doctor!\" \"My insurance didn't want to cover for nutritional services, they said I needed to have a BMI of at least 30, and be over 160 lbs.\" \"There needs to be more accommodations for the disabled.\" Insufficient translators of the primary languages of consumers: The language barrier and inadequate language (particularly Spanish) interpretation services in healthcare facilities was another issue addressed by several consumers. It adversely affects quality of care, but consumers and provides reported that Spanish -speaking consumers are sometimes either afraid to ask for a translator or unaware of their right to a translator, regardless of the language they speak. Comments: (A doctor said:) \"People don't want to be a nuisance, so th ey don't ask for translators. We need to encourage them to ask.\" \"One can translate something and it still may not be useful. Spanish speakers speak different dialects and read on different reading levels. If someone reads on a 3rd grade reading level, th ey may not understand documents that are on an 8th grade reading level.\" \"When I came to a hospital after an asthma attack, the nurse who treated me said she doesn't speak Spanish and didn't offer to find someone who did.\" \"It's hard for educated people to get preventive care; imagine what it'd be for people who can't speak English. There's no one coordinated [interpretation] system, and technical terminology confuses.\" (A doctor said): \"Whenever I don't understand some Spanish [spoken by a patient], I a sk, \"What did you mean by that?\" Don't be afraid to ask. (A doctor said:) \"We need to educate people on their rights. Everyone has the right to a translator.\" Inadequate access to healthy foods: The Summit's keynote speaker, Max Gomez, noted that 4 out 10 adults in the Bronx are overweight and 2 out of 3 adults were overweight. Issues brought up in the workshop discussion were the Bronx's limited access to healthy foods and minimal numbers of farmers 118 markets. Concern was also expressed that diabetes is a ffecting children at a very young age because they are not eating healthily. Comments: \"A main issue for me is that diabetes is affecting children now. 10 -12 year olds are obese.\" \"We need more farmers markets. Health options are so limited.\" \"Fruits and veggies are available, but there's n o time to eat or prepare them.\" The Community Forum allowed Bronx consumers and health providers to attend and discuss healthcare access and concerns. The participants were asked to complete written forms that provi ded an understanding of the attendee demographics. A larger proportion of participants live in the direct vicinity of Fordham University. While many obtain their health services from Montefiore Hospital, there was an even distribution of participants who s eek health services from a diverse variety of other hospitals and healthcare centers. The event was representative of the Latino/Hispanic, women, ages 40 and above, and a household income of $20,000 - $29,999. The most popular themes among the discussions and written feedback included doctor -patient communication, payment barriers, transportation barriers, documentation translation or translation services, and inadequate access to healthy foods. These events also provided a venue to encourage the community to play a more active role in advocating for their healthcare rights. 5.b.iii Online Survey 5.b.iii.1 Process The online survey of Bronx directed toward users of healthcare in the Bronx was implemented to understand current community views on the most pressing health issues and the availability and quality of healthcare in the Bronx. Specifically, the online survey sought community opinions on several aspects of health and healthcare in the Bronx: (1) the most important health issues, (2) the quality of management of mental health, (3) gaps in healthcare availability, and (4) the availability of information on where to access various types of healthcare from individuals who did not participate in any of the direct encounter sessions . The sample populati on consisted of Bronx residents and workers ages 18 and over, both English - and Spanish -speaking. To collect the data of interest, an online survey software tool called Surveymonkey.com was utilized. The platform provides an efficient way of obtaining ano nymous demographic background information and personal health concerns from residents throughout the Bronx borough with a narrow timetable and reasonable cost. Surveys were developed in both English and Spanish in an attempt to reach the large Spanish -spea king population of the Bronx. 119 5.b.iii.2 Methods The questions were developed based on discussion guides used by other organizations that have performed Community Health Needs Assessments. The survey contained 21 questions and was created in English and t hen translated into Spanish by a professional transcriber and certified translator. To recruit participants in the online surveys, s eparate recruitment flyers were prepared for the English -language and Spanish -language surveys. The flyers were circulated via email to a wide range of community -based organizations in the Bronx, including the Bronx Community Research Review Board. Additionally, the information was posted repeatedly in BHL's e - newsletter and on the agency's website. A press release was also prepared in conjunction with Montefiore and sent to several Bronx -based community newspapers and television programs. Both surveys were kept open for approximately 3 weeks (23 days), from October 3 to 25, 2013. Upon closure, there were 139 responses to th e English survey, and only 11 responses to the Spanish survey. Therefore, it was determined that the Spanish survey's sample size was too small to constitute an effective comparison group with the English -survey participants. As a result, the Spanish -langu age survey responses were transcribed and aggregated with the English -language survey responses for data analysis. Then rates were calculated for responses to each question. 120 5.b.iii.3 Demographics All participants were asked questions to assess their s ocio -demographic backgrounds. Below are the combined data for the 150 respondents to the English - and Spanish -language surveys. Living in the Bronx Chart 1: Residence The majority of participants identified themselves as residents of the Bronx, at 65 .3%, while 34.7% stated they did not live within the borough. Participants showed approximately the same distribution in reference to where they work. Seventy percent reported working in the Bronx and 30% reported working elsewhere. (Those who answered \"No \" to both questions were instructed that they were not qualified to participate in the survey.) Of the 150 participants, only 126 identified their zip codes. Twenty -four different zip codes were listed. Of those, the most reported were 10452 (N=15), follow ed by 10457 (N=12), 10466 (N=12), and 10461 (N=11). Gender Among survey respondents, the distribution of males to females was 22.6% (N=28) to 77.4% (N=96) respectively. 121 Age Groups Chart 2: Age The largest age grouping within the sampling (27%, N=34) was between the ages of 18 -25 followed by progressively fewer participants in the older age ranges: the 26 -39 cohort (23.8%, N=30); the 40 (21.4%, N=27); 55 (18.3%, N=23); and the -and-older cohort (8.7%, N=11). The lowest percentage (0.8%, N=1) was observed in the under18 cohort. 122 Race/Ethnicity, Language and Nativity Chart 3: Ethnicity Of the 125 participants who identified their race/ethnicity, the largest group listed Latino/Hispanic -Hispanic/Latino) A total of 116 participants identified 17 countries as their countries of birth. The most reported countries of birth were the U.S. (69.8%, N=81), and the Dominican Republic (16.4%, N=19). Only 123 of the 150 participants identified the main language spoken at home. English was the predominant language listed as spoken within the household, for 78.9% (N=97) of participants. Spanish was reported as primarily spoken at home by 21.1% (N=26) of the sampling. One participant identified French as the primary language spoken at home. Total Household Size and Income The data for household size indicated that the largest group of respondents to that ques tion (26.6%, N=33) reported living in a household of 2 people. The next highest category was households of 3 people (21%, N=26). The final four categories for household size, in order from highest percentage to lowest, were: 4 people (18.5%, N=23); 5 peopl e (14.5%, N=18); and more than 5 people (4.8%, N=6). 123 Chart 4: Household Income As to total household income, of the seven ranges offered, the largest response among participants in this sampling was $75,000 or more (42.5%, N=51). The remaining respondents were evenly distributed in the six income ranges below $75,000 (between 8% and 16%, N=69). By contrast, the 2010 U.S. Census estimated that only 20.3% of the Bronx population had a household annual income of above $75,000. Thus it is clear that the survey sample was significantly skewed toward a higher -income cohort. 124 Education Level Chart 5: Education Level The data show a very advanced education level within the sampling. Specifically, 27% (N=34) of the participants h ad a graduate degree; 26.2% (N=33) of the participants had an undergraduate degree; 21.4% (N=27) of the participants had some college experience; 11.1% (N=14) of the participants had a high school degree or equivalent; and 10.3% (N=13) of the participants had a professional degree. In other words, in the survey sample, 85.7% of respondents were high school graduates or higher, and 53.2% had a bachelor's degree or higher. By contrast, the 2010 Census found that only 69.2% of the Bronx population over 25 clas sified as high school graduate or higher, and only 6.5% had a bachelor's degree or higher. As a result, there is a significant difference in educational attainment between the sample population and the Bronx population. Healthcare or Social Service Backg round 51.3% (N=77) of the participants responded to the question asking if the respondent had ever worked within one of four specific health or social service fields. Here, 40.3% (N=31) reported having worked as a healthcare provider; as a s ocial health educator/counselor/community health worker; and 24.7% (N=19) as a health or social service administrator/manager. Thus it seems that survey respondents were rather closely divided between health/human servic e providers and consumers. 125 5.b.iii.4 Results Most Important Health Issues Chart 6: Five most important community health issues Participants were asked for their opinions regarding the most important health issues affecting residents of the Bronx . A list of 17 health issues was developed by Montefiore Hospital based on data about health status in the Bronx. Respondents were asked to choose what they considered the five most important issues on this list, or to add other items not included in the list. Responders rated Obesity (71%, N=97) and Diabetes (67%, N=91) as the two highest health concerns. These interrelated issues were followed by Asthma (46%, N=63), Mental health/ depression (46%, (40%, N=54), and Heart Disease (36%, N=49). The remaining categories closely followed in priority. Of note is that some participants did select more or less than the proposed 5 health outcomes and that there were 14 participants who skipped this question. 126 Health Status The vast majority (91%) of participants within this sample identified their health status as positive. Specifically, responses were 14.6% (N=19) Excellent, 37.7% Very Good (N=49), and 38.5% Good (N=50). Much smaller proportions deemed their health as Fair (8.5%, N=11) or Poor (0.8%, N=1). There were a total of 130 responders to this question. By contrast, the 2012 NYC Community Health Survey by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene found that only 75.9% of Bronxites reported their health as positive, specifically, 12.4% as Excellent, 23.1% as Very Good, 40.4% as Good, versus 24% as Fair or Poor. So again, the survey sample was not representative of the larger population. The participants of the survey were additionally asked if a h ealthcare practitioner had ever informed them they had any of the conditions listed within the bar graph here. Chart 7: Health conditions told by a health professional The responses were overwhelmingly No. Among the responders who indicated Yes, the most reported condition was Obesity (37%, N=44), followed by Asthma High Cholesterol (22.4%, N=26). 127 Health Insurance Status and Knowledge Chart 8: Health Insurance If and when participants are sick, 89.8% (N=114) reported having a healthcare provider for checkups and visits. More than half the participants (53.5%) had insurance through a private company. The remainder of the participants had Medicaid (14.7%), M edicare (11.6%), Family Health Plus (5.4%), Other uncategorized (17.1%), or None (i.e., uninsured) (9.3%). Again, these results contrasted with the findings of the 2012 NYC Community Health Survey, which reported that 31.6% of Bronxites were covered by pri vate insurance, 27.1% by Medicaid, 14.8% by Medicare, and 4% by other programs, whereas 22.6% were uninsured. 128 Issues with Healthcare Access Chart 9: Problems with getting healthcare Participants were asked if, in the last 12 months, the respondent o r a family member had had problems getting needed healthcare. The majority answered No (76%, N=95), compared with 24% (N=30) who answered Yes. Among those who responded Yes, five issues were identified as the most problematic when attaining healthcare: No insurance that covered what I/we needed (28.1%, N=9); Doctor or clinic would not accept my/our insurance (18.8%, N=6); Doctor or clinic not open when I/we can come (15.6%, N=5); Insurance would not pay for care (12.5%, N=4); and Cannot afford co -paym ent (12.5%, N=4). The health issues that participants felt are the most important in the Bronx are obesity, diabetes, and asthma, followed by mental health/depression, and cancer. which matches several of the most prevalent conditions reported listed by the focus group responders about their own health history (in order): obesity, asthma, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and depression/anxiety. It is with good reason that the Bronx community is concerned with these issues. According to the NYC Departmen t of Health and Mental Hygiene's 2012 Community Health Survey data, 33.3% of the Bronx population is overweight, 32% are obese, 15.2% have ever been told by a health professional that they have diabetes,18.1% have ever been told by a 129 health professional th at they have asthma, and 7.1% answered positively to one of several questions about serious psychological distress. Of the approximately one -quarter of respondents who reported problems with healthcare access (for themselves or their family), one of the most common complaints was the failure of their insurance carrier to cover the services they needed. Other problems included healthcare providers not accepting their form of insurance, inconvenient hours by their doctor or clinic, a refusal by insurance t o pay for their care, and an inability to afford co -payments. More than three -quarters of respondents reported no problems in obtaining healthcare for themselves or their families. But again, this high reported proportion may simply reflect the skewed samp le and not be representative of the lived experience of many Bronx residents with healthcare access, as prior studies have suggested. 5.b.iv Primary Data Analysis Key Findings 5.b.iv.1 Key Findings from Quantitative Data The community input data showe d both overlapping and differing findings, which may or may not be linked to the demographic differences noted above. Most Important Health Issues: See table below for a summary of the health issues deemed most important by the participants in the variou s input -gathering activities. The prevailing health issues for all ages chosen by participants in the English -language focus groups were Diabetes, Cancer, Lack of Physical Activity, Obesity, and Mental Health/ Depression . The Spanish -language focus group s shared three of these priorities: Diabetes, Cancer and Obesity . They as also identified Substance Abuse and Asthma as high ranking concerns. The survey group rated Obesity, Diabetes, Asthma, Mental Health/ Depression, and Cancer as their highest concerns . Among survey respondents, different health issues were clustered at the top five. However, among both English - and Spanish -language focus group Rank English-language focus group Spanish-language focus group Online Survey 1 Diabetes Diabetes Obesity 2 Cancer* Cancer* Diabetes 3 Lack of Physical Activity* Obesity* Asthma* 4 Obesity Substance Abuse Mental Health/ Depression* 5 Mental Health/ Depression Asthma Cancer where 1 = highest, 5 = lowest * signifies a tie to preceding/following rank within the categoryMost Important Health Issues: People of all Ages130 participants, there was very little clustering of highly -rated issues outside of the top five. The forum group was not asked to rate their health concerns. Finally, within the focus groups, participants were asked to rate the most important health issues for children and, separately, for adolescents in the Bronx. See tables below. The English -language focus groups, in rating issues for children in the Bronx, reported Obesity, Asthma, Lack of Physical Activity , Diabetes, and Injury & Violence as the highest. Spanish - language focus group participants also designated Obesity and Asthma , but also named Injury & Violence , and Substance Abuse, and Lack of Physical Activity . When asked about the top health issues for adolescents in the Bronx, the English -language focus groups identified Birth Control/Family Planning, Substance Abuse, Sexually Transmitted Infections, and Mental Health/Depression, and Injury & Violence . The Spanish -language focus groups identified three of the same issues - Substance Abuse , Sexually Transmitted Infections, and Injury & Violence - and two different ones - Obesity and HIV.

Some notable trends were identified as common problems with the healthcare system in the Bronx: Members o f the Spanish -language focus groups and some of the community forum participants expressed great distress over seriously inadequate Spanish interpretation and translation in hospitals and other healthcare settings. Among all the groups, there were concern s about the inadequate availability of certain types of healthcare, difficulties in paying for care, a lack of preventative health programs (forum participants specifically mentioned inadequate access to healthy foods), and a lack of information about ava ilable health services. Forum and focus group participants also pointed to barriers to healthcare access caused by limited hours, inadequate transportation options, and problems with physical accessibility. Focus group members expressed concerns with menta l health misdiagnosis, lack of community mental health outreach and education, and mixed feelings about the education materials on mental health issues available within Bronx hospitals. Forum participants also mentioned several specific problems with doct or-patient relationships, including poor communication, discrimination, and quality of care. It should also be noted while only a quarter of the online survey respondents reported problems with healthcare access, among the particular issues of most concer n were providers that would not accept their insurance and insurance policies that did not cover the services they needed. 6. Prioritization of Community Health Needs The primary and secondary data collection process illuminated four major categories of health needs that were both important across the populations surveyed and reflected in the data as critical. The four areas are: (1) Improve Overall Health Status and Reduce Health Disparities, (2) Prevention of Chronic Disease, (3) Prevent HIV/STD's Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Healthcare Associated Infections, and (4) Promotion of Healthy Women Infants and Children .

Measures and Resources to Meet Identified Needs Montefiore is a leader in community health and has a long history of developing innovative approaches to care and tailoring programs to best serve the c hanging needs of its community. These include, but are not limited to the following: Community Service Plan, Community Services Strategy, Accountable Care Organization, Patient -Centered Medical Home, Disease Management Programs, and Community Outreach. T he integration of these innovative approaches serves Montefiore well in its services to its community. Montefiore has a vast portfolio of programs and services that address a majority of the significant community health needs identified in the Community H ealth Needs Assessment. The breadth and depth of the programs and services vary, but each address a need identified in the community. Historically, Montefiore has earned a reputation as a leader in the region, state and nation in providing services to it s community, by developing and operating an extraordinary array of needed services to the poor and underserved, and to specific at -risk populations (e.g., children, the elderly, the HIV -infected, the homeless and victims of domestic violence). Beyond it s involvement in patient care services to individuals within and (in some cases) beyond its service area, the faculty and staff at Montefiore are heavily invested in the provision of service to the wider community, through: the education of health profe ssionals; the generation of new knowledge through basic, clinical and social sciences research; affecting health policy through service on a range of professional, governmental and inter -institutional boards and advisory group; and by involvement in programs of community service (like housing preservation) which go beyond the boundaries of health and health care. Montefiore embraces its social responsibility and defines its role broadly, promoting wellness in addition to treating disease and address ing needs ranging far beyond medical care. We extend this responsibility to the care of our employees and medical staff, many of whom live in the surrounding community. The population Montefiore serves is one of the most diverse in the nation. Montefio re has been an incubator for programs that improve patients' access to culturally appropriate services, and its progressive financial aid policy and robust entitlement enrollment program support access to care for those in need. Historically, Montefiore h as viewed community service and community health improvement as a delivery system challenge, reaching out to serve the under -resourced. 135 Services to the community are an explicit and essential component of Montefiore's mission and one of its most valued t raditions. The medical center has a long history of reaching beyond the walls of its hospitals to identify and meet the needs of its community and has been a national leader in organizing and expanding community -based services. Our commitment to the commu nity has required a multifaceted, continually evolving response, in which the unique capacities of the academic medical center are mobilized to improve the lives of the people and the communities we serve -- not just medically, but socially, economically a nd environmentally, wherever and whenever our resources can make a difference. For much of our history, community service at Montefiore has been a vital grassroots movement. When pressing needs arose that lay beyond the purview of traditional health car e, physicians, nurses, social workers, staff and community partners have stepped in to address them. These programs tackle a remarkable range of health problems in the Bronx; from the epidemics of diabetes and obesity to high rates of teen pregnancy. They come in an equally impressive range of sizes; from an online guide to hundreds of social services to complex federally -funded agencies with hundreds of staff. With the understanding that the practice of medicine is a service to the community, we have def ined community service to include those efforts at preventing disease, enhancing wellbeing and enacting social change that go beyond traditional health care and its fee -for-service reimbursement system. Through this entrepreneurial spirit, over the past o ne hundred years in the Bronx, Montefiore associates have developed, independently and in collaboration with other organizations, an impressive array of programs that address many of the needs of our communities. In many cases the programs developed in th e Bronx have resulted in national changes in best practices and through our relationship as the University Hospital for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine , the programs have the capacity to expand the evidence base to improve the health of communities like ours beyond our borders. 7a.

New York State Health Improvement Plan - Implementation Plan and Measures As a part of the Montefiore submission for the New York State Health Improvement Plan for 2014 -2017, required by the N ew York State Department of Health, four broad focus areas in two priority areas - Preventing Chronic Disease and Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children, in addition to the large array of services provided by Montefiore were identified. These broad focus areas are (1) Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults, (2) Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure (3) Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings, and (4) Improving Maternal and Infant Health. Across these focus areas, six goal s, with specific interventions, performance measures and time frames, were identified, and are described in the next section. Prevent Chronic Diseas e Focus Area 1: Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults In continuation of the efforts proposed in the 2010 -2013 Community Service Plan, Montefiore will continue to apply its efforts to the prevention, control and dissipation of obesity in children and ad ults. Goal 1.0.1 - Reduce the percentage of children who are obese Strategic Plan : To address the significant issue of obesity reduction in children, Montefiore has partnered with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Honorable Br onx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., and New York State Senator, 33rd District Gustavo Rivera (D) to convene a group of strategic industry leaders across healthcare, government, retail, faith - based, community, municipal and civic groups to collectively ad dress obesity in the borough of the Bronx. Through the formation of the Bronx Campaign to Prevent and Control Obesity, it is the collective belief that the five agreed upon measures can advance the borough in decreasing obesity. Goals & Objectives : The C ampaign has several key interventions that can be used by the various partners to ensure that there is a consistent message delivered across the community related to obesity. The key interventions below, which have multiple sub elements, will be used to di rect the borough wide obesity prevention and reduction message. The goals presented below are a part of the larger borough -wide initiative in which Montefiore intends to contribute in meaningful ways. Key Intervention 1: Launch health promotion and educa tion campaigns Key Intervention 2: Improve worksite food and physical activity environments Goals: Fully adopt NYC Food Standards in 9 Bronx hospitals Adopt NYC Food Standards at 50 other large employers Key Intervention 3: Increase healthy eating opport unities in retail settings Goals: 182 350 retailers adopt Shop Healthy Bronx changes Have a minimum of five retail food distributors adopt Shop Healthy changes Distribute at least 20,000 additional Health Bucks Key Intervention 4: Increase physical activity in schools and the community Goals: Have approximately 4,000+ Bronx elementary teachers trained in classroom physical activity programs Work with approximately twenty affordable housing sites, schools and community groups champion and implement active des ign improvements Key Intervention 5: Increase obesity -related interventions in healthcare centers Goals: Increase current level of referrals and bring on board 20 additional health centers that refer to YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program (Y -DPP) Work with t wenty health centers to promote healthy eating and active living through electronic medical records (EMR), prescriptions for prevention and more. The diversity in the group's membership means that not every organization will work on every intervention; ho wever there is a commitment to unify the message for Key Intervention 1. Evidence Base : There have been numerous studies supporting the five key interventions that have been conducted not only by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, as well as the national Let's Move Campaign, and the efficacy of the YMCA's Diabetes prevention Program, among others. Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets : For the following Key Interventions, the larger organization has planned for a longer time frame than is covered through the Community Service Plan time period of 2017, for the achievement of several of these goals. However, it is our anticipation to make significant progress as indicate on these interventions for reporting through 2017. Key Intervention 1: Launch health promotion and education campaigns Key Intervention 2: Improve worksite food and physical activity environments Performance Measure: Reduce Obesity in the Bronx by 10% Key Intervention 3: Increase healthy eating opportunities i n retail settings Performance Measure: Reduce the percentage of Bronxites who consume one or more sugar sweetened beverages a day by 30% Key Intervention 4: Increase physical activity in schools and the community Performance Measure: Decrease the percenta ge of Bronxites who report no fruit or vegetable consumption by 30% Key Intervention 5: Increase obesity -related interventions in health care centers Performance Measure: Decrease the percentage of Bronxites who report no physical activity in the past 3 0 days by 15% 183 Goal 1.3 - Expand the role of healthcare and health service providers in obesity prevention Strategic Plan : As this Objective 1.3.2: increase the percentage of infants born in NYS hospitals who are exclusively breastfed during the birth hosp italization is closely aligned with the Priority Area Preventing Chronic Disease, Focus Area 2 - Maternal and Infant Health Goal 2.2.1 - Increase the proportion of infants born in New York State who are exclusively breastfed during the birth hospitalizatio n, we have detailed the plan in that section, located below. Focus Area 2: Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure Goal 2.2.2 - Increasing the number of unique callers to the New York State Quit -Line Goal 2.2.2 - Decreasing the prevalence of cigarette smoking by adults ages 18 years and older Strategic Plan : Montefiore has been successful at increasing the number of unique callers to the New York State Quit -Line with our inpatient populations as we ha ve been able to document 100% contacts for patients at discharge with provision of the New York State Quit -Line information. In 2012, this covered over 50,000 unique adult, aged over 18 lives. We have also been tremendously successful with the expansion of the smoke free campus to cover all of our locations in addition to our acute care hospitals and have remained an ardent support of supplemental nicotine replacement therapy in the community as demonstrated by Montefiore's annual distribution of NRT acr oss the Bronx. Goals & Objectives : The goal is to increase the rate of unique callers from across our ambulatory populations and within the communities that our ambulatory facilities are located in by enhancing the training of physicians and increasing th e quantity and visibility of the education we provide in the Bronx. Evidence Base : The evidence base for the expansion of smoking cessation programs especially using the New York State Tobacco Control program is substantial. Bronx BREATHES, our partner i n this activity, as well as the Partnership for a Smoke Free Bronx are state and federally funded entities. The measures of these activities are constructed within the framework established by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's He althy Hospital Initiative and the results will be evaluated through the NC Prevention Partners, a national leader in tobacco cessation evaluation. 184 Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets : The performance measures associated with the increasing of u nique callers to the quit line and the decreasing of smoking prevalence in adults 18 year and older are: Performance Measures (Increasing Unique Callers): Number of callers referred to the quit line as documented in the Electronic Medical Record data Inco rporate quit line information on patient discharge information Receive reporting through Bronx BREATHES of referral of patients through the Fax to Quit program to enhance the number of calls/contacts with the Quitline Performance Measures (Decreasing the smoking prevalence in adults): Increasing the provision of pharmaceutical Nicotine Replacement Therapy by appropriate clinical staff to individuals who desire to eliminate tobacco use. Increasing the prominence of advertising and traditional and social med ia messaging to increase the likelihood of appropriate messaging reaching individuals with appropriate readiness levels to quit smoking Timeframe targets: As Montefiore is pursuing Gold Star Status, through the New York City Department of Health and Menta l Hygiene's Healthy Hospital Initiative, having achieved both Bronze and Silver Star Status, this is an important activity for the hospital. We anticipate being able to attain this status by 2015, and to maintain it through 2017. Focus Area 3: Increase A ccess to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings Goal 3.3.1 - Increasing screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers especially among disparate p opulations Strategic Plan : Montefiore has selected to focus on increasing screening rates for diabetes especially among disparate populations through the increased implementation of and referral to the YMCA of New York City's Diabetes Prevention Program (Y -DPP) across Montefiore Medical Center's Montefiore Medical Group sites, while continuing participation in the South Bronx Community Referral Task collaboration to increase the number of community available sites for Y -DPP. Goals & Objectives : The YMCA's Diabetes Prevention Program helps those at high risk adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles and reduce their chances of developing type 2 diabetes. The goals of the program are to: Reduce body weight by 7% Gradually increase physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week In a classroom setting conducted either in the community or in the clinical setting, a trained lifestyle coach will instruct participants on how to change their lifestyle by learning about 185 healthy eating, physical activity and other behavior changes over the course of 16 one -hour sessions. The topics covered include nutrition, getting started with physical activity, overcoming stress, staying motivated, and others relevant to the group. After the initial 16 core sessions, monthly meet ings continue for up to a year for added support to help with maintenance of the progress they have achieved. Blood glucose monitoring is a part of the clinical visit and is not monitored specifically within the Y -DPP group. However, the patient's physici an received progress reports at four weeks, nine weeks and 13 weeks to incorporate the education provided in the program into the patients overall primary care services. Evidence Base : The Y -DPP Community Program Implementation is supported by multiple st udies including the Translating the Diabetes Prevention Program into the Community: The DEPLOY Pilot Study conducted by Ackermann et al (2008) and YMCA Model Adapting the Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention for Delivery in the Community by A ckerman and Marrero (2007). The YMCA Diabetes Prevention program is based on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which showed that by eating h ealthier, increasing physical activity and losing a small amount of weight, a person with pre -diabetes can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes by 58%. Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets : Performance Measures: The performance measures as sociated with the implementation of the YMCA of New York City's Diabetes prevention program are as follows: Number of patients referred into the Y -DPP program, or other approved DPP program Duration of Y -DPP participation Percentage reaching body weight ta rget Percentage reaching physical activity target Number of patients referred to Y -DPP that demonstrate decreases in A1c in aggregate Time Frame Targets: The Montefiore implementation is currently focused on six Montefiore Medical Group sites, however, in 2014, it is the intention to expand to another four Montefiore Medical Group sites and by 2017 have all sites with eligible adults referred to the program. As New York and other states are currently examining offering access to the DPP programs as a cove red benefit, this timeline may be accelerated. 186 Promote Healthy Women Infants and Children Focus Area 2 - Maternal and Infant Health Goal 2.2.1 - Increase the proportion of infants born in New York State who are exclusively breastfed during the birth ho spitalization Strategic Plan & Goals : Montefiore Medical Center has committed to achieving the goals of the Baby Friendly Hospital initiative and has signed on to the New York City Department of Health's Latch -On NYC Initiative to support breastfeeding mot hers and to increase the proportion of women that are achieving the World Health Organization's target rate of having the first six months of an infant's life with exclusive breastfeeding. Initiative Objectives : The objectives of the Latch on NYC initiati ve are as follows: 1. Montefiore will enforce the New York State hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with formula feeding unless medically indicated and documented within the infants medical record 2. Provide physical restriction to infan t formula by hospital staff including the tracking of infant formula distribution with the health department 3. Discontinue the distribution of free promotional formula 4. Prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula promotion materials in any hospita l location. The objectives of the Baby Friendly Hospital are: 1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. 2. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implement this policy. 3. Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. 4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. 5. Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation, even if they are separated from their infants. 6. Give infants no food or drink other than breast -milk, unless medically indicated. 7. Practice rooming in - allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day. 8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand. 9. Give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants. 10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or birth center. Evidence Base : The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) developed and launched in 1991 as a program of the World Health Organizati on and UNICEF is a part of the global effort to support and enable mothers to initiate breastfeeding their babies, with the recommendation for exclusively breastfeeding infants for their first six months of life. This initiative works to the care of pregn ant women, new mothers and their infants in hospitals and other health providing 187 institutions due to research and clinically reported improved lifelong outcomes in health for both the breastfed infant and the mother. Additional information about the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative can be found here http://www.babyfriendlyusa.org/ . Latch -On NYC, an initiative of the New York City Department of Health, is a local effort within the New York City CDC that has encouraged all NYC maternity hospitals to make a voluntary commitment to support mothers who choose to breastfeed by providing additional support to breastfeeding mothers and minimize practices that can interfere with that choice such as supplementing bre astfeeding infants with formula, unless medically indicated or at the mother's specific request. Participating hospitals also pledge to end the distribution of promotional formula and materials during the hospital stay and at discharge. Supporting this institutional initiative is a public awareness campaign to promote the health benefits of breast milk, and to inform women of their right to receive education, encouragement and support to breastfeed their babies if they choose to do so. When hospitals stop promoting infant formula, mothers are more likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies. The evidence supporting this initiative is strong. An evaluation of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation data has shown that after the Health and Hospi tals Corporation (HHC) hospitals discontinued providing infant formula samples at hospital discharge and implemented other practices to support breastfeeding, the exclusive breastfeeding rate at eight weeks following delivery increased by 21%, with no chan ge in rates for mothers delivering at nonHHC facilities. Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets : In 2012, over 6,300 infants were delivered at Montefiore, with over 2,400 of those infants delivered women defined as low income. Performance Measures: Identification of the following Exclusion criteria Delivery Type Skin to Skin Contact Labor Pain Management Type of Infant Feeding through Hospital Stay Pacifier Use Rooming In Previous Breastfeeding Experience & Success (If Applicable) Feeding Intent Barriers to Breastfeeding (for non -exclusive mothers only) Development of the following: Written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implement this policy. 188 Educational materials and messaging that inform pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding Initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. Lactation maintenance education during separation from infant Establishment of breastfeeding su pport groups for referral upon discharge Time Frame Targets: The time frame established for achievement of the baby friendly hospital designation is 2017. Achievement of the entire Latch on NYC protocol is also expected to be achieved by 2017. Montefior e has established a Breastfeeding Committee that contains an inter -organizational, interdisciplinary membership from Montefiore, Jacobi Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Supplementary membership is held by the Assistant Commissio ner of the Bronx District Public Health Office and the Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau of Maternal and Infant and Reproductive Health at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. These initiatives which address the New York State He alth Improvement Plan , in addition to the various activities conducted as a part of Montefiore's general operations, will be reported to the communities we serve as well as key stakehold ers. 7c. External Resources and Linkages After a thorough assessment of the health needs of Bronx residents, as provided through both primary and secondary data sources, in this report Montefiore has identified a set of major health indicator themes from across primary and secondary data sources. As the Bronx has a signifi cant Spanish language dominant population, primary data collection assessment was conducted in English and Spanish. Among primary data sources, as described in Section 4.a.ii.1.b the prevailing health issues for all ages chosen by participants in the Engli sh- language groups were Diabetes, Cancer, Lack of Physical Activity, Obesity, and Mental Health/ Depression. The Spanish -language groups shared three of these priorities: Diabetes, Cancer and Obesity. They as also identified Substance Abuse and Asthma as h igh ranking concerns. The survey group in aggregate rated Obesity, Diabetes, Asthma, Mental Health/ Depression, and Cancer as their highest concerns. In examining secondary data sources, themes emerged across specific types of healthy system encounters th at serve as prioritization beacons for addressing community health needs. As the nation's largest emergency department system, the data demonstrates that Asthma, unspecified type, with acute exacerbation had the highest total number of ED diagnoses in the Bronx in 2010 -2011 while in 2012, Viral Infection unspecified had the highest total number of ED diagnoses. For individuals admitted into the hospital system, overlapping themes between inpatient diagnoses and ambulatory sensitive discharges emerged: Across the top 25 inpatient diagnoses in the Bronx, the primary themes are: 189 Heart Disease & Stroke Respiratory Diseases Communicable Diseases Maternal, Fetal, and Infant Health Substance Abuse The major health indicator themes that are described among the top 20 inpatient ambulatory sensitive discharges in the Bronx are: Diabetes Heart Disease & Stroke Respiratory Diseases Nutrition Disorders Digestive Disorders Montefiore's reputation as an institution with a commitment to social just ice over its 125 year history and its position as a premier academic medical center and the University Hospital of Albert Einstein College of Medicine has encouraged the development of programs and resources to meet the needs of its community. Montefiore has been in the Bronx for over 100 years and the institution has experienced the ethnic and cultural migrations of the popula tions that have resided in the c ounty, which has given it a unique perspective. As the county's largest employer and reflecting th e diversity of the county among its workforce, many nationally innovative programs, including the Montefiore Lead Safe House, the Montefiore School Health Program, the J.B. & Z.E. Butler Child Advocacy Center, and others have allowed Montefiore to improve the health of the county's residents while providing a national model for other regions to adopt into best practice. As a forward acting institution, programs developed within Montefiore over the years, have addressed many of the areas identified as prim ary concerns in the document, but what makes these programs unique is the partnerships that have evolved and been developed between Montefiore and other institutions that truly work to address the social determinants of health. In addition to the multipl e resources that have been developed at Montefiore independently and through partnership with other organizations, there is an extensive set of resources that are available to meet the needs of Bronx residents which cannot be met entirely by Montefiore programs and services, or that choose to utilize external organizations. Furthermore, as Montefiore is an organization that works with complex health needs and whose community faces multi -factorial crises that impact upon overall health, the following list o f external resources has been made developed to provide additional information to address these needs. As the social determinants of health are as critical as the promotion and delivery of clinical health services for the advancement of health in the bor ough, through our collaborations with external organizations, we have increased the referral network available for our patients to access resources to meet their needs. Montefiore's membership in the Greater New York Hospital Association has permitted us to support the work of the Greater New York Hospital Foundation, which has produced a referral 190 service accessible through the website www.hitesite.org . Through collaboration with the Office of the Bronx Borough Pr esident, we have aligned with www.bronxmall.com to provide access to resources specific to residents in each of the borough's 12 community advisory boards. The primary areas for program support in collaboration wi th external partners fall across the following areas: (1) Dental and Optical, (2) Financial Assistance, (3) Healthcare and Medicine, (4) Immigrant Support. (5) Mental Health & Substance Abuse, (6) School, Youth and Family Services, (7) Social Services, (8) Transportation, and (9) Wellness and Prevention. The 2013 Directory of Community Resources developed for the 2013 Montefiore Medical Center Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Plan, in partnership with a range of collaborating organizat ions, provides information on resources for the community in nine critical areas that impact physical and mental health, as well as the social determinants of health, that are recognized to have a strong impact on health seeking behaviors, health maintenan ce behaviors and health outcomes in the Bronx. It is in partnership with these organizations that we work to promote a healthier population across Bronx County and uplift and improve the health of the community we serve. 2013 Directory of Community Resou rces Table of Contents Page Dental and Optical 190 Financial Assistance 208 Healthcare and Medicine 279 Immigrant Support 371 Mental Health & Substance Abuse 399 School, Youth and Family Services 477 Social Services 569 Transportation 642 Wellne ss and Prevention 646 Dental & Optical BronxCare - Eye Care Center 1650 Grand Concourse, Ground Floor Bronx, NY .bronxcare.org/BronxCareNetwork.html Non -profit clinic providing patients of all ages with eye care.

Write names on cards 2. Facilitator intr oduces herself: [Sly is a Community Psychologist who is passionate about working with underserved populations and improving health disparities in these communities. She has studied disparities in health for several years on topics such as cancer preventio n, adolescent and emerging adult health behavior and currently assisting The Bronx Health Link today with this project. Has worked in Florida, Kansas and NYC.] Define health disparities. 3. Consent forms [read through them with the group] TURN ON RECORDER 4. You have been invited here to talk about a particular health topic. Before we get started, let's talk about some general guidelines for how this kind of group works. Has anyone been in a focus group before? 10 a. When we start, I will be asking some questio ns to try to open up a discussion. Each person does not have to respond to every single question but we do need everyone to participate, to at least answer some questions about your opinions about things or how you see them. b. Let's respect what other pe ople add to the conversation. If you disagree with it or if you have had a different experience or have different information, you should feel free to say that respectfully. The idea of bringing a group together is that we have different opinions, we don' t have to all agree. c. Since we only have about an hour together, my job as facilitator is to help the discussion to focus on that topic. So if it seems that we are getting off track or are spending a long time on any particular question, I may ask the gro up to move on to another question. Please understand that that does not mean that whatever we were talking about is not important or that I don't think it's important - I just have to help guide the conversation to certain topics so we can cover everythin g in one hour. d. Because we are taping the conversation it and it will be transcribed (meaning someone will listen to the tape and type out what was said). So, please, try not to talk on top of each other. Otherwise it's really hard to understand the recor ding to make a report and the person listening and trying to type it will not be able to understand it clearly. 691 e. Lastly, keep in mind that when I am asking the questions that I will be asking, I am not asking you to talk about your personal experience or t o name anyone who has experienced one of these situations. We respect your privacy and the privacy of others so we do not ask you to do that. You can speak in generalities, like, \"I know someone who...\" or \"Someone in my family...\" to maintain privacy. f. At the same time, it is possible that some people may say something private about themselves. Let's please all respect that and leave that information here. For example if someone should say they have a particular health problem, let's not go and tell our f riends or family or neighbors \"so and so said...\" Let's keep it confidential. Agreed? 5. Okay, any questions before we get started? Feel free to stop me or stop the group if you have a question. 6. So let's go around the table. Can you tell me your first na me, how long you've lived in the Bronx, and then let's start with an easy question: [ICEBREAKER SUCH AS : what would you have rather had for a snack today, rather than (these breakfast bars?)] 7. TRANSITION TO LISTS OF HEALTH ISSUES Okay, I'm going to draw your attention to the list in front of you. 8. Looking at the list of health issues on your paper, which do you think are the 5 most important ones facing the people , of all ages, in your community? Circle the ones you see as the top 5. If there are import ant issues you don't see there, you can circle fewer than 5 and write in the ones you think should be added. Let me know if you have any questions about what any of these words mean. 9. Moving to the next page, looking at the same list, and again including a nything you have want to add to the list, mark those that you think are the 5 most important health problems facing the children in your community. 10. And now the third page. Looking at this list, and again including anything you want to add to the list, ma rk those that you think are the 5 most important health problems facing the teenagers in your community. 11. How well do you think mental health issues are being dealt with in your community? a) Probe: What kinds of challenges or problems have you seen? For e xample, as far as people trying to get mental health care? 12. We're now going to pass out a list of types of healthcare services [LIST WILL BE PROVIDED IN HANDOUTS AND IN CHART ON WALL]: 692 General medical care Nutritional/dietary guidance Mental health care Children's health care Maternity and infant care Sexual health/family planning Dental care Vision care Other specialty care, such as diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS, etc. Complementary/alternative medicine (such as acupuncture, herbs, chiropractic care, etc.) Programs to prevent illnesses like cancer, diabetes, asthma, etc., such as education, counseling and medical tests Looking at this list, and including anything that you have added, think for a moment about people you know who live in the Bronx who have nee ded one or more of these types of healthcare services during the past year and for some reason could not get care, either at all or couldn't get care in the Bronx. If there are important issues you don't see here, let us know. a) What was the reason they co uldn't get it? [Leave question open -ended, probe if necessary : It could be money, problems with insurance, location, hours, language or other barriers, or any other reason.] 13. Take a look again at the list of different types of healthcare services (and any thing that you added to the list). How do you feel about the amount of information that is available about how to find these services in the Bronx? Can you think of any situation among people you know where someone didn't know where to get a health service ? 14. (IN SPANISH -LANGUAGE GROUP, IF TIME ALLOWS:) How well do you think language translation and assistance services are working now, in healthcare facilities in your community? Can you give examples of situations where there is a problem? 15. Is there anythi ng we have not covered that you think is important concerning the health and well -being of community residents, whether infants, children, teenagers, adults, or seniors, or services needed by them? CLOSING 693 Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us today. Some of this information is sensitive; some if it is hard to talk about, so I really appreciate that you have put yourselves out there to help your neighbors in the Bronx. And now to finish up we are going to ask you to take this s urvey on your background. We do not need your name. At some point, the report on these groups will be made public. When that happens, probably several months from now, Bronx Health Link will send you a copy. If you like, you can put your name and mailin g address or email address on this paper. Signing up will also allow us to keep in touch with you about our future events, but it's totally voluntary. (Distribute sign -up page) In order to give you your gift we ask that you sign to confirm that you have r eceived it.

Guided by a mission that calls us to heal, to teach, to discover and to advance the health of the communities we serve, Montefiore's physicians, nurses, social workers, and staff work within and outside our hospital walls to address pressing community needs. Montefiore has applied an ongoing imperative to community service, seeking to maximize the impact of our community service as one of five strategic goals. With a focus on making a measurable difference in the health of our populations and communities, Montefiore is pursuing better coordination and allocation of resources on specific high prevalence, high impact problems affecting our community. Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer are pressing public health concerns, and as such, Montefiore has prioritized interventions that increase physical activity, improve nutrition and decrease tobacco use to stem the advancing tide of these diseases. Programs dedicated to these health targets appear at the beginning of the inventory. ABOUT THE INVENTORY The Community Service Inventory showcases a dynamic array of programs, both long standing and newly instituted, that seek to ameliorate health, social, economic and environmental stressors faced by our patients, their families, Montefiore associates, and the community at large. In total, the inventory profiles 84 programs that operate throughout Montefiore's 150 sites and the community at large. The inventory presents programs by health target. Outside support, in the form of grants and philanthropy, is critical to the continuation of community service programs but where Montefiore is cited as the funding source, programs are fully funded by Montefiore. In some cases, reimbursement is received for services rendered, yet these programs are included in the inventory because the target they address has been identified as critical to our community and would be considered outside the traditional scope of an academic medical center. In all cases, Montefiore supports programs whether by providing staff, space or an institutional framework within which to operate. When possible, quantitative and qualitative outcomes are provided to show impact on program participants and the community.2012 Community Service Inventory2012 Community Service Inventory NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND TOBACCO PREVENTION PROGRAMS4 Program name: Bardonia Health Day Description: As part of Bardonia Health Day, Montefiore associates present Heart Healthy Education to 5 through 12 year olds on topics including exercise and heathy eating Target population: School-aged children Health Target: Nutrition and Physical Activity Location: Community-based Outcomes: Montefiore has been invited back each year for the last 10 years, feedback from school organizers and teachers has been positive.

The program is offered in conjunction with a community after-school program that consists of nutrition classes, physical activity programming, parent groups, family nights and a six-week summer program. Target population: Youth aged 12-21 years with a BMI>95th percentile for sex and age Health Target: Obesity, Nutrition and Physical Activity Location: CHAM, Mosholu Montefiore Community Center Outcomes: In 2012, 95 participants enrolled in the program.

The proportion of participants exercising 3 or more days in the prior two week period increased from 48% at baseline to 62% at 9 months. The proportion of participants watching 2 or more hours of TV or computer games per day was unchanged at 88% at baseline and 9 Annual B'N Fit Walkathon; AstraZeneca Foundation Program name: Bronx-CATCH, Collective Action to Transform Community Health Description: Bronx-CATCH is a partnership between Montefiore, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Bronx Community Health Network, other community based organizations and agencies and local elected officials.
