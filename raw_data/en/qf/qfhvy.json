Please read my [disclosure page](https://gonewmommy.com/disclosure-policy/). Body wash is an essential part of our daily routine, but have you ever stopped to consider what ingredients are in your body wash? Many conventional body washes contain harmful chemicals like sulfates, parabens, and synthetic fragrances that can have negative effects on our health and the environment. But no need to worry, you have non-toxic options to choose from! There are natural body washes that are made with gentle ingredients and free from harmful chemicals. In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of using non-toxic body wash, what chemicals to avoid and recommend some natural, non toxic body wash products without harmful chemicals. Benefits of Using Non-Toxic Body Wash Non-toxic body wash is a safer and healthier option for our bodies and the environment. Natural ingredients used in non-toxic body wash products are gentler and less likely to cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. Additionally, many non-toxic body washes are biodegradable and free from harsh chemicals that can pollute our waterways and harm marine life. Using non-toxic body wash is also a great way to reduce our exposure to harmful chemicals that can disrupt our endocrine system and affect our overall health. Chemicals to Avoid in Body Wash There are several harmful chemicals commonly found in body wash that you should try to avoid: - Fragrances: Fragrances can be harmful because they often contain synthetic chemicals that can cause allergic reactions or irritations on the skin. Many of these chemicals have not been fully tested for their safety on human health and some have been linked to health issues such as hormone disruption, cancer, and reproductive problems. Additionally, fragrances are often listed as a single ingredient and fragrance ingredients do not need to be disclosed on the label. Therefore, it's difficult to know exactly what chemicals are being used to create the scent. For these reasons, it's often recommended to choose fragrance-free or naturally scented products, especially for those with sensitive skin or allergies. - Phthalates: These are used to make fragrances last longer in body wash. Phthalates are used as plasticizers in some body washes and may be labeled as \"fragrance\" on the ingredient list. They have been linked to birth defects, decreased fertility, and certain cancers. - Parabens: These are synthetic preservatives that are used to extend the shelf life of body wash. They are used in some body washes to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold. They can disrupt hormones and have been linked to breast cancer. - Sulfates: Sulfates are a type of surfactant, which means they are used to create foam and lather in products like body wash, shampoo, and toothpaste. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) are both commonly used as surfactants in personal care products, including body washes, because they are effective at removing dirt, oil, and other impurities from the skin. However, there is some concern about the potential health effects of sulfates, particularly when used in high concentrations or on sensitive skin. Sulfates can be harsh and drying, and may strip the skin of its natural oils. They can also be irritating to the skin and eyes, and some studies have suggested that they may be linked to other health issues, such as hormone disruption and cancer. - Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives: These preservatives, such as quaternium-15 and DMDM hydantoin, are used to prevent the growth of bacteria in some body washes. They can release formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, and may cause skin irritation and sensitivity. By avoiding these harmful chemicals, you can reduce your exposure to toxins and protect your health. Look for natural and organic body washes that are free from these ingredients, and always read the label before you buy.
