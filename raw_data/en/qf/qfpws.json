Chapter 1 discussesdemographic factors, including population trends and life expectancy. Chapter2 focuseS on children's health status, reporting on child mortality rates,abortion, birth rate, family planning, perinatal health problems, congenitalanomalies, accidents at or around the home, traffic accidents, chronicconditions and handicaps, asthma, diabetes mellitus, vision, hearing,developmental problems, mental deficiency, and mental health. Chapter 3presents information on lifestyle influences on children's health, includingbreastfeeding, dental health, leisure time, cigarette smoking, alcohol,drugs, and teenage sexuality. Chapter 4 discusses aspects of the Netherlands'health care system, including access to health care, organization, financing,obstetrical care, maternity home help, preventive child health care,preschool and school health care, vaccinations, general practitionerconsultation rates, specialist service use, and hospital admissions. Chapter5 focuses on social welfare and discusses pregnancy leave, breastfeeding atwork, parental leave, child benefit, day care for children, youth welfarework, and youth care. Chapter 6 discusses education, focusing on play groups,compulsory education, and schools for special education. Chapter 7 presentsinformation on children at risk, including preterm children, ethnicminorities, children of refugees, adopted children, child abuse, and schooldropouts. The report concludes by noting that children in the Netherlandsenjoy a better state of health than their predecessors a generation ago.However, more attention needs to be paid to problems associated with smoking,drinking, and drug abuse, living environment, accident prevention, lack ofexercise/sport, and mistaken nutritional habits.

A secondpublication of this kindwas published by the Ministry of Welfare,Health and Culture in 1981, the year the EUSUHM Congresswas organised in Amsterdam. Thisbooklet, entitled Youth Health Care in the Netherlands emphasi- zed the longitudinal approach in care for children:pre- and peri- natal care, Maternal and Child Health care (0-4 years) and school health care (4-19 years),an overview of the typical Dutch way of organising the preventive health care for children.I appreciate the initiative of the Child Health Department of the TNO Division Public Health and Prevention in preparingan up- date of child health dataon the occasion of the EUSUHM Congress in Leuven (Belgium). This congress is organised by the Dutch and Flemish Association of Youth Health. This publica- tion, produced with financial support from the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, is based on data from Statistics Netherlands, the Child Health Monitoring project (an annual health status project of TNO) and special studies. The first con- clusion from these data is that children now enjoya better state of health than their predecessors a generation ago. It will also be clear that more attention needs to be paid to problems associatedwith smoking, drinking and drug abuse, living environment, ac- cident prevention, lack ofexercise/sport and mistaken nutrition-al habits. New developmentsin recent decades in medical gene- tics, artificial reproduction (IVF, etc) and recent advances inneo- natology make itnecessary to monitor the health consequences in later stages of life carefully. PREFACE 7 A recent nationwide evaluation of the Youth Health Care systemshowed that preventive health care cannot be exposed to the ef-fect of a free market system. Standards of examination methods(protocols), as well as uniform data information and transfer,have to be developed into one coherent national system. Thissystem, based on a national policy and carried out in mutualcooperation on regional and national level, will improve the effi-cacy of our youth health care services.It is to be hoped that the EUSUHM congress will bring some newscientifically based arguments to realise our wishes for improve-ment.Since various countries have published booklets similar to thisDutch one, a sensible suggestion may be that the EuropeanUnion should coordinate these activities. Some standardisationwould enable the international comparison of the state of healthof our children. J. VerhoeffInspector General for Health Care. 8 CHAPTER 1: DEMOGRAPHY CHAPTER 1:DEMOGRAPHY Density of populationThe Netherlands isa kingdom in Europe, where the deltas of theRhine and the Meuseare located. It is bounded by the North Sea,by Germany and Belgium. Aquarter of the country (where about60% of the population lives) is below sea level. On January 1 1996, the 41,500 km2 of theNetherlands housed 15.5 million in-habitants, an average of 457 inhabitants per km2 (Figure 1), ma- king it one of the most densely populated countries in the world.The Netherlands is a wealthycountry. In 1993, the gross nationalproduct (GNP) per capitawas 20,950 US dollars. Worldwide,there are eleven countries with a higher GNP per capita.In 1995, 8.8% of Dutch GNPwas spent on health care. Europeancountries spend between 6.5% (Denmark) and 9.9% (France) of GNP on health care. In the United States, this figure was 14.5% in 1995. Population trendsThe population of the Netherlands increased by 50% in the last fifty years (Table 1). Duringthat period, the numbers ofyoung people remained stable, leading to a decrease in the proportion of children in the population. In 1950, the proportion ofyoung people (aged 0-19 years) accounted for 37.6% of the population in the Netherlands. On 01-01-1996, this percentage was 24.4. This 'ageing' of the population will continue. The expectation is that, in the year 2020, 0-19year-olds will account for 22% of theDutch Population density by province per km2, 1996.(Source: Statistics Netherlands). 10 CHAPTER 1: DEMOGRAPHY The decrease is partly causedby a drop in the birthrate (see Chapter 2: Birth). Anotherreason is increasing life expectancy,resulting in a higherpercentage of elderly people (in 1970, 10%of the populationas a whole was aged over 65 and the figure in 1996 was 13%).In 1995, therewere 190,500 live-births and 1,100 late foetaldeaths. The birth ratewas 12.3 per 1,000 inhabitants. In 1995,1,050 boys were bornper 1,000 girls.Most children aged 19 and under live in two-parent families. In 1992, approximately halfa million 0-19 year-olds (13%) were li- ving in single-parent Most single-parent families consist of divorcedwomen and their children.Most children live ina single-family house with a garden. Morethan three quarters of the children have their own bedroom. Only 18% share a bedroom with a brother or sister. CHAPTER 1: DEMOGRAPHY 11 Table 1: Number of young people (aged 0-19) in the the Surinam and Indonesia were parts of the Kingdom oftheNetherlands.Atpresent,theoverseasareasoftheNetherlands are limited to the Antilles. In the fifties, manyIndonesian families came to the Netherlands. The sixties saw thearrival of many Turkish and Moroccan men in the Netherlands,to be joined later by their wives and families. During the seven-ties, many inhabitants of Surinam and the Dutch Antilles cameto reside in the Netherlands. 12 CHAPTER 1: DEMOGRAPHY In 1996, 9.1% (1.4 million) of the population of the Netherlandswas born abroad and an additional 7.9% (1.2 million) had at least one foreign-bornparent. Most of these residents belong toan ethnic minority and they mainly live in the country's 4 major cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and The Hague). Most of the people in the Netherlands who were born abroadcome from Surinam, Turkey and Morocco. Table 2 shows the number of 0 - 14 year-olds born abroador with parents born abroad for these 3 groups. Table 2: Number of 0-14 year-olds in 1995 born abroad or with parents born abroad.

In 1996, 13.3% of the populationwas aged over 65. In 2020, approximate-ly 18% of the population isexpected to be agedover 65. 14 CHAPTER 1: DEMOGRAPHY 13 Table 3: Life expectancy at birth (years) in European countries forboys and girls in 1989 and 1994. CHAPTER 2:CHILDREN'SHEALTH STATUS Children in the Netherlandsare generally in good health. Sincethe end of the nineteenthcentury, child mortality rates have dropped rapidly. Because of the absence of diseases in most child-ren and becauseof the good nutritional statusinthe Netherlands, Dutch childrenare among the tallest in the world.The median height of 20 year-old girls in 1994 was 1.70metres. The figure for 20 year-old boys was 1.83 metres. The mean height of recent generations has been increasing by 1-2 centimetres per decade. The mean age of menarche in Dutch girls was 13.3years. Child mortality ratesPerinatal, infant, toddler, schoolchildren and adolescent mortali- ty has greatly decreased since the end of the nineteenthcentury (Figures 2 and 3). In European countries, the infant mortalityrate ranges from 4 to 9per 1,000 live-births. In 1994, theNetherlands wasone of the nine countries with the lowest rates (6 per 1,000) in Europe. CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS 15 Data about gestational age or birth weight for all births are notregistered at birth by Statistics Netherlands. The percentage ofpreterm or low birth weight children, as well as mortality due tothese factors, are only known from specially designed studies andsurveys. 9080 70 60 50 40 30 20 10Infant mortality 1(0-52 weeks)per 1,000(live) births First week Perinatal mortality 20 30Late fetal death 111111II I.111111.1192019301940195019601970198019902000 Figure 2: Perinatal mortality and infant mortality per 1,000(live) births in the Netherlands, 1920-1995. (Source: StatisticsNetherlands; graph TNO-PG).In 1991 the definition of late foetal death changed from 28weeks to24 weeks of gestation. 16CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S . . . CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS 17 Mortality rates are higher for boys than for girls. The main causeof death in infants is congenital anomalies and in older childrenaccidents (Figure 4, Table 4A and 4B).The causes of mortality in children have changed over the lastdecades. Mortality caused by infectious diseases decreased, whe-reas mortality caused by traffic accidents increased both relative-ly and absolutely. Infant mortality decreased rapidly in the lastdecade, mainly owing to a decrease in the incidence of cot death.The prone sleeping position was identified as a risk factor for cotdeath, and, since 1987, preventive health care workers advise pa-rents to use the supine sleeping position for infants. This nation-al campaign has resulted in a drop in cot deaths from 190 infantsin 1986 to 50 in 1995. 1-45-910-1415-191-45-910-1415-19suicide0 road traffic0 drowningother accidentscongenitial malformationsneoplasmsrespiratoryother diseases Figure 4: Causes of death in children by age and sex per 100,000in 1995.

Boys age in the Netherlands subject tocer- tain conditions. Abortion is financed by the Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (AWBZ). In 1995, the number of abortionswas 28,700. The Netherlands has the lowest abortion rate in the world. In 1994 the abortionrate was 6.0 per 1,000women in the fertile age range (15-44 years). Most abortions are performed in independent clinics. The low abortion rate is a sign of good com- pliance with contraception and of the standard of health educa- tion in the Netherlands (See Chapter 3: Teenage sexuality).

Abortion rates among these immigrantgroups are 4 (Moroccan) to 10 (Caribbean) times higher thanamong women of Dutch origin. BirthAt the end of the nineteenth century, the number of childrenborn annually in the Netherlands was 150,000. The number ofbirths remained stable in the early part of the twentieth century:approximately 180,000 children were born in 1930. During the 20CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS Second World War, the birthrate dropped, increasing again inthe fifties and sixties after the war was over. By then, 240,000 children were being born annually in the Netherlands, the \"baby boom\". In the seventies, the number of births decreased again to 171,200 in 1983.Subsequently, there was another increase to 199,700 in 1991. The number seems to be stable at present. It is expected that the birth rate will decrease to 179,000 in 2010.Of all Western countries, theNetherlands has the highest percen- tage of home births (31% in 1993). The high percentage of home births and the low perinatal mortality in the Netherlands is ex- ceptional from an international point of view. The Dutch obste- trical system is basedon the philosophy that reproduction, inclu-ding delivery, is a physiological process. Childbirth is regarded as a natural process which should occur spontaneously, without anaesthesia and with a minimum of operative procedures. For this reason, home birth is preferred for normal delivery. The first priority in prenatal care is the selection of high-risk cases (See Chapter 4, Obstetrical care).Almost all deliveriesare attended by trained health personnel.There is a decreasing trend in home deliveries (Figure 5) caused by the fact that, in recent decades, there has been an increase in short-stay hospital deliveries with assistance by midwives rather than gynaecologists. Afteruncomplicated births, women returnhome the same dayor after spending one night in hospital.All women can obtain home maternity care for a period of 8 days after delivery (See Chapter 4:Maternity home help).

In thelast twenty years,the percentage of deliveries byCaesarean section has tripled to 9.3% of deliveries in 1995(Figure 6). Compared to the USA (with a percentage of 21.2 in1994), the percentage of Caesarean sections in the Netherlands islow. 22CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS vacuumextractioncaesareansectionforcepsbreechdeliveryextraction197019751980[13 198519901995 Figure 6: Artificial deliveries, 1970-1995 (%).Figures for 1995 were only available for Caesarian section.(Source: Statistics Netherlands). Family planningOf all European countries,women in the Netherlands are amongthe oldest when they give birth (Table 5). The average maternal age at the birth of the first child increased from 24.3 years in 1970 to 28.6 years in 1995. The total fertility rate per woman de- creased from 2.6 in 1970 to 1.5 in 1995. The total fertility rate is the mean number of children per woman. This means that, onaverage, women in the Netherlands will have 1.5 children during their lives.

When time-to-pregnancy exceeds several months, general practi-tioners can refer patients to a gynaecologist who, after havingperformed diagnostic tests, may propose hormonal ovarian intra-uterine insemination insemination. CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS Between 1975 and 1995, theprevalence of multiple births incre-ased from about 1% to 1.7% of all births. During this period, the number of triplet birthsmore than doubled.This increase can partly be explained by the development ofnew infertility treatments. In the eighties, the number of pregnancies induced by artificialmeans such as hormonal ovarian stimula-tion, IUI or IVF increased in the Netherlands. In 1996, approxi- mately 1% of live-births occurred after IVF pregnancieswere multiple pregnancies. Artificially-induced pregnanciesare more likely to be multiple pregnanciesand, therefore, to result inpremature birth. In order to preventtriplet and higher-order IVFpregnancies, it has now been gene- rally accepted thatno more than 2 embryos should be transfer-red per treatment cycle unless they are of poor quality. However, the rate of triplet and higher-order pregnancies is still increasing e.g. due to the increase in ovarian stimulation without IVF. Another reason for the increased prevalence of multiple births may be the increased age at birth: in pregnancies where the mother is older, there isa greater chance of a multiple birth.Surinamese, Antillean, Turkish and Moroccan women differ from Dutch women not only in higher abortion rates, but also in fami- ly planning practice. Inrecent decades, however women bornabroad have slowly begunto adapt to the Dutchway of family planning. There is an increase in the age at birth of the first child and a decrease in the number of children per woman. However, the risk of preterm birth in the black population is highercom- pared to other groups. In 1993, the fertility characteristics of women born abroad still differed from those of Dutch women (Table 6). CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS 25 Table 6: Mean age of Dutch women and women born abroad atbirth of first child and total fertility rate, 1993. the last 25 years, the perinatal mortality rate has more thanhalved from 18.6 in 1970 to 8.9 per 1,000 births in 1995 (Figure2). Perinatal mortality is late foetal death (in 1991, the definitionchanged from28 to _>._ 24 weeks of pregnancy) and first-weekmortality combined. The change in certification rules from 28 to24 weeks of pregnancy in 1991 resulted in an increase in late foe-tal deaths of about 20% in 1992.Late foetal death rate in multiples is 2.5 times as high as in sing-letons. The perinatal and infant mortality rates for multiples are Ti 26CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS 4 times as high. Multiple pregnancies result more often in prema-ture births compared to singleton pregnancies. Since the begin-ning of the century, the incidence of multiple births with morethan 2 children has increased from 1.1 to 1.8 per 100 multiplebirths. These pregnancies almost all result in premature delivery.Approximately 7% of all children are born before 37 weeks of ge-station (preterm).In 1995, approximately 1,652 very preterm (5_ 32 weeks) childrenwere born, compared to 1,068 in 1983.The incidence of very preterm 32 weeks) or very low birthweight (5 1,500 grams) infants increased from 8.4 in 1983 to 9.6 per 1,000 live-births in 1993 (in absolute numbers, 1,423 and1,882 respectively).Three quarters of these children were born in a hospital with a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit because theirmothers were transferred to these hospitals before delivery.17.7% were delivered by Caesarean section.In 1995, 2.2 % of all newborn babies (approximately 4,370 child-ren) were admitted to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, comparedto 1.6% (approximately 3,059 children) in 1989. This increase isdue to an increase in the number of very preterm infants (5_ 32weeks), of multiple births and of children requiring respiratory support.The average stay in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was 12.2 days in 1995 (19.6 days if post-intensive care and high care are also taken into consideration). 0 The mean duration of hospital admissions has increased. This can be mostly attributed to the fact that the mortality rate ofvery preterm or very low birth weight infants is decreasing. Theannual number of these children 'coming home alive' almostdoubled in the last decade due to the decreasing mortality rate inthese children. The percentage of surviving children facing phy-sical,developmental or behavioural problems in laterlife CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS 27 decreased. However, the decreasing mortality rate led to anincrease in the total number of children with a chronic, physicaldisability or handicap (See Chapter 7: Preterm children). Congenital anomaliesIn 1974, a network of registers of congenital anomalies was esta-blished in European countries :the EUropean Registration OfCongenital Anomalies (EUROCAT). In the Netherlands, the regis-tration of congenital anomalies started in 1981 in the Northernpart of the country. During the period 1980-1992, the prevalencerates for congenital anomalies in European countries were regis-tered in 28 EUROCAT registries (Table 7).Table 7: European prevalence rates for neural tube defects, conge-nital heart disease, cleft palate and Down's per ofan annual number of approximately190,000 births, 1,340 are children with a congenital heart ano- maly, 255 are children witha neural tube defect and 215 are children with Down's syndrome. Accidents at home or around the homeEvery year, 10-20% of 1-11 year-olds have accidents for which medical assistance is required. Boys are more prone to accidents than girls. Three out of four accidents occur at home. Half of the accidents for which medical assistance is asked are caused by fal- ling.In 1993, hospital admission for an accident around or at home was necessary in 13,005 children 14 or under. Admissions were caused by falling (46%), poisoning (15%), penetration of the body by a foreign object (3%), suffocation (2%), drowning (1%) and burns (1%).75 children under theage of 15 died in 1993 as the result of anaccident at home or around the home, a mortality rate of 2.3 per 100,000. The mostcommon lethal accidents were drowning(47%), suffocation (25%), falling (8%), burns (7%) and poisoning(3%).

From that year onwards, adolescent mortalityrates decreased rapidly (Figure 3).In 1995, 69 children aged 1-14 died as a result of traffic acci-dents. In the Netherlands, most people own a bicycle. Separatecycle paths are common. Nevertheless, cyclists are frequently in-volved in traffic accidents. Children are particularly prone to cy-cling accidents, in part because their stage of physical develop-ment is inadequate to enable them to ride a bicycle safely.2,839 children aged 0-14 were admitted to hospital in 1990 asthe result of traffic accidents (46% of them were cycling at thetime of the accident) and 82 children aged 1-14 died in traffic ac- 3 30CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS cidents (39% of themwere cycling). In the Netherlands, the use of helmets when cycling isnot mandatory. The voluntary use of helmets is being encouraged. Chronic conditions and handicapsChild mortality rates have decreased, not only in the first half of this century, but also in recent decades. It is expected that pre- vention programmes can reduce child mortality even further. However, the percentage of children with chronic diseases is in- creasing as a result of improved care for these children.Not only better care and reduced mortality, but also the incre- asing number of multiple births and premature births are leading to an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases and handi- caps. This increase will produce, in turn, an increase in adults consulting the healthcare system and will, in future, lead to a higher prevalence of chronic disease at older ages. AsthmaTwenty per cent of children aged 4-17 have a physical handicap. Of these, 90% have pulmonary problems. In the Netherlands, thenumber of children with asthma increased. At the age of 4-6, 11% of children have asthma. A higher percentage of children ofDutch parents have asthma than children of Surinamese, Moroccan or Turkish parents. Twenty per cent of regular non-at- tendance at schools is caused by asthmatic complaints. CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS 31 Diabetes mellitusOne in 1,000 children have diabetes mellitus. The incidence ofdiabetesmellitusinchildrenisincreasing,asitisinScandinavian countries. The increase is highest in young child-ren and in girls. Between 1988 and 1994 in the Netherlands, theincidence of diabetes mellitus in 0-4 year old girls doubled, re-aching 12.5 per 100,000 in 1994. The incidence of diabetes melli-tus depends on both genetic and environmental factors. Thesharp rise in incidence can only be explained by changes in theenvironment because the genetic profile of the population chan-ges only slowly. This rise in diabetes mellitus, an illness withhardly any mortality in childhood in the Netherlands, will resultin an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases, especially atolder ages. Vision4 % of children aged 0-9 and 12% of adolescents aged 10-19 wearspectacles.Families with children with severe visual disabilities are offeredadvice and support at home by institutions for blind and visual-ly-impaired persons. When the children start participating in re-gular infant groups, ambulatory support is available for thepersonnel of these groups. Most parents decide to send theirchildren for regular education. Nowadays, children who attendschools for the visually disabled are less likely to live there. Forthe most part, school resources are geared towards the provisionof outpatient assistance. This includes ancillary resources, as wellas ambulatory care in the regular education setting (see Chapter6, schools for special education). 32CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS HearingAt the age of 9 months,a hearing test is offered by the pre-schoolhealth service (see Chapter 4, Preventive Child Health Care). Annually 7% of children fail the test. All of them are referred to general practitioners. Thecause of hearing loss in most childrenis otitis media with effusion. One child in 1,000 has a congenital hearing loss. Since the hearing test was introduced in 1965, the age at which hearing loss is detected has been reduced from 6 years to 1.5 years.If a child proves to be hard of hearing or deaf, the family is offered home help. For several years, parents and children receiveintensive assistance in learning to communicate. The younger the child, the easier it is toovercome communication problems.Deaf children attend special schools, until they are able to visit, with help, a regular school. Developmental problemsIn the Netherlands, thereare schools which provide special edu-cation for children with learning or behavioural problems and for children who are physically disabled. All independent rehabi- litation facilities (i.e. facilities which are not part of a hospital) have initiated programmes for giving early guidance to families with children who have motor disabilities. Through these pro- grammes, children can participate in infant groups which are lin- ked to multidisciplinary treatment, involving physiotherapy,oc- cupational therapy, speech therapy, doctors specialised in rehabi-litation, educationalists and social workers.Children in special education have a higher percentage of disabi- lities and handicaps than children attending ordinary primary schools (see Figure 7 and Chapter 6, Schools for special educa- tion). CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS 33 Disability = any restriction or lack (resulting from an im-pairment) of ability to perform an activity in the manneror within the range considered normal for a human being.Handicap = a disadvantage for a given individual resultingfrom an impairment or a disability, that limits or preventsthe fulfilment of a role that is normal (depending on age,sex, and social and cultural factors) for that individual.Source: WHO, 1980 60 50 40 30 20 10 StrabDrainsMedicine PhysicalWeightOrdinary schoolSpecial school Figure 7: Percentage of children with strabismus (Strab), eardrains (Drains), use of medication (Medicine), a physical handi-cap (Physical) and excess weight related to height (Weight).(Source: TNO-PG). 34CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS Mental deficiencyAt the end of 1991 1,876 children aged 0-14 and 5,798 aged 15- 24 were living in institutional care facilities for the mentally han- dicapped. Mental healthIn 1983, 19% of children aged 8-11 had moderate, and 7% had serious behavioural and emotional problems as measured using the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL). In 1993, 21% of 13-18 year-olds had psychiatric problems, mostly without problems in everyday life. In 1993, the CBCL, Youth Self-Report and Teacher'sReport Form were used. In these studies, diagnoses were postula- ted using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders (DSM-III-R). Girls had phobic complaints more often than boys, whereas boys had manic episodes, behaviouralproblems, attention deficit disorders and tic disorders more often than girls.In the Netherlands, many organisations offer parents pedagogic support, the child preventive health care service being one example. One third of parents with children aged 0-4 have questions on upbringing. Nowadays parents ask questions about the upbringing of their children. It is probable that one of the causes of this uncertainty is the drop in the number of children in complete families and diminishing social networks around fa- milies.In the nineties, a large number of organisations providing peda- gogic support have been joining forces in Youth Care Bureaus(Bureaus Jeugdzorg). These bureaus provide a one window service for all questions. Children and their parents talk to an intake as- CHAPTER 2: CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS 35 sistant who decides which type of assistance is most suitable inthis situation. The Youth Care Bureaus try to prevent parentsfrom shopping around before finding the right help for them(see Chapter 5, Youth Welfare Work). 36 CHAPTER 3: LIFESTYLE CHAPTER 3: LIFESTYLE BreastfeedingIn 1975, 45% of newbornswere being breast-fed at the age of 8days. In 1991, this figurewas 60%.In 1991, 26% of children aged 3 months were exclusively breast- fed. Of all European countries, the Netherlands has the lowest percentage of women breast-feeding their children at the age of 3 months, although breast-feeding is being encouraged by the pre- school health care service. This percentage has been declining since the seventies, reachinga low of 11% in 1975. An increasewas seen in the eighties, reaching approximately 31% in 1985 (Figure 8). Women witha higher level of education, as well as Turkish women, aremore likely to breastfeed.There are as yet no data from 1992 onwards available for exclusi- ve breastfeeding at 3 months.Since 1919, employedwomen are entitled by law to spend up to a quarter of their working hours breastfeeding their baby. In spite of this law, mostwomen stop breastfeeding when they return to work.Breast milk from Dutch mothers contains a relatively highcon- centration of dioxins and PCBs. Nonetheless the beneficial ef- fects of breast-feeding have been shown to be greater than the negative effects. Dutch breast-fed children show better neurologi- cal development at theage of 18 months than Dutch bottle-fedchildren. Furthermore, breast-fed children have a lower prevalen- ce of milk allergy and infections.

The percentages forSurinamese, Moroccan and Turkish children were lower than thepercentage for Dutch children. In the Netherlands in the seven-ties, the prevalence of caries in children aged 6 and 12 years was99% for both ages. This percentage decreased in the eighties, andis stabilizing in the nineties. In 1993, the prevalence of caries inthe Netherlands was 45% in 6 year-olds and 40% in 12 year-olds.In Turkish and Moroccan children, caries is seen in 75%.The decrease in caries prevalence is mainly due to the use of fluo-ride. Most tooth paste in the Netherlands contains fluoride.Tooth paste for children under 4 contains less fluoride thantoothpaste for older children and adults.

Leisure timeSports (including cycling)are one of the most popular ways ofspending leisure timeamong children under the age of 15. In1993, 56% of boys (aged 10-14) spent more than 8 hours a week on sports. The percentage for girls in the same age group was 37%.Figure 9 shows the percentage of school children who watch TV more than 2 hours a day in 1992/1993.In 1993, 52% of 4-11 year-olds subscribed to a youth magazine and 80% were members ofa library. 35 30 25 20 15 10 504-67-910-12over 12 Figure 9: Watching TV formore than 2 hours a day (%) in schoolchildren, by age, 1992/1993.

The increasein smoking among adolescents could, in the future, lead to an in-crease in smoking parents and thus to an increase in passive smo- king in children. Passive smoking in infancy is associated with a variety of diseases, respiratory illness being an example. Long- term passive smoking can induce a predisposition to asthmatic complaints. Due to a reduction of other major risk factors for cot death, 60% of sudden infant deaths are now associated with pas- sive smoking. Of newborn children, 42% were exposed to tobac-4 2 CHAPTER 3: LIFESTYLE 41 co smoke in the living room, 8% were exposed in the car and 4%during feeding in 1996. AlcoholRegular alcohol drinking (defined as drinking beer, wine or otheralcoholic drinks at intervals between daily and once a week) wasreported in 1995 in 47% per cent of boys aged 11-19 and 36% ofgirls aged 11-19. The percentage of adolescents drinking regularlyincreased by 5% in the last 5 years, more in girls than in boys.In adolescents there is an increasing morbidity of problems rela-ted to alcohol and drug use. DrugsIn the Netherlands, there are approximately 27,000 heroin ad-dicts. The mean age of the heroin addicts is increasing (feweryounger addicts) and is now over 30. Most of them have addic-tion histories of 10-15 years. In 1994, there were 37 deaths in theNetherlands as a result of an overdose of hard drugs.To prevent the use of hard drugs, the Netherlands has, since theeighties, tolerated sales of marihuana (a soft drug) in 'coffeeshops'. These coffee shops are bars where marihuana is sold at aseparate counter from the counter where drinks are sold. The in-troduction of coffee shops was intended to separate the softdrugs world from the hard drugs world.In 1995, the use of marihuana at any time was reported in 17%of adolescents aged 11-18 and half of those adolescents (9%) con-tinued to use the drug. Three per cent of adolescents had used ec- 42 CHAPTER 3: LIFESTYLE stasy (XTC) at some time and 2% of the adolescents was still using ecstasy on a regular basis (once a day to once a week). Teenage sexualityIn the Netherlands in 1995, 40% of the 16-17 year-olds and 50% of the 18 year-olds (boysas well as girls) had engaged at sometime in sexual intercourse. The percentage of girls aged 16-19 using the pill increased from 26.7 in 1985 to 43.8 in 1995. During first sexual intercourse, 70% use a condom, 37% use the pill (with or withouta condom), and 15% take no preventivemeasures. With increasing age, condom use diminishes in favour of oral contraception, thereby raising the risk of sexually-trans- mitted disease. Thereare national information campaigns rela-ting to adolescents andsex. The pill is advised for contraceptionand condoms are recommended for the prevention of sexually- transmitted diseases.In the Netherlands, sexually-transmitted diseases are annually diagnosed in approximately 10 persons per general practitioner (with a caseload of 2,000 people on average). Youngsters aged 19 or less constitute 8.5% of all patients with a sexually-transmitted disease, 25% are young adults aged 20-24.In 1995, nine 15-19 year-olds and thirty-two 20-24 year olds with syphilis were reported to the Health Inspector. The figures for go- norrhoea were 71 and 281 respectively.The number of teenage pregnancies in the Netherlands isvery low (Table 9). In 1994, 1.6% of all births in the Netherlands oc- curred in mothers under 20year of age, as compared to 12.9 % inthe USA in 1991.

In 1995, 0.4%of all abortions performed in the Netherlands involved girls agedless than 15 and 12.4% involved adolescents aged between 15and 19.In 1992, 4.2 abortions were performed per 1,000 girls aged 15-19and 43.3 abortion were performed per 100 pregnancies in girlsaged 15-19. This abortion rate has been attributed mainly to thegeneral openness regarding questions of sexuality and to theample availability of, and easy accessibility to, contraceptive ser-vices in the Netherlands. 44 CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CHAPTER 4: HEALTHCARESYSTEM Access to health careIn the Netherlands,access to health care is universal. In 1995,63% of all inhabitants in the Netherlands (9.7 million) had com- pulsory health insurance, 36% (5.5 million) had private health insurance and 1.4% (200,000) were not insured. Uninsured peop- le also generally receive preventive health care, and usually ge- neral practitioner and specialist services as well. OrganisationIn 1995, the Netherlands had 7,000 general practitioners and 820 registered paediatricians. There are 115 general hospitals and 8academic hospitals. Almost all inhabitants live within a short dis- tance from a hospital.Curative health care for children is provided at the request of children or parents by general practitioners (primary care) and by specialists (secondary care). Specialist services can only be obtai- ned after referral bya general practitioner. Most hospitals andspecialised health care facilities are owned and managed by inde-pendent non-commercial organisations. Most general practitio-ners (GPs) and dentists are in private practice. GPs usually have patients with private insurance and patients insured under the compulsory scheme. GPsare the gatekeepers for hospital andspecialised health care. Preventive health care for children is provided unasked to all children living in the Netherlands. It is provided by maternity assistants (at home) and by nurses and46 CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 45 doctors of the preventive child health services and not by paedia-tricians. Preventive health care services are divided into pre-school (Mother and Child Health Care (MCH)) and school healthcare. FinancingThe health care system in the Netherlands is mainly financedfrom 3 different sources: compulsory health insurance, privatehealth insurance and the Exceptional Medical Expenses Act(AWBZ). Every Dutch citizen with an annual income of less than60,000 guilders (approximately 30,000 US dollars) is automatical-ly insured under the compulsory health insurance scheme formedical, pharmaceutical and dental assistance. Hospital admis-sion is also covered with a maximum stay of one year. The requi-red premiums and contributions are based on income. Peoplewith an income in excess of 60,000 guilders have to take out pri-vate health insurance.The AWBZ covers every inhabitant of the Netherlands. The fun-ding is financed by a compulsory premium, levied together withthe income tax. Under the AWBZ all inhabitants are covered forlong-term treatment and nursing in hospitals after one year,comprehensive care for the physically and mentally handicap-ped, nursing homes, etc. This Act also covers home nursing careand the preventive health care for children up to 4 years of age(MCH).In 1994, of the annual health care budget, 32% was spent onhospital care, 9% on the handicapped, 7% on mental health careand 4% on general practice. Of the total annual health care bud-get, 5% is spent on preventive health care (all activities). 46 CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM In 1995, 8.8% of Dutch GNP was spent on health care. About 10% is paid out-of-pocket bypatients, another 10% is paid by government from funds raised through taxation, and 80% is paid from insurance premiums (65% from compulsory health insuran- ce and 15% from private insurance). Obstetrical careDutch prenatal healthcare (obstetrical care) is financed by com- pulsory and private health insurance. Prenatal care is provided by specialists or generalpractitioners (53%), by independentmidwives (46%) or by both physicians and midwives (1%). A clear division of tasks exists between primary and secondary obstetrical care providers, based on the distinction between nor- mal and abnormal. The independent midwife and the general practitioner in primarycare are responsible for the provision ofcare in a healthy pregnancy and concentrate on prevention and early detection of pathology. In principle, pregnancy, delivery and confinementare considered to be physiological events. If,however, risks are identified during pregnancy, delivery or confi- nement, the midwife or the general practitioner decides whether referral of the patient to secondary care is desirable or necessary. Most women have a choice between home or hospital delivery, but women at risk requirecare from an obstetrician in fully-equipped hospital departments.Prenatal care consists ofa monthly physical check-up, includingweight and bloodpressure measurements and urine examina-tion. Blood is screened for syphilis, hepatitis B and rhesus antibo- dies. Ultrasound examinations are carried out only on indication. Pregnant women over 35years of age are offered prenatal chro-mosome analysis. There is currently discussion about `trip-le test' screening for Down's Syndrome. CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Maternity home help47 Postnatal care is provided by maternity assistants in the home.Following a birth, 77% of families ask for maternity care during 8days. This consists of care for the mother and child, support withbreastfeeding and of advice for both parents in taking care of thenewborn infant. In addition, the maternity assistant can takeover the usual household tasks during the postnatal period andtakes care of other children, if present. Preventive child health careThe government takes considerable interest in preventive childhealth care. The preventive child health care service offer preven-tion programmes for children from birth up to the age of 18years. In addition to the prevention of health problems, atten-tion is also paid to pedagogic and psychosocial problems and toeducational problems.Preventive health care for children is divided in 3 parts: perinatalhealth care (maternity home help), pre-school health care andschool health care. The organisations for preventive health careare separate from the curative health care services.Preventive child health care (including vaccinations) is offeredfor 0-4 year olds by doctors and nurses in the home care (=thuis-zorg) organisations. Until the early nineties, nurses in the homecare organisations worked in both pre-school child health careand in home care for chronically-ill patients. In the early nine-ties, the home care organisations divided these two tasks. Thereare now specially-trained nurses working in preventive childhealth care and specially-trained nurses working in home care(nursing). 48CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Preventive child healthcare for 4-18 year-olds is provided by theMunicipal Health Services (school health care). Almost all school health services provide individual examinations by the school doctor or nurse. Specific action is taken in schools with respect to health, health risks and (preventive) health education. This `school health policy' isa group approach.In 1991, the Child HealthMonitoring System (CHMS)was deve- loped to establishan understanding of the health status of young people. The aimwas to assist national and local governments with the formulation of health policy and to evaluate health care. The CHMS is an ongoing system, embedded in the system of preventive healthassessments by doctors andnurses working in the youth health services.TNO Prevention and Health serves as the central institute for the coordination of data collection and for data analysis andpublication. Approximatelyone third of all municipalor regional public health services across the Netherlands participate. Together, they assess annually approxi- mately five thousand schoolchildren and seven thousand 0-4 year-olds. Some aspects of health status are assessed everyyear in each child. The assessmentof other aspects varies fromyear to year in order to obtain more in-depth information.There are approximately 2,400 physicians working (part-time) in pre-school healthcare. 1,500 of them are general practitioner as well. The remaining 900are more or less specialised in child care. Approximately 800 physicians are employed in school health care. Most of them are registered preventive medicine doctors specialised in childcare. When there is a sign of problems withphysical health or development, the child healthcare physician can refer children to the general practitioner. In the pre-school period, 21.5% of childrenare referred to general practitioners atleast once. Of school children, 15% receive treatment from ge- neral practitioners, specialists or physiotherapists. Another 5% PWA0 CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 49 are referred to general practitioners by school doctors.More schoolchildren are referred in large cities than in ruralareas.Screenings, preventive health examinations, vaccinations andhealth education and promotion (Table 10) are all offered by thechild preventive health care service. (Home care organisationsand municipal Health Services).Observations by workers in the pre-school health care system arerecorded in a file. When a child reaches the age of four, the pa-rents are asked for written permission to send the file to theschool health care authorities. Until 1997, the school health careservice kept the pre-school health care record separate. In 1997,integrated records were introduced which combine the findingsof the pre-school and the school health care service. Pre-school health carePre-school health care is provided by the Mother and ChildHealth Care, a division of the home care organisations, (formerlythe 'Kruisverenigingen'). These organisations are private non-commercial foundations. In the pre-school period, 97% of in-fants and 80% of four year-olds visit a child health clinic regular-ly where they are seen by both nurses and doctors.Most MCH organisations also provide pedagogic support, dietaryadvice and physical training for pregnant women.The pre-school health care system provides screening for all 0-4year olds in the Netherlands hip dysplasia, strabismus andhearing the child health clinic, the parents are advi-sed about nutrition (including vitamins A, D, K and fluoride), 50CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Table 10: Preventive healthcare items, the type of activity and the age of first assessment. week CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 51 Health problem Activity .Age of firstattentionPsychomotor development examination4 weeksVisual drugs information10-12yearsSexuality information10-12years including best sleeping position for the baby, and safetyin and around the home. Parents are provided with answers totheir questions. Growth, psychomotor development and the de-velopment of speech and communication is observed using agrowth chart and a checklist, the Van Wiechen test.The nurse from Mother and Child Health Care visits the homeon day 5-7 for PKU/CHT screening and returns a few days later,after the maternity assistant has left the family. All parents are 52 CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM given a 'Growth Book'. This book (which is available in Dutch, English, Arabic, Turkish, Vietnamese and Chinese) contains in- formation about the normal development of children, caring for a young child, healthy nutrition, dental care and vaccinations. The nurse makes an appointment for the parents and the child at the child health clinic. During the pre-school period, parents and children may attend the child health clinic about 10-14 times. On half of these occasions, they see a nurse and on the other oc- casions they see a doctor. The vaccination programme is started at the child health clinic at the age of 3 months. School health carePreventive child health care for schoolchildren is provided by the Municipal Health Services for children between the ages of 4 and 18.Almost all school health services have 3 individual examina- tions by the school doctoror nurse for all children betweenthe ages of 4 and 14. The children are tested for hearing and vision and they also receivea general physical examination.Specific action is taken at the schools in relation to health, he- alth risks and (preventive) health education. This 'school he- alth policy' is a group approach for all children. Health educa- tion is provided in special projects which include lessons about lifestyle. Attention is payed to the hazards of smoking, drinking alcohol and unsafe sex. CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM School health policy53 The school health care system is concentrating increasingly onchildren at risk.These children are approached individually or in groups.Children at risk can be identified by questionnaires on emo-tional well-being.Children at risk are also approached as a group. Group appro-aches occur in schools for special education because childrenattending schools for special education have more health pro-blems compared to children at ordinary schools.90-95% of schoolchildren are seen individually. All the childrenpresent at school will attend the lessons on health education. VaccinationIn 1953, the Netherlands started a National ImmunisationProgramme (Figure 12). The vaccinations in children under 4 aregiven at the child health clinics by doctors and nurses. The vacci-nation at the age of 9 is given by doctors and nurses of theMunicipal Health Services. All vaccinations included in the na-tional programme are free of 54CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM The costs of vaccine production and distribution, as well as of the administration and the time that preventive health workers spend on vaccination, are financed by the Exceptional MedicalExpenses Act (AWBZ). The quality of all vaccines used in the Netherlands is approved by the National Inspectorate of HealthCare. All children may be vaccinated free of charge at the age of3, 4, 5 and 11 months (DTP-Polio and Hib), 14 months (MMR), 4years (DT-Polio) and 9 years (DT-Polio and MMR). The DT-Polioand MMR vaccines are given simultaneously. The Netherlandsuses the Salk polio vaccine (IPV). It is given intramuscularly as a cocktail together with vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus and per-tussis (DTP-Polio). The Netherlands still uses a whole-cell pertus- sis vaccine. In 1987, the combined live vaccines for measles,mumps and rubella were introduced. In 1994, Hib vaccination(Haemophilus influenzae type b) was added to the programme. Itis given simultaneously with the DTP-Polio vaccine. Figure 12: Vaccination schedule in the 1) for children of HBsAg positive mothers2) for children of parents from countries with a high tuberculosis prevalence 56CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM There is no legal obligationor requirement to be immunised.Nevertheless, since the start of the immunisation programme inthe Netherlands, coverage has been high (Table 11) and the inci-dence of preventable diseases are low. Despite this high coverage,low immunisation rates are still found among certain groups, in- cluding members of some Protestant denominations that rejectimmunisation on religious grounds. A small group of anthropos-ophically-oriented people refuse immunisation, especially with the MMR vaccine. These children have a relative high risk ofcontracting these diseases since they live together. The poliomye- litis outbreak of 72 patients in 1992/1993 was restricted to thegroups that reject immunisation on religious grounds, living to-gether in specific regions (pockets).Apart from these groups, children with foreign-born parents form a fragmented group which also has a low immunisationrate because of missed opportunities. These children benefit from herd immunity as they live scattered among the population as a whole. CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 57 Table 11: Immunisation coverage on 01-01-1996 in the cohorts1970 to SYSTEM Administration of the vaccinations.The doctors of the Provincial Vaccination Authority (PVA) are responsibleforthe implementationoftheImmunisation Programme. The PVA maintains a computerised database of im- munisation records for each child in the province. Every child is included in this system from birth until the age of 13. Each day, the PVA receives data from municipal records relating to births, changes of address and deaths. During the child's second month, the PVA sends the parentsa set of records together with an expla-nation of the vaccinations. This text is written in Dutch, English, Arabic and Turkish. The doctor or nurse who gives the vaccina-tion sends the cards back to the PVA. If the child does not receivethe appropriate vaccinations, the PVA sends the parents a remin- der. This registration system makes it possible to check which vaccinations a child has had, even when the file is missing. Additional vaccinationsIn addition to the recommended schedule for DTP-Polio, Hib and MMR vaccination, the Health Council of the Netherlands recom- mends additional vaccinations for certain high-risk groups.1. Children aged 6-14 months who are travelling to a country with a high prevalence of measles can receive an early MMR vaccination at the child health clinic. This vaccination is free of charge,like the other vaccinations in the National Immunisation Programme. At the age of 14 months (but at least 4 weeks after the MMR vaccination), the child receives another MMR vaccination.2. Children of foreign-bornparents who are going to countrieswith a high prevalence of tuberculosis can receive the BacillusCalmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG), preferably at the age of 660 CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 59 months, but it can be given from birth, if necessary. TheRegional Public Health Authorities provide this vaccinationfree of charge.3. In 1989, a new programme was initiated for the children ofwomen who screen positively for hepatitis B in pregnancy(0.5% of pregnant women). The children receive immunoglo-bulin immediately after delivery and a hepatitis B vaccinationat the ages of 3, 4, 5, and 11 months. Vaccination takes placeat the child health clinic, using the same schedule as DTP-Polio-Hib vaccination. General practitioner consultation ratesAlmost all children (95%) have been seen by a general practitio-ner before the age of 2. In the Netherlands in 1994/1995, 69.4%of 0-14 year-olds had been seen by a general practitioner, themost frequent causes being skin diseases, leg or foot complaintsand common cold. Sixteen per cent of the children reported pre-scribed medicine use in the last 2 weeks and 21.9% used non-pre-scribed medicines in the 2 weeks prior to the interview.Most children aged between 0-4 who had been seen by a generalpractitioner had an upper airway infection or an ear infection.Children aged 5-14 were referred by the general practitioner tospecialists because of visual defects, ear infections, genital ormenstruation problems or postural anomalies. In adolescents(aged 15-24) there has been an increase in recent decades in theprevalence of anorexia nervosa, bulimia, sexually-transmitteddiseases, violent injuries and in problems related to alcohol anddrugs use. 60 Specialist service useCHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM In 1989, 30% of children aged 0-2 had been examined by paedia- tricians and were treated by a physiotherapist and 4% consulted practitioners of alternative medicine. Specialists were most often consulted for ear complaints, eye complaints, skin diseases and leg or foot complaints. Hospital admissionsIn the last decade,average hospital admissions decreased from 21days in 1974 to 8 days in 1996 (this figure relates to all hospital admissions- including adult admissions- in the Netherlands). The number of children being hospitalised is also decreasing (Table 12). There isa clear shift from inpatient treatment to day care or outpatient treatment. There has been an increase in day care admissions. In 1995, four per cent of the children aged 19 and under had been admitted to hospital. Most child admissionsto hospital are due to pulmonary infections and (traffic) acci- dents. CHAPTER 4: HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 61 Table 12: Hospital admissions of children aged 1-14 and meanstay In some hospitals, one of the parents is allowed to sleep next tothe young child during hospitalisation. In most hospitals, pa-rents can visit their children without restriction. Older childrencan receive help with their school work. G 62 CHAPTER 5: SOCIAL WELFARE CHAPTER 5: SOCIALWELFARE Pregnancy leaveEmployed pregnantwomen are entitled to pregnancy leave of 16weeks on full pay. Womenare allowed to stop working 4-6 weeksbefore the delivery is expected. This means that when the baby is 10-12 weeks old, mostwomen in the Netherlands have to go back to work. Breastfeeding at workIn the Netherlands,women are legally allowed to spend 2 hoursof each 8-hour working daybreastfeeding. The time spent on breastfeeding is paid for by the employer. However, in practice, the implementation of thisact is poor. Parental leaveThe governmentencourages parents to combine paid work withtaking care of a family. In 1991, the Parental Leave Actwas ac- cepted. This gives parents (both women and men) the right to take leave in order tocare for their children.In most European countries,parents can take parental leave. Insome countries, the leave is unpaid (Greece, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands) butparents in Austria, Denmark, Finland,France, Germany, Italy and Sweden get a share of their salary du- ring their parental leave.In most European countries, parental leave can be taken only CHAPTER 5: SOCIAL WELFARE 63 until the child is 4 years of age. In Sweden, parents can take pa-rental leave before their child reaches the age of 8 and the limitis 9 years of age in Denmark.Until 1997, the minimum working time during parental leavewas 20 hours a week. Parental leave had to be taken before thechild reached the age of 4.In 1997, the arrangements for parental leave in the Netherlandswere extended to allow parents to work for 50% of the workingweek during 6 months or not to work at all during 3 months.Parents can take parental leave until the child is 8 years of age. Child benefitAll parents with children aged 18 or less are entitled to child be-nefit for the costs of the children. This benefit is about 1,000Dutch guilders annually for each child. Day care for childrenIn the fifties, almost all mothers stayed at home to raise theirchildren. In recent decades, emancipation has led to a higherpercentage of girls in higher education. In 1995, half of the stu-dents in higher professional education (48%) were female, aswere a third of the students at Dutch universities (33%). Aftergraduating, most women work for a few years before havingchildren. It has become common for parents to combine child-ren with work.In 1992, 53% of women with one child under the age of 4 wor-ked. Fewer women with more children (the youngest aged underfour) have a job (31%). Most mothers in employment work part- 64 time (67%).CHAPTER 5: SOCIAL WELFARE During working hours, children can stay in day nurseries or host families (professional daycare for children). There is a scarcity ofprofessional daycare facilities because thereare only a few em- ployers with access to daynurseries. A lot of workingparents the- refore bring their childrento their family, neighboursor to grandparents. Thereare also parents who hire a home help or an au pair.In 1994, professional daycare (day nurseries and host families)had capacity for 109,000children. Of the childrenin profession- al day care, 70%are in a privately-run daynursery, and 5% were in commercial day nurseries. 11% were with host families and 14% of the childrenwent to day centres after school hours.Now that the number of day nurseries for children under four is increasing, day care for school children (after school hours) is particularly in demand. Thegovernment is paying attention to this demand from workingparents. Youth welfare workThe policy of thegovernment is to promote and create opportu- nities for children by stimulating social commitment to children, creating a strong social position for children and creating possibi- lities for social participation.In the last decade, the localauthori- ties in the Netherlands haveclaimed a more active rolein sha- ping the welfare ofyoung people. They want to create more co- herence in the field and they are therefore encouraging institu-tions for youth welfare workto contribute to the solution of complex problems involvingyoung people. Many institutions are approaching target groups on a project basis. This has led to66 CHAPTER 5: SOCIAL WELFARE 65 the formation of locally integrated networks, in which represen-tatives of day care centres for children, social work, primaryschools and the preventive child health care services participate.In 1994-1995, there were 178 local networks. The members ofthe networks meet about 8 times a year. During the meetings,local problems or problems relating to individual children arediscussed. The most frequently-discussed topics in the localnetworks are problems with emotional development, signs ofchild abuse, pedagogic problems and signs of mental retardation. Youth care'Youth Care' (Jeugdzorg) in the Netherlands consists of threekinds of care:Mental health care for children and adolescents (especially am-bulatory careasprovided by the Regional InstitutesforAmbulatory Mental Health Care, the RIAGG), financed by theMinistry of HealthYouth Protection (Jeugdbescherming), financed by the Ministryof Justice, which deals with \"forced aid\" (by Child WelfareCouncil) andYouth Welfare Work (Jeugdhulpverlening), also financed by theMinistry of Health, which supports children and adolescentswith mainly social and adaptive problems.Since many children and adolescents have problems in morethan one of these areas, and schools and preventive child healthcare are often involved as well, the current efforts of professio-nals, care providers and authorities are aimed at establishing asystem of integrated care in these respects. 67 66 CHAPTER 6: EDUCATION CHAPTER 6: EDUCATION PlaygroupsFrom the seventies, playgroups (for children from 2 to 5years- old) were set up. Songsare sung and the children draw and paint.There is 1 skilled 'teacher' for every 15 children plus a parent. There are playgroups where the teachers have meetings with re- presentatives from the pre-school preventive health care services. When 'teachers' in playgroups are worried about the develop- ment of a child, they can consult the nurse or the physician of the child health clinic. There are a lot of playgroups involved inlocally integrated networks (See Chapter 5: Youth welfare work). In playgroups, as in compulsory schools, there are classes. Most children attend the toddlergroup for 2 mornings or 2 afternoons a week.In 1994, therewere 4,000 playgroups. Admission is now open to children aged between 2 to 4. After the fourth birthday children go to a primary school, although education is only compulsory from 5 years onwards.Playgroups are not compulsory. The number of children whoat- tend a playgroup is stillincreasing: from 174,000 children in 1990 to 200,000 children in 1994.Parents have to pay for theplaygroups. The fee is dependent on their income. Compulsory educationAll children living in theNetherlands are allowed to start schoolfrom their fourth birthday onwards. At the age of five, education CHAPTER 6: EDUCATION 67 becomes compulsory. For the first eight years of their education,children attend a primary school. At the age of twelve, they goon to a secondary school which they attend for between four andsix years (Figure 13). After the age of sixteen it is compulsory forthem to attend school for at least two days a week. At the end ofthe school year in which the adolescent has his seventeenthbirthday, school is no longer compulsory. Education is importantin the Netherlands since qualifications are required for almostevery kind of work. 1003280 1560440 1 320 1 200-45-910-1415-19 years1= primary school2= junior general secondary education3= junior secondary vocational education4= senior general secondary education5= senior secondary vocational education6= higher professional education7= university education Figure 13: Participation in education in 1995/1996 (%). (Source:Statistics Netherlands).6 68 CHAPTER 6: EDUCATION The governmentpays the costs for almost all primary schools: the buildings, the teachers'salaries and the textbooks and exerci- se books. The law also lays down how many hours a week child- ren have to attend school and which learning objectives have to be met. Many schoolsare run by the local authorities (publicschools). There are also schools which have been setup by peop- le with e.g. particular religious philosophies or by parents who think that children should betaught in a differentway (private- ly-run schools). These schools receive as much moneyas the pu- blic schools, provided theyfulfil the conditionsset by the government. Schools for special educationWhen a child has difficulties with school work or whena child has physical or developmental problems, the primary schools will give the child remedialteaching in readingor writing. The school can also ask for help from psychologists from a regional educational centre. Whena child needs help which cannot beprovided at an ordinary primary school, the childcan attend a special school. The classesat special schools are smaller than in ordinary primary schools and special learning aidsare used. There are special schools forchildren with a (partial) hearing loss, for children with visualimpairments or physical disabilitiesand for children with speechdisorders, but most childrenattend special schools for learningor behavioural difficulties.The proportion of childrenat special schools has increased sharp- ly in the last decade. In 1987, 2.6% of 4-12 year-oldswas in spe- cial education. In 1994, thepercentage was 4.2. Table 13 showsthe percentage of childrenattending special schools, broken down according toage and gender. To stop the increase in child-ren attending special schools, the government initiated a plan in CHAPTER 6: EDUCATION 69 1996 with the aim of keeping the children who would have at-tended special schools in the past to remain at ordinary primaryschools in the future. These children will receive extra help inprimary schools which was not available in those schools prior to1996. The extra help can be provided by teachers employed bythe special schools. 70 CHAPTER 6: EDUCATION Table 13: Percentage of children attending regular and special schools by age and gender, 1995/1996.(Source:Statistics Netherlands). 7: CHILDREN ATRISK Use of the health care systemChildren who consult general practitioners and specialists morefrequently are: -Children with physical or mental development disorders.They use the health care system 3 times more often thanchildren with normal development.Children from lower social classes and children living in ci-ties.Children who attend day nurseries have more health pro-blems than other young children. They have twice as manyrespiratory infections and ear infections as children who donot attend day nurseries. A higher percentage also have eardrains. They consult general practitioners twice as often anduse medication 3 times as often as other young children. Health and socio-economic statusResearch based on indicators such as perinatal and child mortali-ty, morbidity data, well-being and height shows that children inthe Netherlands are generally healthy.However,socio-economic healthdifferences dostillexist.Examples are lower perinatal and child mortality in higher SESgroups, higher rates of mortality, diseases and accidents in lowerSES groups, particularly when housing and living conditions are 72 CHAPTER 7: CHILDREN AT RISK poor. Height and weight also vary with socio-economic status. The question which arisesis whether these differencesare caused only by socio-economicfactors or by additional factors such as level of education,health-threatening life circumstances (e.g. li- ving conditions, habits ofnutrition, smoking, alcohol,drugs and behaviour involvinga risk of accidents), and ethnic and or cul- tural differences. A lack ofunderstanding of health and diseases and of knowledge of localcare facilities may also affect health.Ethnic minoritiesare over-represented in the lower socio-econo- mic groups.Acting individually, healthcare workers can seldom solve thecauses of socio-economic health differences. However, they can provide additionalcare.The aim of government health policy is to reduce socio-econo-mic healthdifferences,thus improving equityin health. Evaluation studies of interventions designed to reduce socio-eco- nomic health differencesare encouraged.As long as socio-economichealth differences exist,prevention is needed. Better education ingeneral, health education directed at specific targetgroups (e.g. giving vitamin D to Mediterraneanchildren to prevent rickets),the improvement of livingcondi- tions, prevention andcare are tools for ,improving the health sta- tus of the following special risk groups. Preterm childrenChildren born preterm havemore health problems in theneona- tal period than full-termchildren. In lateryears, very preterm or very low birth weight children also have a high risk of health and developmental problems. In the Netherlands in 1983, all 1,068 very pretermor very low birth weight children (0.6 % of the births in that year)were included in a nation-wide study and of them 714 were followeduntil the age of 10. At theage of 5, CHAPTER 7:CHILDREN AT RISK 73 23% of the survivors had a physical disability, 30% speech andlanguage difficulties and 25% behavioural problems. At the ageof 9, 32% were in a grade below the appropriate level for theirage, 38% received special assistance at school and 19% of pre-term children were attending a school for special education. Ethnic minoritiesForty percent of ethnic minorities live in the 4 major cities. Inthese cities, half of the children have foreign-born parents (44%in Utrecht, 64% in Amsterdam).Inhabitants of the Netherlands born in Turkey and Morocco havemore health problems than Dutch-born inhabitants.Children from these ethnic groups use the health systemmore intensively than Dutch children. A greater percentage ofchildren with foreign-born parents than Dutch children usemedication, are referred to specialists and are admitted to hos-pital.Children whose parents are born in Morocco or Turkey have ahigher risk of health problems like caries and accidents.The mortality rate in Turkish or Moroccan children is twice tothree times as high as the mortality rate in Dutch infants. Themain causes are cot death, infections, road accidents, drow-ning, congenital anomalies and congenital metabolic disor-ders.In the Netherlands, the preventive health care system providesforeign-born parents with various courses of pedagogic and edu-cational training with the aim of improving the health status oftheir children and of reducing the shortfall in these childrens'educational progress. The higher rate of health problems in thesechildren and the preventable causes of mortality indicate that 74 CHAPTER 7: CHILDREN AT RISK prevention programmescan achieve a greater effect for the child-ren of parents born abroad.A special programme called \"Opstapje\" (meaning \"preparation\") is provided for children aged two or older from families from eth-nic minorities in order toprepare them for the regular Dutch pri-mary school. Once a week for two years, the child and its pa- rent(s) are offered help and instructions with toys and books ina playful manner at home, bya mother who speaks their nativelanguage. The aim of thisprogramme is to stimulate cognitivedevelopment in pre-school children. Children of refugeesIn recent years, the number of people asking for asylum in the Netherlands has increased. The number of families coming to the Netherlands has undergonea particularly sharp increase. In1995, '29,258 people asked for asylum in the Netherlands. 18,501 of them were granted theirrequest.In. 1994, 35% of asylum-seekers were aged 0-19. Children aged 0- 4 are relatively over-represented. Asylum-seekers are housed in special centres until a decision is made about their request. The centres provide medical care. Children aged 0-19 are offered the same pre-school and school preventive health care, including vaccination,asisofferedtoallchildrenlivinginthe Netherlands. There are doctors in the centres who can be consul- ted.Adopted childrenMost adopted childrenare adopted abroad with many coming tothe Netherlands in the seventies and eighties. The childrenwere adopted from Korea, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India.r6 CHAPTER 7:CHILDREN AT RISK 75 Upon arrival, 60% of the adopted children had a medical pro-blem (Figure 14). In total there are about 22,000 adopted child-ren living in the Netherlands. In the eighties, the number of fo-reign adoptions decreased. One of the reasons for the decreasewas the increase in signs that adopted children developed emo-tional problems at a later age. 353025 20 15 10 50skindiaranemotitastmhosp Figure 14: Medical problems in adopted children at arrival in theNetherlands: skin problems (skin), diarrhoea caused by parasitesin the stools (diar), anaemia (anem), throat infections and otitis(otit), mental retardation (reta), medication for asthma or bron-chitis (astm) and hospital admission (hosp) (percentage of totalnumberofadoptedchildren).(Source:SorgedragerandSchulpen). 71, 76 CHAPTER 7: CHILDREN AT RISK At the age of 12-15, thepercentage of behavioural and emotionalproblems in adopted boyswas twice as high (23%) as in boysborn in the Netherlands (10%). During puberty, the problemsworsen. By that time, 14.5% of adopted children have been exa- mined by a psychiatrist. Child abuseIn the last decade, a lot of attention has been paid to child abuse. A wide range of pedagogic and educational support is available for parents. There are consulting hours, advice is given to parents while visiting the child health clinic or the school doctor andthere are pedagogic lectures for parents. In these lectures (mostly a series of 5 'lessons'), pedagogic and educational problems and their solutions are demonstrated on video. Parents are also givenhomework. The aim of the lectures is to teach parents how to un- derstand children's tantrums and to teach them methods of re- sponding to them. These lectures can prevent pedagogic pro- blems leading to child abuse.Families with cultural problems or who are socially isolated have an increased risk of developing pedagogic problems which can lead to psychological disorders in vulnerable children. The risk of child abuse is greater in children with a strong temper or a con- genital anomaly. Parents with pedagogic problems are particular- ly liable to abuse their children. These at-risk parents do not at- tend pedagogic lectures. Fortunately, pedagogic problems and child abuse in these familiescan be noted and prevented by pro-fessionals in the pre-school and school health care systems be- cause most of the children and parents are taken up into the pre- ventive health care system.In the Netherlands,anyone who has seen signs of child abuse7 CHAPTER 7:CHILDREN AT RISK 77 can phone the Advice- and Report Centre for Child Abuse. In thelast 7 years, the number of reports of possible child abuse repor-ted to the Centre doubled. In 1994, there was 1 report per 270children. It is assumed that tens of children are still dying in theNetherlands annually as a consequence of child abuse. School drop-outsIn 1992/1993, 4.7% of adolescents left school in the first 5 yearsof secondary school before completing their education (schooldrop-outs).Boys drop out more often (5.3%) than girls (4.0%). Adolescentswith foreign-born parents drop out more often than Dutch ado-lescents (Table 14).Table 14: School drop-outs before completing 5 years of seconda-ry education (%). (Source: ITS). 16.1 7.7 Netherlands 4.2 Other country 5.9 78 CHAPTER 7: CHILDREN AT RISK In the eighties, the percentage of unemployed adolescents in the Netherlands increased. Most of the school drop-outs find jobs but these jobs are usuallytemporary. The government is worriedabout the prospects for these adolescents later in life. The gover- nment therefore encourages apprenticeships. An apprentice works in a companyor institution for 2 or 3 years. The company provides on-the-job vocational training. At the end of the trai- ning, there is an examination. Apprentices receive the statutory minimum wage from the firm to which they are apprenticed.Apprenticeships exist for almost every sector of trade and indust-ry.

In this publication we have used a range of sources, in particular- ly the monthly reports of Statistics Netherlands, information from SIG Health Care Information, the scenario reports of the NationalInstituteofPublicHealthandEnvironmental Protection, and AJP Schrijvers' excellent book, Health and Health care in the Netherlands. In order to keep the text readable, we did not quote in the textevery source we used since we wouldhave had to do that after almost every sentence. We therefore preferred to include a general literature list.We are indebted to Drs. A. Ambler-Huiskes, Drs. R.J.F. Burgmeijer, Prof. Dr. Vogels, Dr. J. Merkx and Drs. H. Zoomers for their valuable comments on the manuscript. Drs. J. van Zwet checked the original data from the different sources. Dr. P. Thomas polis- hed our imperfect English.Our aim was to keep the text concise and readable. However, we hope that this publication provides an adequate in- sight into child health in the Netherlands and that it will be used to compare preventive health care systems for children in order to improve the health of children all over the world.
