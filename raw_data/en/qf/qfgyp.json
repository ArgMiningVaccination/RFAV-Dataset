We provide traditional chiropractic treatments such as spinal adjustments, cranial therapy, disc decompression, and more. We want our patients to have healthy lives and to move pain-free. That's why we also offer acupuncture treatment as a way of helping our patients find relief. What Is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is an ancient traditional form of Chinese medicine. The technique employs the use of thin needles inserted into the skin at various specific nerve-rich points of the body. There are several theories about how precisely acupuncture works, though there is no singular medical explanation for the efficacy of acupuncture. Acupuncture is used worldwide to help patients suffering from a wide range of ailments. In a chiropractic environment, the most likely use of acupuncture treatment would be for back pain, sciatica, neck pain, and headaches. Patients who undergo acupuncture report that the treatment is painless. At worst, patients may experience slight discomfort from the needles' insertion. Chiropractic Acupuncture Acupuncture and chiropractic care go hand in hand due to their holistic and non-evasive approach to pain management and injury treatment. It is commonly known that chiropractic care addresses imbalance in the spinal column using manual manipulation. Acupuncture focuses more on using methods to balance energy flow in the body. It is a natural pairing to have a chiropractor work with acupuncture therapy. While the techniques used in each approach are vastly different, the goal is always to provide the patient with whole-body wellness. Acupuncture is recommended to alleviate chronic pain and treat neurological and muscular disorders like headaches, tendinitis, lower back pain, tennis elbow, sciatica, and osteoarthritis. If you are not comfortable receiving a surgical procedure for lower back problems, then acupuncture paired with an exercise regimen may be the perfect treatment plan for you. The other advantage of acupuncture is that it helps avoid the need for pain medication to deal with your symptoms. Our chiropractic clinic will be able to help you live pain-free.
