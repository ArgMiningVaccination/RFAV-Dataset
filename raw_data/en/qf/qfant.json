They compare and illustrate situations, people, and many other parts of a story to better the audience's understanding of the connotation being presented. For example, the book The Hot Zone, portrays many examples of allusion. In this novel, scientists from all over the world research to find the natural host and the end to the Ebola virus and its sister, the Marburg virus. Many people and events in history are used to describe the way the Ebola virus behaves in humans and monkeys. Richard Preston uses allusion in his book, The Hot Zone. \"In the late 1800 and early 1900's, infectious diseases were the most serious threat to health and well being.\" Until the late 1900's the leading cause of death was communicable diseases. As doctors gain more knowledge about medicine the death rate of those disease has substantially decreased. The three main illnesses of the 1800's-1900's were scarlet fever, tuberculosis, and chicken pox, yet a positive outcome from these horrendous sicknesses were antibiotics, remedies, and vaccines. Throughout the play of the Crucible, the women of Salem, Massachusetts, of all ages were being falsely accused of witchcraft, which was considered a sin by the Bible. These women would be hung or drowned by the other townspeople. Since the society that the women had lived in were Puritan who believed in an utopian society controlled by God, the townspeople saw the women as satan trying to control them. The use of false accusations had broken down the society to the core, uncovering adultery, greed and false protocols. For instance, two of the main characters had an affair with each other, which was an act of adultery. Also, the way that the townspeople handled the situation was also terrible, \"The more one contemplates the hot viruses, the less they look like parasites and the more they begin to look like predators\" (Preston 136). There is many different viruses around the planet; each spreading and mutating, jumping from species to species, picking out and taking down their prey. Richard Preston identifies viruses as predators in his novel, The Hot Zone, to show just how lethal they really are; the worst being the hot agent Ebola. The Ebola virus is the most dangerous hot agent, with high fatality rates, mutations, and limited survivors. \"Plague in Central America,\" by Arana Xajila, in the years of 1519-1560 talks about a deadly plague that derives from Europe to Mesoamerica (Central America) and spreads throughout Central America. This plague had spread to the people of Central America when their tribe, Cakchiquels, were fighting against the Spaniards. The Spaniards that were fighting in the tribe had passed on this deadly plague to the Cakchiquels tribe who then passed it on to others in Central America. This plague can be known as the influenza (flu). This deadly virus was spreading rapidly and soon everyone in Central America were affected. This deadly disease that spread from Europe to Central America had caused people much suffering and ultimately was the cause of their Edgar Allen Poe uses symbols such as the Red Death, masquerade ball, and even the castellated abbeys in the allegory \"The Masque of the Red Death\" to teach all readers, no matter their age, ethnicity, or gender, to acknowledge other people's problems. This story applies to real-life situations, such as the HIV outbreak in the 1980s; it was believed that the disease could only be contracted by homosexual men and drug users, so it seemed unimportant to the sober, straight community, who mainly just tried to ignore it. It was only when HIV was detected in straight women and children who did not use drugs that Americans started worrying about the disease and began funding and developing research on it. In this case, HIV was like the Red Death in The Black Death spread so quickly due to poor hygiene and overcrowding in major cities. It was the worst pandemic plague, and had significant results on the world. 1. Health officials realized that the mysterious illness was not caused by a bacterium because the pathogen would be identified quickly in comparison to a virus, which is more complicated (CBC, 2013). The Black death is a horrible disease that caused many symptoms in and on the body and was easily transmitted. There are a few different What would you do if your town started to come down with a fever that no one knew what it was? The reasons why I think that the author used \"all was not right\" for this chapter is because they knew something was going around and that they did not know what was going on. Dictionary.com defines a filo virus as \"any of several filamentous single stranded RNA viruses.\" The Hot Zone is a terrifying true story, by Richard Preston, about the historical stories of Ebola and other viruses such as Marburg and Simian Fever. Richard Preston teaches the reader that nature is unpredictable and that you should always be ready for something new. Dan Dalgard, Gene Johnson, and Nancy Jaax; these are just some of the extraordinary people who have made new breakthroughs in the medical field. Gene Johnson was one of the first discoverers of Ebola and has become an expert on the filo virus. Nancy Jaax almost became infected when she tore her space suit while performing an autopsy on an infected monkey. Luckily she didn't, but danger can happen around any corner. 200 years ago Edgar Allen Poe wrote the story \" The Masque of the Red Death\", comparing both the red death, and Ebola from what I read Poe was not talking about Ebola in the story. For instance the symptoms of both diseases have common affects on people when they come in contact with disease. Poe wrote the story 200 years ago, at Prince Prospero , but Ebola has only been around for a short period of time. For example both infections scared everyone, and the people isolated themselves from the sick. Based on what I read Poe was not talking about Ebola in the story. We've had many global outbreaks in our world of diseases and viruses. The novel The Hot Zone by Richard Preston is about an outbreak of a vicious disease. It gives a terrifying, true narrative about an eruption of a deadly virus, Ebola, the great slate wiper, the disease that did horrific things you did not want to imagine (Preston 64). The vicious virus approached upon the people out of nowhere, when no one knew what it was or why it was happening. The government's response was very well reacted to the situation, they jumped right on the situation, contained the virus and tried to find a cure as soon as possible. Edgar Allan Poe, writer of \"The Masque of the Red Death\" could very well be talking about present-day disease, Ebola. In the story, many things send readers' minds straight to the disease and for good reason. Poe could be psychic, or he may simply have a very avid imagination; nonetheless, the similarities are very, very strange. Next, the symptoms of this disease can be as mild as sweating, or as extreme as growing large, black patches all over the body. The main way a person would become sick is if a rodent with the Plague bit them. In special cases, Yersinia Pestis bacteria would get into the skin if a human had a "}
