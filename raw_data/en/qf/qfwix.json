Research Question - What strategies should public health and health care officials, health care providers, policymakers, and researchers pursue to boost COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States in order to achieve herd immunity and overcome the pandemic? This report presents the results of an evaluation of the root causes of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy to inform strategies to boost vaccine acceptance among vaccine-hesitant populations in the United States. The authors conducted a literature review of the causes of vaccine hesitancy and vaccine acceptance; focus groups with patients, pre-hospital first responders, and hospital-based health care providers; a social media platform sentiment analysis to review attitudes regarding the COVID-19 vaccine; and a roundtable discussion with experts on vaccine hesitancy. Drawing on this mixed-methods analysis, the authors recommend strategies to help boost COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in the United States, grouping them according to three overall goals: boosting confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, combating complacency about the pandemic, and increasing the convenience of getting vaccinated. The authors emphasize that combating misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine is key to achieving these goals. These recommendations can inform the development of a toolkit of strategies to reach herd immunity and end the pandemic. Key Findings The mixed-methods analysis revealed common themes associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the United States - Strategies to boost COVID-19 vaccine acceptance need to be tailored to root causes of hesitancy in different populations. - Currently hesitant populations might be willing to obtain the vaccine if the right influencer helps to convey a recommendation to do so. Strategies to boost acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine can be grouped within the World Health Organization's \"three Cs\" model of confidence, complacency, and convenience - Boosting COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in the United States can be achieved by (1) boosting confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, (2) combating complacency about the pandemic, and (3) increasing the convenience of getting vaccinated. - Combating misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine is key to achieving these goals. Recommendations - Expand vaccination access at the community level through various services. - Increase awareness, knowledge, and dissemination of accurate vaccination information. - Address conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation through constant and consistent truth-telling and myth-busting public health campaigns. - Develop communication strategies that use personal narratives and emphasize the \"why\" of vaccination. - Employ multiple vaccination-acceptance-boosting strategies directed at more than one level of engagement among hesitant populations. - Tailor vaccination-acceptance-boosting messages, messengers, and messaging platforms to a particular community's root causes of hesitancy. - Develop and implement unified federal, state, and local vaccination campaigns and initiatives that are apolitical. - Identify strategies to boost vaccine acceptance among those with political, religious, or conspiratorial reasons for vaccine avoidance, and individuals who may identify with the anti-vaccination movement that existed prior to COVID-19. - Normalize vaccination as a patriotic or public health action that strives to help the greater good and overcome a common threat while removing any semblance of performativity. - Foster a sense of belonging and community associated with vaccination to replace the appeal of endorsing conspiracy theories. - Leverage technology to promote vaccinations, such as convenient, \"smart\" scheduling and tailoring messages via text-messaging to those who have not yet been reached. - Prioritize research and further evaluation of effective strategies to overcome hesitancy in hard-to-reach populations and to inform vaccination-acceptance efforts in the ongoing COVID-19 and future pandemics. - Develop and implement vaccination programs through public-private partnerships.
