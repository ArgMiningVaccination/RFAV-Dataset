Shungo is also a greeting, said to mean, \"From my heart or center to yours.\" It is from this place, the heart and center of our being, that the most profound healing can take place. By tuning into your body and intuitive heart, you are led to an awareness of what medicine is needed to ease or release the subtle patterns of constriction and the blocks in your systems\u2014mental, physical, and spiritual. This new awareness can awaken you to your inner truth, and lead you to new discoveries within the Self and your life. You are left with the potential to discover the whole of who you are, your Truth and your Medicine, and find the way back to your center\u2014the heart of your being. A sacred inclusive space. The journey through healing body, mind & soul Hello My name is Moira Scullion. I've been in the healing arts field for almost 25 years, with various studies in bodywork (with a focus on abdominal healing), energy and shamanic healing, personal growth, breathwork, spiritual healing, spiritual life coaching, and spiritual ministry. Over the years, I've seen the profound connection and relationship between the mind, spirit, body, and the emotional states carried within. It is the intersection of these fields that is the heart and center of your being, and where the most profound healing takes place. Why Energy Healing?

About the work A healing journey through body, mind, and soul. It was through working with the belly, specifically, that I came to understand the body to be about more than just bones and muscles. In Peru, the indigenous Quechua people have a word Shungo, which roughly translates to \"one's center\u2014the heart and belly of your being.\" I've found this word's meaning and concept to be central to my work with the belly and to the spirits, or souls, of my clients. Combined, Shungo and abdominally centered work helped me to understand the profound connection between the body and its state of well-being; all the energy, emotions, and beliefs it carries; and the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves. I saw, and continue to see every day, that they are intrinsically linked: our history, our experiences/memories, live inside of our bodies as personalized stories. When the story is positive, it expresses itself in our systems\u2014mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual\u2014as balance, joy, flow, abundance, vitality, health, contentment, and even good luck. When this inner story is about something difficult or overwhelming and unprocessed, it most often gets stuck in our bodies and energy systems and fields as a contraction, and expresses itself in our systems as fear, withdrawal, self-limitation, discomfort, pain, and even disease. Positive and negative stories can also be experienced outside of our bodies\u2014we see them mirrored in our experiences in the world. For example, we may keep running into similarly challenging situations that always seem to trigger us. It is this trigger, though, that is the arrow that points to the what and where inside of us that needs healing, tending to, and loving care. Experiences that trigger us can become opportunities to look at our imprints\u2014events or circumstances that impacted our well-being\u2014to find those places within us that are ready to unweave themselves while under tender care. It seems ironic, and can even feel counterintuitive, but here is a truth I have come to know for sure: you can consider a trigger the soul and body's call for our attention. The wounded place in us is telling us it's ready to receive healing; it wishes to heal. This healing work is the work I love. Holding a space of tender care and a space of active collaboration where you and I, and our subconscious minds, and our spirit allies, and the Divine all work and play and commune together. I have a profound love for this space, this field of collaborative healing where the web of imprinted history is unwoven in order the release the hurt and pain of old stories and wounds so that you can weave a new story\u2014so that you can come back to yourself and become closer to your own soul. This is where the story changes from you being the wounded soldier or victim, to you being the empowered heroine or hero who is able to write a new story and the way you choose it to be in it. Offerings Healing work is a journey, not a destination or a task on a checklist. There is no \"one stop shop.\" Healing is a daily process of awareness and self-care, and we all need support in our healing process. It is not meant to all be done by yourself. Also, healing work is done in layers and phases. While you can do some by yourself, really, the most effective healing is done, and is meant to be done and witnessed, with the love and support of others in community and in relationship. It is the process of being witnessed, of being held by another in sacred space, that helps us go into the deeper places within our selves and the wounds, to bring them out into the light and be shared with others and held with compassionate hearts. This is just as healing as anything. I love being able to hold this sacred space for others as it has been held for me. Release old patterns and move through current challenges with greater awareness and empowerment. Each session changes and varies with the intention you bring into the present moment. Energy Coaching/Guidance remote In this active session, you will enter the healing field in a wakeful, conscious state. Through your perception and awareness, and my active support, we will listen to, feel, see, and follow the perceived energy so as to intentionally allow it to unfold and unwind by welcoming it to be witnessed and express its messages. We will lovingly tend it throughout this process. These sessions are done via Zoom.

These sessions are done via Zoom. Abdominal Therapy In Person Through abdominal-focused bodywork and energy medicine, we will explore\u2014through the doorway of the abdomen specifically\u2014both the physiological and emotional restrictions involved in emotional holding, digestive and pelvic issues, and scar tissue.
