V/ashington Street, Room W461, MS25 Indianapolis, IN 46204 Dear Ms. Taylor: Under section 1115 of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) may approve any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project that, in the judgment of the Secretary, is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of certain programs under the Act, including Medicaid. Congress enacted section l115 of the Act to ensure that federal requirements did not \"stand in the way of experimental projects designed to test out new ideas and ways of dealing with the problems of public welfare recipients.\" S. Rep. No. 87-1589, at 19 (1962), as reprinted in 1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1943, 1961. As relevant here, section I I l5(a)(l) of the Act allows the Secretary to waive compliance with the Medicaid program requirements of section 1902 of the Act, to the extent and for the period he finds necessary to carry out the demonstration project. In addition, section 1115(a)(2) of the Act allows the Secretary to provide federal financial participation (FFP) for demonstration costs that would not otherwise be considered as federally matchable expenditures under section 1903 of the Act, to the extent and for the period prescribed by the Secretary. For the reasons discussed below, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is approving Indiana's amendment request for its section 1 I 15(a) demonstration titled, \"Healthy Indiana Plan\" (HIP) (Project Number: l1-W-00296/5) through December 31,2020. Approval of this demonstration amendment will enable Indiana to receive FFP for inpatient services provided to otherwise-eligible Medicaid beneficiaries while residing in Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) for a serious mental illness (SMI) diagnosis. Indiana also submitted its SMI Implementation Plan with the amendment request. CMS has completed its review of the Implementation Plan and determined that, pending an updated assessment of mental health services, it is consistent with the requirements set forth in the special terms and conditions (STC). Based on CMS review, it is concurrently approving the Implementation Plan as Attachment G. With this concurrent approval, the state may begin receiving FFP under the terms of the demonstration amendment.Page 2 - Ms. Allison Taylor Obiectives of the Medicaid Program As noted above, the Secretary may approve a demonstration project under section I 1 I 5 of the Act if, in his judgment, the project is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of title XIX. The purposes of Medicaid include an authorization of appropriation offunds to \"enabl[e] each State, as far as practicable under the conditions in such State, to fumish (1) medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and ofaged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs ofnecessary medical services, and (2) rehabilitation a\u00a1d other services to help such families and individuals attain or retain capability for independence or self-care.\" Act $ 1901. This provision makes clear that an important objective of the Medicaid program is to fumish medical assistance and other seryices to vulnerable populations. But there is little intrinsic value in paying for services if those services are not advancing the health and wellness of the individua.l receiving them, or otherwise helping the individual attain independence. Therefore, we believe an objective of the Medicaid program, in addition to fumishing services, is to advance the health and wellness needs of its beneficiaries, and that it is appropriate for the state to structure its demonshation project in a manner that prioritizes meeting those needs. Section 1115 demonstration projects present an opportunity for states to experiment with reforms that go beyond just routine medical care and focus on interventions that drive better health outcomes and quality of life improvements, and that may increase beneficiaries' financial independence. Such policies may include those designed to address certain health determinants and those that encourage beneficiaries to engage in health-promoting behaviors and to strengthen engagement by beneficiaries in their personal health care plans. These tests will necessarily mean a change to the status quo. They may have associated administrative costs, particularly at the initial stage, and section 1l 15 acknowledges that demonstrations may \"result in an impact on eligibility, effollment, benefits, cost-sharing, or financing.\" Act $ 111s(dxl). But in the long term they may create incentives and opportunities that help enable many beneficiaries to enjoy the numerous personal benefits that come with improved health and financial independence. Section 1 1 15 demonstration projects also provide an opportunity for states to test policies that ensure the fiscal sustainability of the Medicaid program, better \"enabling each [s]tate, as far as practicable under the conditions in such [s]tate\" to fumish medical assistance, Act $ 1901, while making it more practicable for states to fumish medical assistance to a broader range of beneficiaries in need. For instance, measures desigrred to improve health and wellness may reduce the volume of services consumed, as healthier, more engaged beneficiaries tend to consume fewe\u00a1 medical services and are generally less costly to cover. Further, measures that have the effect ofhelping individuals secure employer-sponsored or other commercial coverage or otherwise transition from Medicaid eligibility may decrease the number of individuals who need financial assistance, including medical assistance, from the state. Such measures may enable states to stretch their resources further and enhance their ability to provide medical assistance to a broader range ofbcncficiaries in need, including by expanding the serviccs and populations they cover.l By the same token, such measures may also preserve states' ability to continue to provide the optional services and coverage they already have in place. I States have considerable flexibility in the design of their Medicaid programs, within federal guidelines. Certain benefits are mandatory under federal law, but many benefits may be provided at state option, such as prescriptionPage 3 - Ms. Allison Taylor Our demonstration authority under section I 1 I 5 of the Act allows us to offer states more flexibility to experiment with different ways of improving health outcomes and strengthening the financial independence ofbeneficiaries. Demonstration projects that seek to improve beneficiary health and financial independence improve the well-being of Medicaid beneficiaries and, at the same time, allow states to maintain the long-term fiscal sustainability of their Medicaid programs and to provide more medical services to more Medicaid beneficiaries. Accordingly, such demonstration projects advance the objectives of the Medicaid program. CMS considered whether the demonstration as amended is likely to assist in delivering high- quality, clinically appropriate treatment to beneficiaries diagnosed with SMI and receiving treallent while they are short-term residents in free-standing psychiatric hospitals that qualifu as IMDs. CMS has determined the demonstration is likely to promote the objectives of Medicaid, and the authorities sought are necessary and appropriate to carry out the d\u00f8nonstration. Specifically, the demonstration is expected to assist the state in increasing identifrcation, initiation, and engagement of Medicaid beneficiaries diagrrosed with SMI; improve access to community-based services to address the chronic mental health ca\u00a1e needs ofbeneficiaries with SMI; improve care coordination, especially continuity of care in the community following episodes of acute care in hospitals; and reduce inappropriate or preventable utilization of emergency departments and inpati\u00f8rt hospital settings tfuough improved access to a continuum ofcare services in additional settings that, absent this d\u00f8nonstration, would be ineligible for Medicaid reimbursement for most Medicaid enrollees. Consideration of Public Comments To increase the transparency of demonshation projects, section 1115(dX1) and (2) ofthe Act direct the Secretary to issue regulations providing for two periods ofpublic comment on a state's application for a section 1115 project that would result in an impact on eligibilit\u00a1 enrollment, benefits, cost-sharing, or financing. The first comment period occurs at the state level before submission ofthe section 1115 application and the second occurs at the federal level after the application is received by the Secretary. Sections 1 1 1 5(dX2XA) and (C) of the Act fufther specify that comment periods should be \"sufficient to ensure a meaningful level ofpublic input,\" but the statute imposes no additional requirement on the states or the Secretary to address those comments, as might otherwise be required under a general rulemaking. Accordingly, the implernenting regulations issued in 2012 drug benefits, vision benefits, afld dental benefits. Similar\u00fe, states have considerable latih\u00a1de to determine whom their Medicaid programs will cover. C\u20acrtain eligibility groups must be covered under a state's program, but many states opt to cover additional eligibility groups that are optional under the Medicaid statute. The optional groups include a new, non-elderly adult population (ACA expansion population) that was added to the Act at section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Coverage ofthe ACA expansion population became optional as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in.\u00f2/F1B v. Sebelius,567 U.S. 519 (2012). Accordingly, several months after the NFIB decision was issued, CMS informed the states that they \"have flexibility to start or stop the expansion.\" CMS, Frequent\u00fe Asked Questions on Exchanges, Market Reforns, and Medicaid at 11 (Dec. 10, 2012). In addition to expanding Medicaid coverage by povering optional eligibility groups and benefits beyond what the Medicaid statute requires, many states also choose to cover benefits beyond what is authorized by statute byusing expenditure authority under section I I l5(a)(2) ofthe Act. For example, recently, many states have been relying on this authority to expand the scope ofservices they offer to address substance use disorders beyond what tlle statut\u20ac explicitly authorizes.Page 4 - Ms. Allison Taylor provide that CMS will review and consider all comments received by the deadline, but will not provide written responses to public comments.2 The federal public comment period was open from September 13, 2019 to October 13, 2019, and CMS received four comments during this federal public comment period. Most of comments were supportive of this amendment; and one commenter urged CMS to approve this amendment quickly so the state can better serve individuals with SMI. The same commenter expressed concem tlrat certain components ofthe demonstration, including community engagement requirements, cost-sharing requirements, and lockouts, may undermine the goals of the SMI amendment. We addressed the comments conceming these demonstration features in the approval letter for the HIP dernonstration extension issued on February 1, 2018. For the reasons stated in that approval letter, the demonstration project as amended is likely to promote the objectives of Medicaid. One commenter raised several concems regarding the state's proposal, including one that stated authorizing FFP for IMDs risks diverting resources away from community-based services and would undermine community integration. Nothing in this demonstration requires that services be provided to any individual in any particular setting, nor does it limit the availability of community-based settings. Nonetheless, the state should ensure that inpatient and residential care will supplement and coordinate with community-based care. In addition, this amendment should not reduce or divert state spending on mental health and addiction treatrnent services as a \u00a1esult of available federal funding for services in IMDs. The state will also ensure that it maintains current spending on outpatient, community-based mental health services consistent with historical spending at the local level, as outlined in STC XL2.e. The remaining comments were generally predicated upon a misapprehension about the nature and scope of CMS's 1l 15 authority. Other Information CMS' approval of this demonstration is subject to the limitations specified in the enclosed authorities and STCs which define the nature, character, and extent of federal involvernent in this project. The state may deviate from the Medicaid state plan requirements only to the extent they have been specifically listed as waived or not applicable to expenditures or individuals covered by expenditure authority. This approval is also subject to your written acknowledgement of the award and acceptance of the STCs within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES This section 1115(a) demonstration provides authority for the state to offer HIP, which provides health care coverage for adults and an account similar to a health savings account called a Personal Wellness and Responsibility (POWER) Account. Under this a pproval , Indiana is building on and changing its previous HIP program in multiple ways , including through POWER Account contributions determined by income tier, implementation of a tobacco user contribution surcharge, the addition of some chiropractic cove rage, a change in the timing of managed care organization (MCO) selection, a non -eligibility period for failure to timely complete the redetermination process, a substance use disorder (SUD) treatment program, and required participation in community engage ment . Under HIP , beneficiaries who consistently make required monthly contributions to their POWER Account will maintain access to an enhanced benefit plan, known as \"HIP Plus ,\" which will include enhanced benefits such as dental, vision, and chiropractic coverage. HIP Plus is intended to encourage personal responsibility, improve healthy behaviors, and develop cost conscious consumer behaviors among all beneficiaries. Beneficiaries with income at or below 100 percent of the federal pove rty level (FPL) who do not make monthly POWER Account contributions will be defaulted to a more limited benefit plan meeting alternative benefit plan re quirements (known as \"HIP Basic\") . Individuals above 100 percent of the FPL who do not make the monthly contributions will be disenrolled and not able to re -enter the program for six months. The HIP Basic plan will require co -payments for all services in amounts that would be permitted in the state plan rather than the monthly POWER Account contributions r equired to participate in the HIP Plus plan. All beneficiaries will have the opportunity to have their POWER Account contributions reduced in subsequent years for completion of preventive services and through successfully managing their POWER accounts. In addition, Indiana implemented community engagement requirement s as a condition of eligibility for HIP beneficiaries , with exemptions for various groups, including: pregnant women, beneficiaries considered medically frail, members in active SUD treatment, and students. To remain eligible , non- exempt beneficiaries must complete a specific number of hours per week of community engagement activities, such as employment, education, job skills training, and community service for eight months in the 12- month ca lendar year . Beneficiaries will have their eligibility suspended in the new calendar year for failure to demonstrate compliance with the community engagement requirement during the prior calendar year . During an eligibility suspension, beneficiaries may reactiv ate their eligibility in the month following notification to the state that they complete d a calendar month of required hours . Indiana will provide good cause exemptions in certain circumstances for beneficiaries who cannot meet requirements. The HIP demonstration also include s a SUD program available to all Medicaid beneficiaries to ensure that a broad continuum of care is available to beneficiaries with SUD, which will help improve the quality, care, and health outcomes for Indiana Medicaid beneficiaries. In an Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 3 of 229 amendment to this demonstration dated [ December 20, 2019], t he state also received authority under the demonstration to receive federal financial participation (FFP) for delivering high - quality, clinically appropriate treatment to bene ficiaries ages 21 through 64 diagnosed with a serious mental illness ( SMI) and receiving treatment while they are short -term residents in settings that meet the definition of an Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD). Over the demonstration period, the s tate seeks to achieve several demonstration goals. The state's goals will inform the state's evaluation design hypotheses, subject to CMS approval, as described in these STCs. The state's goals include , but are not limited to determining whether : Moving the monthly payment obligation to a tiered structure, linked to a POWER account , will result in more efficient use of health care services , be easier for beneficiaries to understand, and increase compliance with payments ; Implementing a community engageme nt requirement will lead to sustainable employment and improved health outcomes among HIP beneficiaries and former HIP beneficiaries who experience a lapse in eligibility or who transition to employer -sponsored coverage or commercial coverage; Charging beneficiaries an increased monthly contribution for tobacco use will discourage tobacco use and increase the utilization of tobacco cessation benefits ; and Receiving FFP for Medicaid services rendered in an IMD for bene ficiaries with an SMI and/or a SUD re duces utilization and length of stays in emergency departments and preventable readmissions to acute care hospitals and residential settings. III. GENERAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 1. Compliance with Federal Non -Discrimination Statutes. The state must comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to non -discrimination. These include, but are not limited to, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act . 2. Compliance with Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Law, Regulation, and Policy. All requirements of the Medicaid program and CHIP, expressed in law, regulation, and policy statement, not expressly waived or identified as not applicable in the waiver and expenditure authority documents (of which these terms and conditions are part), apply to the demonstration. 3. Changes in Federal Law, Regulation, and Policy. The state must, within the timeframes specified in the applicable federal law, regulation, or policy statement, come into compliance with any changes in federal law, regulation, or policy affecting the Medicaid or CHIP program that occur durin g this demonstration approval period, unless the provision being changed is expressly waived or identified as not applicable as described in these STCs . In addition, CMS reserves the right to amend the STCs to reflect such changes and/or changes of an operational nature without requiring the state to submit an amendment to the demonstration under STC 7 of this section . CMS will Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 4 of 229 notify the state 30 days in advance of the expected approval date of the amended STCs to allow the state to provide comment. 4. Impact on Demonstration of Changes in Federal Law, Regulation, and Policy. a. To the extent that a change in federal law, regulation, or policy requires a change in federal financial participation (FFP) for expenditures made under this demonstration, the sta te shall adopt, subject to CMS approval, a modified budget neutrality agreement for the demonstration, as well as a modified allotment neutrality worksheet as necessary to comply with such change. Further, the state may seek an amendment to the demonstrat ion (as per STC 7 of this section) as a result of the change in FFP. b. If mandated changes in federal law require state legislation, unless otherwise prescribed by the terms of the federal law, the changes must take effect on the day such state legislation becomes effective, or on the day such legislation was required to be in effect under federal law, whichever is sooner. 5. State Plan Amendments. The state will not be required to submit title XIX or title XXI state plan amendments (SPAs) for changes affecting any populations made eligible solely through the demonstration. If a population eligible through the Medicaid or CHIP state plan is affected by a change to the demonstration, a conforming amendment to the appropriate state plan may be required except as otherwise noted in these STCs. In all such cases, the Medicaid st ate plan governs. 6. Changes Subject to the Amendment Process. If not otherwise specified in these STCs, changes related to eligibility, enrollment, benefits, beneficiary rights, delivery systems, cost sharing, evaluation design, sources of non- federal share of funding, and budget neutrality that are specifically authorized under the demonstration project must be submitted to CMS as amendments to the demonstration. All amendment requests are subject to approval at the discretion of the Secretary in accordance with section 1115 of the Act. The state must not implement changes to these elements without prior ap proval by CMS either through an approved amendment to the Medicaid or CHIP state plan or amendment to the demonstration. Amendments to the demonstration are not retroactive and FFP will not be available for changes to the demonstration that have not been approved through the amendment process set forth in STC 7 of this section , except as provided in STC 3 of this section . 7. Amendment Process. Requests to amend the demonstration must be submitted to CMS for approval no later than 120 days prior to the planned date of implementation of the change and may not be implemented until approved. CMS reserves the right to deny or delay approval of a demonstration amendment based on non- compliance with these STCs, including but not limited to failure by the state to submit required reports and other deliverables in a timely fashion according to the deadlines specified herein. Amendment requests must include, but are not limited to, the following: a. An explanation of the public process used by the state, consistent wi th the requirements applicable to amendments listed in STC 14 of this section, prior to Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 5 of 229 submission of the requested amendment; b. A data analysis worksheet which identifies the specific \"with waiver\" impact of the proposed amendment on the current budget neutrality agreement. Such analysis shall include total computable \"with waiver\" and \"without waiver\" status on both a summary and detailed level through the current approval period using the most recent actual expenditures, as well as summary and detail p rojections of the change in the \"with waiver\" expenditure total as a result of the proposed amendment, which isolates (by Eligibility Group) the impact of the amendment; c. An up-to-date CHIP allotment neutrality worksheet, if necessary; d. A detailed description of the amendment including impact on beneficiaries, with sufficient supporting documentation and data supporting the evaluation hypotheses as detailed in the evaluation design in section XV; and e. If applicable, a description of how the evaluation design will be modified to incorporate the amendment provisions. 8. Extension of the Demonstration . No later than twelve months prior to the expiration date of the demonstration, the Governor of the state must submit to CMS either a demonstration extension request that meets federal requirements at 42 CFR 431.412(c) or a phase out plan consistent with the requirements of STC 9 of this section . 9. Demonstration Phase Out. The state may only suspend or terminate this demonstration in whole, or in part, consistent with the following requirements. a. Notification of Suspension or Termination.

Individuals eligible for a Medicaid category under the s tate plan not listed under STC 1 of this section. b. Individuals eligible for Medicare at the time of enrollment. If an individual becomes eligible for Medicare after enrolling in HIP, then disenrollment from HIP would become effective starting the date of Medicare Part B eligibility and in accordance with Medicaid and Medicare rules and regulations. 3. Effective Date of Coverage. For individuals who participate in HIP Plus, coverage will be effective no later than the first day of the month in which the initial POWER account contribution or fast track payment is made . For individuals with income at or below 100 percent of the FPL who do not pay POWER account contributions for access to the HIP Plus plan, coverage will be effective the first day of the month in which the 60- day payment period expires. For individuals found presumptively eligible, who are subsequently determined eligible for full eligibility, there shall be no gap in coverage between presumptive coverage and HIP Plus or HIP Basic coverage as described in STC 4 of this section. For such individuals, at state option, the effective date of HIP coverage may begin at the end of the PE period (or earlier) so long as there is no gap in coverage. This waiver of effective date of coverage (reasonable promptness) is conditioned as described in the terms outlined in STC 4 of this section related to presumptive eligibility standards. 4. Presumptive Eligibility. The state includes Federally Qualified Health Centers, Rural Health Centers, Community Mental Health Centers, and Health Department sites in the presumptive eligibility program, to allow potentially eligible individuals to gain temporary coverage. All provisions of 42 CFR 435.1103 and 435.1110 a re applicable to these entities in determining presumptive eligibility. Individuals determined presumptively eligible for HIP (Adult PE) will not have a break in coverage if they are found eligible for Medicaid through the Indiana Health Cove rage Program s (IHCP ) application process. Adult PE beneficiaries who do not submit a full IHCP application will have their PE benefit end on the last day of the following month after PE approval.

A dult PE beneficiaries who have their IHCP application approved will move into HIP coverage the first of the month following approval of the application. Beneficiaries will have 60 days to pay any required premium payment starting f rom the date when fast track eligibility begins following filing of the IHCP application ; this payment period will transition into HIP coverage. For example, if the member had already had 15 days to pay during PE, their payment period in HIP Basic will continue for 45 days. PE members will receive HIP Plus or HIP Basic coverage follo wing transition to HIP per the standard processes. a. At state option, Indiana can reclassify presumptive ly eligible individual s as eligible in the new adult group for up to 3 months prior to the effective date of coverage as Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 11 of 229 outlined in STC 3 of this section . Members transitioned from Adult PE who do not make a POWER Account payment in the 60- day time frame and who have household incomes greater than 100 percent of the FPL will be terminated from HIP . 5. Pregnant Women . Pregnant women eligible under 42 CFR 435.116 with income under 133 percent of the FPL will be enrolled into HIP. Women who are enrolled in HIP and report a pregnancy will begin to receive state plan equivalent benefits that are equal to or more generous in all categories than t he benefits provided in the HIP ABP s and all required prenatal services. Pregnant beneficiaries have no cost sharing and receive 60 days of postpartum coverage. After the completion of postpartum coverage, the beneficiaries will seamlessly transition bac k to the appropriate Medicaid eligibility category and will be provide d an option to pay for HIP Plus benefits. Newly eligible adults who are pregnant can continue to be claimed by the state at the enhanced match until redetermination, at which time , if the beneficiary identifies as pregnant, that beneficiary must be claimed at the applicable match for pregnant women . 6. Transitional Medical Assistance . Beneficiaries whose job income increases to over 133 percent of the FPL can either attain or remain in HIP Plus coverage for up to twelve months. If after the first six months of TMA coverage income remains over 133 percent of the FPL, but below 185 percent of the FPL, coverage can extend an additional six months as long as POWER Account contributions are paid. Except for the income limit and frequency of reporting, all other existing TMA rules will be used for the over 133 percent of the FPL parent/caretaker group. All other individuals that would have previously qualified as TMA with income over the s ection 1931 limit, but less than 133 percent of FPL will be enrolled directly in HIP and receive the applicable HIP Basic or HIP Plus ABP . V. BENEFITS 1. HIP Benefits. HIP beneficiaries, other than s ection 1931 parents and caretaker relatives and pregnant women, will receive benefits available in one of the state's approved ABPs. These beneficiaries will have access to the HIP Plus plan containing an enhanced benefit package that includes adult chiropractic, vision, and dental as additional state plan services. Such beneficiaries with income at or below 100 percent of the FPL (other than AI/AN individuals) who do not make their required monthly POWER account contributions within the 60- day payment period, will be defaulted to the HIP Basic benefit plan. Benefi ciaries who are s ection 1931 parents and caretaker relatives will be enrolled in HIP, but will receive all benefits as described in the state plan. Beneficiaries in the new adult group who qualify as medically frail will be enrolled in HIP, but will also receive ABP coverage equivalent to coverage in the state plan. Table 2.

VI. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM 1. General Description . Gateway to Work was launched in 2015 to promote the connection between employment and health by integrating the s tate's various work training and job search programs with HIP. Through the Gateway to Work initiative, for which the state does not receive federal matching funds, all eligible HIP beneficiaries who are unemployed or working less than 20 hours per week are referred to available employment, work search and job training programs to assist the member in securing gainful employment. After the referral is made via Gateway to Work, member participation in the available employment and training programs has been voluntary. Effective 2019, building upon its experience with Gateway to Work, Indiana will make participation in community engagement activities mandatory for some HIP beneficiaries as discussed below . Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 13 of 229 2. Eligibility .

Beneficiaries can participate in any of the qual ifying activities described in STC 4 of this section and combine the hours to satisfy the weekly hour s requirement. As noted in STC 7(b) of this section, if beneficiaries participate in more hours of qualifying activities than is required in a week, they can apply the extra hours to the rest of that calendar month. 6.

The state must also provide reasonable modifications for program protections and procedures, including but not limited to assistance with demon strating eligibility for good cause exemptions; appealing suspensions; documenting community engagement activities and other documentation requirements; understanding notices and program rules related to community engagement requirements; and other types of reasonable modifications. The reasonable modifications must include exemptions from participation where an individual is unable to participate for disability -related reasons, modification in the number of hours of participation required where an individual is unable to participate for the required number of hours, and provision of support services necessary to participate, where participation is possible with supports. In addition, the state should evaluate individuals' ability to participate and the ty pes of reasonable modifications and supports needed . 7. Measurement and Non -Compliance. Beneficiaries will not be subject to a review of their community engagement hours until each December. E ach December, the state will evaluate whether a beneficiary has met the community engagement hours requirement for the prior 12- month calendar year. All beneficiaries must meet the community engagement requirement s for eight months per calendar year. Some b eneficiaries will not have been eligible for HIP the full calendar year, and the months in which the beneficiary is not eligible will not be counted as months in which the beneficiary must meet the requirement . Months in which a beneficiary qualifies for an exemption (as described in STCs 3 and 7(a) of this section) are also not counted. Beneficiaries who are exempt for a partial year , or who participated in the program for a partial year, will still have four months per each calendar year, in which they do not have to complete the community engagement requirement s or qualify for an exemption. Months for which the beneficiary has requested an appeal of/has successfully appealed the state's determination of noncompliance (according to state procedures ) will also not be counted. Thus, for a person who was enrolled the full calendar year and has no exemptions or appeals , participation in community engagement activities will be required for eight out of twelve months . For a person who enrolled in September and has no exemptions or appeals, that person will not have to demonstrate participation in community engagement activities until the end of the next calendar year . Eligibility will be suspended beginning on the first day of the new calendar year for bene ficiaries who did not meet required community engagement hours as stated in Table 3 for the required number of months during the prior 12- month calendar year. Unless a beneficiary reactivates eligibility (as described in STC 8 of this section) , eligibility will remain suspended until the beneficiary's eligibility redetermination date. If a member is in suspended status on their redetermination date and does not meet the requirement or qualify for an exemption during the month of redetermination, their eligibility will be denied and their enrollment in the demonstration terminated, and they must reapply to regain access to Medicaid coverage , including through the demonstration. When an individual whose enrollment was terminated during redetermina tion reapplies, their previous noncompliance with the community engagement requirement will not be factored into the state's determination of their eligibility for reenrollment into HIP . Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 16 of 229 a. Good Cause Exemption.

Suspension Effective Date . Suspensions for non- compliance with community engagement requirements are effective the first day of the new calendar year. 8. Re-activation During Suspension for Non -Compliance . During suspension for community engagement non- compliance, beneficiaries can re activate eligibility by becoming eligible for Medicaid under an eligibility group not subject to the provisions of the community engagement requirements, by meeting an exemption (including a good cause exemption) , or by completing one calendar month of required community engagement hours and submitting that information to the state . Reactivation will occur based on the specific member eligibility criteria: a. If a beneficiary beco mes eligible under another eligibility group in Medicaid, their eligibility would be reactivated with an effective date based on established state policy for that eligibility group . b. If a beneficiary meets an exemption, their eligibility would reactivate in the concurrent month of when the state receives notification of the exemption. c. If a beneficiary becomes pregnant , eligibility could be retroactive to a prior month per established state policy. d. If a beneficiary complete s one calendar month of required community engagement hours , they will be able to reactivate eligibility in the month following notification to the state that they have come into compliance. 9.

Provide full appeal rights as required under 42 CFR, Part 431, subpart E prior to suspension of eligibility or termination of el igibility, and observe all requirements for due process for beneficiaries whose eligibility will be suspended, denied , or terminated for failing to meet the community engagement requirement, including allowing beneficiaries the opportunity to raise additio nal issues in a hearing, including whether the beneficiary should be subject to the suspension, and provide additional documentation through the appeals process. g. Assure that disenrollment or denial of eligibility will only occur after an individual has been screened and determined ineligible for all other bases of Medicaid eligibility and reviewed for eligibility for insurance affordability programs in accordance with 42 CFR 435.916(f). h. Establish beneficiary protections, including assuring that HIP beneficiaries do not have to duplicate requirements to maintain access to all public assistance programs that require community engagement and employment. i. Make good faith efforts to connect beneficiaries to existing community supports that are available to assist beneficiaries in meeting community engagement requirements, including available non- Medicaid assistance with transportation, child care, language access services and other supports; and make good faith efforts to connect beneficiaries with disab ilities as defined in the ADA, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with services and supports necessary to enable them to meet community engagement requirements. j. Ensure the state will as sess areas within the state that experience high rates of unemployment, areas with limited economies and/or educational opportunities, and areas with lack of public transportation to determine whether there should be further exemptions from community engag ement requirements and/or additional mitigation strategies, so that the community engagement requirements will not be impossible or unreasonably burdensome for beneficiaries to meet. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 19 of 229 k. Ensure that the state will assess whether people with disabilities have limited job or other opportunities for reasons related to their disabilities. If these barriers exist for people with disabilities, the state must address these barriers. l. Provide beneficiaries with written notice of the rights of people with disabilities to receive reasonable modifications related to meeting community engagement requirements. m. Maintain a mechanism that provides reasonable modifications related to meeting the community engagement requirement to beneficiaries with disabilities as defined in the ADA, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. VII. HIP POWER ACCOUNTS 1. General Description. The POWER A ccount is styled like a health savings account arrangement under a consumer -directed health plan. The POWER A ccount will hold state and beneficiary contributions (including beneficiary contributions donated by employers or other entities). T he POWER A ccou nt funds will be used to pay for the first $2,500 in claims; claims beyond the initial $2,500 will be fully covered through capitation payments or other payments made by the state. POWER A ccounts may not be used to pay for beneficiary copayments . A member will have one POWER Account established per calendar year . 2. Beneficiary and State Contributions. a. All HIP eligible beneficiaries will be eligible for HIP Plus. HIP Plus requires beneficiaries to make a monthly contribution to their POWER Accounts based upon their FPL, except for populations that are otherwise excluded from cost sharing requirements . b. Beneficiaries with income above 100 percent of the FPL will lose eligibility for HIP Plus if they fail to pay their monthly contributions within the 60 day grace period. At the end of the grace period, such beneficiaries who fail to pay the monthly contribution will be terminated from coverage after proper notice and subject to a 6 -month non- eligibility period , with the exception of those who are medically frail, or who fall under a designated \"qualifying events\" category, as discussed in STC 10(d) of this section. Individuals who do not pay their initial contribution and never fully enroll in HIP Plus are not subject to non- eligibility period for non- payment. Individuals subject to a non-eligibility period will not be able to reenroll until the end of the non- eligibility period; payment of unpaid debt shall not be a condition of re -enrollment at the end of th e non- eligibility period, but may be owed as a debt that the MCO can collect and does not affect prospective eligibility . c. Beneficiaries with income at or below 100 percent of the FPL . Beneficiaries with income at or below l00 percent of the FPL will lose HIP Plus copayment protection (and HIP Plus benefits for those in the new adult group) if they fail to pay Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 20 of 229 their monthly contributions within the 60- day grace period. Effective the first day following the expiration of the grace period, these beneficiaries will be automatically enrolled in HIP Basic, with no gap in coverage. In HIP Basic, the beneficiary would then be responsible for paying co-payments in accordance of amounts specified in the state plan, but not monthly POWER account contributions. The minimum monthly contribution a mount to access HIP Plus is one dollar per month. The beneficiary would have the option to resume making monthly POWER account contributions and enroll in HIP Plus during the annual redetermination process or upon receipt of rollover . The state may add additional times for movement from HIP Plus to HIP Basic at the state's discretion. d. Medically frail beneficiaries and section 1931 p arents and c aretaker r elatives will have the same cost sharing opportunity as described in subsection (b) or (c) above, to either make monthly POWER account contributions consistent with HIP Plus, or to transition to co- payments consistent with the HIP Basic plan. Medically frail beneficiaries above the 100 percent of the FPL who do not make monthly POWER account contributions shall have cost sharing described in STC 10(c) of this section. e. State Contributions. The state will annually contribute to the POWER account for each beneficiary an amount equal to the difference between the required beneficiary contribution and $2500. The state will make an initial $1300 POWER Account contribution promptly upon the benef iciary's full enrollment with the MCO. The MCO will be responsible for reimbursing providers up to the full $2500 amount regardless of the beneficiary's current POWER Account balance, as described in STC 5 of this section. Following the conclusion of the 12-month benefit period, the MCO and s tate shall reconcile the POWER A ccount. 3. Determination of Beneficiary Contribution Amounts . a. The household's POWER A ccount contributions will be calculated based upon a tiered contribution structure established by the state and described in Table 4. When added to other cost sharing incurred by the beneficiary or the beneficiary's family members, the household's out of pocket expenses shall not exceed five percent of a beneficiary's gross quarterly h ousehold income. Required beneficiary contributions will be reduced by the amounts of contributions made by third parties to the POWER Account on behalf of the beneficiary. Permissible contributions may be made by employers or other entities as indicated in STCs 8 and 9 of this section. b. In families with two enrolled spouses, each beneficiary will have their own POWER Account. However, the total of both beneficiaries' required POWER A ccount contributions cannot exceed the total POWER A ccount contribution for the two spouses determined by the state under the tiered structure and described in Table 4. c. The state shall notify beneficiaries of POWER A ccount payment requirements upon eligibility determination. The state shall determine the amount of a beneficiary's monthly contribution based on the modified adjusted gross income and will notify the Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 21 of 229 beneficiary and MCO of this amount. The MCO must bill for and collect this contribution amount from beneficiaries. Monthly invoices shall include information about how to report any change in income, shall inform individuals of the consequences of nonpayment (disenrollment from all coverage, or disenrollment from HIP Plus and default into HIP Basic) and that payment of a POWER A ccount contribution means an individual can now only change plans for cause and how enrollment broker can help. d. Beneficiaries enrolled in HIP Plus who are identified as tobacco users will have a tobacco user surcharge applied to their POWER Ac count contribution amount. This amount will be equal to a 50 percent increase in individual contribution amount. The MCO will identify tobacco users and apply the surcharge as a distinct line item separate from the regular POWER Account contribution amount in the monthly invoice. The tobacco surcharge will be waived for the first year of enrollment in order to provide the individual the opportunity to take advantage of the robust tobacco cessation benefits offered through HIP . During this 12 -month period, the MC Os will be required to conduct active outreach and member education related to the tobacco cessation benefits available through HIP . If after twelve months, the member continues to be a tobacco user, a tobacco user surcharge will be applied to their POWER Account contribution amount beginning in the first month of their renewed benefit period. If a beneficiary informs the state that he or she has stopped using tobacco , the tobacco user surcharge will be removed from the following benefit year's contribution amount. T he application of the tobacco user surcharge will be appealable for a beneficiary who disagrees with the application of the surcharge. e. Beneficiaries enrolled in HIP Plus will contribute to the POWER Account according to their incom e tier as described in Table 4. Table 4. POWER Account Tier Amounts FPL Monthly PAC Single Individual Monthly PAC Spouses (each) PAC with Tobacco Surcharge (Individual) Spouse PAC when one has tobacco surcharge Spouse PAC when both have tobacco surcharge (each) Up to and including 22% of the FPL $1.00 $1.00 $1.50 $1.00 & $1.50 $1.50 Above 22% of the FPL & up to and including 50% of the FPL $5.00 $2.50 $7.50 $2.50 & $3.75 $3.75 Above 50% of the FPL & up to and including 75% of the FPL $10.00 $5.00 $15.00 $5.00 & $7.50 $7.50 Above 75% including $15.00 $7.50 $22.50 $7.50 & $11.25 $11.25 Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 22 of 229 100% of the FPL Above 100% of the FPL and up to and including 133% of the FPL $20.00 $10.00 $30.00 $10.00 & $15.00 $15.00 f. The state allows for a ten dollar ($10.00) initial fast track POWER Account payment that makes available immediate enrollment into HIP Plus effective the first date of the month in the month in which payment is received, once an individual has been determined eligib le. This option is available via both fast track invoicing from the member's managed care plan and via the application. Individuals completing the application will have an option to select fast track and make a payment directly to the plan to lock in the ir eligibility start date to the 1st of the month of application, provided they are determined eligible. The fast track invoice option will be available only to individuals who through an initial screening process are not found to be pregnant, below age of 19, receiving Social Security Income (SSI), or potentially disabled. The initial fast track payment must be paid within 60 calendar days from the date of invoice to allow enrollment into HIP Plus (effective the first date of the month in the month in which payment is received, once the eligibility has been determined. For individuals initially screened eligible for HIP, the invoice shall be dated no later than five business days after the date of application. Both the application and the fast track payment invoice must include a notice explaining that the individual has not yet been determined eligible for HIP benefits, and that the payment is optional and does not guarantee eligibility. g. The initial fast track invoice shall notify potentially e ligible members that the fast track payment is an optional payment that is fully refundable if the individual is determined not to be eligible for HIP. The initial fast track payment is the minimum amount required to obtain HIP Plus benefits, however, the member will remain responsible for the full amount of the POWER Account contribution during the first month of coverage and any such amount not covered by the fast track payment will be included on the subsequent month POWER Account invoice. If the membe r's POWER Account contribution is less than the fast track pre -payment, the MCO shall credit the fast track payment against the member's required POWER Account contributions. Further, the initial fast track invoice must also include a prominent notice sta ting in substance that the individual has the right to select another MCO only before the fast track payment is made. h. The state shall continue the fast-track prepayment process as documented in the operational protocol. i. Account contributions by beneficiaries will be made through payments to the MCO in which the beneficiary is enrolled. Further details of how such payments can be made to an MCO are provided in the operational protocol. 4. Grace Period/Payment Period . Applicants and beneficiaries wil l have 60 days Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 23 of 229 from the date of the payment invoice to make the required monthly contribution. 5. Recalculation of Beneficiary POWER Account Contribution Amount. At annual redetermination or anytime the state is made aware that the beneficiary's income has changed during the current coverage term, the state shall determine whether an adjustment to the beneficiary's POWER A ccount contribution is necessary. During the current coverage term or changes of income at redetermination, recalculated POWER Account c ontributions are effective the first of the month following the recalculation. Any overpayments made by the member reduce the next month(s) contribution. 6. Medicaid Transitions. For members transitioning to HIP from other Medicaid categories , including pregnant women in HIP exiting their postpartum period, individuals making such a transition will be immediately enrolled in the HIP Basic plan with a 60 - day opport unity to make an initial POWER A ccount contribution to move to HIP Plus. 7. Power Account Operations. The s tate will continue to operate in compliance with the approved POWER Account Contributions and Copayment Infrastructure Operational Protocol . Any changes to the operations of the POWER Account will be amended in the protocols and submitted to CMS. 8. Employer Contributions . Employers are permitted and encouraged to contribute to their employees' POWER accounts. A n employer's contribution must be used to offset the beneficiary's required contribution only \u2014not the state's \u2014and thus may not be greater than the beneficiar y's expected annual contribution amount . 9. Contributions from other third parties. Third parties are permitted to contribute to a beneficiary's POWER account contribution. There are no limits on the amounts third parties can contribute to an beneficiary's POWER account except that the contribution must be used to offset the beneficiary's required contribution only \u2014not the state's contribution. Health care provider or provider -related entities making contributions on individuals' behalf must have criteria for providing assistance that do not distinguish between individuals based on whether or not they receive or will receive services from the contributing provider(s) or class of providers. Providers may not include the cost of such payments in the cost of care for purposes of Medicare and Medicaid cost reporting and cannot be included as part of a Medicaid shortfall or uncompensated care for any purpose. 10. Non-Payment of Month ly POWER Account Contribution. a. Beneficiaries Eligible for HIP Plus . If a beneficiary with income above 100 percent of the FPL does not make a required monthly contribution within the grace period, the beneficiary will be disenrolled and subjected to a si x month non- eligibility period, unless the beneficiary lost coverage due to a \"qualifying event\" as described below. Any debt accrued, may be owed to the health plan in which the individual was previously enrolled, but will not prevent re -entry into HIP.

Beneficiaries with income at or below 100 percent of the FP L have the opportunity to participate in the HIP Plus plan, if they make required monthly POWER account contribution. However, if such beneficiary does not pay required monthly POWER account within the grace period, they will be automatically defaulted to the HIP Basic Plan with no gap in coverage or non- eligibility period. Beneficiaries will continue to maintain a POWER account. c. Medically Frail and 1931 Parents and Caregivers.

Education on benefits of medication assisted treatment and referral to treatment as necessary. 3. SUD Implementation Plan Protocol. The state must submit an SUD Implementation Protocol within 90 calendar days after approval of the OUD/SUD program under this demonstration. The state may not claim FFP for services provided in I MDs until CMS has approved the Implementation Protocol. Once approved, the Implementation Protocol will Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 32 of 229 be incorporated into the STCs, as Attachment D , and once incorporated, may be altered only with CMS approval. After approval of the implementation protocol, FFP will be available prospectively, not retrospectively. Failure to submit an Implementation Protocol or failure to obtain such CMS approval will be considered a material failure to comply with the terms of the demonstration project as described i n 42 CFR 431.420(d) and, as such, would be grounds for termination or suspension of the SUD program under this demonstration. Failure to progress in meeting the milestone goals agreed upon by the state and CMS will result in a funding deferral. At a min imum, the SUD Implementation Protocol will describe the strategic approach and detailed project implementation plan, including timetables and programmatic content where applicable, for meeting the following milestones which reflect the key goals and objectives of this SUD demonstration project: a. Access to Critical Levels of Care for SUDs: Service delivery for new benefits, including residential treatment, withdrawal management, opioid treatment program and addiction recovery and management services within 12- 24 months of OUD/SUD program demonstration approval; b. Use of Evidence- based SUD -specific Patient Placement Criteria: Establishment of a requirement that MCOs and providers assess treatment needs based on SUD - specific, multidimensional assessment tools, such as the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Criteria or other patient placement assessment tools that reflect evidence- based clinical treatment guidelines within 12 -24 months of OUD/SUD program demonstration approval; c. Patient Placement: Establishment of a utilization management approach such that beneficiaries have access t o SUD services at the appropriate level of care and that the interventions are appropriate for the diagnosis and level of care, including an independent process for reviewing placement in residential treatment settings within 12-24 months of OUD/SUD demons tration approval; d. Use of Nationally Recognized SUD -specific Program Standards for Residential Treatment: Currently, residential treatment service providers must be certified by the Indiana Department of Mental Health and Addiction. The state will establis h residential treatment provider qualifications in licensure, policy or provider manuals, managed care contracts or credentialing, or other requirements or guidance that meet program standards in the ASAM Criteria or other comparable, nationally recognized , SUD- specific program standards regarding in particular the types of services, hours of clinical care, and credentials of staff for residential treatment settings within 12 -24 months of OUD/SUD demonstration approval; e. Standards of Care: Establishment of a provider review process to ensure that residential treatment providers deliver care consistent with the specifications in the ASAM Criteria or other comparable, nationally recognized SUD program standards based on evidence -based clinical treatment guide lines for types of services, hours of Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 33 of 229 clinical care, and credentials of staff for residential treatment settings within 12 -24 months of OUD/SUD demonstration approval; f. Standards of Care: Establishment of a requirement that residential treatment providers offer MAT on -site or facilitate access to MAT off -site within 12 -24 months of OUD/SUD demonstration approval; g. Sufficient Provider Capacity at Critical Levels of Care including MAT: An assessment of the availability of providers in the key levels of care t hroughout the state, or in the regions of the state participating under this demonstration including those that offer MAT, within twelve months of OUD/SUD demonstration approval; h. Implementation of Comprehensive Strategies to Address Prescription Drug Abuse and OUD: Implementation of opioid prescribing guidelines along with other interventions to prevent prescription drug abuse and expand access to naloxone; i. SUD Health IT Plan: Implementation of the milestones and metrics as detailed in STC 10 of thi s section ; and j. Improved Care Coordination and Transitions: Establishment of policies to ensure residential and inpatient facilities link beneficiaries with community -based services and supports following stays in these residential and inpatient facilities within 24 months of OUD/SUD demonstration approval. 4. SUD Monitoring Protocol. The state must submit an SUD Monitoring Plan Protocol within 150 calendar days after approval of the OUD/SUD program under this demonstration. The SUD Monitoring Protocol must be developed in cooperation with CMS and is subject to CMS approval. Once approved, the SUD Monitoring Protocol will be incorporated into the STCs as Attachment E . At a minimum, the SUD Monitoring Protocol will include reporting r elevant to each of the program implementation areas listed in STC 3 of this section. The protocol will also describe the data collection, reporting and analytic methodologies for performance measures identified by the state and CMS for inclusion. The SUD Monitoring Protocol will specify the methods of data collection and timeframes for reporting on the state's progress on required measures as part of the general reporting requirements described in Section XIII of the demonstration. In addition, for each performance measure, the SUD Monitoring Protocol will identify a baseline, a target to be achieved by the end of the demonstration and an annual goal for closing the gap between baseline and target expressed as percentage points. Where possible, baselines will be informed by state data, and targets will be benchmarked against performance in best practice settings. CMS will closely monitor demonstration spending on services in IMDs to ensure adherence to budget neutrality requirements. 5. Mid-Point Assessment. The state must conduct an independent mid- point assessment between DYs 5 and 6 of the demonstration. The assessor must collaborate with key stakeholders, including representatives of MCOs, SUD treatment providers, beneficiaries, and other key part ners in the design, planning and conducting of the mid-Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 34 of 229 point assessment. The assessment will include an examination of progress toward meeting each milestone and timeframe approved in the SUD Implementation Protocol, and toward closing the gap between bas eline and target each year in performance measures as approved in the SUD Monitoring Protocol. The assessment will also include a determination of factors that affected achievement on the milestones and performance measure gap closure percentage points to date, and a determination of selected factors likely to affect future performance in meeting milestones and targets not yet met and about the risk of possibly missing those milestones and performance targets. The mid -point assessment will also provide a status update of budget neutrality requirements. For each milestone or measure target at medium to high risk of not being met, the assessor will provide for consideration by the state, recommendations for adjustments in the state's implementation plan or to pertinent factors that the state can influence that will support improvement. The assessor will provide a report to the state that includes the methodologies used for examining progress and assessing risk, the limitations of the methodologies, its dete rminations and any recommendations. A copy of the report will be provided to CMS. CMS will be briefed on the report. For milestones and measure targets at medium to high risk of not being achieved, the state will submit to CMS modifications to the SUD Implementation and SUD Monitoring Protocols for ameliorating these risks subject to CMS approval. 6. Deferral for Insufficient Progress Toward Milestones and Failure to Report Measurement Data. If the state does not demonstrate sufficient progress on milestones, as specified in the SUD Implementation Protocol, as determined by CMS, or fails to report data as approved in the SUD Monitoring Protocol, CMS will defer funds in the amounts specified in Section XI II STC 1 for each incident of insufficient progress or failure to report in each reporting quarter. 7. Deferral of Federal Financial Participation (FFP) from IMD claiming for Insufficient Progress Toward Milestones. Up to $5 million in FFP for ser vices in IMDs may be deferred if the state is not making adequate progress on meeting the milestones and goals as evidenced by report ing on the milestones in Table 6 and the required performance measures in the monitoring protocol agreed upon by the state and CMS. Once CMS determines the state has not made adequate progress, up to $5 million will be deferred in the next calendar quarter and each calendar quarter thereafter until CMS has determined sufficient progress has been made. 8. SUD Evaluation. The SUD Evaluation will be subject to the same terms as the overall demonstration evaluation, as listed in in the General Reporting Requirements and Evaluation of the Demonstration of the STCs. 9. SUD Evaluation Design. The state must submit, for CMS comment a nd approval, an updated Evaluation Design with implementation timeline, no l ater than 180 days after the effective date of these STCs. Failure to submit an acceptable and timely evaluation design along with any required monitoring, expenditure, or other e valuation reporting will subject the state to a $5 million deferral. The state must use an independent evaluator to design the evaluation. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 35 of 229 a. Evaluation Design Approval and Updates. The state must submit a revised draft Evaluation Design within 60 days after receipt of CMS' comments. Upon CMS approval of the draft Evaluation Design, the document will be included as an attachment to these STCs. Per 42 CFR 431.424(c), the state will publish the approved Evaluation Design within thirty (30) days of CMS approval. The state must implement the evaluation design and submit a description of its evaluation implementation progress in each of the Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports, including any required Rapid Cycle Assessments specified in these STCs. b. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses. The state must follow the general evaluation questions and hypotheses requirements as specified in Section XVI STC 5. In addition, hypotheses for the SUD program should include an assessment of the objectives of the S UD component of this section 1115 demonstration, to include (but is not limited to): initiation and compliance with treatment, utilization of health services (emergency department and inpatient hospital settings), and a reduction in key outcomes such as de aths due to overdose. 10. SUD Health Information Technology (Health IT). The state will provide CMS with an assurance that it has a sufficient health IT infrastructure/\"ecosystem\" at every appropriate level (i.e. state, delivery system, health plan/MCO and individual provider) to achieve the goals of the demonstration \u2014or it will submit to CMS a plan to develop the infrastructure/capabilities. This \"SUD Health IT Plan,\" or assurance, will be included as a section of the state's Implementation Protocol (see STC 3 of this section ) to be approved by CMS. The SUD Health IT Plan wil l detail the necessary health IT capabilities in place to support beneficiary health outcomes to address the SUD goals of the demonstration. The plan will also be used to identify areas of SUD health IT ecosystem improvement. a. The SUD Health IT section of the Implementation Protocol will include implementation milestones and dates for achieving them (see Attachment D). b. The SUD Health IT Plan must be aligned with the state's broader State Medicaid Health IT Plan (SMHP) and, if applicable, the state's Behav ioral Health (BH) \"Health IT\" Plan. c. The SUD Health IT Plan will describe the state's goals, each DY, to enhance the state's prescription drug monitoring program's (PDMP) .1 d. The SUD Health IT Plan will address how the state's PDMP will enhance ease of use for prescribers and other state and federal stakeholders .2 This will also include plans to include PDMP interoperability with a statewide, regional or local Health 1 Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP) are electronic databases that track controlled substance prescriptions in states. PDMPs can provide health authorities timely information about prescribing and patient behaviors that contribute to the \"opioid\" epidemic and facilitate a nimble and targeted response. 2 Ibid. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 36 of 229 Information Exchange. Additionally, the SUD Health IT Plan will describe ways in which the state will support clinicians in consulting the PDMP prior to prescribing a controlled substance \u2014and reviewing the patients' history of controlled substance prescriptions \u2014prior to the issuance of a Controlled Substance Schedule II (CSII) opioid prescript ion. e. The SUD Health IT Plan will, as applicable, describe the state's capabilities to leverage a master patient index (or master data management service, etc.) in support of SUD care delivery. Additionally, the SUD Health IT Plan must describe current and future capabilities regarding PDMP queries \u2014and the state's ability to properly match patients receiving opioid prescriptions with patients in the PDMP. The state will also indicate current efforts or plans to develop and/or utilize current patient index capability that supports the programmatic objectives of the demonstration. f. The SUD Health IT Plan will describe how the activities described in (a) through (e) above will: (a) support broader state and federal efforts to diminish the likelihood of long-term opioid use directly correlated to clinician prescribing patterns3 and (b) ensure that Medicaid does not inappropriately pay for opioids -and that states implement effective controls to minimize the risk. g. In developing the Health IT Plan, states shall use the following resources. i. States may use resources at Health IT.Gov (https://www.healthit.gov/playbook/opioid- epidemic -and-health -it/) in \"Section 4: Opioid Epidemic and Health IT.\" ii. States may also use the CMS 1115 Health IT resources available on \"Medicaid Program Alignment with State Systems to Advance HIT, HIE and Interoperability\" at https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data -and- systems/hie/index.html. States should review the \"1115 Health IT Toolkit\" for health IT considerations in conducting an a ssessment and developing their Health IT Plans. iii. States may request from CMS technical assistance to conduct an assessment and develop plans to ensure they have the specific health IT infrastructure with regards to PDMP plans and, more generally, to meet t he goals of the demonstration. h.

B. Establishment of an oversight and auditing process that includes unannounced visits for ensuring participating psychiatric hospitals meet state licensure or certification requirements as well as a national accrediting entity's accreditation requirements; C. Use of a utilization review entity (for example, a managed care organization or administrative service organization) to ensure beneficiaries hav e access to the appropriate levels and types of care and to provide oversight to ensure lengths of stay are limited to what is medically necessary and only those who have a clinical need to receive treatment in psychiatric hospitals are receiving treatment in those facilities; D. Establishment of a process for ensuring that participating psychiatric hospitals meet federal program integrity requirements and establishment of a state process to conduct risk- based screening of all newly enrolling providers, as wel l as revalidating existing providers (specifically, under existing regulations, the state must screen all newly enrolling providers and reevaluate existing providers pursuant to the rules in 42 CFR Part 455 Subparts B and E, ensure treatment providers have entered into Medicaid provider agreements pursuant to 42 CFR 431.407, and establish rigorous program integrity protocols to safeguard against fraudulent billing and other compliance issues); E. Implementation of a state requirement that participating psychia tric hospitals screen enrollees for co -morbid physical health conditions and substance use disorders (SUDs) and demonstrate the capacity to address co -morbid physical health conditions during short -term stays in inpatient treatment settings (e.g., with on- site staff, telemedicine, and/or partnerships with local physical health providers). ii. Improving Care Coordination and Transitions to Community- Based Care. A. Implementation of a process to ensure that psychiatric hospitals provide intensive pre -discharge, care coordination services to help beneficiaries transition out of those settings into appropriate community -based outpatient services, including requirements that community -based providers participate in transition efforts (e.g., by allowing initial serv ices with a community -based provider while a beneficiary is still residing in these settings and/or by hiring peer support specialists to help beneficiaries make connections with available community -based providers, including, where applicable, plans for employment); B. Implementation of a process to assess the housing situation of a beneficiary transitioning to the community from psychiatric hospitals and to connect beneficiaries who are homeless or who have unsuitable or unstable housing with community provi ders that coordinate housing services, where available; C. Implementation of a requirement that psychiatric hospitals have protocols in place to ensure contact is made by the treatment setting with each discharged beneficiary within 72 hours of discharge and to ensure follow -up care is accessed by individuals after leaving those facilities by contacting the Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 41 of 229 individuals directly and by contacting the community -based provider they were referred to; D. Implementation of strategies to prevent or decrease the length o f stay in emergency departments among beneficiaries with SMI/SED or SED (e.g., through the use of peers and psychiatric consultants in EDs to help with discharge and referral to treatment providers); E. Implementation of strategies to develop and enhance inte roperability and data sharing between physical, SUD, and mental health providers, with the goal of enhancing coordination so that disparate providers may better share clinical information to improve health outcomes for beneficiaries with SMI/SED or SED. iii. Increasing Access to Continuum of Care Including Crisis Stabilization Services. A. Establishment of a process to annually assess the availability of mental health services throughout the state , particularly crisis stabilization services, and updates on steps taken to increase availability; B. Commitment to implementation of the SMI/SED financing plan described in STC 2(e) of this section ; C. Implementation of strategies to improve the state's capacity to track the availability of inpatient and crisis stabiliza tion beds to help connect individuals in need with that level of care as soon as possible; D. Implementation of a requirement that providers, plans, and utilization review entities use an evidence- based, publicly available patient assessment tool, preferably endorsed by a mental health provider association (e.g., LOCUS or CASII) to determine appropriate level of care and length of stay. iv. Earlier Identification and Engagement in Treatment Including Through Increased Integration A. Implementation of strategies f or identifying and engaging individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults, with SMI/SED in treatment sooner, including through supported employment and supported education programs; B. Increasing integration of behavioral health care in non- specialty care settings, including schools and primary care practices, to improve identification of SMI/SED conditions sooner and improve awareness of and linkages to specialty treatment providers; C. Establishment of specialized settings and services, including crisis stabilization services, focused on the needs of young people experiencing SMI/SED or SED. d. SMI/SED Health IT Plan . Implementation of the milestones and metrics as detailed in Attachment H . e. SMI/SED Financing Plan. As part of the SMI/SED implementation plan referred to in STC2 of this section , the state must submit, within 90 calendar days after approval of the demonstration, a financing plan that will be approved by CMS. Once approved, the SMI/SED Financing Plan will be incorporated int o the STCs as part of the SMI/SED Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 42 of 229 Implementation P lan in A ttachment G and, once incorporated, may only be altered with CMS approval. Failure to submit an SMI/SED Financing Plan will be considered a material failure to comply with the terms of the demonstr ation project as described in 42 CFR 431.420(d) and, as such, would be grounds for termination or suspension of the SMI/SED program under this demonstration. Components of the financing plan must include: i. A plan to increase the availability of non -hospita l, non- residential crisis stabilization services, including but not limited to the following: services made available through crisis call centers, mobile crisis units, coordinated community response services that includes law enforcement and other first responders, and observation/assessment centers; and ii. A plan to increase availability of ongoing community -based services such as intensive outpatient services, assertive community treatment, and services delivered in integrated care settings; iii. A plan to ensur e the on -going maintenance of effort (MOE) on funding outpatient community -based services to ensure that resources are not disproportionately drawn into increasing access to treatment in inpatient and residential settings at the expense of community -based services. 3. SMI/SED Monitoring Protocol(s). The state must submit a Monitoring Protocol for the SMI/SED program authorized by this demonstration within 150 calendar days after approval of the implementation plan. The Monitoring Protocol Template must be developed in cooperation with CMS and is subject to CMS approval.

Once approved, the SMI/SED Monitoring Protocol will be incorporated into the STCs, as Attachment H . Progress on the performance measures identified in the SMI/SED Monitoring Protocol must be reported via the quarterly and annual monitoring reports. Components of the SMI/SED Monitoring Protocol include : a. An assurance of the state 's commitment and ability to report information relevant to each of the program implementat ion areas listed in STC 2 of this section reporting relevant information to the state 's SMI/SED financing plan described in A ttachment G , and reporting relevant information to the state 's Health IT plans described in STC 2(d) of this section ; b. A description of the methods of data collection and timeframes for reporting on the state's progress on required measures as part of the general reporting requirements described in Section X III of the demonstration; and c. A description of baselines and targets to be achi eved by the end of the demonstration. Where possible, baselines will be informed by state data, and targets will be benchmarked against performance in best practice settings. 4. Evaluation. The SMI/SED Evaluation will be subject to the same requirements as the overall demonstration evaluation, as described in Sections XIII (General Reporting Requirements) and XVI (Evaluation of the Demonstration) of these STCs. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 43 of 229 5. Availability of FFP for the SMI/SED Serv ices under the SMI/SED IMD expenditure authority . FFP is only available for services provided to beneficiaries during short term stays for acute care in IMDs. The state may claim FFP for stays up to 60 days as long as it shows at its midpoint assessment that it is meeting the requirement of a 30 day or less average length of stay (ALOS). Stays in IMDs that exceed 60 days are not eligible for FFP under this demonstration. If the state cannot show that it is meeting the 30 day or less ALOS requirement wit hin one standard deviation at the mid- point assessment, the state may only claim FFP for stays up to 45 days until such time that the state can demonstrate that it is meeting the 30 day or less ALOS requirement. The state assures that it will provide cove rage for stays that exceed 60 days \u2014or 45 days, as relevant \u2014with other sources of funding if it is determined that a longer length of stay is medically necessary for an individual beneficiary. 6. SMI/SED Mid -Point Assessment. The state must conduct an indepe ndent mid- point assessment by December 31, 2022. In the design, planning and conduction of the mid- point assessment, the state must require that the independent assessor consult with key stakeholders including, but not limited to: representatives of manag ed care organizations (MCO), SMI/SED providers, beneficiaries, and other key partners. The state must require that the assessor provide a report to the state that includes the methodologies used for examining progress and assessing risk, the limitations of the methodologies, its determinations and any recommendations. The state must provide a copy of the report to CMS no later than 60 days after December 31, 2022. The state must brief CMS on the report. For milestones and measure targets at medium to high risk of not being achieved, the state must submit to CMS modifications to the SMI/SED Implementation Plan, the SMI/SED Financing Plan, and the SMI/SED Monitoring Protocol for ameliorating these risks. Modifications to the applicable Implementation, Financing, and Monitoring Protocol are subject to CMS approval. Elements of the mid -point assessment include: a. An examination of progress toward meeting each milestone and timeframe approved in the SMI/SED , the SMI/SED Financing Plan, and toward meeting the targets for performance measures as approved in the SMI/SED Monitoring Protocol; b. A determination of factors that affected achievement on the milestones and performance measure gap closure percentage points to date; c. A determination of selected factors likely to affect future performance in meeting milestones and targets not yet met and information about the risk of possibly missing those milestones and performance targets; d. For milestones or targets at medium to high risk of not being met, recommendations for adjustments in the state 's SMI/SED or SMI/SED Financing Plan or to pertinent factors that the state can influence that will support improvement; and e.

Costs for services provided to individuals who are involuntarily residing in a psychiatric hospital or residential treatment facility by operation of criminal law. d. Costs for services provided to beneficiaries under age 21 residing in an IMD unless the IMD meets the requirements for the \"inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21\" benefit under 42 CFR 440.160, 441 Subpart D, and 483 Subpart G. 8. Updated SMI Deliverable. Within 60 days of approval, the st ate must submit an updated current assessment of mental health services that includes the geographical break -down of the availability of all services following the CMS template , to replace the existing assessment . The state submitted a current assessment of mental health services as part of its amendment application and used the draft template available at the time. Since the state's amendment submission, CMS has published an updated template on Medicaid.gov that states are to follow that Indiana did not have access to so CMS is providing Indiana 60 additional days to submit the updated template. XII. DELIVERY SYSTEM 1. Managed Care Requirements. The state must comply with the managed care regulations published at 42 CFR 438. Capitation rates shall be developed and certified as actuarially sound, in accordance with 42 CFR 438.4 through 438.8. 2. Public Contracts. Payments under contracts with public agencies, that are not competitively bid in a process involving multiple bidders, shall not exceed the documented costs incurred in furnishing covered services to eligible individuals (or a reasonable estimate with an adjustment factor no greater than the annual change in the consumer price index). 3. Network Requirements. The state must deliver all covered benefits, ensuring high quality care. Services must be delivered in a culturally competent manner, and the MCO network must be sufficient to provide access to covered services. In addition, the MCO must coordinate healt h care services for demonstration populations. The following requirements must be included in the state's MCO contracts: a. Special Health Care Needs . Beneficiaries with special health care needs Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 45 of 229 must have direct access to a specialist, as appropriate for the individual's health care condition, as specified in 42 CFR 438.208(c)(4). b. Out of Network Requirements . The state, through its contracts with the HIP MCOs, will require the MCOs to provide out of network benefits in the following situations: i. Each MCO must allow access to non-network providers, when services cannot be provided consistent with the timeliness standards required by the state. ii. During the transition of beneficiaries into HIP MCOs, for any provider seen by the beneficiary during the month i n which enrollment is effectuated, MCOs will honor previous care authorizations for a minimum of 30 calendar days from the member's date of enrollment with the MCO, or date the member paid their contribution (whichever is later) even on a non- network basis. 4. HIP Managed Care Organizations (MCO). HIP beneficiaries shall be enrolled to receive service through an MCO under contract to the state , as provided under the state plan . The MCOs are subject to the federal laws and regulations in 42 CFR Part 438. The HIP beneficiary will be given an opportunity to select an MCO at the time of application. A HIP beneficiary who does not make an MCO selection at the time of application may be auto -assigned to a HIP MCO by the state. Except in cases of presumptive eligibility, auto -assignment may occur after the date in which the state determined their eligibility. The state may adjust the auto -assignment methodology. In addition to the criteria identified in 42 CFR 438.54, t he state may consider assignment to the lowest -cost MCO, or to the MCOs that demonstrate higher quality scores or better health outcomes, or to MCOs on a rotating basis. Any change to the auto-assignment methodology m ust be approved by CMS before implementation. Beneficiaries will be advised both at the time of application, and upon receiving an initial invoice, of the auto -assignment and their right to change MCOs prior to the first POWER account contribution payment . The notice to beneficiaries shall include information on the process to change MCOs. 5. MCO Information and Selection. The state shall contract with an enrollment broker to assist interested applicants with their MCO selection so they can make an informed decision in compliance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7438.810 . The enrollment broker will provide the applicant with appropriate counseling on the full spectrum of available MCO choices and will address any questions the applicant may have. Once an MCO has been selected and after the beneficiary has made either their fast track payment or first POWER account contribution, or has begun coverage in HIP Basic after non- payment, the beneficiary is required to remain in that MCO for twelve months, with exceptions specified in STC 6 of this section. 6. Beneficiary's Right to Change MCOs. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 46 of 229 a. A beneficiary will be automatically re- enrolled into the beneficiary's prior MCO, even if the beneficiary disenrolls and re -enrolls in HIP coverage during the 12- month benefit year. b. A beneficiary may change HIP MCOs without cause if the change is requested prior to (i) the date the beneficiary pays their initial POWER account contribution or fast track POWER account prepayment, or (ii) has defaulted into HIP Basic for non- payment of fast -track prepayment or POWER Account contribution whichever comes first. Beneficiaries may seek assistance from the enrollment broker in choosing an MCO. Disenrollment without cause for the reasons identified in 42 CFR 438.56(c)(2)(ii), (iii) and (iv) will also be permitted. c. Each November 1 - December 15th, beneficiaries will have the opportunity to select their MC O for the coming benefit period. Prior to the open selection period, beneficiaries will be reminded of their ability to select a new MC O. Beneficiaries may make a selection by contacting the enrollment broker. d. For Cause. A beneficiary may change MCOs fo r cause at any time and will include this information in all communications about POWER account contributions. \"Cause\" is defined in 42 CFR 438.56(d)(2). Other reasons as described in 42 CFR 438.56(d)(2)(v), includes, but is not limited to, the following: i. Receiving poor quality care; ii. Failure of the Insurer to provide covered services; iii. Failure of the Insurer to comply with established standards of medical care administration; iv. Lack of access to providers experienced in dealing with the enrollee's health care needs; v. Significant language or cultural barriers; vi. Corrective Action levied against the Insurer by the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA); vii. Limited access to a primary care clinic or other health services within reasonable proximity to a beneficiary's residence; viii. A determination that another MCO's formulary is more consistent with a new beneficiary's existing health care needs; or ix. Other circumstances determined by FSSA or its designee to constitute poor quality of health care coverage Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 47 of 229 x. If a beneficiary was unable to participate in MC O selection period for a qualified reason, they may change their MC O during the f irst 60 days of the new benefit period or within 60 days of transfer into HIP . Qualified reason for being unable to participate in the MCO selection period include: Mem ber transitioned from other Indiana health care program to HIP. Member was in a non- eligibility period during MC O selection, and returned to the program via a reauthorized case. Member w as not fully eligible during MC O selection time. xi. The beneficiary must submit his or her request for change to the enrollment broker either orally or in writing. The beneficiary shall still have access to the grievance and appeals process required under the managed care regulations. e. If a beneficiary misses the MCO selection period due to temporary loss of eligibility, and then reenrolls in the subsequent benefit year, the beneficiary would be able to change plans when they reenroll. f. If the state f ails to make a determination by the first day of the second month following the month in which the beneficiary files the request, the request for change will be considered approved and the beneficiary will be transferred into the new MCO. g. If a beneficiary is transferred from the MCO, the MCO , must return the remaining balance of the individual's POWER account to the state within 120 days of the last date of participation with the MCO. The state shall then provide the entire remaining POWER account balance to the new MCO with the information needed to properly track the individual's contribution. h. The state shall ensure that all transferring individuals receive coverage from their new MCO promptly, without any interruption in care. 7. Withhold and Incentive Payments. Any capitation withhold arrangements or incentive payments, to MCOs under 42 CFR 438.6( b) shall only be based on quality measures or demonstrated improved healt h outcomes . XIII. GENERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 1. Deferral for Failure to Submit Timely Demonstration Deliverables. CMS may issue deferrals in the amount of $5,000,000 (federal share) when items required by these STCs (e.g., required data elements, analyses, reports, design documents, presentations, and other items s pecified in these STCs (hereafter singly or collectively referred to as Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 48 of 229 \"deliverable(s)\") are not submitted timely to CMS or found to not be consistent with the requirements approved by CMS. Specifically: a. Thirty (30) days after the deliverable was due, C MS will issue a written notification to the state providing advance notification of a pending deferral for late or non- compliant submissions of required deliverables. b. For each deliverable, the state may submit a written request for an extension to submit the required deliverable. Extension requests that extend beyond the fiscal quarter in which the deliverable was due must include a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). i. CMS may decline the extension request. ii. Should CMS agree in writing to the state's request, a c orresponding extension of the deferral process described below can be provided. iii. If the state's request for an extension includes a CAP, CMS may agree to or further negotiate the CAP as an interim step before applying the deferral. c. The deferral would be issued against the next quarterly expenditure report following the written deferral notification. d. When the state submits the overdue deliverable(s) that are accepted by CMS, the deferral(s) will be released. e. As the purpose of a section 1115 demonstration is to test new methods of operation or services, and timely and complete submission of required deliverables is necessary for effective testing, a state's failure to submit all required deliverables may preclu de a state from renewing a demonstration or obtaining a new demonstration. f. CMS will consider with the state an alternative set of operational steps for implementing the intended deferral to align the process with the state's existing deferral process, for example which quarter the deferral applies to, and how the deferral is released. 2. Submission of Post -Approval Deliverables. The state will submit all deliverables using the process stipulated by CMS and within the timeframes outlined within these STCs. 3. General Financial Requirements. The state must comply with all general financial requirements under Title XIX outlined in Section XI V of these STCs. 4. Reporting Requirements Related to Budget Neutrality. The state shall comply with all reporting requirements for monitoring budget neutrality set forth in Section X V of these STCs. 5. Periodic Monitoring Calls. CMS will convene periodic conference calls with the state. The purpose of these calls is to discuss ongoing demonstration operation, to include (but not limited to) any significant actual or anticipated developments affecting the demonstration; including planning for future changes in the program or intent to further Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 49 of 229 the HIP demonstration beyond December 31, 2020. CMS will provide updates on any pending actions, as well as federal policies and issues that may affect any aspect of the demonstration. The s tate and CMS will jointly develop the agenda for the calls. 6. Monitoring Reports. The state must submit three Quarterly Reports and one compiled Annual Report each DY. The information for the fourth quarterly report should be reported as distinct informa tion within the Annual Report. The Quarterly Reports are due no later than sixty days following the end of each demonstration quarter. The compiled Annual Report is due no later than ninety days following the end of the DY. The reports will include all required elements as per 42 CFR 431.428, and should not direct readers to links outside the report. Additional links not referenced in the document may be listed in a Reference/Bibliography section. The Monitoring Reports must follow the framework provided by CMS, which is subject to change as monitoring systems are developed/evolve, and be provided in a structured manner that supports federal tracking and analysis. a. Operational Updates - Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document any policy or administrative difficulties in operating the demonstration. The reports shall provide sufficient information to document key challenges, underlying causes of challenges, how challenges are being addressed, as well as key achievements and to what conditions and efforts successes can be attributed. The discussion should also include any issues or complaints identified by beneficiaries; lawsuits or legal actions; unusual or unanticipate d trends; legislative updates; and descriptions of any public forums held. The Monitoring Report should also include a summary of all public comments received through post -award public forums regarding the progress of the demonstration. b. Performance Met rics - Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document the impact of the demonstration in providing insurance coverage to beneficiaries and the uninsured population, as well as outcomes of care, quality and cost of care, and access to care. This may also include the results of beneficiary satisfaction surveys, if conducted, grievances and appeals. The required monitoring and performance metrics must be included in writing in the Monitoring Reports, and will follow the framework provided by CMS to support federal tracking and analysis. c. Budget Neutrality and Financial Reporting Requirements - Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document the financial performance of the demonstration. The state must provide an updated budget neutrality workbook with every Monitoring Report that includes established baseline and member months data with every Monitoring Report. The budget neutrality workbook will meet all the reporting requirements for monitoring budget neutrality set forth in the General Financial Requirements section of these STCs, including the submission of corrected budget neutrality data upon request. In addition, the state must report quarterly and annual expenditures associated with the populations affected by this demonstration on the Form CMS -64. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 50 of 229 Administrative costs should be reported separately. d. Evaluation Activities and Interim Findings . Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document any results of the demonstration to date per the evaluation hypotheses. Additionally, the state shall include a summary of the progress of evaluation activities, including key milestones accomplished, as well as challenges encountered and how they were addressed. 7. Cooperation with Federal Evaluators. As required under 42 CFR 431.420(f), the state shall cooperate fully and timely with CMS and its contractors in any federal evaluation of the demonstration or any component of the demonstration. This includes, but is not limited to, commenting on design and other federal evaluation documents and providing data and analytic files to CMS, including entering into a data use agreement that explains how the data and data files will be exchanged, and providing a technical point of contact to support specification of the data and files to be di sclosed, as well as relevant data dictionaries and record layouts. The state shall include in its contracts with entities who collect, produce or maintain data and files for the demonstration, that they shall make such data available for the federal evalu ation as is required under 42 CFR 431.420(f) to support federal evaluation. The state may claim administrative match for these activities. Failure to comply with this STC may result in a deferral being issued as outlined in STC 1 of this section . 8. Compliance with Federal Systems Innovation. As federal systems continue to evolve and incorporate 1115 demonstration reporting and analytics, the state will work with CMS to: a. Revise the reporting templates and submission processes to accommodate timel y compliance with the requirements of the new systems; b. Ensure all 1115, T -MSIS, and other data elements that have been agreed to are provided; and c. Submit the monitoring reports and evaluation reports to the appropriate system as directed by CMS. 9. Close O ut Report . Within 120 days prior to the expiration of the demonstration, the state must submit a draft Close Out Report to CMS for comments. a. The draft final report must comply with the most current Guidance from CMS. b. The state will present to and participate in a discussion with CMS on the Close -Out report. c. The state must take into consideration CMS' comments for incorporation into the final Close Out Report. d. The final Close Out Report is due to CMS no later than 30 days after receipt of CMS' Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 51 of 229 comments. e. A delay in submitting the draft or final version of the Close Out Report may subject the state to penalties described in STC 1 of this section . 10. CMS Review of the Protocols . Once reviewed by CMS, the Evaluation Design will become Attachment C of the STCs and will be binding upon the state. The state may request changes to protocols, which will be effective prospectively. Changes may be subject to an amendment to the STCs in accordance with S ection III STC 7, depending upon the nature of the pr oposed change. A delay in submitting such protocols could subject the state to penalties described in STC 1 of this section . XIV. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS 1. Quarterly Expenditure Reports. The state must report quarterly expenditures associated with the populations affected by this demonstration on the Form CMS - 64. 2. Reporting Expenditures under the Demonstration. The following describes the reporting of expenditures: a. Tracking Expenditures . In order to track expenditures under this demonstration, Indiana must report demonstration expenditures through the MBES and state Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (CBES), following routine CMS -64 reporting instructions outlined in section 2500 of the state Medicaid Manual. All demonstration expenditures claimed under the authority of title XIX of the Act must be reported each quarter on separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver, identified by the demonstration projec t number assigned by CMS, including the project number extension, which indicates the DY in which services were rendered or for which capitation payments were made. For this purpose, DY 1 is defined as the year beginning February 1, 2015, and ending Decem ber 31, 2015; subsequent DYs are defined accordingly. All title XIX service expenditures that are not demonstration expenditures and are not part of any other title XIX waiver program should be reported on Forms CMS -64.9 Base/64.9P Base. b. Reporting of HIP POWER Account Contributions. The state must report HIP plan POWER account contributions as follows: i. HIP MCO Contributions . HIP plan contributions must be reported on Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and CMS -64.9P Waiver, using Line 18A. ii. State's Contributions to Participants' POWER Accounts . The state's contributions to participants' POWER accounts must be reported on Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver, using Line 18E. (Because individual participants' POWER account contributions are not subject to f ederal Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 52 of 229 matching, they are not to be reported on the CMS -64.). iii. Recouped State Contributions to Participants' POWER Accounts . In the event that the state recoups state POWER account contributions from HIP MCOs (for example, when a participant disenrolls from HIP; see S ection VII), the amounts collected must be reported as a prior period adjustment using Line 10B of the Forms CMS - 64.9P Waiver on Line 18E. c. Cost Settlements. For monitoring purposes, cost settlements attributable to the demonstration must be recorde d on the appropriate prior period adjustment schedules (Form CMS -64.9P Waiver) for the Summary Sheet Line 10B, in lieu of Lines 9 or 10C. For any cost settlements not attributable to this demonstration, the adjustments should be reported as otherwise inst ructed in the state Medicaid Manual. d. Use of Waiver Forms . Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P must be submitted each quarter (when applicable) to report title XIX expenditures for individuals enrolled in the demonstration. The expressions in quotation ma rks are the waiver names to be used to designate these waiver forms in the MBES/CBES system. i. \"SUD/IMD\" Expenditures ii. \"SMI FFS Inpatient\" Expenditures iii. \"SMI Managed Care Capitation & FFS \" Expenditures e. Pharmacy Rebates. The state may propose a methodology for assigning a portion of pharmacy rebates to the demonstration, in a way that reasonably reflects the actual rebate- eligible pharmacy utilization of the demonstration population, and which reasonably identifies pharmac y rebate amounts with DYs. Use of the methodology is subject to the approval in advance by the CMS Regional Office, and change s to the methodology must also be approved in advance by the Regional Office. The portion of pharmacy rebates assigned to the de monstration using the approved methodology will be reported on the appropriate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver for the demonstration, and not on any other CMS -64.9 form (to avoid double -counting). Each rebate amount must be distributed as state and federal revenue consistent with the federal matching rates under which the claim was paid. f. Administrative Costs. The following provisions govern reporting of administrative costs during the demonstration. i. Administrative costs attributable to the demonstration must be reported under waiver name \"HIP.\" ii. Administrative costs not related to the demonstration should be reported on the appropriate CMS -64.10 Base or 64.10P Base, or another waiver schedule as appropriate. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 53 of 229 g. Claiming Period. All claims for expenditures (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. Furthermore, all claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years aft er the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter 2 -year period, the state must continue to identify separately on the CMS -64 waiver forms the net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the section 1115 dem onstration, in order to account for these expenditures properly to determine budget neutrality. 3. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the demonstration. The state must estimate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and federal share) and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each federal fiscal year on the Form CMS -37 for both the Medical Assistance Payments (MAP) and State and Local Administration Costs (ADM). CMS will make federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -64 quarterly Medicaid expenditure report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the quarter just ended. CMS will reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -64 quarterly with federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. 4. Extent of FFP for the Demonstration. Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non- federal share of funding, CMS will provide FFP at the applicable federal matching rate for the demonstration as a whole as outlined below: a. Administrative costs, including those associated with the administration of the demonstration. b. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments of the Medicaid program that are paid in accordance with the approved state plan. c. Medical Assistance expenditures made under section 1115 demonstration authority, including those made in conjunction with the demonstration, cost sharing, pharmacy rebates, and all other types of third party liability or CMS payment adjustments. 5. Sources of Non -Federal Share. The state must certify that the ma tching non-federal share of funds for the demonstration are state/local monies. The state further certifies that such funds shall not be used as the match for any other federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. All sources of non -federal fun ding must be compliant with section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. In addition, all sources of the non- federal share of funding are subject to CMS approval. a. CMS may review the sources of the non- federal share of funding for the demonstrat ion at any time. The state agrees that all funding sources deemed unacceptable by CMS shall be addressed within the time frames set by CMS. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 54 of 229 b. Any amendments that impact the financial status of the program shall require the state to provide information to C MS regarding all sources of the non -federal share of funding. c. The state assures that all health care- related taxes comport with section 1903(w) of the Act and all other applicable federal statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as the approved Medicaid state plan. d. Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of the HIP reimbursement amounts claimed by the state as demonstration expenditures. Moreover, no pre -arranged agreements (contractual or otherwise) may exist betw een the health care providers and the state and/or local government to return and/or redirect any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business (such as payments related to taxes (including health care provider -related taxes), fees, and business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medicaid payments) ar e not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. e. FFP will not be available for individual contributions to the POWER accounts. FFP will be available for state contributions to the POWER accounts to the extent that funds are actually trans ferred to MCOs (net of any such funds returned to the state or other governmental entity), and for capitation payments to MCOs. 6. State Certification of Funding Conditions. The state must certify that the following conditions for non- federal share of demon stration expenditures are met: a. Units of government, including governmentally operated health care providers, may certify that state or local tax dollars have been expended as the non -federal share of funds under the demonstration. b. To the extent the state utilizes certified public expenditures (CPEs) as the funding mechanism for Title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) payments, CMS must approve a cost reimbursement methodology. This methodology must include a detailed explanation of the process by which the state would identify those costs eligible under Title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) for purposes of certifying public expenditures. c. To the extent the state utilizes CPEs as the funding mechanism to claim federal match for payments under the demonstration, governmental entities to which general revenue funds are appropriated must certify to the state the amount of such tax revenue (state or local) used to fund the non- federal share of demonstration expenditures. The entities that incurred the cost must also provide cost documentation to support the state's claim for federal match. d. The state may use intergovernmental transfers to the extent that such funds are Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 55 of 229 derived from state or local tax revenues and are transferred by units of government within the state. Any transfers from governmentally operated health care providers must be made in an amount not to exceed the non- federal share of Title XIX payments. e. Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of t he HIP reimbursement amounts claimed by the state as demonstration expenditures. Moreover, no pre -arranged agreements (contractual or otherwise) may exist between the health care providers and the state and/or local government to return and/or redirect any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business (such as payments related to taxes (including health care provider -related taxes), fees, and business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medicaid payments) are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. 7. Monitoring the Demonstration. The state shall provide CMS with information to effectively monitor the demonstration, upon request, in a reasonable timeframe. XV. BUDGET NEUTRALITY DETERMINATION 1. Limit on Title XIX Funding. The state shall be subject to a limit on the amount of federal ti tle XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the period of approval of the demonstration. The limit will be determined by using a per capita cost method. The budget neutrality expenditure targets are set on a yearly basis with a cumulative budget neutrality expenditure limit for the length of the entire demonstration. Actual expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit shall be reported by the state using the procedures described in Section X IV STC 2(d). The data supplied by the state to CMS to set the annual limits is subject to review and audit, and, if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. 2. Risk. Indiana shall be at risk for the per capita cost (as determined by the method described below in this s ection) for Medicaid eligibles but not for the number of demonstration eligibles in each of the groups. By providing FFP for HIP enrollees in these elig ibility groups, Indiana shall not be at risk for changing economic conditions that impact enrollment levels. However, by placing Indiana at risk for the per capita costs for HIP enrollees, CMS assures that the federal demonstration expenditures do not exc eed the level of expenditures that would have occurred had there been no demonstration. 3. Budget Neutrality Annual Expenditure Limits. For each DY, annual limits are calculated. As part of the SUD and SMI initiative s, the state may receive FFP for the con tinuum of services specified in T ables 6 and 7 to treat OUD and other SUDs that are provided to Medicaid beneficiaries in an IMD. These are Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 56 of 229 state plan services that would be eligible for reimbursement if not for the IMD exclusion. Therefore, they are being treated as hypothetical. The state may only claim FFP via demonstration authority for the services listed in Table s 6 and 7 that will be provided in an IMD. However, the state will not be allowed to obtain budget neutrality \"savings\" from these services. Therefore, a separate expenditure cap is established for SUD and SMI services. a. The SUD and SMI MEG s listed in the table below are included in SUD budget neutrality test. b. SUD and SM I expenditures cap s are calculated by mult iplying the projected PMPM for each SUD MEG, each DY, by the number of actual eligible SUD and SMI member months for the same MEG/DY \u2014and summing the products together across all DYs. The federal share of the SUD expenditure cap is obtained by multiplying those caps by the Composite Federal Share (see STC 4 of this section). c. SUD and SMI budget neutrality test is a comparison between the federal share of SUD expenditure cap and total FFP reported by the state for the SUD and SMI MEG s. Eligibility Group Trend Rate DY 4 DY5 DY 6 SUD 4.9% & FFS 4.6% $1,046.32 $1,094.45 d. The budget neutrality cap is calculated by taking the PMPM cost projection for the above group in each DY, times the number of eligible member months for that group and DY, and adding the products together across groups and DYs. The federal share of the b udget neutrality cap is obtained by multiplying total computable budget neutrality cap by the federal share. e. The s tate will not be allowed to obtain budget neutrality \"savings\" from the SUD and SMI MEG s. 4. Composite Federal Share. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of FFP received by the state on actual demonstration expenditures during the three- year approval period, as reported on the form listed in Section XI V STC 2(d) by total computabl e demonstration expenditures for the same period as reported on the same forms. Should the demonstration be terminated prior to the end of the three- year approval period, the Composite Federal Share will be determined based on actual expenditures for the period in which the demonstration was active. For the purpose of Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 57 of 229 interim monitoring of budget neutrality, a reasonable estimate of Composite Federal Share may be used. 5. Future Adjustments to the Budget Neutrality Expenditure Limit. CMS reserves the right s to adjust the budget neutrality expenditure limit to be consistent with enforcement of impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, new federal statues, or policy interpretations implemented through letter, memoranda, or regulations wit h respect to the provision of services covered unde r HIP. 6. Enforcement of Budget Neutrality. CMS shall enforce budget neutrality over the lif e of the demonstration rather than on an annual basis, by combining the annual limits calculated following this STC into lifetime limits for the demonstration. The budget neutrality test for the demonstration extension will incorporate net savings from the immediately prior demonstration period of February 1, 2015 through January 31, 2018, but not from any earlier appr oval period. 7. Budget Neutrality Savings Phase -Down . Beginning with the demonstration period that begins on February 1, 2018, the net variance between the without -waiver and actual with - waiver costs will be reduced. The reduced variance, calculated as a percentage of the total variance, is used in place of the total variance to determine overall budget neutrality of the demonstration. The formula for calculating the reduced variance is, reduced variance equals total variance times applicable percentag e. The percentages are determined based on how long Medicaid populations have been enrolled in managed care subject to the demonstration. In the case of Indiana, the managed care program will retain 25 percent of the total variance as future savings for t he demonstration. Should the state request an extension of its demonstration beyond December 31, 2020, the state must provide actual managed care capitation rate data for enrollees. Budget neutrality will be adjusted again to reflect revised PMPMs based on this data . 8. Exceeding Budget Neutrality. If at the end of the demonstration period the cumulative budget neutrality limit has been exceeded, the excess federal funds will be returned to CMS. If the demonstration is terminated prior to the end of the budget neutrality agreement, an evaluation o f this provision will be based on the time elapsed through the termination date. 9. Impermissible DSH, Taxes or Donations. The CMS reserves the right to adjust the budget neutrality expenditure limit in order to be consistent with enforcement of impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, new federal statutes, or with policy interpretations implemented throug h letters, memoranda, or regulations. CMS reserves the right to make adjustments to the budget neutrality expenditure limit if CMS determines that any health care -related tax that was in effect during the base year, or provider -related donation that occur red during the base year, is in violation of the provider donation and health care related tax provisions of Section 1903(w) of the Act. Adjustments to the budget neutrality agreement will reflect the phase -out of impermissible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. XVI.

Prior to release of these reports, articles or other national publications, CMS will be provided a copy including any associated press materials. CMS will be given ten days to review and comment on publications before they are released. CMS may choose to decline to comment or review some or all of these notifications and reviews. This requirement does not apply to the release or presentation of these materials to state or local government officials or to FSSA staff acting in their official capacity and providing information to stakeholders in a formal capacity with the expressed intent of soliciting feedback and/or comment as required by regulations . Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 61 of 229 Attachment A - Developing the Evaluation Design Introduction For states that are testing new approaches and flexibilities in their Medicaid programs through section 1115 demonstrations, evaluations are crucial to understand and disseminate what is or is not working and why. The evaluations of new initiatives seek to produce new knowledge and direction for programs and inform Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative about what happened during a demonstration provide s important information, the principal focus of the evaluation of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g., whether the demonstration is being implemented as intended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target population), and impact s of the demonstration (e.g., whether the outcomes observed in the targeted population differ from outcomes in similar populations not affected by the demonstration). Both state and federal governments need rigorous quantitative and qualitative evidence t o inform policy decisions. Expectations for Evaluation Designs All states with Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are required to conduct an evaluation, and the Evaluation Design is the roadmap for conducting the evaluation. The roadmap begins with the stated goals for the demonstration followed by the measurable evaluation questions and quantifiable hypotheses, all to support a determination of the extent to which the demonstration has achieved its goals. When conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances. The format for the Evaluation Design is as follows: A. Gener al Background Information; B. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses; C. Methodology; D. Methodological Limitations; E. Attachments. Submission Timelines There is a specified timeline for the state's submission of Evaluation Design and Reports. (The graphic below depic ts an example of this timeline). In addition, the state should be aware that section 1115 evaluation documents are public records. The state is required to publish the Evaluation Design to the state's website within 30 days of CMS approval, as per 42 CFR 431.424(e). CMS will also publish a copy to the Medicaid.gov website. Required Core Components of All Evaluation Designs The Evaluation Design sets the stage for the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. It is important that the Evaluation Design explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology (and limitations) for the evaluation. A copy of the state's Driver Diagram (described in more detail in paragraph B2 below) should be included with an explanation of the depicted information. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 62 of 229 A. General Background Information - In this section, the state should include basic information about the demonstration, such as: 1) The issue/s that the state is trying to address with its section 1115 demonstration and/or expenditure authorities, the potential magnitude of the issue/s, and why the state selected this course of action to address the issue/s (e.g., a narrative on why the state submitted an 1115 demonstration proposal). 2) The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstration, and period of time covered by the evaluation; 3) A brief description of the demonstration and history of the implementation, and whether the draft Evaluation Design applies to an amendment, extension, renewal, or expansion of, the demonstration; 4) For renewals, amendments, and major operational changes: A description of any changes to the demonstration during the approval period; the primary reason or reasons for the change; and how the Evaluation Design was altered or augmented to address these changes. 5) Describe the population groups impacted by the demonstration. B. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses - In this section, the state should: 1) Describe how the state's demonstration goals are translated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. 2) Include a Driver Diagram to visually aid readers in understanding the rationale behind the cause and effect of the variants behind the demonstration features and intended outcomes. A driver diagram is a particularly effective modeling tool when working to improve health and health care through specific interventions. The diagram includes information about the goal of the demonstration, and the features of the demonstration. A driver diagram depicts the relationship between the aim, the pr imary drivers that contribute directly to achieving the aim, and the secondary drivers that are necessary to achieve the primary drivers for the demonstration. For an example and more information on driver diagrams: https://innovation.cms.gov/files/x/hciatwoaimsdrvrs.pdf 3) Identify the state's hypotheses about the outcomes of the demonstration: a. Discuss how the evaluation questions align with the hypotheses and the goals of the demonstration; b. Address how the research questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the objectives of Titles XIX and/or XXI. C. Methodology - In this section, the state is to describe in detail the proposed research methodology. The focus is on showing that the evaluation meets the prevailing standards of scientific and academic rigor, and the results are statistically valid and reliable, and that where appropriate it builds upon other published research (use references). Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 63 of 229 This section provides the evidence that the demonstration evaluation will use the best available data; reports on, controls for, and makes appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizabilit y of results. This section should provide enough transparency to explain what will be measured and how. Specifically, this section establishes: 1) Evaluation Design - Provide information on how the evaluation will be designed. For example, will the evaluation utilize a pre/post comparison? A post -only assessment? Will a comparison group be included? 2) Target and Comparison Populations - Describe the characteristics of the target and comparison populations, to include the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Include information about the level of analysis (beneficiary, provider, or program level), and if populations will be stratified into subgroups. Additionally discuss the sampling methodology for the populations, as well as support that a statistically reliable sample size is available. 3) Evaluation Period - Describe the time periods for which data will be included. 4) Evaluation Measures - List all measures that will be calculated to evaluate the demonstration. Include the measure stewards (i.e., the organization(s) responsible for the evaluation data elements/sets by \"owning\", defining, validating; securing; and submitting for endorsement, etc.) Include numerator and denominator information. Additional items to ensure: a. The measures contain assessments of both process and outcomes to evaluate the effects of the demonstration during the period of approval. b. Qualitative analysis methods ma y be used, and must be described in detail. c. Benchmarking and comparisons to national and state standards, should be used, where appropriate. d. Proposed health measures could include CMS's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS), the Initial Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid -Eligible Adults and/or measures endorsed by National Quality Forum (NQF). e. Proposed performance metrics can be selected from nationally recognized metrics, for example from sets developed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation or for meaningful use under Health Information Technology (HIT). f. Among considerations in selecting the metrics shall be opportunities identified by the state for improving quality of care and health outcomes, and controlling cost of care. 5) Data Sources - Explain where the data will be obtained, and efforts to validate and clean the data. Discuss the quality and limitations of the data sources. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 64 of 229 If primary data (data collected specifically for the evaluation) - The methods by which the data will be collected, the source of the proposed question/responses, the frequency and timing of data collection, and the method of data collection. (Copies of any proposed surveys must be reviewed with CMS for approval before implementation). 6) Analytic Methods - This section includes the details of the selected quantitative and/or qualitative measures to adequately assess the effectiveness of the demonstration. This section should: a. Identify the specific statistical testing which will be undertaken for each measu re (e.g., t -tests, chi -square, odds ratio, ANOVA, regression). Table A is an example of how the state might want to articulate the analytic methods for each research question and measure. b. Explain how the state will isolate the effects of the demonstratio n (from other initiatives occurring in the state at the same time) through the use of comparison groups. c. A discussion of how propensity score matching and difference in differences design may be used to adjust for differences in comparison populations over time (if applicable). d. The application of sensitivity analyses, as appropriate, should be considered. 7) Other Additions - The state may provide any other information pertinent to the Evaluation Design of the demonstration. Table A. Example Design Table for the Evaluation of the Demonstration Research Question Outcome measures used to address the research question Sample or population subgroups to be compared Data Sources Analytic Methods Hypothesis 1 Research question 1a -Measure 1 -Measure 2 -Measure 3 -Sample e.g. All attributed Medicaid beneficiaries -Beneficiaries with diabetes diagnosis -Medicaid FFS and encounter claims records -Interrupted time series Research question 1b -Measure 1 -Measure 2 -Measure 3 -Measure 4 -sample, e.g., PPS patients who meet survey selection requirements (used services within the last 6 months) -Patient surve y Descriptive statistics Hypothesis 2 Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 65 of 229 Research question 2a -Measure 1 -Measure 2 -Sample, e.g., PPS administrators -Key informants Qualitative analysis of interview material D. Methodological Limitations - This section provides detailed information on the limitations of the evaluation. This could include the design, the data sources or collection process, or analytic methods. The state should also identify any efforts to minimize the limitations. Additionally, this section should include any information about features of the demonstration that effectively present methodological constraints that the state would like CMS to take into consideration in its review. E. Special Methodological Considerations - CMS recognizes that there may be certain instances where a state cannot meet the rigor of an evaluation as expected by CMS. In these instances, the state should document for CMS why it is not able to incorporate key components of a rigorous evaluation, including comparison groups and baseline data analyses. Examples of considerations include: 1) When the state demonstration is: a. Long -standing, non -complex, unchanged, or b. Has previously been rigorously evaluated and found to be successful, or c. Could now be considered standard Medicaid policy (CMS published regulations or guidance) 2) When the demonstration is also considered successful without issues or concerns that would require more regular reporting, such as: a. Operating smoothly without administrative chang es; and b. No or minimal appeals and grievances; and c. No state issues with CMS 64 reporting or budget neutrality; and d. No Corrective Action Plans (CAP) for the demonstration. F. Attachments A. Independent Evaluator. This includes a discussion of the state's process for obtaining an independent entity to conduct the evaluation, including a description of the qualifications that the selected entity must possess, and how the state will assure no conflict of interest. Explain how the state will assure that the Independent Evaluator will conduct a fair and impartial evaluation, prepare an objective Evaluation Report, and that there would be no conflict of interest. This includes \"No Conflict of Interest\" signed conforma tion statements. B. Evaluation Budget. A budget for implementing the evaluation shall be provided with the draft Evaluation Design. It will include the total estimated cost, as well as a breakdown of estimated staff, administrative, and other costs for all aspects of the evaluation. Examples include, but are not limited to: the development of all survey and measurement instruments; quantitative and qualitative data collection; data cleaning and Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 66 of 229 analyses; and reports generation. A justification of the costs may be required by CMS if the estimates provided do not appear to sufficiently cover the costs of the draft Evaluation Design or if CMS finds that the draft Evaluation Design is not sufficiently developed. C. Timeline and Major Milestones. Describe the timeline for conducting the various evaluation activities, including dates for evaluation- related milestones, including those related to procurement of an outside contractor, if applicable, and deliverables. The Final Evaluation Design shall incorporate a n Interim and Summative Evaluation. Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.424(c)(v), this timeline should also include the date by which the Final Summative Evaluation report is due. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 67 of 229 Attachment B : Preparing the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports Introduction For states that are testing new approaches and flexibilities in their Medicaid programs through section 1115 demonstrations, evaluations are crucial to understand and disseminate what is or is not working and why. The evaluations of new initiatives seek to produce new knowledge and dire ction for programs and inform Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative about what happened during a demonstration provide important information, the principal focus of the evaluation of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g., whether the demonstratio n is being implemented as intended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target population), and impacts of the demonstration ( e.g., whether the outcomes observed in the targeted population differ from outcomes in similar populations not affected by the demonstration). Both state and federal governments could benefit from improved quantitative and qualitative evidence to inform policy decisions. Expectations for Evaluation Reports Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are required to conduct an evaluation that is valid (the extent to which the evaluation measures what it is intended to measure), and reliable (the extent to which the evaluation could produce the same results when used repeatedly). To this end, t he already approved Evaluation Design is a map that begins with the demonstration goals, then transitions to the evaluation questions, and to the specific hypotheses, whic h will be used to investigate whether the demonstration has achieved its goals. Stat es should have a well -structured analysis plan for their evaluation. With the following kind of information, states and CMS are best poised to inform and shape Medicaid p olicy in order to improve the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries for decades to come. When conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request , and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances. When submitting an application for renewal, the interim evaluation report should be posted on the state's website with the application for public comment. Additionally, the interim evaluation report must be included in its entirety with the application submitted to CMS. Intent of this Attachment Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires an evaluation of every section 1115 demonstration. In order to fulfill this requirement, the state's submission must provide a comprehensive written presentation of all key components of the demonstration, and include all required elements specified in the approved Evaluation Design. This Attachment is intended to assist state s with organizing the required information in a standardized format and understanding the criteria that CMS will use in reviewing the submitted Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. The format for the Interim and Summative Evaluation reports are as follows: A. Executive Summary; B. General Background Information; C. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses; D. Methodology; E. Methodological Limitations; F. Results; G. Conclusions; Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 68 of 229 H. Interpretations, and Policy Implications and Interactions with Other State Initiatives; I. Lessons Learned and Recommendations; and J. Attachment(s). Submission Timelines There is a specified timeline for the state's submission of Evaluation Designs and Evaluation Reports. These dates are specified in the demonstration Special Terms and Conditions (STCs). (The graphic below depicts an example of this timeline). In addition, the state should be aware that section 1115 evaluation documents are public records. In order to assure the dissemination of the evaluation findings, lessons learned, and re commendations, the state is required to publish the evaluation design and reports to the state's website within 30 days of CMS approval, as per 42 CFR 431.424(d). CMS will also publish a copy to the Medicaid.gov website. Required Core Components of Int erim and Summative Evaluation Reports The section 1115 Evaluation Report presents the research about the section 1115 Demonstration. It is important that the report incorporate a discussion about the structure of the Evaluation Design to explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology for the evaluation. A copy of the state's Driver Diagram (described in the Evaluation Design Attachment) must be included with an explanation of the depicted information. The Evaluation Report should present the relevant data and an interpretation of the findings; assess the outcomes (what worked and what did not work); explain the limitations of the design, data, and analyses; offer recommendations regar ding what (in hindsight) the state would further advance, or do differently, and why; and discuss the implications on future Medicaid policy. Therefore, the state's submission must include: a. Executive Summary - A summary of the demonstration, the principal results, interpretations, and recommendations of the evaluation. B. General Background Information about the Demonstration - In this section, the state should include basic information about the demonstration, such as: i. The issues that the state is trying to address with its section 1115 demonstration and/or expenditure authorities, how the state became aware of the issue, the potential magnitude of the issue, and why the state selected this course of action to address the issues. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 69 of 229 ii. The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstration, and period of time covered by the evaluation; iii. A brief description of the demonstration and history of the implementation, and if the evaluation is for an amendment, exten sion, renewal, or expansion of, the demonstration; iv. For renewals, amendments, and major operational changes: A description of any changes to the demonstration during the approval period; whether the motivation for change was due to political, economic, and fiscal factors at the state and/or federal level; whether the programmatic changes were implemented to improve beneficiary health, provider/health plan performance, or administrative efficiency; and how the Evaluation Design was altered or augmented to ad dress these changes. v. Describe the population groups impacted by the demonstration. C. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses - In this section, the state should: 1. Describe how the state's demonstration goals were translated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. The inclusion of a Driver Diagram in the Evaluation Report is highly encouraged, as the visual can aid readers in understanding the rationale behind the demonstration features and intended outcomes. 2. Identify the state's hypotheses about the outcomes of the demonstration; a. Discuss how the goals of the demonstration align with the evaluation questions and hypotheses; b. Explain how this Evaluation Report bui lds upon and expands earlier demonstration evaluation findings (if applicable); and c. Address how the research questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the objectives of Titles XIX and XXI. D. Methodology - In this section, the state is to provi de an overview of the research that was conducted to evaluate the section 1115 demonstration consistent with the approved Evaluation Design. The evaluation Design should also be included as an attachment to the report. The focus is on showing that the evaluation builds upon other published research (use references), and meets the prevailing standards of scientific and academic rigor, and the results are statistically valid and reliable. An interim report should provide any available data to date, including both quantitative and qualitative assessments. The Evaluation Design should assure there is appropriate data development and collection in a timely manner to support developing an interim evaluation. This section provides the evidence that the demonstration evaluation used the best available data and describes why potential alternative data sources were not used; reported on, controlled for, and made appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizability of results. This section should provide enough transparency to explain what was measured and how. Specifically, this sec tion establishes that the approved Evaluation Design was followed by describing: 1. Evaluation Design\u2014Will the evaluation be an assessment of: pre/post, post -only, with or without comparison groups, etc? 2. Target and Comparison Populations \u2014Describe the target and comparison populations; include inclusion and exclusion criteria. Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 70 of 229 3. Evaluation Period\u2014 Describe the time periods for which data will be collected 4. Evaluation Measures \u2014What measures are used to evaluate the demonstration, and who are the measure stewards? 5. Data Sources \u2014Explain where the data will be obtained, and efforts to validate and clean the data. 6. Analytic methods \u2014Identify specific statistical testing which will be undertaken for each measure (t -tests, chi -square, odds ratio, ANOVA, regression, etc.). 7. Other Additions - The state may provide any other information pertinent to the evaluation of the demonstration. E. Methodological Limitations This section provides sufficient information for discerning the strengths and weaknesses of the study design, data sources/collection, and analyses. F. Results - In this section, the state presents and uses the quantitative and qualitative data to show to whether and to what degree the evaluation questions and hypotheses of the demonstration were achieved. The findings should visually depict the demonstration results (tables, charts, graphs). This section should include information on the statistical tests conducted. G. Conclusions - In this section, the state will present the conclusions about the evalua tion results . 1. In general, did the results show that the demonstration was/was not effective in achieving the goals and objectives established at the beginning of the demonstration? 2. Based on the findings, discuss the outcomes and impacts of the demonstration and identify the opportunities for improvements. Specifically: a. If the state did not fully achieve its intended goals, why not? What could be done in the future that would better enable such an effort to more fully achieve those purposes, aims , objectives, and goals? H. Interpretations, Policy Implications and Interactions with Other State Initiatives - In this section, the state will discuss the section 1115 demonstration within an overall Medicaid context and long range planning. This sh ould include interrelations of the demonstration with other aspects of the state's Medicaid program, interactions with other Medicaid demonstrations, and other federal awards affecting service delivery, health outcomes and the cost of care under Medicaid. This section provides the state with an opportunity to provide interpretation of the data using evaluative reasoning to make judgments about the demonstration. This section should also include a discussion of the implications of the findings at both the s tate and national levels. I. Lessons Learned and Recommendations - This section of the Evaluation Report involves the transfer of knowledge. Specifically, the \"opportunities\" for future or revised demonstrations to inform Medicaid policymakers, advocates, and stakeholders is just as significant as identifying current suc cessful strategies. Based on the evaluation results: 1. What lessons were learned as a result of the demonstration? Healthy Indiana Plan Effective: February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Amendment approved: December 20, 2019 Page 71 of 229 2. What would you recommend to other states which may be interested in implementing a similar approach? J. Attachment 1.

Nearly six times as many Hoosiers died from drug overdoses in 2014 as did in 2000, and the number of heroin overdose deaths has increased by nearly 25 times between 2000 and 20141. The State's Medicaid population has been particularly impacted by the crisis: nearly 100,000 individuals were treated for a diagnosis of substance use disorder in 20162. As part of a response to a recommendation laid out by the Taskforce on Drug Enforcement, Treatment, and Prevention, Indiana Medicaid is building a stronger substance use disorder (SUD) treatment infrastructure, with increased benefits, stronger provider networks, and incorporation of evidenced- based SUD program standards. Indiana will utilize a section 1115 demonstration waiver to pursue the following primary goals, as outlined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS): 1. Increased rates of identification, initiation, and engagement in treatment 2. Increased adherence to and retention in treatment 3. Reductions in overdose deaths, particularly those due to opioids 4. Reduced utilization of emergency department s and inpatient hospital settings for treatment where the utilization is preventable or medically inappropriately through improved access to other continuum of care services 5. Fewer readmissions to the same or higher level of care where the readmission is preventable or medically inappropriate 6. Improved access to care for physical health conditions among beneficiaries Indiana Medicaid believes it can accomplish these six goals by putting particular focus on three areas: Expanded SUD treatment options for as ma ny of its members as possible Stronger, evidenced- based certification standards for its SUD providers, particularly its residential addiction providers Consistency with prior authorization criteria and determinations among its health plans Organized by six key milestones that have been identified by CMS, the following implementation plan provides a vision for the direction Indiana Medicaid will go over the months and years ahead in combating the State's opioid epidemic. Access to Critical Levels of Care for SUD Treatment Indiana Medicaid provides coverage of SUD treatment services to its members. Throughout the waiver application process, Indiana Medicaid reviewed its options for individuals struggling with 1 INDIANA STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, INDIANA:SPECIAL EMPHASIS REPORT, DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS, 1999 -2013 (2016), available at http://www.in.gov/isdh/files/2016_SER_Drug_Deaths_Indiana.pdf. 2 Based on ICD -10 claims a nalysis for claims with a date a service between January 1 and December 31, 2016. Excludes tobacco use disorder. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 5 SUD compared with the standards outlined through the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM). Many services that align with an ASAM level of care are currently covered, but through the usage of the 1115 SUD waiver, State Plan Amendments, and other regulatory tools, Indiana will provide coverage for a more complete continuum of services. The following table provides an over view of each ASAM level of care with current Indiana Medicaid coverage along with proposed changes: ASAM Level of Care Service Title Description Current Coverage Future Coverage OTP Opioid Treatment Program Pharmacological and non -pharmacological treatment in an office -based setting (methadone) Currently covered for all (as of September 2017) Continued oversight of new policy 0.5 Early Intervention Services for individuals who are at risk of developing substance -related disorders Currently covered for all No change expected 1.0 Outpatient Services Outpatient treatment (usually less than 9 hours a week), including counseling, evaluations, and interventions Currently covered for all No change expected 2.1 Intensive Outpatient Services 9-19 hours of structured programming per week (counseling and education about addiction -related and mental health programs) Currently MRO -only Will be covered for all individuals 2.5 Partial Hospitalization 20 or more hours of clinically intensive programming per week Covered for all No change expected 3.1 Clinically Managed Low - Intensity Residential 24-hour supportive living environment; at least 5 hours of low -intensity treatment per week No coverage Bundled daily rate for residential treatment 3.5 Clinically Managed High - Intensity Residential 24-hour living environment, more high -intensity treatment (level 3.7 without intensive medical and nursing component) No coverage Bundled daily rate for residential treatment 3.7 Medically Monitored Intensive Inpatient Services 24-hour professionally directed evaluation, observation, medical monitoring, and addiction treatment in an inpatient setting Covered for all (based on medical necessity) Align authorization criteria with ASAM 4.0 Medically Managed Intensive Inpatient 24-hour inpatient treatment requiring the full resources of an acute care or psychiatric hospital Covered for all (based on medical necessity) Align authorization criteria with ASAM Sub- Support Addiction Recovery Management Services Services to help people overcome personal and environmental obstacles to recovery, assist the newly recovering person into the recovering community, and serve as a personal guide and mentor toward the achievement of goals No coverage Covered for all individuals Sub- Support Supportive Housing Services Services for individuals who are transitioning or sustaining housing. No coverage Explore options for coverage Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 6 Each of the ASAM levels of care will be addressed in more detail by providing current coverage, future coverage, and a timeline for implementation over the next 12- 24 months for these proposed changes. Level of Care: OTS (Opioid Treatment Services) Summary of Actions Needed: Amendment to Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) promulgating covera ge of OTP services Current State: Through August 2017, Indiana Medicaid did not provide coverage for opioid treatment program (OTP) services, including the daily administration of methadone. The Family and Social Services Admission (FSSA), Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA) currently certifies thirteen (13) OTPs, including three that are operated through a community mental health center (CMHC). Since 2008, DMHA has been prohibited from certifying new programs; however, Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 464 (2015) allows DMHA to approve up to five new programs before June 30, 2018. As a result of this legislation, DMHA is moving forwar d with the certification of up to five new OTPs throughout the state. In addition, DMHA is reviewing and updating the Indiana Administrative Code to clarify sections of the code and modify outdated sections. Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 297 (2016) required that as of July 1, 2017, all OTPs operating in Indiana must either be: Enrolled as an Indiana Health Coverage Programs (IHCP) provider, or Enrolled as an orderin g, prescribing, or referring provider in accordance with Section 6401 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As a result of this legislation, Indiana Medicaid began pursuing conversations with several OTPs about a bundled payment for all servic es rendered. Future State: Indiana Medicaid has completed making the system changes to enroll OTPs as billing providers and reimburse these programs with a daily bundled payment that includes all services as required by federal regulations and in alignment with ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. These services include the following: Individualized, patient -centered assessment and treatment Assessing, ordering, administering, reassessing, and regulating medication and dose levels appropriate to an individual Monitored drug testing, to be done at a minimum of eight times a year A range of cognitive, behavioral, and other substance use disorder -focused therapies Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 7 Case management, including medical monitoring and coordination of on- and off -site treatment services, provided as a needed Psychoeducation, including HIV/AIDS education and other health education services BT201755 was published on August 17, 2017 finalizing all of the billing guidance and enrollment information for OTP services. Services were originally announced to begin on August 2, 2017; however, due to public comment and system specifications, the effective date was delayed until September 1, 2017. Meanw hile, the State Plan Amendment (SPA) authorizing the use of the bundled payment structure was submitted to CMS on September 8, 2017. This SPA was approved on December 4, 2017. Indiana Medicaid has made a concerted effort at working closely with DMHA to en sure that the State's Medicaid guidance is consistently aligned with the State's non -Medicaid guidance. Representatives from Indiana Medicaid continue to participate in quarterly meetings with all of the OTP providers, and the program will closely monitor the success of this new coverage and amend policy as necessary. Finally, Indiana Medicaid will promulgate its coverage of OTP services as part of a comprehensive review of its behavioral health administrative rules. A list of action items and expected implementation timeline regarding OTP services is provided in the table below: Action Implementation Timeline Pursue Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) change for coverage and reimbursement of OTPs Will be filed by December 31, 2018 Level of Care: 0.5 (Early Intervention) Summary of Actions Needed: None anticipated Current State: Indiana Medicaid provides coverage for several individual services around early intervention, including smoking cessation counseling and screening, brief intervention, and refe rral to treatment (SBIRT). These services are available to all Indiana Medicaid members without prior authorization. Future State: No changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. Level of Care: 1.0 (Outpatient Services) Summary of Actions Needed: Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 8 Amendment to Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) aligning outpatient services with ASAM structure Current State: Indiana Medicaid provides coverage for two broad categories of outpatient services: office -based addiction treatment (also known as \"clinic option\" services) and community -based addiction treatment (also known as \"Medicaid Rehabilitation Option\" services). Office -Based Treatment All Indiana Medicaid members have coverage for office- based behavioral health services. Individuals are covered for these services for up to twenty (20) units per member, per provider, per rolling 12 -month period; additional units require prior authorization based upon medical necessity. These services must be certified by and may be provided by a physician, a Health Services Provider in Psychology (HSPP), and other providers as outlined in 405 IAC 5- 20-8(2). Community -Based Treatment Indiana Medicaid also has an array of services for ment al health and addiction treatment known as Medicaid Rehabilitation Option (MRO). These optional services are authorized under Section 1905(a)(13)(C) of the Social Security Act and are allowed to be rendered in an individual's home or other setting within the community. Individuals are assigned an MRO package of services based upon an approved mental health or substance use diagnosis and an appropriate level of need, as determined through a DMHA -approved assessment tool called the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) or Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment (ANSA). Depending upon the automated results of the CANS or ANSA, an individual with a level of need of two or higher for youth (three or higher for adults) is assigned/authorized a package/array of service that includes a specific number of units of each MRO service that's available to the member for a six - month eligibility period. Individuals who still require services at the end of six months must undergo a redetermination and be assigned/authorized a new package of services designed to meet their needs. Services billable through MRO include the following: Addiction counseling (individual and group) Behavioral health counseling and therapy Behavioral health day treatment Case management Intensive outpatient treatment (IOT) Medication training and support Peer recovery services Skills training and development Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 9 MRO services are further distinguished by the provider staff qualifications eligible to deliver the service. Many of the services covered under MRO can be rendered by a licensed professional, a qualified behavioral health professional (an unlicensed individual who may have professional experience or education qualifications to provide services), or any other behavioral health professional (who may have an associate or bachelor's degree, or equivalent behavioral health experience). Additionally, due to a freedom of choice waiver authorized under Section 1915(b)(4) of the Social Security Act, MRO services are only reimburs able to community mental health centers. Future State: Indiana Medicaid currently has a robust set of services for outpatient addiction treatment. The only explicit change that will be sought, which will be discussed further in the next section, is the removal of Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOT) from the MRO package of services. Indiana Medicaid plans to make this service available to all individuals and reimbursable to qualifying providers beyond community mental health centers. The State is also pl anning to make amendments to the Indiana Administrative Code to update provider staff qualifications, including adding licensed clinical addiction counselors, and to further align its coverage standards with the ASAM Criteria. A list of action items and ex pected implementation timeline regarding outpatient services is provided in the table below: Action Implementation Timeline Pursue Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) amendments to Mental Health Services Rule Will be filed by December 31, 2018 Level of Care: 2.1 (Intensive Outpatient Services) Summary of Actions Needed: State Plan Amendment Indiana Administrative Code change CoreMMIS system changes Provider notification Current State: As indicated in the previous section, Indiana Medicaid has reimbursed for intensive outpatient treatment (IOT) as a service available through the MRO benefit. IOT is a treatment program that operates at least three hours per day for at least three days in a week. The service includes group therapy, interactive education grou ps, skills training, random drug screenings, and counseling, all of which fall in line with ASAM Level of Care 2.1 expectations for Intensive Outpatient Services. Like all other MRO services, it is only reimbursable through CMHCs. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 10 Over the past year, providers other than CMHCs have been trying to work with our managed care entities (MCEs) on proper payment for IOT services outside of MRO. The MCEs have adopted the usage of \"intensive outpatient program\" (IOP) for services billed outside of MRO. In January 2017, OMPP provided clearer reimbursement instructions directly to the MCEs on IOP services that also differentiate between substance use and psychiatric treatment. The following summarizes those instructions: For providers billing on a U B-04 claim form: Must bill CPT Code 90899 - Unlisted psychiatric service or procedure for any IOP service with one of the following revenue codes, based on the type of service rendered: o 905 - psychiatric o 906 - chemical dependency For providers billing on a CMS -1500 claim form: HCPCS code S9480 (Intensive outpatient psychiatric services) would be used for psychiatric IOP HCPCS code H0015 (Alcohol and/or drug services; intensive outpatient) would be used for substance use IOP o One unit equals three hours of IOP services Future State: Indiana Medicaid wants to ensure that this policy is consistent for both the managed care and fee-for-service population. As a result, Indiana Medicaid will be submitting a SPA to completely remove IOT from the MRO package of services to ensure that it is reimbursable to all appropriate entities, including community mental health centers. Indiana anticipates using the same federal authority as MRO for this separate service (Section 1905(a)(13)(C) of the Social Security Act). An upda ted section of the Indiana Administrative Code will be devoted to coverage of IOT services. A list of action items and expected implementation timeline regarding intensive outpatient services is provided in the table below: Action Implementation Timeline Pursue Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) change to remove IOT from MRO Will be filed by December 31, 2018 Pursue State Plan Amendment (SPA) to move IOT coverage from MRO Will be filed by June 30, 2018 Pursue amendment to 1915(b)(4) waiver Will be filed by June 30, 2018 Make necessary system changes to CoreMMIS Will be completed by June 30, 2018 Develop provider communication over new benefits Contingent upon approval of SPA (formal notification will be delivered at least 30 days prior to launch) Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 11 Level of care: 2.5 (Partial Hospitalization) Summary of Actions Needed: None anticipated Current State: Indiana Medicaid covers partial hospitalization for all members according to medical necessity. The following program standards apply for all individuals: Services must be ordered and authorized by a psychiatrist Face -to-face evaluation and assignment of a mental health or substance use diagnosis must take place within 24 hours following admission Psychiatrist must actively participate in the case review and monitoring of care Documentation of active oversight and monitoring of progress by a physician, psychiatrist, or HSPP must appear in the patient's clinical record At least one psychotherapy service (group psychotherapy service) must be delivered daily For those under 18 years old: active psychotherapy must appear on clinical record, and one family encounter per five business days of episode of care is required Must include four to six hours of active treatment per day, at least four d ays per week Authorized for up to five days; must check with each health plan for other authorization criteria. Future State: No immediate changes are expected at this ASAM level of care. However, Indiana Medicaid's partial hospitalization criteria will un dergo a complete review against the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria, and this effort may result in changes to the Indiana Administrative Code as part of the previously mentioned comprehensive review of the behavioral health administrative rule. Level of care: 3.1 / 3.5 (Clinically Managed Low -Intensity Residential / Clinically Managed High -Intensity Residential) Summary of Action Items: CoreMMIS system modifications (including finalizing coding) New provider specialty Conversation with MCEs regarding authorization criteria Provider notification Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 12 Current State: Residential treatment for substance use disorders can be provided within residential addiction treatment facilities, including institutions for mental disease (IMDs). An IMD is defined as a hospital, nursing facility, or other institution of more than 16 beds that is primarily engaged in providing diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases, including medical attention, nursing care, and related services. Federal law p rohibits federal financial participation (FFP) from going to IMDs for individuals aged 21 through 64. One of the primary goals of the 1115 SUD waiver is to waive this restriction and allow IMDs to provide treatment to all IHCP members, including inpatient and residential treatment. Indiana Medicaid currently has no defined methodology to pay for residential treatment for substance use disorder. As a result, neither Level 3.1 (clinically managed low -intensity residential) nor Level 3.5 (clinically managed hi gh-intensity residential) are currently reimbursable. Future State: Upon approval of the 1115 waiver, Indiana Medicaid will be able to reimburse for residential stays in all settings, including IMDs, for most populations (fee -for-service and managed care). Indiana will allow members to seek authorization for residential IMD stays based on a statewide average length of stay of thirty (30) days. The State will be pursuing a bundled per diem payment based upon the approved ASAM level of care. The funding autho rity will be the 1115 SUD waiver. The bundled rate methodology for both Level 3.1 and 3.5 residential services will initially be based around a mix of current MRO services that is most appropriate to that particular level of care. Consistent with the thera pies offered according to ASAM Level 3.1 and Level 3.5 treatment, the following table summarizes the individual services that will be incorporated into the bundled payment rate: Service Unit Type MRO Service Cost Per Unit Individual/Family Therapy Hour H0004 $108.97 Group Therapy Hour H0004 (Group) $27.23 Skills Training and Development Hour H2014 $104.56 Medication Training and Support Hour H0034 $74.48 Peer Recovery Supports Hour H0038 $34.20 Case Management Hour T1016 $58.12 Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 13 Drug Testing Encounter 80101 $19.03 Through a rigorous analysis from Milliman, the following daily bundled rates will be utilized: Level 3.1 (clinically managed low -intensity residential) o Adult - $126.46 per day o Child - $130.37 per day Level 3.5 (clinically managed high -intensity residential) o Adult - $361.65 per day o Child - $439.56 per day Only facilities that have been designated by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA) as an ASAM Level 3.1 or Level 3.5 residential facility will be eligible to r eceive reimbursement from Indiana Medicaid. The development of improved certification requirements and ASAM designation for these facilities will be addressed under a later section of the implementation plan. Indiana Medicaid will be developing a new provi der specialty for residential addiction treatment facilities that have been certified by DMHA and designated at ASAM Level 3.1 or Level 3.5. The State anticipates having this new provider specialty, along with all other necessary system changes for the fee- for-service and managed care populations, complete ahead of a March 1, 2018 implementation. To allow adequate time for facilities to complete the DMHA designation process and to separately enroll as this new provider specialty, Indiana Medicaid will give currently enrolled facilities until July 1, 2018 to complete these steps; any facility seeking reimbursement for residential services after that time will be required to complete the previous two steps ahead of reimbursement. Indiana Medicaid will also pur sue conversations with our managed care entities to ensure that each health plan is basing admission decisions for residential treatment on the six dimensions of the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. The managed care entities, as well as Indiana Medicaid's fee-for-service prior authorization vendor, will be allowed to utilize any evidence -based clinical decision system that incorporates all six specific dimensions of life care, as articulated in the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. These six dimensions include: Acute intoxication and/or withdrawal potential Biomedical conditions and complications Emotional, behavioral, or cognitive conditions and complications Readiness to change Relapse, continued use, or continued problem potential Recovery environment A list of action items and expected implementation timeline regarding residential treatment is provided in the table below: Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 14 Action Implementation Timeline Make necessary system changes to CoreMMIS to enroll residential addiction facilities and to reimburse for residential treatment Will be completed by March 1, 2018 Develop provider communication over new benefits Ongoing as part of roll -out; formal communication will be released with at least 30 days-notice ahead of launch Level of care: 3.7/4.0 (Medically Monitored Intensive Inpatient / Medically Managed Intensive Inpatient) Summary of Action Items: Conversation with MCEs regarding authorization criteria Consider change in reimbursement from DRG -based payment to per diem payment Current State: Due to the same federal regulatory restriction, Indiana Medicaid is prohibited from seeking federal financial participation (FFP) for treatment in IMDs for individuals aged 21 through 64 for inpatient treatment. Since July 2016, our managed care ent ities have had the authority to reimburse for inpatient IMD stays in lieu of services or settings covered under the State Plan. Indiana Medicaid does currently reimburse for inpatient treatment for substance use and chemical dependency treatment based upon a diagnosis -related group (DRG) payment methodology. Indiana Medicaid's managed care entities, as well as the fee- for-service prior authorization vendor, utilize evidenced- based clinical criteria for admission standards to inpatient treatment. Future State: Upon approval of the 1115 waiver, Indiana Medicaid will be able to reimburse for inpatient stays in IMD settings for all populations (fee -for-service and managed care). Indiana will allow members to seek authorization for inpatient IMD stays for lengths of stay of up to fifteen (15) days. During the latter part of 2018, Indiana Medicaid will consider reimbursing substance use -related inpatient stays on a per diem basis. This would allow providers to receive payment based upon the number of days, as well as the intensity of treatment, for which an individual is seeking treatment. Indiana Medicaid will review its State Plan to determine if a SPA is necessary for this change and pursue the amendment accordingly. The managed care entities, as well as Indiana Medicaid's fee- for-service prior authorization vendor, will be allowed to utilize any evidence -based clinical decision system for inpatient stays that incorporates all six specific dimensions of life care, as articulated in the ASAM Patient Placement Crite ria. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 15 A list of action items and expected implementation timeline regarding intensive inpatient services is provided in the table below: Action Implementation Timeline Determine final action and necessary system changes to CoreMMIS to allow reimbursement for inpatient SUD stays on a per diem basis Fall 2018 Develop provider communication over changes in reimbursement structure Ongoing as part of roll -out; formal communication will be released with at least 30 days-notice ahead of launch Sub Support Service - Addiction Recovery Management Services Summary of Action Items: Pursue State Plan Amendment CoreMMIS system changes Pursue amendment to IAC Provider communication Current State: Indiana currently does not have coverage for addiction recovery management services. As previously described under Outpatient Services, mental health treatment is available through a Medicaid Rehabilitation Option (MRO) package of services, but these new services will be available specifically for su bstance use treatment. Future State: Indiana will be pursuing a State Plan Amendment to use the same federal authority (Section 1905 (a)(13)(C) of the Social Security Act) that currently authorizes MRO services to reimburse for Addiction Recovery Management Services. These services include the following: Peer Recovery Support Recovery -Focused Case Management These services will be individually reimbursable services using the following tentative criteria: Peer Recovery Support Recovery -Focused Case Management Coding H0038 (SUD modifier) T1016 (SUD modifier) Provider Types Addiction Peer Recovery Coach Other licensed professionals will be allowed to provide this service as long as they are trained as an Addiction Peer Recovery Coach. Licensed professionals o Psychiatrist o Licensed Addiction Counselor (LAC) o Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) o Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC) o Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) o Licensed Clinical Addiction Counselor (LCAC) Qualified Behavioral Health Provider (QBHP) Eligibility All Indiana Medicaid members (except for those eligible only for family planning services, emergency services, or QMB -only/SLMB -only/QI coverage) Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 16 A list of action items and expected implementation timeline regarding Addiction Recovery Management Services is provided in the table below: Action Implementation Timeline Make necessary system changes to allow reimbursement for Addiction Recovery Management Services Spring 2018 Pursue State Plan Amendment (SPA) to add coverage and reimbursement of services* *coverage of services will begin upon approval of SPA Spring 2018 Pursue Indiana Administrative Code changes to add coverage of services Will be filed by December 31, 2018 Develop provider communication over new benefits Ongoing as part of roll -out; formal communication will be released with at least 30 days-notice ahead of launch Sub Support Service - Supportive Housing Services Summary of Action Items: Create collaborative workgroup Develop rate methodology CoreMMIS system changes Provider communication Current State: Indiana Medicaid currently provides no coverage for supportive housing services. Future State: Using the 1115 SUD waiver as a funding mechanism, Indiana will be pursuing coverage of supportive housing services. Indiana is using CMCS Informational Bulletin: Coverage of Housing- Related Activities and Services for Individuals with Disabilities as a template for the services that wi ll be offered. The services will fall under two broad categories: services for individuals transitioning to housing, and services for individuals to help sustain their housing status. Indiana envisions the following activities falling under each category: Transitioning Services Must meet medical necessity (have a primary or secondary diagnosis of substance use disorder) Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 17 o Identification of resources to help cover the security deposit, moving costs, environmental modifications, and other one -time expenses o Tenant screening and housing assessment to identify individual's preferences and barriers related to successful tenancy o Assistance with housing application or housing search process o Assistance with arranging for and supporting details of the move o Development of a housing support crisis plan Sustaining Services o Early identification and intervention for behaviors that may jeopardize housing o Education and training on the roles, rights, and responsibilities of a tenant and landlord o Coaching on key relationships with landlords and property managers o Assistance with resolving disputes with landlords o Assistance with housing recertification process o Training in being a good tenant and lease compliance In May 2017, Indiana Medicaid participated in a day -long summit on the topic of supportive housing. The summit was hosted by one of Indiana Medic aid's MCEs and was attended by representatives from all four of the MCEs along with various stakeholders representing housing. This summit was used to lay the foundation for a larger commitment to exploring supportive housing opportunities throughout the r emainder of 2017. Indiana will utilize time throughout 2018 to get a better understanding of the terminology surrounding supportive housing. Indiana Medicaid will then invite representatives from each of the MCEs, the Indiana Housing and Community Developm ent Authority (IHCDA), and other interested stakeholders to continue the efforts begun in May 2017 towards developing a supportive housing solution. Indiana Medicaid will provide ongoing updates to CMS as required to demonstrate progress towards a final solution. Withdrawal Management Services (Inpatient Detoxification) Summary of Action Items: Conversation with MCEs regarding authorization criteria Current State Indiana Medicaid currently reimburses for withdrawal management services (known as inpatient detoxification). Indiana does not address distinctions among the various withdrawal management levels of care according to the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. During the 2016 legislative session, the Indiana General Assembly passed Senate Enrolled Act 297, which required the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (OMPP) to establish inpatient detoxification admission criteria in accordance with either: Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 18 The most current edition of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Patient Placement Criteria; or Other clinical criteria that are determined by the office and are evidenced based and peer reviewed. Indiana Medicaid released BT201632 announcing that inpatient detoxification criteria may be based upon one of the following: Milliman Care Guid elines InterQual Criteria American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Patient Placement Criteria Anthem Clinical Utilization Management (UM) Guidelines Future State: Indiana will continue requiring the usage of the criteria outlined in BT201632 . Similar to authorization requirements for residential and other inpatient treatment, the managed care entities, as well as Indiana Medicaid's fee -for-service prior authorization vendor, will be allowed to utilize any evidence -based clinical decision system that incorporates all six specific dimensions of life care, as articulated in the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. Use of Evidenced -Based SUD -Specific Patient Pla cement Criteria In addition to newly covered addiction treatment services, Indiana is incorporating established standards of care for medical necessity criteria and provider qualifications. Specifically, Indiana will be incorporating the ASAM Criteria into both prior authorization requests for services as well as certification for residential providers. Indiana will accomplish this through administrative rule changes, policy manual updates, and contract amendments. Patient Assessment Individuals seeking substance use treatment for all ASAM levels of care, including residential and inpatient, will be required to undergo a psychosocial assessment that will be used for the completion of a plan of treatment. As part of the assessment, providers will be required to address all six dimensions of multidimensional assessment, including the following: Acute intoxication and/or withdrawal potential Biomedical conditions and complications Emotional, behavioral, or cognitive conditions and complications Readiness to change Relapse, continued use, or continued problem potential Recovery/living environment Each of the six dimensions plays a critical role in assigning an individual to the most appropriate level of care, including residential or inpatient treatment. As p art of any prior authorization Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 19 request, providers will be required to submit assessments that address all six dimensions. Indiana Medicaid will work with its managed care partners to develop a standard template that will be submitted with e very authorization request for an SUD -specific service. The template will be organized according to the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria and will help guide providers towards the most appropriate level of care for a member. As previously mentioned, Indiana Medicaid currently utilizes the CANS and ANSA assessment tools to determine an individual's placement with an MRO package of services. Indiana Medicaid will work closely with DMHA to review these tools and align them closer with the ASAM Criteria. DMHA wil l pursue opportunities to provide education to Indiana's provider community around the appropriate use of the ASAM Criteria. This will include ongoing outreach to Indiana's ASAM chapter as well as the utilization of national ASAM resources. Utilization Man agement Once an eligible licensed professional has completed a psychosocial assessment for individuals needing substance use treatment, those findings must be confirmed by an independent third party that has the necessary competencies to use the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. Services at ASAM Level 2 and above will require prior authorization through either Cooperative Managed Care Services (CMCS) - the fee -for-service prior authorization vendor - or one of our four managed care entities. All service level of care and length of stay requests will be authorized using the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. Each vendor will be allowed to utilize any evidence -based system for clinical guidelines that incorporates the medical criteria required for an individual t o meet an ASAM level of care. Indiana will review each of its managed care partners' contracts and pursue amendments to formalize the usage of the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria as well as any other changes necessary as a result of the 1115 SUD demonstration waiver. These amendments will be used to ensure that members have access to SUD services at the most appropriate level of care, that interventions are appropriate for the diagnosis and level of care, and that providers receive an independent process for reviewing placement in residential treatment settings. Each of Indiana Medicaid's managed care entities (MCEs) are contractually obligated to operate and maintain a utilization management program. This allows each MCE to place limits on coverag e on the basis of medical necessity or utilization control criteria. The State requires the usage of a nationally recognized set of guidelines for its medical management criteria, which may include InterQual, Milliman Care Guidelines, or any other accepted set of evidence -based guidelines. When utilizing a set of guidelines for residential and inpatient addictions treatment, each MCE will be required to demonstrate incorporation of the six dimensions of multidimensional assessment, as outlined in the ASAM P atient Placement Criteria. While each MCE is allowed to decide which nationally recognize set of guidelines to use for its medical management criteria, all MCEs are required to utilize the Indiana Health Coverage Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 20 Programs Prior Authorization Request Form . To help facilitate prior authorization requests for addiction treatment servic es in alignment with the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria, Indiana Medicaid will work with the MCEs to develop an additional form that will assist providers in requesting approval for the usage of the most appropriate level of care for an individual (as indicated in the previous section). Additionally, as discussed in the previous section, Indiana is expecting to update the ANSA assessment tool to be used by all SUD providers as the multidimensional assessment required by the ASAM Criteria to ensure that ind ividuals are placed in the most appropriate level of care. The MCEs are expected to use additional utilization review processes to ensure that services are medically necessary. Each MCE is required to have policies and procedures in place to review instanc es of over - and under -utilization of emergency room services and other health care services, identify aberrant provider practice patterns, ensure active participation of a utilization review committee, evaluate efficiency and appropriateness of service del ivery, and identify quality of care issues. All of these processes are especially critical to the State's efforts around combatting substance use. A list of action items and expected implementation timeline related to patient assessment and utilization man agement is provided in the table below: Action Implementation Timeline Provider education on ASAM Criteria Ongoing throughout 2018 Development of standard prior authorization SUD treatment form Completed by July 1, 2018 Review contracts and pursue amendments where necessary Filed by July 1, 2018 Review CANS/ANSA for alignment with ASAM Criteria Completed by December 31, 2018 Use of Nationally Recognized SUD -Specific Program Standards for Residential Treatment Indiana's current residential facilit y certification requirements are not designed to support residential facilities as treatment facilities. They do not adequately meet the standards placed by the ASAM Criteria. Rather than focus on treatment requirements for services rendered within a resid ential facility, current certification focuses on resident rights, physical building attributes and basic health/nutrition needs of residents. As a result of this insufficiency, Indiana does not have a definitive breakdown of providers by ASAM Criteria -approved level of care. To remedy this problem, DMHA is developing new administrative rules that align residential facility certification with the higher standards of the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. Providers who are wishing to receive reimbursement from Indiana Medicaid for residential services will need to be designated by DMHA as either an ASAM Level 3.1 or Level 3.5 facility. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 21 The Indiana Administrative Code will be updated with specific requirements around the setting, provider type, t reatment goals, and therapies required at the appropriate level of care. Because the rulemaking process can take upwards of twelve to eighteen months for promulgation, DMHA is proposing to issue provisional ASAM designations until the new certification req uirements have been promulgated. Between May and September 2017, DMHA and Indiana Medicaid visited each current residential facility to begin discussions on both the new coverage authorized through the 1115 SUD waiver as well as the new certification requi rements. Ahead of each meeting, DMHA delivered a one- page memo along with a four - page questionnaire that providers were asked to complete ahead of the formal on- site visit with the provider. The completion of the questionnaire will assist DMHA in assignin g a provisional ASAM Level of Care designation to the facility. In late 2017, DMHA will be prepared to issue guidance to its currently certified residential facilities around the requirement of the ASAM designation. DMHA will begin accepting documentation and issuing provisional designations in early 2018. This designation will be instrumental during the implementation of a new Indiana Medicaid provider specialty, as discussed in the next section. Finally, DMHA will spend much of 2018 reworking its Indiana Administrative Code language for residential certification to incorporate all required aspects of the ASAM Criteria, including a requirement that residential facilities offer medication -assisted treatment (MAT) on -site or through facilitated access off -site. A list of action items and expected implementation timeline related to standards for residential facilities is provided in the table below: Action Implementation Timeline Finalize process for provisional ASAM designation Will be completed by December 31, 2017 Insert permanent certification language in Indiana Administrative Code Will be filed by December 31, 2018 Sufficient Provider Capacity at Critical Levels of Care Network adequacy is a critical concern for the success of the 1115 SUD waiver. DMHA certifies all mental health and addiction providers in Indiana. For purposes of the 1115 SUD waiver, Indiana will address two current certifications: Addiction Treatment Services Provider (Regular) - an agency with eleven or more direct service staff Addiction Treatment Services Provider (Outpatient) - an agency with ten or fewer direct service staff/volunteers/contract workers Addiction Treatment Services Provider (Regular) The State has identified 80 facilities that are certified by DMHA as Addiction Treatment Services Providers (Regular). This group of facilities includes residential facilities, psychiatric Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 22 hospitals, acute care hospitals (and wings of acute care hospitals), and opioid treatment programs. Due to the previously -mentio ned 2015 state law change, nearly all of Indiana's opioid treatment programs (OTPs) are now enrolled with Indiana Medicaid. A new provider specialty for OTPs has been developed and went active in September 2017. Indiana will continue to pursue the remainin g programs, as well as any new clinics that open in the coming months, for Medicaid enrollment. The largest provider enrollment challenge facing Indiana Medicaid is the enrollment of residential facilities. Nearly all of the currently -enrolled facilities a re community mental health centers (CMHCs) or outpatient mental health clinics with a limited number of residential beds; many facilities would not meet the standards of a psychiatric hospital or an outpatient clinic, and without reimbursement for resident ial stays, these facilities have had no incentive to enroll with Indiana Medicaid. In addition to pursuing updated certification standards that meet the ASAM Criteria, Indiana will also be creating a new provider specialty for residential addictions facili ties. To enroll with Indiana Medicaid, these facilities will be required to be certified by DMHA as a residential sub -acute facility and will also be designated by DMHA as an ASAM Level 3.1 or 3.5 facility. By meeting the ASAM designation, these facilities will automatically meet the qualification to be certified as an Addiction Treatment Services Provider (Regular). Addiction Treatment Services Provider (Outpatient) The State has identified 161 organizations that are licensed as Addiction Treatment Services Provider (Outpatient). Many of these organizations are not enrolled as IHCP providers. Many are believed to be small office practices that are not overseen by a physician or HSPP, preventing Medicaid reimbursement. These addictions providers must have qualified staff and must perform at least outpatient treatment services and may provide intensive outpatient treatment services to those individuals with whom assessments indicate a need for those services. Indiana Medicaid may consider creating additiona l provider specialties for these office- based outpatient addictions providers. Provider Enrollment Indiana Medicaid enrolls its behavioral health providers using one of the following provider types and specialties: Type 01 (Hospital) - Specialty 011 (Psychiatric) Type 11 (Mental Health) - Specialty 110 (Outpatient Mental Health Clinic) Type 11 (Mental Health) - Specialty 111 (Community Mental Health Center) Type 11 (Mental Health) - Specialty 114 (Health Service Provider in Psychology) Type 31 (Physic ian) - Specialty 339 (Psychiatrist) Type 35 (Addiction Services) - Specialty 835 (Opioid Treatment Program) As indicated above, many of the Addiction Treatment Services Providers (Outpatient) are considered mid- level practitioners and are not enrolled with Indiana Medicaid. Additionally, Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 23 some providers enrolled under one of these provider specialties may only provide mental health and not addiction treatment. Both pose a challenge towards understanding access to addiction services. Indiana Medicaid will take several measures to ensure sufficient provider capacity: We will pursue stronger data analytics around our provider capacity. This will begin by determining, by provider specialty, how many providers are capab le of providing each ASAM level of care. We will determine the correct system specifications to determine both who is capable of billing a specific level of care and who is actually billing a specific level of care. We will track this information over the course of the demonstration. We will also complete a full assessment of the availability of medication -assisted treatment (MAT) for Indiana Medicaid members. This will include identifying the number and locations of all Indiana Medicaid providers who have the appropriate buprenorphine training for prescribing MAT. We will also consider adding additional provider specialties to account for more mid- level practitioners, including licensed behavioral health professionals. Overall Provider Strategy Indiana's p rovider community is new to the principles of the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. As a result, the State will take a multi- tiered approach to bring our providers closer in alignment with ASAM principles: From summer 2017 through the remainder of the year, the State will visit each residential addictions facility to begin a dialog around Medicaid reimbursement for residential treatment as well as the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria. This discussion will assist the State in assigning a provisional ASAM Level of Care designation, as previously discussed. By early 2018, Indiana Medicaid will have completed all necessary system modifications to ensure that residential addictions facilities are able to enroll and receive reimbursement for addictions service rende red. This will be communicated through Indiana Medicaid's provider website as well as an IHCP Provider Bulletin. Also by early 2018, Indiana Medicaid will have developed new training material on the 1115- approved services as well as provider enrollment for interested residential facilities. This material will be included as part of quarterly and annual IHCP provider workshops. By the end of the first quarter 2018, Indiana Medicaid will have developed the data analytics required to assess utilization of services by ASAM level. This analysis will be completed quarterly in anticipation of a full assessment of member access to all ASAM levels of care by the end of 2018. This will also include the availability of medication- assisted treatment. Throughout 2018, upon approval of new administrative certification rules, all residential facilities will be able to receive an ASAM designation. The finalized designation will be Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 24 parallel to an ongoing effort at educating providers on the use of the ASAM P atient Placement Criteria to ensure that individuals seeking treatment are placed at the most appropriate level of care. A list of action items and expected implementation timeline related sufficient provider capacity is provided in the table below: Actio n Implementation Timeline Create new provider specialty for residential addictions facilities Will be completed by March 1, 2018 Data reporting by provider specialty and ASAM level of care Will be completed by March 31, 2018 Assessment of ASAM providers and services Will be completed by December 31, 2018 Implementation of Comprehensive Treatment and Prevention Strategies to Address Opioid Abuse Governor's Task Force on Drug Enforcement, Treatment, and Prevention On September 1, 2015, then- Governor Mike Pence issued Executive Order 15 -09, establishing the Governor's Task Force on Drug Enforcement, Treatment, and Prevention to identify best practices and make informed recommendations for policy makers. The task force included membership from the Indiana General Assembly, the Governor's Office, the Indiana State Department of Health, the Indiana Department of Correction, the Indiana Department of Child Services, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, and other organizations and associations throughout Indiana. The group held multiple regional public meetings to hear from individuals affected by substance use disorders, local and state government officials, law enforcement, and other community leaders. On December 5, 2016, the task force completed its work and issued a final rep ort detailing all of their findings along with 17 actionable recommendations for lawmakers and state agencies to consider. The following list includes all recommendations identified by the group: Enforcement Recommendations: 1. Support legislation to enhance penalties for persons dealing drugs convicted of serious and aggravated offenses. 2. Direct the Indiana Department of Correction to work with Starke and other northwest Indiana counties to pilot and adopt the Regional Therapeutic Communities program, which provides more treatment options for local officials in addressing addiction. 3. Direct the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute (CJI) and the Indiana Division of Mental Health & Addiction (DMHA) to identify a county criminal justice entity and implement a therap eutic substance use disorder treatment program for offenders awaiting adjudication and for those service sentences while in jail. Treatment Recommendations: Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 25 4. Direct the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) to implement the Gold Card program, which removes administrative burdens by allowing qualified physicians the ability to prescribe medications without prior authorization (while still following the established criterion). 5. Direct the FSSA to pursue a Medicaid 1115 Demonstration Waiver for individuals with substance use disorders to broaden Indiana Medicaid benefit packages and provide a more comprehensive continuum of covered services and care. 6. Direct appropriate entities to promulgate and adopt with all expediency chron ic pain prescribing rules for all prescribers. 7. Direct the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) to work with appropriate entities including those that represent physicians, nurses, dentists, physician assistants, podiatrists, and veterinarians to devel op guidelines for prescribing acute pain medications. Endorse opioid and controlled substance prescribing guidelines for emergency departments as part of a larger strategy to combat prescription drug abuse in Indiana. 8. Direct the ISDH to convene a working g roup to send recommendations on improvements and best practices related to INSPECT - Indiana's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program - to the INSPECT Oversight Committee. 9. Direct the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency (PLA) to begin implementing a pilot program, the INSPECT Integration Initiative, to allow for the integration of INSPECT data with hospital patient records. 10. Direct the PLA to request that the INSPECT Oversight Committee explore possible measures to increase access to INSPECT for prescribers and dispensers. 11. Direct state agencies to raise awareness of Aaron's Law. 12. Direct the Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) to identify gaps in naloxone availability compared with overdose demographics. 13. Support legislation that would amend state law to require ISDH to issue a standing order for the dispensing of an overdose intervention drug, such as naloxone, and to expand the state's LifeLine Law to include immunity beyond alcohol offenses. 14. Direct the ISDH to implement a central repository naloxone distribution program for first responders should Indiana experience increased numbers of overdoses that would deplete local responders' supplies. 15. Support legislation that would modify the Governor's Commission for a Drug -Free Indiana in a way that maintain s support for Local Coordinating Councils but brings together state agencies and stakeholders to address the drug abuse issues Indiana is facing today. 16. Direct the Indiana Department of Workforce Development to work closely with existing youth assistance pr ograms and identify best practice models to replicate statewide. 17. Request the Commission for Improving the Status of Children make recommendations through its Educational Outcomes Task Force and Substance Abuse and Child Safety Task Force on the following: developing an age -appropriate substance abuse Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 26 curriculum for students, and finding ways to better connect affected youth with substance abuse services. Gold Card Program Indiana Medicaid implemented a Gold Card program in late 2015. This allows qualified Indiana Medicaid prescribers to be exempt from prior authorization document submission requirements for individual Indiana Medicaid members when prescribing buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone. The Gold Card program currently has 16 p rescribers. The following requirements currently apply to each prescriber: Must be an enrolled IHCP provider Must be licensed to practice medicine in the State of Indiana and be in good standing with the Indiana PLA and FSSA Must hold one of the following certifications: o A subspecialty board certification in addiction psychiatry from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) o An addiction medicine certification from the American Board of Addiction Medicine (ABAM) o A certification of added qualification (CAQ) in addiction medicine from the American Osteopathic Association Must comply with all applicable Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to the prescribing of controlled substances, including buprenorphine and buprenorphine/nal oxone Must agree to comply with all current IHCP buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone criteria as set forth by State and Federal law and the FSSA or its designee Must maintain complete medical records for individual IHCP members documenting criteria compliance Must commit to IHCP audits, occurring at the discretion of FSSA Must immediately inform FSSA, through its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), of any change in qualification status Must agree that the FSSA reserves the right to withdraw the prescribe r from participation in this program Buprenorphine Prior Authorization Criteria For non- Gold card members, Indiana Medicaid adopted specific prior authorization criteria for prescriptions of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone (also known as Suboxone) . The criteria is now used by all of the MCEs' PBMs. These products may be approved for up to six months at a time, with a member receiving a 34 -day supply at a time. The following authorization criteria applies for both fee -for-service and managed care members: Patient must be 16 years of age or older Physician must meet all qualifications to prescribe buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 27 Patient must have a diagnosis of opiate dependence/addiction Physician must verify that the risks of using buprenorphine/naloxone with alcohol or benzodiazepines have been explained to the patient Physician must verify that there are not untreated or unstable psychiatric conditions that would interfere with buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine compliance For pregnant members, physician must explain choice of buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine over alternatives Physician must provide documentation of the patient's referral to or active involvement in formal counseling with a licensed behavioral health provider. Indiana Attorney General's Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Task Force The Indiana Attorney General's Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Task Force is a separate task force created in September 2012 by then -Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller to focus on five key components: 1. Providing education regarding the safe and appr opriate prescribing and use of opioids for medical providers 2. Reducing drug diversion 3. Ensuring sustainability with the state's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (INSPECT) 4. Increasing availability of disposal sites for unused controlled substances 5. Improvin g access to treatment and recovery for those suffering from addiction The task force published a four -year report in Decem ber 2016. Many of the same objectives identified by the Governor's Task Force were acted upon by this task force. The four -year report detailed many legislative accomplishments, including the following: Obtained a long -term funding solution for INSPECT by moving 100% of the funds generated by the Controlled Substance Registrations back into the program Required licensing boards to establish opioid prescribing guidelines for chronic pain Required methadone clinics to check INSPECT before prescribing Required pharmacists to report dispensing data to INPSECT within 24 hours Created immunity for first responders and lay persons to administer naloxone Allowed for Syringe Exchange Programs to be implemented in counties at risk of HIV or Hep C outbreaks Appropriate d $30 million to the Mental Health and Addiction Forensic Treatment Services account (administered by DMHA) for addiction services for those convicted of a felony Prescribing Guidelines In 2014, the Indiana Medical Licensing Board issued final rules establ ishing the standards and protocols for physicians in the prescribing of opioid controlled substances for pain management Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 28 treatment. These standards are outlined in 844 IAC 5 -6. The rules apply for individuals who have been prescribed one of the following: More than sixty (60) opioid- containing pills a month for more than three (3) consecutive months A morphine equivalent dose of more than fifteen (15) milligrams per day for more than three (3) consecutive months A transdermal opioid patch for more than three (3) consecutive months A tramadol dose reaching a morphine equivalent of more than sixty (60) milligrams per day for more than three (3) consecutive months An extende d release opioid medication that is not in an abuse deterrent form for which an FDA -approved abuse deterrent form is available Additionally, in response to Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 297 (2016) , DMHA created clinical practice guidelines for office- based opiate treatment. These guidelines have been distributed to OMPP, the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency, and each of the MCEs. The guidelines have been attached as an appendix to this implementation report. The Indiana General Assembly also passed Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 226 (2017) , which limited the prescription supply for opioids to only seven days for adults who are prescribed an opioid for the first time as well as for children under the age of 18. Expanded Access to Naloxone In 2015, the Indiana General Assembly passed Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 406 (2015) , which significantly expanded the number of people who can have access to a prescription for Naloxone. Passage of the law allowed a person at risk for overdose or any individual who knows someone who may b e at risk for overdosing to receive a prescription for the medication. In 2016, this law was further amended through Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 187 (2016) that required the State Health Commissioner to issue a statewide standing order for the dispensing of naloxone. This further expanded access by allowing any individual to walk into a pharmacy for a prescription of naloxone without having to see a physician or other qualified prescriber first. Naloxone (Narcan) is considered a preferred drug through Indiana Medicaid's pharmacy benefit. In determining ways of expanded access to naloxone further, Indiana Medicaid is exploring ways to allow emergency responders to receive reimbursement for the administration of naloxone. Indiana Medicaid does not currently enroll paramedics or emergency responders directly; rather, Indiana Medicaid enrolls transportation providers, including ambulances and common carrier providers. Indiana will consider releasing guidance allowing a physician to bill for the administration of naloxone on behalf of an emergency responder as well as consider enrolling emergency responders directly. A list of action items and expected implementation timeline related to the expansion of naloxone for overdose reversal is included below: Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 29 Action Implementation Timeline Consider options for emergency responder reimbursement of naloxone Will be completed in early 2018 Prescription Drug Monitoring Program On August 24, 2017, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb announced a major statewide initiative around incorporating the State's prescription drug monitoring program (knowing as INSPECT) directly into health care systems' electronic health reco rds. Once fully integrated, practitioners will no longer be required to use multiple portals to access information around the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances. Initial efforts at integration were made through Deaconness Midtown hospital in Evansville, Indiana; due to that system's success, the effort is being pushed across the entire state. Within three years, Indiana hopes to have all of its hospital systems fully integrated with INSPECT. Taken as a whole, these efforts demonstrate the S tate's commitment to using all available resources (legislative changes, state regulations, certification, members within the community) for multiple strategies towards addressing both prescription drug use and opioid use disorder. All of these efforts should provide assurance to CMS that Indiana has a sufficient health IT infrastructure at every appropriate level to achieve the goals of this demonstration. Improved Care Coordination and Transitions Between Levels of Care Indiana Medicaid places contractual obligations on each of its managed care entities (MCEs) around case management and care coordination. The following list details each of those obligations: Each MCE must provide case management services for any member at risk for inpatient psychiatric or substance use hospitalization; for members discharged from an inpatient psychiatric or substance use hospitalization, case management services must be provided for at least 90 calendar days following the hospitalization. Each MCE must schedule an outpatient follow -up appointment to occur no later than seven calendar days following a psychiatric or substance use hospitalization discharge. Case managers are assigned to ensure that each new member already receiving behavioral health services is linked to an appropriate behavioral health provider. Case managers must also consult with both a member's physical and behavioral health provider(s) to facilities the sharing of clinical information With appropriate consent, case managers are required to notify all providers when a member is hospitalized or receives emergency treatment for behavioral health issues, including substance use within five calendar days of the admission or emergency treatment. Each MCE is required to have policies and procedures in pla ce to facilitate the reciprocal exchange of health information between physical and behavioral providers treating a Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 30 member. This information sharing must include primary and secondary diagnoses, findings from assessments, medication prescri bed, psychotherapy prescribed, and other relevant information. Each MCE is required to send a behavioral health profile to a member's primary medical provider (PMP) on a quarterly basis. Information about substance use treatment may only be released only with a member's consent, per 42 CFR Part 2 standards. The MCEs also use advanced data analytics to help identify who may be at risk for substance use. The MCEs utilize ER claims, pharmacy claims, diagnosis codes, health needs assessments, and other tools to help predict individuals who may be high risk and high cost in a given year. Depending upon the level of risk assigned to an individual, a person may be given 1:1 care coordination. Another idea that some of Indiana Medicaid's MCEs utilize is having poi nts of contact housed within state's community mental health centers. These points of contact work with their members to facilitate the transition among the various levels of behavioral health services. Indiana believes it can take additional steps to ensu re a smooth transition for individuals moving between levels of care: While our current contracts with our MCEs require case management services for individuals transitioning from inpatient hospital stays, Indiana will pursue conversations and additional c ontract amendments to ensure that this obligation extends to individuals transitioning from residential treatment facilities. Upon release from an inpatient or residential level of treatment, Indiana believes individuals gain strength on the road to recove ry through their relationships with others who have experienced the same difficulties. Indiana Medicaid is choosing to expand its coverage of peer recovery coaches as a way of helping individuals connect with professional and nonprofessional services and r esources that are available in their community. This will be especially important for Traditional Medicaid members who do not have the resources available through the MCEs. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 31 Appendix: Best Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorders These best practice guidelines were developed in response to Indiana Senate Enrolled Act (SEA) 297 & SEA 214 (2016). The intent of the guidelines is to provide a standard of care for the treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs) in the State of Indiana and will be sent to the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency, the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning, and the managed care organizations contracted with the Office for implementation. Practice standards were determined through a review of exis ting guidelines and research base. The Indiana guidelines are intended to quickly assist providers in locating up to date, accurate and useful information. Leslie Hulvershorn, MD, Medical Director at the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMH A), was the primary author. Information was then reviewed within DMHA and was circulated for review to stakeholders, such as Mental Health America of Indiana, Addiction Psychiatry faculty and fellows from the Indiana University School of Medicine, and Clea nSlate Centers. This guide applies to inpatient and office -based opioid treatment (OBOT) providers and Opioid Treatment Providers (OTPs; i.e., \"methadone clinics\") in their use of buprenorphine and naltrexone. Sections within quoted material marked by \"[te xt in italics]\" should be interpreted as additional text provided by the authors of the Indiana guidelines, not a part of the originally published material (e.g., American Society of Addiction Medicine guidelines). These guidelines are not intended to be a substitute for formal medical training in the treatment of substance use disorders. The definition of 'physician' in these guidelines includes all DATA -waved clinicians who prescribe buprenorphine for addiction treatment legally under their license in Indiana. Abbreviations American Psychiatric Association = APA American Society of Addiction Medicine = ASAM Medication assisted treatment= MAT Opioid use disorders= OUDs Office -based opioid treatment = OBOT (e.g., DATA waived physicians) Opioid treatment pr ograms=OTPs (Require particular license from DEA; Offer daily supervised dosing of methadone, and other medications) Guideline Summary: Comprehensive treatment, including medication assisted treatment (MAT), is an effective response to opioid use disorde r (OUD). The use of medications, in combination with behavioral therapies, provides a whole -patient approach to the treatment of substance use disorders. Individuals receiving MAT often demonstrate dramatic improvement in addiction- related behaviors and ps ychosocial functioning. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 32 The opioid use disorder treatment protocol shall have the goal of opioid abstinence when appropriate or, if not possible, the minimal clinically necessary dose of medication. Treatment providers shall provide themselves, or through referral, comprehensive treatment options, including: 1. Opioid 5. Long acting, nonaddictive medication assisted treatment medications. Treatment for opioid use disorders shall be comprehensive and include: 1. Initial and periodic behavioral health assessments for each patient; 2. Informed consent from a concerning all available opioid treatment options, including each option's potential benefits and risks, before prescribing medication; 3. Appropriate use of providing overdose reversal medication, relapse prevention, counseling and ancillary services; 4. Transitioning off agonist and partial agonist therapies, when appropriate, with the goal of opioid abstinence. Section 1. Assess ment and Diagnosis of opioid use disorders for Office- based opioid treatment (OBOT) providers Introduction: In order to appropriately assess for opioid use disorders, as well as co -occurring mental health, other substance use disorders and physical health, best practices have been reviewed. Essential information about these best practices is as follows: . For any provider treating opioid use disorders (OUDs), the following practices are recommended for assessment and diagnosis. Assessment & Diagnosis Recom mendations (excerpted from American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Guidelines [1]): Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 33 \"(1) First clinical priority should be given to identifying and making appropriate referral for any urgent or emergent medical or psychiatric problem(s), including drug related impairment or overdose. (2) Completion of the patient's medical history should include screening for concomitant medical conditions including infectious diseases (hepatitis, HIV, and TB), acute trauma, and pregnancy. [If the provider does not provide this type of medical screening, the patient should be referred to a provider who does and any findings (if not readily identifiable in the medical record) should be reported to the provider treating the OUDs.] (3) A physical examination should be completed as a component of the comprehensive assessment process. The prescriber (the clinician authorizing the use of a medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder) may conduct this physical examination him/herself, or, in accordance with the ASAM Standards, [refer to another provider to] ensure that a current physical examination is contained within the patient medical record before a patient is started on a new medication for the treatment of his/her addiction. (4) Initial laboratory tes ting should include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and tests for hepatitis C and HIV. Testing for TB and sexually transmitted infections should also be considered. Hepatitis B vaccination should be offered, if appropriate. (5) The assessment of women presents special considerations regarding their reproductive health. Women of childbearing age should be tested for pregnancy, and all women of childbearing potential and age should be queried regarding methods of contraception, given the increase in fertility that results from effective opioid use disorder treatment. (6) Patients being evaluated for addiction involving opioid use, and/or for possible medication use in the treatment of opioid use disorder, should undergo (or have completed) an assessment of mental health status and possible psychiatric disorders (as outlined in the ASAM Standards). [Any psychiatric disorders that are identified warrant treatment, either by referral or treatment directly by the OBOT provider. Periodic mental health screens (and subsequent treatment) should be completed by the OBOT provider every 3 months, or with the emergence of psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, psychosis), whichever occurs first.] (7) Opioid use is often co- occurring with other substance related disorder s. An evaluation of past and current substance use and a determination of the totality of substances that surround the addiction should be conducted. (8) The use of marijuana, stimulants, or other addictive drugs should not be a reason to suspend opioid use di sorder treatment. However, evidence demonstrates that patients who are actively using substances during opioid use disorder treatment have a poorer prognosis. [The use of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics is a reason to suspend agonist treatment because of safety concerns related to respiratory depression. A Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 34 thirty day benzodiazepine taper should be initiated at the onset of treatment or whenever the benzodiazepine use is discovered. On occasion, if ongoing withdrawal is clearly present and documented, a ninety day benzodiazepine taper may be warranted.] (9) A tobacco use query and counseling on cessation of tobacco products and electronic nicotine delivery devices should be completed routinely for all patients, including those who pre sent for evaluation and treatment of opioid use disorder. (10) An assessment of social and environmental factors should be conducted... Addiction should be considered a bio- psycho- social -spiritual illness, for which the use of medication(s) is but only one component of overall treatment.\" Diagnostic Recommendations (excerpted from ASAM Guidelines [1]): \"(1) Other clinicians may diagnose opioid use disorder, but confirmation of the diagnosis by the provider with prescribing authority and who recommends medi cation use must be obtained before pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder commences. (2) Opioid use disorder is primarily diagnosed on the basis of the history provided by the patient and a comprehensive assessment that includes a physical examination. (3) Validated clinical scales that measure withdrawal symptoms, for example, the Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS), Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), and the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), may be used to assist in the evaluation of pa tients with opioid use disorder. (4) Urine drug testing during the comprehensive assessment process, and frequently during treatment, is recommended. The frequency of drug testing is determined by a number of factors, including the stability of the patient, the type of treatment, and the treatment setting.\" Section 2. Appropriate use of medications for the treatment of Opioid Use Disorders by OBOT Providers Introduction: Medications with a substantial evidence base supporting their efficacy in various stages of the treatment of opioid use disorders are reviewed in this section. Specifically, evidence supporting detoxification, maintenance treatment, dosing recommendations and overdose reversal are reviewed. In addition, practices lacking an evidence base are also covered here. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 35 (i) Opioid maintenance treatment options: Buprenorphine addiction consists of three phases: (1) induction, (2) stabilization, and (3) maintenance . Induction is the first stage of buprenorphine treatment and involves helping patients begin the process of switching from the opioid of abuse to buprenorphine. The goal of the induction phase is to find the minimum dose of buprenorphine at which the pati ent discontinues or markedly diminishes use of other opioids and experiences no withdrawal symptoms, minimal or no side effects, and no craving for the drug of abuse. The consensus panel recommends that the buprenorphine/naloxone combination be used for induction treatment (and for stabilization and maintenance) for most patients. The consensus panel further recommends that initial induction doses be administered as observed treatment; further doses may be provided via prescription thereafter... Pregnant wo men who are deemed to be appropriate candidates for buprenorphine treatment should be inducted and maintained on buprenorphine monotherapy. The stabilization phase has begun when a patient is experiencing no withdrawal symptoms, is experiencing minimal or no side effects, and [cravings have been significantly reduced]. Dosage adjustments may be necessary during early stabilization, and frequent contact with the patient increases the likelihood of compliance. The longest period that a patient is on buprenorp hine is the maintenance phase. This period may be indefinite. During the maintenance phase, attention must be focused on the psychosocial and family issues that have been identified during the course of treatment as contributing to a patient's addiction[, rather than on buprenorphine dose escalation.]\" (excerpted from ASAM Guidelines [1]): \"(1) Opioid- dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Generally, buprenorphine initiation should occur at least 6-12 hours after the last use of heroin or other short -acting opioids, or 24-72 hours [or more for individuals taking high doses of opioids] after their last use of long -acting opioids such as methadone. (2) Induction of buprenorphine should with a dose of 2-4 mg, [with 8mg inductions being appropriate for a greater degree of physiologic dependence]. Dosages [are often] increased in increments of 2-4mg. (3) Clinicians should observe patients in their offices during induction. (4) Buprenorphine doses after induction and titration should be, on average, at least 8mg per day. However, if patients are continuing to use opioids, consideration should be given to increasing the dose by 4 -8mg (daily doses of 12 -16mg). [While the US FDA approves dosing to a limit of 24mg per day, there is little evidence for clinical benefit beyond 16mg. Dosing beyond 24 mg is not recommended.] In addition, the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 36 (5) Psychosocial treatment should be implemented in conjunction with the use of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder. [Buprenorphine prescribers should be in regular contact wi th the psychosocial treatment team in order to be aware clinical progress. Preferably, the psychosocial and prescribing providers are co- located and on the same treatment team.] (6) Clinicians should take steps to reduce the chance of buprenorphine diversion. Recommended strategies include frequent office visits (weekly in early treatment), drug testing, including testing for buprenorphine and [metabolites (e.g., norbuprenorphine)], and recall visits for pill counts. [In the case of diversion, the opioid treatm ent provider must determine that the benefit to the patient in receiving the medication outweighs the potential risk of diversion resulting from the take home medication.] (7) Patients should be tested frequently for buprenorphine, other substances, and prescription medications. Accessing Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data [(INSPECT) is] useful for monitoring. [See Section V.2. below. If a patient tests positive for a controlled substance other than the buprenorphine prescribed, the clinicia n shall review the treatment plan and consider changes with the goal of opioid abstinence. (8) Patients should be seen frequently at the beginning of their treatment. Weekly visits (at least) are recommended until patients are determined to be stable. There is no recommended time limit for treatment. [Provider must determine and document that the benefit of the receiving a supply of medication to treat an opioid use disorder would outweigh the potential risk of diversion.] (9) Buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is [generally] a slow process and close monitoring is recommended... Patients should be encouraged to remain in treatment for ongoing monitoring past the point of discontinuation. (10) When considering a switch from buprenorphine to naltrexone, 7-14 days should elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids before starting naltrexone. (11) When considering a switch from buprenorphine to methadone, there is no required time de lay because the addition of a full mu- opioid agonist to a partial agonist does not typically result in any type of adverse reaction. (12) Patients who discontinue agonist therapy and resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with an opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.\" (ii) Detoxification: Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 37 A. Buprenorphine detoxification (excerpted from ASAM Guidelines [1]): \"Buprenorphine can be used for the medically supervised withdrawal of patients from both self - administered opioids and from opioid agonist treatment with methadone.... The goal of using buprenorphine for medically supervised withdrawal from opioids is to provide a transition from the state of physical dependence on opioids to an opioid- free state, while minimizing withdrawal symptoms. Medically supervised withdrawal with buprenorphine consists of an induction phase and a dose -reduction phase. The consensus panel recommends that patients dependent on short acting opioids (e.g., hydromorphone, oxycodone, heroin) who will be receiving medically supervised withdrawal be inducted directly onto buprenorphine/naloxone tablets. The use of buprenorphine (either as buprenorphine monotherapy or buprenorphine/naloxone combination treatment) to taper off long act ing opioids should be considered only for those patients who have evidence of sustained medical and psychosocial stability, and should be undertaken in conjunction and in coordination with patients' OTPs.\" B. Clonidine detoxification (excerpted from the APA guidelines is a [non- addictive] centrally acting 2 -adrenergic antihypertensive medication that effectively decreases the noradrenergic hyperactivity associated with opioid withdrawal. Clonidine is not approved for opioid withdrawal in the United States but has been extensively studied and used for this indication elsewhere. Clonidine reduces withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, and sweating but, unlike methadone, does little to reduce other symptoms such as musc le aches, insomnia, distress, and drug craving [3, 4]. As a non- opioid medication, clonidine has some advantages over methadone for withdrawal. For example, clonidine does not produce opioid- like tolerance or dependence or the post -methadone rebound in wit hdrawal symptoms [5]. In addition, patients completing a course of clonidine -assisted withdrawal can immediately be given an opioid antagonist (e.g., naltrexone) if indicated. The disadvantages of clonidine include its aforementioned inability to improve c ertain opioid withdrawal symptoms, associated hypotension that can be profound despite the use of low doses of this medication, and its possible sedative effects. Contraindications to the use of clonidine include acute or chronic cardiac disorders, renal or metabolic disease, and moderate to severe hypotension [6]. On the first day of clonidine -aided detoxification, a clonidine dose of 0.1 mg three times daily (totaling 0.3 mg per 24 hours) is usually sufficient to suppress signs of opioid withdrawal; inpatients can generally receive higher doses to block withdrawal symptoms because of the availability of medical staff to monitor the patient for hypotension and sedation. The dose is adjusted until withdrawal symptoms are reduced. If the patient's blood press ure falls below 90/60 mm Hg, the next dose should be withheld, after which tapering can be resumed while the patient is monitored for signs of withdrawal. In the case of short -acting opioids such as heroin, clonidine -aided withdrawal usually takes 4 -6 days. Other medications may be used along with clonidine to treat withdrawal symptoms. In general, clonidine -assisted detoxification is easier to carry out and monitor in inpatient settings. Clonidine -induced sedation is also less of a problem for inpatients.\" Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 38 C. Clonidine -Naltrexone (Excerpted from APA [2]): \"The combined use of clonidine and naltrexone for rapidly withdrawing patients from an opioid has been demonstrated to be safe and effective. Essentially, naltrexone- precipitated withdrawal is avoided by pretreating the patient with clonidine. This technique is most useful for opioid dependent patients who are in transition to narcotic antagonist treatment [e.g., naltrexone]. The limitations of this method include the need to monitor patients f or 8 hours on the first day because of the potential severity of naltrexone- induced withdrawal and the need for careful blood pressure monitoring during the entire detoxification procedure.\" D. Supplementary Medications (Excerpted from APA [2]): \"Some clinicians and treatment programs have used medications targeting the symptoms of opioid withdrawal as the primary means for treating this condition. For example,..., antiemetics are prescribed to treat nausea and vomiting, NSAIDs are provided for muscle cra mps, and antispasmodics [(e.g., dicyclomine)] are used to treat gastrointestinal cramping. There are limited controlled data about the use of such medications for the treatment of opioid withdrawal [8]...Diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, and sedating antidepress ants (e.g., trazodone) have been used for [insomnia and anxiety.] It should be noted that these medications have also been abused, although much less often than benzodiazepines [9]. Other medications such as NSAIDs and antispasmodic s may be safely provided but appear to be less effective than mu agonist opioids for symptom relief.\" (iii) Overdose Reversal (Excerpted Guidelines [2]): \"The syndrome of acute opioid overdose is recognizable by respiratory depression, extreme miosis, and stupor or coma [10]. Pulmonary edema may also be observed. Naloxone is a competitive antagonist at all three types of opiate receptors (mu, kappa, and sig ma) and has no intrinsic agonist activity [11]. It is clinically indicated to rapidly reverse a known or suspected opioid overdose [10, 12]...Because naloxone is rapidly absorbed by the brain and then quickly redistributed and eliminated from the body, its activity in the brain is short -lived [10, 13]. Thus, further monitoring and infusion of additional naloxone are needed to continue antagonizing the effects of severe opioid overdose, particularly if longer -acting opioids have been ingested [12, 14]. Monitor ing for opioid withdrawal symptoms is also indicated because patients may experience significant distress that can last for several hours after reversal of an opioid overdose with an antagonist [9].\" [Currently, in the State of Indiana, naloxone is available without a prescription from individual prescribers, as pharmacies have a written order to prescribe from the State Health Commissioner. At the time of assessment, OBOT providers should provide education about naloxone's role in overdose reversal to all patients in treatment for OUDs, as well as any involved family, caregivers or friends. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 39 OBOT providers should recommend that patients in treatment obtain a supply of naloxone to use in case of an overdose, but provide education that not all overdoses can be rescued.] (iv) Relapse prevention: Relapse prevention is the use of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic techniques that have been shown to decrease the risk of relapse in individuals in treatment for substance use disorders. See section 4 for psychotherapeutic techniques. FDA approved pharmacological treatments shown to reduce relapse in persons with OUDs include naltrexone, for preventing relapse in opioid use disorder [and is generally well tolerated]. Oral formula naltrexone may be considered for patients in whom adherence can be supervised or enforced [e.g., individuals who are incarcerated, adolescents supervised by parents, inpatients]. Extended- release injectable naltrexone [Vivitrol TM] may be more suitable for patients who have issues with adherence, [particularly individuals living in the community, receiving outpatient treatment.] (2) [Oral naltrexone should usually be taken daily (3) Extended -release injectable naltrexone [Vivitrol TM] should be administered every 4 weeks by deep IM injection in the gluteal muscle at a set dosage of 380 mg per injection. (4) Psychosocial treatment, [in conjunction wi th treatment with naltrexone, is required.] The efficacy of naltrexone use in conjunction with psychosocial treatment has been established, whereas the efficacy of extended release injectable naltrexone without psychosocial treatment ''has not'' been estab lished. (5) There is no recommended length of treatment with oral naltrexone or extended- release injectable naltrexone. Duration depends on clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances. Because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone, it can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms. (6) Switching from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine should be planned, considered, and monitored. Switching from an antagonist such as naltrexone to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated than switching from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment and thus no possibility of precipitated withdrawal. Pa tients being switched from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have physical dependence on opioids and thus the initial doses of methadone or Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 40 buprenorphine used should be low. Patients should not be switched until a significant amount of the naltrexone is no longer in their system, about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 30 days for extended- release injectable naltrexone. (7) Patients who discontinue antagonist therapy and resume opioid use should be made aware of the increased risks associated with an opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death. (8) Naltrexone should be used with ''caution'' under the following conditions: (a) All patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis. Hepatic injury is a concern if very high doses are used, for example, 200-300 mg per day. Use of naltrexone should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis. Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone exposure during the clinical development program and in the post marketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed in the clin ical trials and post marketing period. (b) Patients with [clinically significant] liver impairment should complete liver enzyme tests before and during treatment with naltrexone to check for additional liver impairment. (c) Patients who experience injection site r eactions should be monitored for pain, redness, or swelling. Incorrect administration may increase the risk of injection site reactions. Reactions have occurred with extended -release injectable naltrexone. To reduce injection site reactions in obese patients, a longer needle size may be used. (d) [Patients with co -occurring psychiatric disorders should be monitored for [psychiatric] adverse events. Suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, and depression have been reported [with naltrexone]]. (9) Significant ''medication interactions'' with naltrexone are as follows: (a) Naltrexone should not be used with methylnaltrexone or naloxegol. (b) Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioid analgesics because it is an opioid antagonist. (c) Glyburide may increase serum concentration of naltrexone. Monitor for increased toxicity effects of naltrexone.\" Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 41 Section 3. Switching between medications that treat OUDs Introduction: In order to assist providers with the process of switching between medications, detailed, current evidence is provided. Switching may be needed for the following reasons, including but not limited to: patient preference, side effects, difficulty accessing a particular medication, etc. (Excerpted from ASAM guidelines [1]): \"(I) Switching from methadone to other opioid treatment medications may be appropriate in the following cases: (1) Patient experiences intolerable methadone side effects. (2) Patient has not experienced a successful course of treatment on methadone. (3) Patient wants to change and is a candidate for the alternative treatment. Transfer of medications should be planned, considered, and monitored. Particular care should be taken in reducing methadone dosing before transfer to avoid precipitating a relapse. If the patient becomes unstable and appears at risk for relapse during the transfer of medications, reinstating methadone may be the best option. (II) Switching from methadone to buprenorphine: [This medication switch should be referred or closely supervised by an experienced addictionologist.] Patient s on low doses of methadone (30-40mg per day or less) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort; whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may find that switching causes significant discomfort. Patients should be closel y monitored during such a switch because there is a risk that stable methadone patients may become unstable when changing to buprenorphine... Patients should be experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before the switch. This would typically occur a t least 24 hours after the last dose of methadone, and indicates that sufficient time has elapsed for there to be minimal risk that the first dose of buprenorphine will precipitate significant withdrawal. Moderate withdrawal would equate to a score greater than 12 on the COWS. An initial dose of 2-[8] mg of buprenorphine should be given and the patient should be observed for 1 hour. If withdrawal symptoms improve, the patient can be dispensed two additional 2-4-mg doses to be taken as needed. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 42 (III) Switching from Methadone to Naltrexone [This medication switch should be referred or closely supervised by an experienced addictionologist. This process often takes place in inpatient settings.] Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended - release injectable naltrexone need to be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids before they can receive naltrexone. This may take up to 14 days, but can typically be achieved in 7 days. A naloxone challenge (administration of 0.4-0.8 mg naloxone and observation for precipitated withdrawal) may be useful before initiating treatment with naltrexone to document the absence of physiological dependence and to minimize the risk for precipitated withdrawal. (IV) Switching from Buprenorphine t o Naltrexone Buprenorphine has a long half -life; 7 -14 days should elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids before starting naltrexone. It may be useful to conduct a naloxone challenge before starting naltrexone to demonstrate an absence of physical dependence. Recently, investigators have begun to evaluate newer methods of rapidly transitioning patients from buprenorphine to naltrexone using repeated dosing over several days with very low doses of naltrexone along with ancillary medications. Although the results are promising, it is too early to recommend these techniques for general practice, and the doses of naltrexone used may not be readily available to mos t clinicians. [However, for physicians with addiction expertise, the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry in partnership with the American Psychiatric Association, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and the American Osteopathic Academy of Addi ction Medicine provides the Columbia from buprenorphine to methadone is less problematic because the addition of a full mu -opioid agonist to a partial agonist does not typically result in any type of adverse reaction. There is no time delay required in transitioning a patient from buprenorphine to treatment with methadone.\" Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 43 Section 4. Counseling and Ancillary services for OBOT providers Introduction: The combination of behavioral interventions and medications to treat substance use disorder is commonly referred to as MAT. While prescribing health care professionals can provide some or all of these interventions, some patients will require additional professionals to care for their medical, psychiatric, and addictive conditions. Best practice requires ensuring evidence -based interventions can be accessed as available, treatment should be individualized to the needs of the specific patient. Excerpted from APA Guidelines [2]: \"When considering psychosocial treatments for treating opioid- related disorders, it is essential to note that all clinical trials of psychosocial interventions for opioid abusers have taken place in programs that also provide either opioid agonist maintenance (e.g., methadone) or treatment with opioid antagonists. Although some follow -up studies of na turalistic treatment have found equivalent efficacy for methadone maintenance and outpatient drug- free programs for heroin users [10, 15- 18], early attempts at providing psychotherapy alone yielded unacceptably high attrition rates [19].\" Evidence based treatments which should be used to supplement medication assisted treatment for OUDs (excerpted from APA guidelines [2]): \"1. Cognitive -behavioral therapies In individuals who are receiving methadone maintenance, CBT is efficacious in reducing illicit substance use and achieving a wide range of other treatment goals. The benefits of CBT in combination with drug counseling are equivalent to those of drug counseling alone or drug counseling plus supportive -expressive psychotherapy in patients with low levels of psychiatric symptoms; however, in the presence of higher degrees of depression or other psychiatric symptoms, supportive -expressive therapy or CBT has been shown to be much more effective than drug counseling alone [19- 24]. CBT may also help reduce other target symptoms or behaviors (e.g., HIV risk behaviors) in opioid- using individuals [25]. Group based relapse prevention therapy, when combined with self -help group participation, may also help recently detoxified patients reduce opioid use and crimi nal activities and decrease unemployment rates [26]. 2. Behavioral therapies Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 44 Contingency management approaches are beneficial in reducing the use of illicit substances in opioid- dependent individuals who are maintained on methadone [27- 29]. Although other reinforcers or rewards (e.g., vouchers for movie tickets or sporting goods) may be provided to patients who demonstrate specified target behaviors (e.g., providing drug- free urine specimens, accomplishing specific treatment goals, atten ding treatment sessions), methadone take -home privileges are a commonly offered and effective incentive that is made contingent on reduced drug use [30- 33]. Furthermore, contingency management, either alone or in conjunction with family therapies, can also be used to enhance adherence with unpopular treatments such as naltrexone and has been shown to result in diminutions in drug use among recently detoxified opioid- dependent individuals [34-40]. 3. Psychodynamic and interpersonal therapies The utility of ad ding a psychodynamic therapy to a program of methadone maintenance has been investigated. The provision of supportive -expressive therapy, a specific approach to such treatment, may be particularly helpful for patients with high levels of other psychiatric symptoms [20, 23]. However, in terms of individual IPT, the potential benefits of treatment are unclear, as it is very difficult to engage opioid- dependent patients in such approaches. Psychodynamically oriented group therapy, modified for substance -depend ent patients, appears to be effective in promoting abstinence when combined with behavioral monitoring and individual supportive psychotherapy [41]. 4. Family therapies Family therapy has been demonstrated to enhance treatment adherence and facilitate imple mentation and monitoring of contingency contracts with opioid- dependent patients [42, 43]. [Family therapies are particularly beneficial for adolescents with OUDs]. 5. Self-help groups and 12- step-oriented treatments Self-help groups, such as Narcotics Anonymous, are beneficial for some individuals in providing peer support for continued participation in treatment, avoiding substance -using peers and high -risk environments, confronting denial, and intervening early in patterns of thinking and behavior tha t often lead to relapse. Because of the emphasis on abstinence in the 12- step treatment philosophy, patients maintained on methadone or other opioid agonists may encounter disapproval for this type of pharmacotherapy at Narcotics Anonymous meetings.\" Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 45 Section 5. Transitioning off agonist and partial agonist therapies, with the goal, when appropriate of opioid abstinence Introduction: For many individuals, agonist treatments may be necessary until they have reached a point in their trea tment where taper and discontinuation can be considered with their treatment providers. Excerpted from ASAM guidelines [1] : \"There is no recommended time limit for treatment with buprenorphine. Buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process and close monitoring is recommended...Patients and clinicians should not take the decision to terminate treatment with buprenorphine lightly. Factors associated with successful termination of treatment with buprenorphine are not well described, but may include the following: (1) Employment, engagement in mutual help programs, or involvement in other meaningful activities. (2) Sustained abstinence from opioid and other drugs during treatment. (3) Positive changes in the psychosocial environment. (4) Evidence of additional psychosocial supports. (5) Persistent engagement in treatment for ongoing monitoring past the point of medication discontinuation. Patients who relapse after treatment has been terminated should be returned to treatment with buprenorphine.\" Section 6. Traini ng and experience requirements for providers who treat and manage individuals with OUDs (1) Minimal Prescriber Requirements for practice office- based treatment of opioid addiction under the auspices of DATA 2000, physicians must first obtain a waiver from the special registration requirements established in the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974 and its enabling regulations. To obtain a DATA 2000 waiver, a physician must submit notification to SAMHSA of his or her intent to begin dispensing and/or prescribing this treatment. The Notification of Intent form must contain information on the physician's qualifying credentials Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 46 and must contain additional certifications, including that the physician (or the physician's group practice) will not treat more than 30 patients for addiction at any one time. Notification of Intent forms can be filled out and submitted online at the SAMHSA Buprenorphine Web site a t http://www.buprenorphine.samhsa.gov. Physicians who meet the qualifications defined in DATA 2000 are issued a waiver by SAMHSA and a special identification number by DEA. To qualify for a DATA 2000 waiver, physicians must ha ve completed at least 8 hours of approved training in the treatment of opioid addiction or have certain other qualifications as defined in the legislation (e.g., clinical research experience with the treatment medication, certification in addiction medicin e) and must attest that they can provide or refer patients to the necessary, concurrent psychosocial services. The consensus panel recommends that all physicians who plan to practice opioid addiction treatment with buprenorphine attend a DATA 2000- qualifyi ng 8-hour training program on buprenorphine. SAMHSA maintains a list of upcoming DATA 2000- qualifying buprenorphine training sessions on the SAMHSA Buprenorphine Web site. Additional information about DATA 2000 and buprenorphine also can be obtained by contacting the SAMHSA Buprenorphine Information Center by phone at 866- 287-2728) or via e -mail at info@buprenorphine.samhsa.gov. \" (2) It is recommended that physicians obtain advanced traini ng such as formal ASAM certification or addiction psychiatry fellowship training. (3) Requirements for INSPECT reviews when prescribing opioids At the outset of an opioid treatment plan, and at least annually thereafter, a physician prescribing opioids for a patient shall run an INSPECT report on that patient under and document in the patient's chart whether the INSPECT report is consistent with the physician's knowledge of the patient's controlled substance use history. Section 7. Addressing benzodiazepine use Introduction: Given the potential lethality of opioids and benzodiazepines, special attention needs to be given to patients taking both classes. Excerpted from Management of Benzodiazepines in Medication- Assisted Treatment [44]: \"Generally: Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 47 1. Individuals must be agreeable to engage in a plan to address their benzodiazepine use before beginning MAT. 2. [The evidence base does not support the use of chronic] benzodiazepines in a person presenting for MAT with methadone or buprenorphine is contraindicated. It presents an extremely high risk for adverse drug reaction involving overdose and/or death during t he induction process. [A closely supervised, short -term benzodiazepine taper is indicated in this instance.] 3. CNS [central nervous system] depressant use is not an absolute contraindication for either methadone or buprenorphine, but is a reason for caution because of potential respiratory depression. Serious overdose and death may occur if MAT is administered in conjunction with benzodiazepines, sedatives, tranquilizers, anti - depressants, or alcohol. 4. Individuals who use benzodiazepines, even if used as a pa rt of long -term therapy, should be considered at risk for adverse drug reactions including overdose and death.... 6. If a person presenting for MAT will not allow a clinician to coordinate care, he or she [is not] appropriate for methadone and/or buprenorphine Section 8. Managing Relapse Introduction: Relapse is an anticipated event in the process of recovery. . Nonetheless, there are practices that prescribers can adopt that are more likely to promote recovery than others. Best practices to address relapse are detailed here. Excerpted from APA guidelines [2]: \"Because individuals with substance use disorders are often ambivalent about giving up their substance use, it can be useful to monitor their attitudes about participating in treatment and adhering to specific recommendations. These patients often deny or minimize the negative consequences attributable to their substance use; this tendency is often erroneously interpreted by clinicians and significant others as evidence of dishonesty. Even patients ent ering treatment with high motivation to achieve abstinence will struggle with the reemergence of craving for a substance or preoccupation with thoughts about attaining or using a substance. Moreover, social influences (e.g., substance - using family or frie nds), economic influences (e.g., unemployment), medical conditions (e.g., chronic pain, fatigue), and psychological influences (e.g., hopelessness, despair) may make an individual more vulnerable to a relapse episode even when he or she adheres to prescrib ed treatment. For these reasons, it can be helpful for clinicians and patients to anticipate the possibility that the patient may return to substance use and to agree on a corrective Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 48 plan of action should this occur. If the patient is willi ng, it can be helpful to involve significant others in preventing the patient's relapse and prepare significant others to manage relapses should they occur. Supporting patients in their efforts to reduce or abstain from substance use positively reinforces their progress. Overt recognition of patient efforts and successes helps to motivate patients to remain in treatment despite setbacks. Clinicians can optimize patient engagement and retention in treatment through the use of motivational enhancement strateg ies [45, 46] and by encouraging patients to actively partake in self -help strategies. Monitoring programs, such as EAPs and impaired -physician programs [47- 49], can sometimes help patients adhere to treatment. Early in treatment a clinician may educate pat ients about cue -, stress- , and substance -induced relapse triggers [50, 51]. Patients benefit from being educated in a supportive manner about relapse risk situations, thoughts, or emotions; they must learn to recognize these as triggers for relapse and learn to manage unavoidable triggers without resorting to substance -using behaviors. Participation in AA or similar self -help group meetings can also support patients' sobriety and help them avoid relapse. Many other strategies can also help prevent relapse. Social skills training is targeted at improving individual responsibility within family relationships, work related interactions, and social relationships. During the early recovery phase, it can be helpful to encourage patients to seek new experiences and roles consistent with a substance -free existence (e.g., greater involvement in vocational, social, or religious activities) and to discourage them from instituting major life changes that might increase the risk of relapse. Facilitating treatment of co -occurring psychiatric and medical conditions that significantly interact with substance relapse is a long - term intervention for maintaining sobriety [52- 54]. Therapeutic strategies to prevent relapse have been well studied and include teaching individuals t o anticipate and avoid substance -related cues (e.g., assessing individual capacity to avoid relapse in the presence of substance -using peers), training individuals how to monitor their affective or cognitive states associated with increased craving and sub stance use, behavioral contingency contracting, training individuals in cue extinction and relaxation therapies to reduce the potency of substance - related stimuli and modulate craving intensity, and supporting patients in the development of coping skills and lifestyle changes that support sobriety [55, 56]. Behavioral techniques that enhance the availability and perceived value of social reinforcement as an alternative to substance use or reward for remaining abstinent have also been used [57]. If relapse does occur, individuals should be praised for even limited success and encouraged to continue in or resume treatment. Clinicians may help patients analyze relapses as well as periods of sobriety from a functional and behavioral standpoint and use what is l earned to adjust the treatment plan to fit the individual's present needs. For chronically relapsing substance users, medication therapies may be necessary adjuncts to treatment.\" Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 49 Section 9. Obtaining informed consent concerning all available opioid use disorder treatment options, including risks and benefits of each option. Introduction: The informed consent process should ensure that each patient voluntarily chooses their treatment and that relevant facts concerning the use of the medications (including non -opioid medication treatment options) are clearly and adequately explained, such as follows : Opioids are drugs that stimulate mu -receptors in the brain to produce a wide range of effects including pain relief, sedation, euphoria, addiction, and, with high enough doses, death. Opioids include heroin, morphine, methadone, oxycodone, hydrocodone, buprenorphine, tramadol and others. An opioid use disorder (i.e. addiction) is diagnosed when opioids are used in a compulsive, uncontrolle d way producing negative physical, mental and social consequences. Treatment options for opioid addictions are compared below. Behavioral Interventions : Behavioral interventions are recommended to accompany any addiction treatment. Benefits and advantages Capable of addressing a host of contexts associated with addiction (e.g., depression or pain) No medication costs or side effects, except in the case of adolescents, where groups have been shown to worsen prognosis Risks and downsides The long- term chance of quitting opioids is low without taking medication like those listed below. Group therapies involve some compromise of confidentiality and can be time consuming. Methadone : Methadone is an opioid dispensed by a government regulated Opi ate Treatment Provider (OTP). Benefits and advantages Scientifically proven to reduce withdrawal, illicit opioid relapse, psychiatric, legal, medical, social and financial consequences of opioid addiction. Clients are monitored closely for progress. Risks and downsides Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 50 Requires ongoing use of opioids Requires daily, often early morning visits to the OTP in the first months. OTPs typically focus on only opioid addiction and do not treat other co -occurring addictions and mental illnesses. OTP/Methadone treatment is generally not covered by public/private insurance. Only 13 OTP clinics and the Veteran's Administration in Indiana --so may need to drive long distances. Methadone can cause serious side effects with high doses, or when mixed with alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates or certain muscle relaxants; Can cause irregular heartbeat, cessation of breathing and death. Stopping methadone, as with any opioid, causes opioid withdrawal sickness. Accidental ingestion by children can be fatal. Buprenorphine (Suboxone, Subutex, Zubsolv, Bunavail) : Buprenorphine is an opioid prescribed by an OTP or a doctor with a special prescribing certification. It has many of the same benefits and risks as methadone. However there are several key differences listed as follows. Benefits and advantages Buprenorphine treatment (outside of an OTP) typically requires fewer treatment appointments than methadone to receive medication. Buprenorphine treatment is more often covered by public and private insurance. Ris k of lethal over dose is much less than with methadone or other opioids. Babies born to mothers maintained on Buprenorphine have less risk of experiencing NAS. Risks and downsides May not work as well as methadone in certain patients with severe opioid addiction. Lack of highly structured treatment programming with buprenorphine does not serve some people well. Naltrexone (Revia, Vivitrol) : Naltrexone is a prescription drug that blocks the effects of opioids in the brain. Naltrexone comes as a pill that is taken one or two times a day or as a shot given by a nurse once a month. You can not take opioids for about two weeks before starting naltrexone. Naltrexone is also used to treat alcohol addiction. Benefits and advantages Does not require the use of an opioid to facilitate recovery Increases adherence to psycho -social treatment. Significantly reduces cravings for opioids. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 51 Will not result in respiratory depression if taken in excess Covered by most insurance plans. Treats alcohol addiction too. Risks and downsides Naltrexone may cause opioid withdrawal symptoms if started before someone has detoxed from opioids. Can cause serious liver problems, although this is more likely when taking high doses of the oral form. Opioid pain medications wi ll not work as well when taking naltrexone. The injection can cause some discomfort, rarely could become infected. Individuals can still overdose on opioids, while taking naltrexone. Should not be started during pregnancy.

Drug Testing Introduction: Testing biological samples for the presence of drugs of abuse is an essential part of the treatment of OU Ds. Best practices of drug screening are detailed here. Excerpted from APA[2]: \"Urine drug testing, or other reliable biological tests for the presence of drugs, during the initial evaluation and frequently throughout treatment, is highly recommended. Results from some studies have indicated that more intensive monitoring of substance use may increase recovery rates from a substance use disorder...There are a variety of toxicology tests available, some with greater and lesser reliability and validity. Urine testing is useful for detecting substance use over the preceding 5 -day period for common substances of abuse (cocaine, opiates, cannabis, and fenta nyl) cannot be detected with routine methods and require special assays. [It is important to screen for the metabolites of the prescribed opioid agonist (e.g. norbuprenorphine), to ensure compliance with the treatment. Point of care testing (e.g., urine testing) is needed to make rapid clinical decisions, supplemented by \"send out,\" confirmatory Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 52 laboratory values.] The person who is interpreting these labs should be very familiar with the methodology and the reliability. There is little rese arch on the optimal frequency of testing, [however, random drug testing is optimal.]....The frequency of drug testing will be determined by a number of factors, including the stability of the patient, the type of treatment, the treatment setting, and the half -life of drugs in the matrix being tested. Patients will likely require more testing early in treatment or during periods of relapse. Patients participating in office based treatment with buprenorphine may be tested at each office visit. Opioids are detec table in the urine for 1-3 days after use. A negative urine test combined with no history of withdrawal may indicate a lack of physical dependence. However, a negative urine test does not rule out opioid use, disorder, or physical dependence. Urine testing is also helpful to identify (1) Use of other psychoactive substances. (2) If a patient tests positive for an illegal drug...or a controlled substance that the patient is not taking as part of the treatment plan, then the provider needs to review the treatment plan and consider changes with the goal of opioid abstinence.\" Section 11. Pregnant Women with OUDs Introduction: Pregnant women have unique needs and require treatment customized to their situation. Best practices for their treatment are highlighted here. (Excerpted from ASAM guidelines [1] \"(1) The first priority in \"treating\" pregnant women for opioid use disorder should be to identify emergent or urgent medical conditions that require immediate referral for clinical evaluation. (2) A medical examination and psychosocial assessment is recommended when evaluating pregnant women for opioid use disorder. (3) Obstetricians and gynecologists should be alert to signs and symptoms of opioid use disorder. Pregnant women with opioid use disorder are more likely to seek pr enatal care late in pregnancy, miss appointments, experience poor weight gain, or exhibit signs of withdrawal or intoxication. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 53 (4) [As with all patients with OUDs,] psychosocial treatment is [strongly] recommended in the treatment of pregnant women with opioid use disorder. (5) Counseling and testing for HIV should be provided in accordance with state law. Tests for hepatitis B and C and liver function are also suggested. Hepatitis A and B vaccination is recommended for those whose hepatitis serology is negative. (6) Urine drug testing may be used to detect or confirm suspected opioid and other drug use with informed consent from the mother, realizing that there may be adverse legal and social consequences of her use. State laws differ on reporting subs tance use during pregnancy. Laws that penalize women for use and for obtaining treatment serve to prevent women from obtaining prenatal care and worsen outcomes. (7) Pregnant women who are physically dependent on opioids should receive treatment using methadone or buprenorphine mono- product rather than withdrawal management or abstinence. (8) Care for pregnant women with opioid use disorder should be co- managed by an obstetrician and an addiction specialist physician. Release of information forms need to be completed to ensure communication among healthcare providers. (9) Treatment with [buprenorphine or] methadone [(within a licensed Opioid Treatment Program)] should be initiated as early as possible during pregnancy. (10) Hospitalization during initiation of methadone and treatment with buprenorphine may be advisable due to the potential for adverse events, especially in the third trimester. (14) Clinicians should be aware that the pharmacokinetics of [buprenorphine] are affected by pregnancy....Increased or split doses may be needed as pregnancy progresses. After child birth, doses may need to be adjusted. (15) Buprenorphine monoproduct is a reasonable and recommended alternative to methadone for pregnant women. Whereas there is evidence of safety, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the combination buprenorphine/ naloxone formulation. (16) If a woman becomes pregnant while she is receiving naltrexone, it is appropriate to discontinue the medication if the patient and doctor agree that the risk of relapse is low. If the patient is highly concerned about relapse and wishes to continue naltrexone, she should be informed about the risks of staying on naltrexone and provide her consent for ongoing treatment. If the patient wishes to discontinue naltrexone, but then reports relapse to opioid use, it may be appropriate to consider treatment with methadone or treatment with buprenorphine. (17) Naloxone is not recommended for use in pregnant women with opioid use disorder except in situations of life -threatening overdose. Indiana 1115 SUD Waiver Implementation Plan Updated January 2018 54 (18) Mothers receiving methadone and buprenorphine monoproduct for the treatment of opioid use disorders should be encouraged to breastfeed. (19) [Naltrexone may be appropriate for a mother after delivery who is capable of detoxification and at risk of relapse.] Methadone Versus Buprenorphine The discussion and decision for medication should be reviewed with the patient and documented in her chart. For women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, opioid agonist treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is seen as t he most appropriate treatment, taking into consideration effects on the fetus, neonatal abstinence syndrome, and impacts on perinatal care and parenting of young children. Methadone is the accepted standard of care for use during pregnancy; however, buprenorphine monoproduct is a reasonable alternative and also has some advantages over methadone. Infants born to mothers treated with buprenorphine had shorter hospital stays (10 vs. 17.5 days), had shorter treatment durations for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) (4.1 vs. 9.9 days), and required a lower cumulative dose of morphine (1.1 vs. 10.4 mg) compared to infants born to mothers on treatment with methadone. Combination Buprenorphine/Naloxone There is some evidence suggesting that buprenorphine/ naloxone is equivalent in safety and efficacy to the monoproduct for pregnant women...At present, however, this evidence is insufficient to recommend the combination buprenorphine/naloxone formulation in this population.\" References 1.

III-10 FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, I- March 21, SECTION I: GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION I.A Introduction Indiana, along with a number of states, is in the midst of a substantial drug abuse epidemic. The magnitude of the epidemic is demonstrated by the following facts: Nearly six times as many Hoosiers died from drug overdoses in 2014 as did in 2000, and the number of heroin overdose deaths increased by nearly 25 times between 2000 and 2014.1 In 2014, Indiana had the 16th highest drug overdose death rat e in the nation, which represented a statistically significant increase in the rate from 2013.2 Since 2009, more Hoosiers have lost their lives due to a drug overdose than in automobile accidents on state highways.3 The State's Medicaid population has been particularly impacted by the crisis: nearly 100,000 individuals were treated for a diagnosis of substance use disorder in 2016.4 As an outgrowth of recommendations made by the State's Taskforce on Drug Enforcement, Treatment, and Prevention, the Family an d Social Services Administration (FSSA) requested a waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) under the authority of section 1115(a) of the Social Security Act. The waiver request was to add new evidence- based substance use disorder (SUD) tre atment services and to expand access to qualified providers through a waiver of the Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion. As proposed, the SUD services would be available to all Medicaid beneficiaries, not just those eligible as a result of the demonstration waiver. The waiver application was submitted on January 31, 2017 and amended on July 20, 2017. CMS subsequently approved the extension request on February 1, 2018 (Project No. 11- W-00296/5). The approved waiver is effective from February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 and will provide access to the enhanced SUD benefit package for all Indiana Medicaid recipients. Services will be delivered through fee for service (FFS) and managed care delivery systems. On February 1, 2018, Indiana also re ceived approval of its SUD Implementation Protocol as required by special terms and conditions (STC) X.10 of the state's section 1115 Health Indiana Plan (HIP) demonstration. As set forth in the Implementation Plan, Indiana is aligning the six goals for th e SUD waiver component with the milestones outlined by CMS as follows:5 1. Increased rates of identification, initiation, and engagement in treatment; 2. Increased adherence to and retention in treatment; 3. Reductions in overdose deaths, particularly those due to opioids; 4. Reduced utilization of emergency departments and inpatient settings for treatment where the utilization is preventable or medically inappropriate through improved access to other continuum of care services; 5. Fewer readmissions to the same or higher level of care where the readmission is preventable or medically inappropriate; and 6. Improved access to care for physical health conditions among beneficiaries. To accomplish these six goals, Indiana Medicaid is focusing on the three following areas6: FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, I- March 21, Expanded SUD treatment options for as many of its members as possible; Stronger, evidence -based certification standards for its SUD providers, particularly its residential addiction providers; and Consistency with prior authorization criteria and determina tions among its health plans. In support of these focus areas, Indiana Medicaid and CMS identified six key milestones, as described in their approved Implementation and Monitoring Plan, which include:7. 1. Access to critical levels of care for SUD treatment; 2. Use of evidence- based SUD -specific patient placement criteria; prior -authorization, providers, payers; matching need to capacity 3. Use of nationally recognized SUD -specific program standards to set provider qualifications for residential treatment facilities; 4. Sufficient provider capacity at critical levels of care, including medication assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD); 5. Implementation of comprehensive treatment and prevention strategies to address opioid abuse and OUD; and 6. Improved c are coordination and transition between levels of care. 1 INDIANA STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, INDIANA: SPECIAL EMPHASIS REPORT, DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS, 1999 -2013 (2016), available at http://www.in.gov/isdh/files/2016_SER_Drug_Deaths_Indiana.pdf. 3 R.

See Figure 1 for a summary of the ASAM levels of care and Figure 2 for a summary of the key SUD waiver policy changes to improve access, including the timing for implementation and populations impacted, by ASAM level of care. 2. Use of evidence- based SUD -specific patient placement criteria Patient Assessment o Individuals seeking treatment will be required to undergo a psychosocial assessment that will be used to develop a treatment plan. o Providers will be required to submit assessments that address the six dimensions of ASAM patient placement criteria which will be critical in determining the appropriate level of care. Utilization Management o ASAM level s 2 and above will require prior authorization through either the fee -for- service vendor or one of the managed care entities (MCEs). o A single prior authorization form will be developed to assist providers in requesting approval for the most appropriate level of care. 3. Use of nationally recognized SUD -specific program standards for residential treatment Develop new administrative rules that align residential facility certification with ASAM patient placement criteria for levels 3.1 and 3.5. Require residential facilities to offer medication assisted treatment (MAT) either on -site or through facilitated access off-site. 4. Sufficient provider capacity at critical levels of care Pursue stronger data analytics around provider capacity by creating reporti ng by provider specialty and ASAM level of care. Complete an assessment of ASAM providers and services, including availability of MAT. Create a new provider specialty for residential addictions facilities, and consider adding additional provider specialties to account for more mid -level practitioners. 5. Implementation of comprehensive treatment and prevention strategies to address opioid abuse Governor's Task Force on Drug Enforcement, Treatment and Prevention o Established on September 1, 2015 to i dentify best practices and informed recommendations to policy makers. o Membership included the following: General Assembly; Governor's Office; State Department of Health; Department of Corrections; Department of Child Services; Family and Social Services Ad ministration; and other organizations and associations. o Task force concluded its work on December 5, 2016, and issued a final report detailing FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, I- March 21, findings and actionable recommendations: 17 recommendations in total; 3 recommendations related to enforcement; and 14 recommendations related to treatment, including pursuit of a Medicaid 1115 Demonstration Waiver for individuals with SUD. Gold Card Program o Implemented late 2015. o Program allows qualified Medicaid prescribers to be exempt from prior authorization document submission requirements when prescribing buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone. Buprenorphine Prior Authorization Criteria o Established specific prior authorization criteria for prescribers who are not Gold Card members. o Criteria is used by all of the MCEs' pharmacy benefit managers to allow for authorization up to six months at a time, and a 34- day supply at a time per member. Indiana Attorney General's Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Task Force o Separate task force created in September 2012. o Published a four -year report in December 2016, with many of the same objectives identified by the Governor's Task Force acted upon by this task force. Prescribing Guidelines o Established standards and protocols (844 IAC 5 -6) for physicians prescribing opioid controlled substances for pain management treatment. o Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 297 (2016) created clinical practice guidelines for office - based opiate treatment. o Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 226 (2017) limited prescription supply to seven days for first time opioid prescriptions for adults and children under age 18. Expanded Access to Naloxone o Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 406 (2015) expanded access to persons at risk for overdose or any individual who knows someone who may be at risk for overdosing. o Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 187 (2016) expanded access to allow any individual to walk into a pharmacy for a prescription of Naloxone without having to first see a prescriber. Prescription Drug Monitoring Program o On August 24, 2017, Governor Eric Holcomb announced a major statewide initiative to incorporate the State's prescription drug monitoring program (INSPECT) into health care systems' electronic health records. o Once fully integrated, practitioners will have a single portal to access information about prescribing and dispensing of a controlled substance. o Indiana hopes to have all of its hospitals fully integrated within three years. 6. Improved care coordination and transitions between levels of care In addition to current MCE contractual requirements for case management, pursue extending the care settings transitioning from inpatient to include residential treatment facilities. Expand access to peer recovery coaches across delivery systems. Since receiving approval of the SUD waiver, Indiana FSSA has been engaged in implementation activities as shown in Figure 3. Additionally, Indiana FSSA completed the procurement of an independent evaluator to develop the SUD Evaluation Design Plan, as required in STC X.9. Burns & Associates, Inc. (B&A), a health car e consulting firm with headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, was contracted by the FSSA to serve in that capacity and, as such, has led development of the initial draft of the Evaluation Design Plan.

As part of the examination of the relationships between goals and the interventions, B&A constructed two driver diagrams identifying primary and secondary drivers of two principle aims: 1) reducing overdose death; and 2) reducing costs. The driver diagrams ar e summarized in Figure 4 and Figure 5 on the following two pages of the Evaluation Design Plan. B&A chose overdose deaths as the first aim because it is a measurable health outcome. CMS goals related to improved quality of care were determined to all have the potential to contribute to a reduction in overdose deaths and therefore are included as primary drivers. And in turn, the specific actions described in the implementation plan, which would be designed to improve these measures of quality of care, were considered as secondary drivers. Reductions in per capita costs of the SUD population is the second defined aim based on CMS interest on whether the investments in SUD services made as part of the waiver, result in demonstrable reductions in non- SUD services spending. Similar to the approach above, upon examination, B&A identified relationships between goals related to improving physical health and reductions in the use of acute care services as the key primary drivers of achieving a reduction in over all spending, net of SUD investments. In order to translate these aims, and primary and secondary drivers into measurable results, we compared these items against the measures included in the Monitoring Plan and identified whether new measures may be need ed. B&A found that existing, nationally recognized measures were available for the aims and primary drivers; moreover, the specifications and data sources were already described as part of Indiana Medicaid's CMS -approved Monitoring Plan. The one exception is that B&A will add two \"potentially preventable\" measures. To fill gaps in measuring secondary drivers, B&A added custom measures where needed. These measures, in the post -waiver period, will be used as targets such that performance in the post -waiver period will be considered positive should changes occur in the post - versus pre - waiver period. A more detailed description of the data, measures and analysis to be used are described in Section III. Methodology. FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Figure 4.

Driver Diagram 1.2 Target Health Outcome: Reductions in Per Capita Cost FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, II-4 March 21, II.B Hypotheses (H) and Research Questions (Q) Aims and Primary Drivers The identified aims, primary and secondary drivers were converted into a series of hypotheses (H) and research questions (Q); and the latter each assigned measures and targeted analytic methodology, described in detail in Section III. Methodology. Hypothesis 1.1 and 1.2 focus on the aims and primary drivers depicted in the revised driver diagrams. These are the targets for testing using interrupted time series (ITS) as described in Section III. Methodology. The two aims and eight prima ry drivers will be tested in order to detect statistically significant changes in the pre - and post -waiver period. The hypotheses and research questions specific to the aims and primary drivers include: H 1.1 Key health outcomes improve in the SUD populat ion in the post - waiver period. Q 1.1.1 Does the level and trend of overdose deaths and overdose due to opioids decrease among the SUD population in the post -waiver period? Q 1.1.2 Does the level and trend of initiation and engagement in treatment increase in the SUD population in the post waiver period? Q 1.1.3 Does the level and trend of follow -up after discharge from the Emergency Department (ED) for SUD increase among the SUD population in the post waiver period? Q 1.1.4 Does the level and trend in conti nuity of pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder increase among the OUD population in the post waiver period? Q 1.1.5 Does the level and trend in concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines decrease in the OUD population in the post waiver period? Q 1.1.6 Does the level and trend in the rate of use of opioids at high dosage in persons without cancer decrease in the post waiver period? H 1.2 Costs of care decreases in the SUD population in the post waiver period. Q 1.2.1 Does the level and trend in overall spending for the SUD population decrease in the post waiver period? Q 1.2.2 Does the level and trend in SUD service spending for the SUD population increase in the post waiver period? Q 1.2.3 Does the level and trend in non- SUD service spending for the SUD population decrease in the post waiver period? Q 1.2.4 Does the level and trend in the percentage of SUD facilities who report they accept Medicaid as a payer increase in the post waiver period? Q 1.2.5 Does the level and trend in Clinical Risk Group (CRG) risk scores decrease among the SUD population in the post waiver period? Q 1.2.6 Does the level and trend in acute utilization for SUD, potentially preventable emergency department or potentially preventable hospital readmissions decrease in th e SUD population in the FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, II-5 March 21, post waiver period? Secondary Drivers Hypotheses 2.1 through 6.1 focus on the secondary drivers as depicted in the revised driver diagram and are organized to be consistent with Indiana Medicaid's CMS -approved Implementation Plan. Unlike those aims and primary drivers in Hypothesis 1.1 and 1.2, the secondary drivers are targets for continuous monitoring and quality improvement, and require information beyond what is available in claims or other public data sets, nationally recogni zed measures, and thus, performance will be assessed using a set of mixed methods to evaluate progress on the secondary drivers. Where possible, measures will be incorporated into a reporting dashboard of the pre - and the to- date post -waiver periods and re ported on a quarterly basis, with a refresh every six months. A summary of methods is detailed in Section III. Methodology. The hypotheses and research questions specific to the secondary drivers include: H 2.1 Access to care improved in the SUD population in the post-waiver period. Q 2.1.1. Does the level and trend in the number of SUD and primary care providers and the number of providers per capita in the SUD population increase in the post waiver period for each ASAM level of care? Q 2.1.2 Does the utilization per 1,000 of SUD services and primary care in the SUD population increase in the post waiver period for each ASAM level of care? Q 2.1.3 Does the average driving distance for SUD services and primary care decrease in the SUD population in the post waiver period for each ASAM level of care? H 3.1 Implementing residential treatment facility provider certification requirements based on ASAM level 3.1 and 3.5 criteria will improve provision of care. Q 3.1.1 Does provider certification shi ft from resident and facility -based criteria to treatment -based certification criteria using ASAM level of care over the length of the waiver? Q 3.1.2 Does the ability to measure utilization by ASAM facility level improve program monitoring? Q 3.1.3 Does provider awareness and use of ASAM Patient Placement Criteria increase over the length of the waiver? Q 3.1.4 Do providers offer medication- assisted treatment (MAT)? Q 3.1.5 Do residential facilities not currently enrolled in Indiana Medicaid have the oppo rtunity to meet standards for enrollment leading to increased enrollment of residential addictions facilities? H 4.1 The quality and use of INSPECT data will improve in the post waiver period. Q 4.1.1 Were changes to INSPECT made according to the Impleme ntation Plan? Q 4.1.2 Did changes to INSPECT result in meaningful reporting capabilities? Q 4.1.3 Has the number of prescribers using INSPECT increased over time? Q 4.1.4 Has the volume of inquiries into the INSPECT database increased over time? FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, II-6 March 21, H 5.1 The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) and Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment (ANSA) tools are being used to place beneficiaries in ASAM levels of care. Q 5.1.1 Are clinical criteria for authorization review for services delivered to beneficiaries with SUD being applied consistently across Indiana's Health Coverage Programs (Hoosier Healthwise, Healthy Indiana Plan, Hoosier Care Connect, and Traditional Medicaid)? H 5.2 Prior authorization (PA) requirements do not negatively impact access to residential or inpatient services (ASAM 3.1, 3.5 and 4.0). Q 5.2.1 Are the rates of prior authorizations (P As) submitted and PA requests that are denied in the SUD population, controlling for volume, relatively consistent by MCE and over time? Q 5.2.2 Are prior authorization (PA) denials predominately for reasons directly related to not meeting clinical criteri a as opposed to administrative reasons such as lack of information submitted? Q 5.2.3 Is provider administrative burden associated with PA requests cited as a perceived barrier to access to care? H 6.1 Care coordination and transitions between ASAM levels of care will increase in the post-waiver period. Q 6.1.1 Does the proportion of beneficiaries receiving ASAM designation who had a claim in that ASAM level within the next two consecutive months following the month of ASAM assignment increase over time? Q 6.1.2 Does the proportion of beneficiaries with a SUD diagnosis who are receiving care coordination increase over time? Q 6.1. 3 Do Indiana's MCEs facilitate more active engagement in the case/care management process between behavioral health/substance a buse providers and primary care/other physical health providers for their patients with a SUD diagnosis? FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, III- March 21, SECTION III: METHODOLOGY III.A Evaluation Design The evaluation design is a mixed -methods approach, drawing from a range of data sources, measures and analytics to best produce relevant and actionable study findings. B&A tailored the evaluation approach for each research question described in Section II, Evaluation Hypothesis and Research Questions. The evaluation plan reflects a range of da ta sources, measures and perspectives. It also defines the most appropriate study population and sub- populations, as well as describes the six analytic methods included in the evaluation design. The six analytic methods proposed for use across the six goa ls include: 1. single segment interrupted time series (ITS), 2. descriptive statistics (DS), 3. provider surveys (PS) 4. onsite reviews (OR) 5. desk reviews (DR) and, 6. facilitated interviews (FIs) and/or focus groups (FGs). Figure 6 on the next page presents a chart displaying which method(s) are used for each hypothesis. It also includes a brief description of the indicated methods, as well as the sources of data on which they rely. The six methods are ordered and abbreviated as described in the first sentence of th is paragraph. As described in Section II.B, the first two hypothesis [1.1. and 1.2] and the 12 associated research questions focus on whether the 1115 SUD waiver provision made an impact on key CMS goals (i.e., aims and primary drivers). In order to facil itate evaluation on whether a statistically significant difference between the pre - and post - waiver period can be detected, the data, measures and methods for these research questions will be tested using healthcare claims and enrollment data, nationally recognized measure specifications, and ITS. For the remainder of the hypotheses (2.1 - 6.1) and the associated research questions, the focus will shift to the secondary drivers. Given these are targets for continuous monitoring and quality improvement, and require information beyond what is available in claims or other public data sets, this section draws upon a set of mixed methods to evaluate progress on the secondary drivers. Where possible, measures will be incorporated into a reporting dashboard of the pre- and the to -date post -waiver periods and reported on a quarterly basis, with refreshes every six months.

B&A will use the approved specification, described in the CMS -approved Monitoring Plan, for identification of beneficiaries with SUD. Having a positive SUD Indicator Flag will serve as an indicator of exposure to the changes in the waiver. The specification to be used to create the SUD Indicator Flag is included in Attach ment D. While the key study population is the overall SUD population, a standardized set of sub- populations will be identified and examined. B&A will sub- set the SUD population at minimum, by common demographic groups, payer (i.e., MCE or OMPP), and geogr aphic regions. In addition, there are nuances in the 1115 waiver changes, which warrant identification and stratification of the data into a number of sub -populations. See Figure 2 in Section I of the evaluation plan for a summary of the waiver policy chan ges. ASAM Levels: 2.1; 3.1; 3.5; 4; OTP; RS. It is possible that outcomes may differ among the SUD population based on their access to services. B&A will examine the outcomes by those accessing a particular level of care for differences in health outcomes or cost in the post -waiver period compared to the pre -wavier period. Risk Scores: Similarly, outcomes may differ among the SUD population for some types of clinically similar groups compared to others. Therefore, B&A will examine outcomes by categorized groups of clinically similar beneficiaries based on the 3MTM Clinical Risk Groups (CRG) to examine whether there are differences in health outcomes or cost among clinically similar groups of SUD beneficiaries. ASAM 2.1 Intensive Outpatient Services: cover age is expanding beyond the community -based treatment or Medicaid Rehabilitation Option (MRO); those previously receiving IOP via the MRO option therefore, may not be impacted as much as others not previously eligible for MRO. Opioid Use Disorder (OUD): It is likely that those beneficiaries with OUD, compared to those with other types of SUD, may have different health outcomes and access a different mix of services. Therefore, it is possible that the waiver impacts these populations differently and those beneficiaries will be identified and examined as a sub -population. B&A will use the specification for OUD described in the CMS -approved Monitoring Plan. To fully study the secondary drivers, three surveys will target all identified Indiana Medicaid enroll ed providers. In addition, B&A will use Indiana -specific N -SSATS data, which is self - reported provider survey data collected nationally, to explore statewide, multi -payer trends. The matrices included in Section III.G identify the target population and st ratification proposed for each hypothesis and research question. Comparison Groups Two ideal comparison groups described in the CMS technical advisory guidance on selection of comparison groups include another state Medicaid population and/or prospectively collected information FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, III-4 March 21, prior to the start of the intervention.11 Specifically, a SUD po pulation with similar demographics, in another state without those waiver flexibilities described in Indiana, would be an ideal comparator. However, identifying whether such a state exists or that data could be obtained given the sensitivity of SUD privacy concerns as it relates to data sharing is outside the scope of the evaluation and therefore not feasible. Similarly, the other example of a control from the design guide is to collect prospective data and to our knowledge, there is no known prospective data collection on which to build baselines. One exception to this would be for the three reported measures using N -SSATS data, which are collected nationally and reported at a statewide level. In this case, comparator states could be identified and possibly included within the analysis. B&A will compare these trends for up to two other states if desired; the two states will be chosen in consultation with Indiana Medicaid, CMS and other stakeholders. Given the lack of an available and appropriate co mparison group, B&A will use an analytic method which creates a pre- and post - waiver (intervention) group upon which to compare outcomes. See Section III.F for more details on the analytic methods. III.C Evaluation Period A pre - and post - wavier period will be defined as three calendar years before and three calendar years after waiver implementation. The waiver period is three years and therefore, the pre - period will also be for three years. The pre -waiver period, therefore, is defined as enrollment or dates of service of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. The post -waiver period is defined as enrollment or dates of service of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. Also, in support of the analytic methods described in Section III.F, the calendar y ear data will be sub - set into both monthly and quarterly segments such that both the pre - and post - waiver periods will include 12 quarters or 36 months each. To simplify the analytic plan, B&A is making an assumption about the first month of 2018. Although CMS approved the SUD provisions of Indiana's 1115 waiver in February 2018, not in January 2018, waiver -related activities were moving forward in anticipation of approval and for ease of conducting and describing the analysis, the evaluation period will include the one month of the post -intervention period following submission of the waiver but prior to February 2018 approval. Similarly, while this is the expected post- evaluation period, modifications may be warranted to better reflect differences in the time period upon which one would expect to see a change in outcome resulting from waiver activities. At this time, there was little data or similar studies on which to base specific alternatives to the proposed post -evaluation period. B&A will therefore, examine time series data in order to identify whether the post- evaluation period should be delayed. For example, if review of the data shows a distinctive change in the third quarter of 2018, the post -period would be adjusted such that the first and second quarter data would not be considered in the interrupted time series analysis described in Section III.F.

The measures fall into three primary domains: quality, access and financial. All the measures in Indiana's existing Monitoring Plan are included as well as additional measures including average driving distance, potentially preventable emergency dep artment visits and hospital readmissions. https:// www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section -1115- demo/downloads/evaluation -grp-eval-dsgn.pdf.

The evaluation design relies most heavily on the use of Indiana Medicaid administrative data, i.e., enrollment, claims and encounter data. Supplemental administrative data, such as prior approval denials and authorizations, will also be incorporated. Primary data will be limited and include data created by surveys, desk review and facilitated interview instruments. A brief description of these data and their strengths and weaknesses are below. Indiana Medicaid Administrative Data Claims and encounters with dates of service (DOS) from January 1, 2015 - December 31, 2020 will be collected from the OMPP Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), facilitated by OMPP's EDW vendor, Optum. Managed care encounter data has the same record layout as f ee-for- service, and includes variables such as charges and payments at the header and line level. Payment data for MCE encounters represents actual payments made to providers, including SUD and related services payments. Three of the four MCEs in Indiana w ere contracted through the entire study period, with the fourth, CareSource, added effective January 1, 2017. A data request specific to the 1115 SUD Evaluation Design Plan, will be given to Optum and the data will be delivered to B&A in an agreed upon format. The initial EDW data set will include historical data up to the point of the delivery, with subsequent data sent on a monthly basis. All data delivered to B&A from the OMPP will come directly from the EDW. B&A will leverage all data validation techni ques used by Optum before the data is submitted to the EDW. When additional data is deemed necessary for the evaluation, B&A will outreach directly to the MCEs to obtain the necessary data for the evaluation, including running the required data validations . A refresh of the EDW for additional claims with these dates of services will be done at six month and twelve -month intervals; the last query of the EDW will occur on January 1, 2022 for claims with DOS in the study period. Additional data from the MCEs and the State will be collected on prior authorizations, denials, denial reason codes as well as data on care coordination activities. There could be some data validity or quality issues with these sources as they are not as rigorously collected as claims and encounters data. That being said, we will use a standard quality review and data cleaning protocol in order to validate these data, as well as provide detailed specifications and reporting tools to the MCEs and the state to minimize potential for diffe rences in reporting of the requested ad -hoc data. Survey and Facilitated Interview Data N-SSATS The National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N -SSATS) is an annual survey of service providers. This data is reported at a statewide level and therefore, this data does not allow states to isolate demonstration populations. Moreover, the CMS technical guidance states that this survey is known to undercount Medicaid providers. Therefore, this data is used as supplement and will be used to review f or descriptive trends over time. FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, III-8 March 21, Provider Survey or Interview Guides B&A will construct standardized instruments in order to create primary data. The instruments will be provided to CMS for their feedback in advance of fielding. The instruments will be c reated after doing preliminary desk reviews and analysis, and therefore, are not included in the evaluation plan. It is anticipated that once the survey instruments are approved by CMS, they will be fielded for one month before initial results would be ta bulated. Where focused interviews are used to collect data, B&A will hold a sufficient number of sessions to collect the required data in accordance with the research question and CMS deliverable.

A detailed review of each are included in this section. Method 1: Interrupted Time Series (ITS) Interrupted time series (ITS) is a quasi- experimental method used to evaluate health inte rventions and policy changes when randomized control trials (RTC) are not feasible or appropriate.12,13,14 As it would not be ethical or consistent with Medicaid policy to withhold services resulting from waiver changes from a sub -set of SUD beneficiaries for purposes of evaluation, an RTC is therefore, not possible. Per CMS technical guidance, the ITS is the preferred alternative approach to RTC in the absence of an available, adequate comparison group. And finally, the ITS method is particularly suited f or interventions introduced at the population level which have a clearly defined time period and targeted health outcomes.15,16 ,17 An ITS analysis relies on a continuous sequence of observations on a population taken at equal intervals over time in which an underlying trend is \"interrupted\" by an intervention. In this evaluation, the waiver is the intervention and it occurs at a known point in time. The trend in the post-waiver is compared against the expected trend in the absence of the intervention. While there are no fixed limits regarding the number of data points because statistical power depends on a number of factors like variability of the data and seasonality, it is likely that a small number of observations paired with small expected effects may be underpowered.18 The expected change in many outcomes included in the evaluation are likely to be small and therefore, B&A will use 72 monthly observations where possible and 24 quarterly observations where monthly are not deemed reliable. In order to determine whether monthly or quarterly observations will be created, a reliability threshold of having a denominator of a minimum number of 100 observations at the monthly or quarterly level will be used. If quarterly reporting is not deemed reliable under this threshold, the measure and/or stratification will not be tested using interrupted time series and instead, these measures will be computed using calendar year data in the pre - and post -period and reported descriptively. 12 Bonell CP, Hargreaves J, Cou sens S et al..

These data will be inspected for identification of anomalies and trends. To identify underlying trends, seasonal patterns and outliers, scatter plots of each measure will be created and examined. Moreover, each outcome will undergo bivariate comparisons; a Pearson correlation coefficient will be produced for each measure compared to the others as well as each measure in the pre- and post - periods. Regression Analysis Wagner et al. described the s ingle segmented regression equation as19: t = 0 + 1*time t + 2*intervention t + 3*time_after_intervention t + e t Visualization and interpretation will be done as depicted in the Figure 10. Each outcome will be assessed for one of the following types of relationships in the pre - and post - wavier period: (a) Level change; (b) Slope change; (c) Level and slope change; (d) Slope change following a lag; (e) Temporary level change; (f) Temporary slope change leading to a level change.

FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, III- March 21, Figure 10. Illustration of Potential ITS Relationships20 Seasonality and Autocorrelation One strength of the ITS approach is that it is less sensitive to typical confounding variables which remain fairly constant such as population ag e or socio -economic status as these changes relatively slowly over time. However, ITS may be sensitive to seasonality. To account for seasonality in the data, the same time period, measured in months or quarters, will be used in the pre- and post -waiver period. Should it be necessary, a dummy variable can be added to the model to account for the month or quarter of each observation thereby controlling for the seasonal impact. An assumption of linear regression is that errors are independent. When errors are not independent, as is often the case for time series data, alternative methods may be warranted. To test for the independence, B&A will review a residual time series plot and/or autocorrelation plots of the residuals. In addition, a Durbin- Watson test will be constructed to detect the presence of autocorrelation. If the Durbin- Watson test statistic value is well below 1.0 or well above 3.0, there is an indication of serial correlation. If autocorrelation is detected, an autoregressive regression model, like the Cochrane- Orcutt model, will be used in lieu of simple linear regression. Other assumptions of linear regression are that data are linear and that there is constant variance in the errors versus time. Heteroscedasticity will be diagnosed by examining a plot of residuals verses predicted values. If the points are not symmetrically distributed around a horizontal line, with roughly constant variance, then the data may be nonlinear and transformation of the FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, III- March 21, dependent variable may be warranted. Heteroscedasticity often arises in time series models due to the effects of inflation and/or real compound growth. Some combination of logging and/or deflating may be necessary to stabilize the variance in this case. For these reasons and in accordance wi th CMS technical guidance specific to models with cost - based outcomes, B&A will use log costs rather than untransformed costs, as costs are often not normally distributed. For example, many person- months may have zero healthcare spending and other months very large values. To address these issues, B&A will use a two -part model that includes zero costs (logit model) and non- zero costs (generalized linear model). Controls and Stratification As described in Section III.B, the regression analysis will be run both on the entire SUD target population and stratified by relevant sub- populations. The sub- population level analysis may reveal waiver effects that would otherwise be masked if only run on the entire SUD population. Similarly, common demographic covaria tes such as age, gender, and race will be included in these models to the extent they improve the explanatory power of the ITS models. 20 From: Interrupted time series regression for the evaluation of public health interventions: a tutorial Int J Epidemiol. 2016;46(1):348- 355. doi:10.1093/ije/dyw098. Int J Epidemiol. FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, III- March 21, Method #2: Descriptive Statistics In order to facilitate ongoing monitoring, all measures will be summarized on an ongoing basis over the course of the waiver. The descriptive statistics will be stratified by ASAM level of care, by MCE and FFS delivery systems, and/or by region where possible. For reporting purposes, the descriptive studies will be subject to determination of a minimum number of beneficiaries in an individual reported cell (i.e., minimum cell size) and subject to blinding if the number falls below this threshold. While a conventional threshold is 10 or fewer observations, given the sensitivity of SUD and the public dissemination of report findings, a higher threshold may be established by B&A upon review of the final data. Results will primarily be reported in terms of longitudinal descriptive statistics of defined groups of SUD beneficiaries and using regional maps where possible. Method #3: Provider Surveys (PS) In order to fill gaps and address questions for which claims -based data is insufficient, one -time, cross - sectional provider surveys will be fielded. The surveys will be sent via an online survey tool. The survey will be sent to 100 percent of targeted providers. The provider groups include residential providers, inpatient providers and those serving patients with SUD who are receiving care coordination. The surveys will collect anonymous information related to perceptions of barriers, value and efficiency of improvements under the waiver. Dissemination of the survey and efforts to improve response rates will be coordinated with the OMPP and applicable Indiana provider and/or professional associations. The response rate will be clearly stated and considered when evaluating and/or presenting any findings. The survey questions will be presented to CMS in advance of fielding for their feedback and approval. A detailed o verview of each survey along the dimensions of interest to CMS (defining cohort, study period, analytics, etc.) are included for each research question using survey findings in Section III.G. Method #4: Onsite Reviews (OR) In order to fill gaps and address questions for which claims -based data and provider surveys are insufficient, a number of onsite reviews are proposed. These onsite reviews will seek to gain insight on nuanced differences in approach, use and effectiveness of different MCE and FSSA approaches to the following topics: Adoption of ANSA screening criteria and subsequent ASAM placement Credentialing of residential providers SUD care coordination activities The onsite reviews rely on creating a standardized set of questions that will capture information on process, documentation and medical records. The questions may include onsite documentation gathering and data validation related to those topics described above. In some cases, the onsite reviews will employ a sampling approach wher eby a limited number of FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, III- March 21, beneficiaries are selected based on a set of criteria, and internal records specific to those beneficiaries will be reviewed. The sample criteria would be developed to reflect the representativeness with the SUD population served by each MCE, which will help aid in the comparability of the results of the onsite across MCEs. Finally, the same reviewer (or group of reviewers) will be used for all MCE reviews, strengthening inter -reliability. A detailed overview of each onsite review along the dimensions of interest to CMS (defining cohort, study period, analytics, etc.) are included for each research question using onsite review findings in Section III.G. Method #5: Desk Reviews (DR) A limited number of desk reviews will supplement the other study methods included in the evaluation. These reviews will focus on hypotheses which are directed at assessment of process outcomes like avoidance of implementation delays, system changes according to schedules, transparency of policy and rates, and utility of stakeholder tools and analytics. Each desk review will use a questionnaire that asks for the information sought, the documentation reviewed, and the finding. Any gaps in information will also be noted as findings. The evaluator will review publicly available information and/or documentation specifically requested from the OMPP and/or the MCEs. A detailed overview of each survey along the dimensions of interest to CMS (defining cohort, study period, analytics, etc.) are included for each re search question using desk review findings in Section III.G. Method #6 Facilitated and/or Focus Group Interviews (FI/FG) As needed, the evaluator will supplement all study methods using facilitated interviews and/or focus groups. Like the onsite reviews, facilitated interviews and focus groups will be done by first creating a standardized questionnaire that will be used to validate or elucidate gaps in information related to findings of any of the study methods. Since these would be done on an ad - hoc basi s, no sampling design would be used; however, at minimum, the evaluator will ensure a broad representation of perspectives when doing additional research about a particular topic. An independent focus group facilitator has been engaged by the evaluation te am to conduct these focus groups.

That being said, the proposed design is feasible, and is a rational explanatory framework for evaluating the impact of the SUD waiver on the SUD population. Moreover, to fill gaps left by the limitations of this study design, a limited number of provider surveys, onsite reviews, desk reviews, and facilitated interviews/focus groups are proposed to provide a more holistic and comprehensive evaluation. Another limitation is the leng th of time of the evaluation period. It is not expected that a two-year evaluation period, assuming year one is the benchmark period, would be sufficient time to observe changes in all measures of interest. In some cases, the time period may be insufficient to observe descriptive or statically significant differences in outcomes in the SUD population. Therefore, it is expected that not all outcomes included in the study will show a demonstrable change descriptively, although we do expect some process measur es to show a change during this time frame. Moreover, with any study focused on the SUD population and potentially rare outcome measures, such as overdose rates, insufficient statistical power to detect a difference is a concern. For any observational studies, especially if the exposures and the outcomes being assessed are rare, it is difficult to find statistically significant results. It is not unexpected, therefore, that many of the outcome measure sample sizes will be too small to observe statistically significant results. Related to the issues mentioned above, many of the outcome measures are multi -dimensional and influenced by social determinants of health. While changes under the waiver related to access to care may be one dimension of various outc omes of interest, and may contribute to improvements, it may be difficult to achieve statistically significant findings in the absence of data on other contributing dimensions, like social determinants of health such as housing, employment, and previous incarcerations. Section V, Special Considerations, will summarize the unique challenges in this study, reemphasizing the need for a mix -methods approach. FINAL DRAFT Evaluation Design Plan for Indiana's 1115 SUD Waiver Burns & Associates, V- March 21, SECTION V: SPECIAL METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS Given that the waiver is new, and there are no identified implementation delays, or any other outstanding concerns, the proposed Evaluation Design Plan provides more than adequate rigor in the observational study design, especially when considering the range of supplemental evaluation methods proposed for inclusion. As described in detail in Section IV, Methodological Limitations, the study mitigates known limitations to the extent feasible drawing upon the range of options to fill gaps in the observational study design. Moreover, this Evaluation Design Plan is consistent with, and expands upon, CMS approved 1115 demonstration waiver SUD evaluation plans available on the CMS State Waivers List.21 Another special consideration is in the case of residential treatment in IMDs. While the waiver change is stated as \"no coverage\" to \"coverage for all\", B&A identified that IMD residential services may have been provided in the pre -waiver period, but these would be funded by100% state funds as opposed to matched federal dollars. Therefore, it is unclear whether a detectable change will be seen related to IMDs specifically, or whether change is created by the availability of new f unds to be invested in other waiver services. This nuance will be considered when evaluating the results.

A total of five vendors submitted proposals. After evaluation, and a request for a best and final offer from respondents, Burns & Associates, Inc. (B&A) was selected to act as the independent evaluator based on scores determined by the state review team on April 23, 2018. Vendor Qualifications B&A has served as the evaluator for the Indepe ndent Assessment for Indiana's 1915(b) waiver for Hoosier Care Connect and has served as the External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) for Indiana since 2007. B&A has written an External Quality Review (EQR) report each year since that time which has been submitted to CMS. With this experience, the B&A team is very familiar with the Indiana Medicaid program, the managed care entities (MCEs) under contract with the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (OMPP), and the unique issues related to SUD treatmen t. The team that developed the Evaluation Design Plan has also worked on numerous EQRs, including a baseline study on the initiation and engagement of treatment for SUD for Indiana Medicaid as part of the EQR 2015 report. Assuring Independence As the State EQRO, B&A has already established its independence as required of all EQROs for this engagement. Additionally, in accordance with standard term and condition (STC) Attachment A - Developing the Evaluation Design, B&A has signed \"No Conflict of Intere st\" statements regarding its work as the selected independent evaluator.

It also helps establish what information the state will report in its quarterly and annual monitoring reports. The implementation plan does not usurp or replac e standard CMS approval processes, such as advance planning documents, verification plans, or state plan amendments. This template only covers SMI/SED demonstrations. The template has three sections. Section 1 is the uniform title page. Section 2 contains implementation questions that states should answer. The questions are organized around six SMI/SED reporting topics: 1. Milestone 1: Ensuring Quality of Care in Psychiatric Hospitals and Residential Settings 2. Milestone 2: Improving Care Coordination and Transitioning to Community -Based Care 3. Milestone 3: Increasing Access to Continuum of Care, Including Crisis Stabilization Services 4. Milestone 4: Earlier Identification and Engagement in Treatment, Including Through Increased Integration 5. Financing Plan 6. Healt h IT Plan State may submit additional supporting documents in Section 3. Implementation Plan Instructions: This implementation plan should contain information detailing state strategies for meeting the specific expectations for each of the milestone s included in the State Medicaid Director Letter (SMDL) on \" Opportunities to Design Innovative Service Delivery Systems for Adults with [SMI] or Children with [SED]\" over the course of the demonstration. Specifically, this implementation plan should: 1. Include summar ies of how the state already meets any expectation/specific activities related to each milestone and any actions needed to be completed by the state to meet all of the expectations for each milestone, including the persons or entities responsible for completing these actions; and 2. Describe the timelines and activities the state will undertake to achieve the milestones. The tables below are intended to help states organize the information needed to demonstrate they are addressing the milestones describ ed in the SMDL. States are encouraged to consider the evidence -based models of care and best practice activities described in the first part of the SMDL in developing their demonstrations. The state may not claim FFP for services provided to Medicaid be neficiaries residing in IMDs, including residential treatment facilities, until CMS has approved a state's implementation plan. Memorandum of Understanding: The state Medicaid agency should enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or another formal a greement with its State Mental Health Authority , if one does not already exist, to delineate how these agencies will work with together to design, deliver, and monitor services for beneficiaries with SMI or SED. This MOU should be included 5 as an attachmen t to this Implementation Plan. State Response: In accordance with Indiana's approved Medicaid State Plan, the Office of the Secretary of the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) is the single state agency. The Division of Mental Health and Addi ction (DMHA) is within the FSSA; therefore, no MOU is applicable to this waiver request.

Milestone 1: Ensuring Quality of Care in Psychiatric Hospitals and Residential Settings To ensure that beneficiaries receive high quality care in hospitals and residential settings, it is important to establish an d maintain appropriate standards for these treatment settings through licensure and accreditation, monitoring and oversight process es, and program integrity requirements and processes. Individuals with SMI often have co -morbid physical health conditions and substance use disorders (SUDs) and should be screened and receive treatment for commonly co- occurring conditions particularly wh ile residing in a treatment setting. Commonly co- occurring conditions can be very serious, including hypertension, diabetes, and substance use disorders, and can also interfe re with effective treatment for their mental health condition. They should also be screened for suicidal risk. To meet this milestone, state Medicaid programs should take the following actions to ensure good quality of care in psychiatr ic hospitals and residential treatment settings. Ensuring Quality of Care in Psychiatric Hospita ls and Residential Treatment Settings a Assurance that participating hospitals and residential settings are licensed or otherwise authorized by the state primarily to provide mental health treatment ; and that residential treatment facilities are accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation entity prior to participating in Medicaid Current Status: In accordance with Indiana Administrative Code (440 IAC 1.5), all free -standing psychiatric hospit als must be licensed as a private mental health institution (PMHI)4 by the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA). PMHI licensure must be renewed annually. Additionally, all entities must be accredited by an agency approved by DMHA, which currently include the following: National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) CARF - The Rehabilitation Accreditation Commission Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) The following general components are required for licensure: A governing board 4 Defined as an inpatient hospital setting, including inpatient and outpatient services provided in that setting, for the treat ment and care of individuals with psychiatric disorders or chronic addictive disorders, or both, that is physically, organizationa lly, and programmatically independent of any hospital or health facility licensed by the Indiana State Department of Health. 8 Prompts Summary Medical or professional staff organization A quality assessment and improvement program Dietetic service Infection control program Medical record services Nursing service Physical plan, maintenance and environmental services Intake and treatment services Discharge planning services Pharmacy services A plan for special procedures An entity seeking a license as a PMHI must file an application with DMHA which includes, at minimum: A description of the organizational structure and mission of the applicant The location of all operational sites of the applicant The consumer population to be served and program focus A list of governing board members and executive staff A copy of the applicant's procedures to ensure protection of consumer rights and confidentiality Written evidence of an onsite review and inspection by the Indiana Department of Health and Department of Homeland Security Division of Fire and Building Safety and the correction of any deficiencies identified Proof of accreditation including site survey recommendations from the accrediting agency and the applicant's response to such recommendations To maintain licensure, a PMHI must meet the following conditions: Maintain accreditation from a DMHA approved accrediting agency Maintain compliance with required health, building, fire and safety codes as prescribed by federal, state and local law Have written policies and enforce these policies to support and protect the fundamental human, civil, constitutional and statutor y rights of each consumer Comply with requirements for providing, posting and documenting consumer statement of rights under Indiana Code 12- 27 Respond to complaints from the consumer service line in a timely manner 9 Prompts Summary Future Status: Continued operation of current requirements. Summary of Actions Needed : N/A -milestone requirements already met. b Oversight process (including unannounced visits) to ensure participating hospital and residential settings meet state's licensing or certification and accreditation requirements Current Status : DMHA currently conducts annual unannounced site visits of each PMHI. Site visits are conducted using a checklist which crosswalks with all licensure requirements. Future Status : Continued operation of current requirements. Summary of Actions Needed : N/A -milestone requirements already met. Utilization review process to ensure beneficiaries have access to the appropriate levels and types of care and to provide oversight on lengths of stay Current Status: In accordance with 405 IAC 5 -3-13, all inp atient psychiatric, substance abuse and rehabilitation admissions require prior authorization to ensure the appropriate level of care. Medical necessity reviews are completed by Indiana's managed care organizations (MCOs) and the State's fee- for-service pr ior authorization (PA) entity, based on the individual's enrollment. The PA entity utilizes Milliman Care Guidelines and OMPP reviews the MCO's UM practices. As described in the Indiana Medicaid Medical Policy Manual, acute psychiatric inpatient admissio ns are available for enrollees with a sudden onset of a psychiatric condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of such severity that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in one or more of the following: Dang er to the individual Danger to others Death of the individual Reimbursement is available for inpatient care only when the need for admission has been certified. Emergency and nonemergency admissions require telephonic precertification review. The precertification review must be followed by a written certification of need through completion of State Form 44697 - Certification of the Need for Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Services (12 61A form) along with a written plan of care. This form documents t he enrollee's: Psychiatric and medical evaluation Functional capacity Prognoses Recommendations 10 Prompts Summary Certification by an interdisciplinary team that based upon physical, mental and social evaluations the individual requires inpatient psychiatric treatment and a vailable alternative community resources do not meet the patient's mental health care needs All requests for PA are reviewed on a case- by-case basis. The MCO or PA entity reviews each State Form 44697 to determine whether the requested acute inpatient services meet medical necessity. Reimbursement is denied for any days the facility cannot justify a need for inpatient care. If the provider fails to complete a telephone PA precertification, reimbursement will be denied from the admission to the actual date of notification. Additionally, in accordance with 440 IAC 1.5 -3-9, all PMHIs must have policies and procedures that govern the intake and assessment process to determine eligibility for services. Each admitted Medicaid enrollee must have a preliminary tr eatment plan formulated within 60 hours of admission on the basis of the intake assessment at admission, which must specify the services necessary to meet the consumer's needs and contain discharge or release criteria and the discharge plan. Further, progr ess notes must be entered daily and the consumer's treatment plan must be reviewed at least every seven days. Future Status : OMPP will develop a report to monitor average length of stay (ALOS) for all Medicaid programs. All reporting will follow CMS monitoring guidance. Additionally, OMPP will review timeline requirements for submission of the 12 61A form. Summary of Actions Needed : The Quality and Outcomes section of OMPP, in coordination with the evaluation vendor and MCOs, will develop reporting specifications to implement monitoring for implementation. OMPP will make necessary updates to the provider manuals to reflect any changes by Q2 of 2020. Providers were notified of program changes via bulletin on November 26, 2019. d Compliance with program integrity requirements and state compliance assurance process Current Status : In order to receive reimbursement under Medicaid, parti cipating psychiatric hospitals must be enrolled to participate in Indiana Medicaid. Provider enrollment processes fully comply with 42 CFR Part 455 Subparts B&E. As MCOs have been reimbursing IMDs as an in lieu of service and are only permitted to contract with Indiana Medicaid screened and enrolled providers, the State is currently screening and revalidating this provider type. Future Status : Continued operation of current requirements. Summary of Actions Needed : N/A -milestone requirements already met. 11 Prompts Summary e State requirement that psychiatric hospitals and residential settings screen beneficiaries for co - morbid physical health conditions, SUDs, and suicidal ideation, and facilitate access to treatment for those conditions Current Status : Indiana Administrative Code (440 IAC 1.5 -3-9) details a series of required policies and procedures for intake and assessment processes. This includes, but is not limited to completion of the following assessments: Physical examination by a licensed physician, advance practice nurse or physician's assistant Emotional, behavioral, social and legal assessment Compliance with these requirements, including screening for SUD, is reviewed during annual site reviews conducted by the DMHA. Future Status : Compliance will continue to be monitored via the annual unannounced site visits of hospitals as part of their recertification. Summary of Actions Needed : N/A -milestone requirements already met. f Other state requirements/policies to ensure good quality of care in inpatient and residential treatment settings. Current Status : DMHA conducts the Mental Health Statistical Improvement Project Survey for Adults and Youth (MHSIP), an annual consumer satisfaction surveys for all individuals who have been served by DMHA contra cted providers. In addition, the MCOs conduct annual consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems (CAHPS) surveys which provide insight into the consumer experience with their healthcare providers. Findings from these surveys are utilized in qua lity assurance and improvement activities as needed. Future Status : Continued operation of current consumer satisfaction surveys. Summary of Actions Needed : N/A -milestone requirements already met. SMI/SED. Topic_2. Milestone 2: Improving Care Coordination and Transitioning to Community -Based Care Understanding the services needed to transition to and be successful in community -based mental health care requires partnerships between hospitals, residential providers, and community -based care providers. To meet this milestone, state Medicaid programs, must focus on improving care coordination and transitions to community -based care by taking the following actions. Improving Care Coordination and Transitions to Community -based Care a Actio ns to ensure psychiatric hospitals and residential settings carry out intensive pre- discharge planning, and include community- based providers in care transitions. Current Status: Indiana Administrative Code (440 IAC 1.5 -3-10) outlines minimum requirements for discharge planning. Hospitals are required to initiate discharge planning at admission that includes the following: Facilitates the provision of follow -up care. Transfers or refers consumers, along with necessary medical information and records, to ap propriate facilities, agencies, or outpatient services for follow -up or ancillary care. Required minimum information to be transferred includes: o Medical history o Current medications o Available social, psychological and educational services o Nutritional needs o Outpatient service needs 12 Prompts Summary o Follow -up care needs Additionally, in accordance with the Indiana Medicaid Medical Policy Manual, all plans of care must document a post -discharge plan and a plan for coordination of inpatient services with partial discharge plans, including appropriate services in the member's community to ensure continuity of care when the patient returns to his or her family and community upon discharge. Community mental health centers (CMHCs) are required, as codified in Indiana Administr ative Code (440 IAC 9-2-4), to be involved in the planning of treatment for and the discharge of consumers during the time a consumer is in inpatient care, to maintain continuity of care. Additionally, MCOs are contractually required to provide case management services for any member discharged from an inpatient psychiatric or substance abuse hospitalization for no fewer than 90 calendar days following discharge. MCO contracts also require case managers to contact members during an inpatient hospitalizati on, or immediately upon receiving notification of a member's inpatient behavioral health hospitalization and must schedule an outpatient follow -up appointment to occur no later than seven calendar days following the inpatient behavioral health hospitalizat ion discharge. If a member misses an outpatient follow -up or continuing treatment, the MCO is contractually required to ensure that a behavioral health care provider or the MCO's behavioral health case manager contacts that member within three business day s of notification of the missed appointment. Future Status : Continued operation of current requirements. Summary of Actions Needed : N/A -milestone requirements already met. 2.b Actions to ensure psychiatric hospitals and residential settings assess beneficiaries' housing situations and coordinate with housing services providers when needed and available. Current Status : MCOs are contractually required to provide case management s ervices for any member at risk for or discharged from an inpatient psychiatric or substance abuse hospitalization. Case managers must contact members during an inpatient hospitalization and as a component of case management, must make every effort to assist members in navigating community resources and linking members with community- based services such as Connect2Help211, food pantries, housing and housing supports, legal, employment and disaster services. Additionally, CMHCs are required, in accordance wi th IAC 440 IAC 9 -2-10, as a component of case management , to provide advocacy and referral including helping individuals access entitlement and other services, such as Medicaid, housing, food stamps, educational services, recovery groups, and vocational services. 13 Prompts Summary Future Status : Indiana Medicaid Provider Manual will be updated to explicitly require psychiatric hospitals have protocols in place to assess for housing insecurity as part of the social work assessment and discharge planning processes and to ref er to appropriate resources . Compliance will be monitored via the annual unannounced site visits of hospitals as part of their recertification. Post -discharge follow -up will continue to be provided by MCOs and providers eligible to deliver case management services. Summary of Actions Needed : Provider Manual will be updated by OMPP by Q2 2020 . The State issue d provider communication materials detailing the requirements on November 26, 2019 . 2.c State requirement to ensure psychiatric hospitals and residential settings contact beneficiaries and community- based providers through most effective means possible, e.g., email, text, or phone call within 72 hours post discharge Current Status: MCOs curr ently undertake the primary responsibility for assuring enrollees access follow -up care post -discharge. They are contractually required to schedule an outpatient follow -up appointment to occur no later than seven calendar days following an inpatient behavi oral health hospitalization discharge. If a member misses an outpatient follow -up appointment, the MCO must ensure that a behavioral health provider or the MCO's case manager contacts that member within three business days of notification of the missed appointment. Additionally, Indiana Medicaid provides coverage for bridge appointments, which are follow -up appointments after inpatient hospitalization for behavioral health issues, when no outpatient appointment is available within seven days of discharge. The goal of the bridge appointment is to provide proper discharge planning while establishing a connection between the member and the outpatient treatment provider. During the bridge appointment, the provider ensures, at minimum, the following: The membe r understands the medication treatment regimen as prescribed. The member has ongoing outpatient care. The family understands the discharge instructions for the member. Barriers to continuing care are addressed. Any additional questions from the member or f amily are answered. Future Status : Indiana Medicaid Provider Manual will be updated to explicitly require psychiatric hospitals have protocols in place to ensure contact is made by the treatment setting with each discharged beneficiary within 72 hours of discharge and follow -up care is accessed. Compliance will be monitored via the annual unannounced site visits of hospitals as part of their recertification. Summary of Actions Needed: Provider Manual will be updated by OMPP by Q2 2020. A provider bull etin detailing these requirements was published on November 26, 2019. 2.d Strategies to prevent or decrease lengths of stay in EDs Current Status : MCOs are required to identify high utilizers of ED services and ensure members are coordinated and participating in the appropriate disease management or care management services. Any member with ED utilizations at least three standard deviations from the mean are referred to care coordination. 14 Prompts Summary among beneficiaries with SMI or SED prior to admission Future Status : OMPP , in collaboration with its Provider Relations contractor, will monitor provider network capacity on an annual basis and identify underserved areas for targeted provider recruitment . Additionally, DMHA plans to pilot two Crisis Stabilization Un its (CSU) in the northern and southern parts of the state. The goals for these units are to provide an alternative to crisis evaluations within emergency departments and divert admissions to inpatient psychiatric units. FSSA's OMPP, DMHA, and Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS) are partnering with the Department of Child Services (DCS) and Juvenile Justice agencies to explore pilot ing mobile response stabilization services (MRSS). MRSS would provide community- based crisis interventio n including short term follow -up and support for the youth and family to prevent reescalation, emergency department utilization and/or inpatient admission. Summary of Actions Needed : OMPP will annually identify geographic shortage areas and Provider Enro llment will conduct targeted outreach to non- Medicaid enrolled providers in those areas. The CSU is proposed for implementation in SFY2020 . The timeline for a potential MRSS is currently under review. 2.e Other State requirements/policies to improve care coordination and connections to community- based care Current Status : Please refer to previous sections. Future Status : N/A Summary of Actions Needed : N/A SMI/SED. Topic_3. Milestone 3: Increasing Access to Continuum of Care, Includin g Crisis Stabilization Services Adults with SMI and children with SED need access to a continuum of care as these conditions are often episodic and the sever ity of symptoms can vary over time. Increased availability of crisis stabilization programs can help to divert Medicaid beneficiaries from unnecessary visits to EDs and admissions to inpatient facilities as well as criminal justice involvement. On -going treatment in outpatient settings can help address less acute symptoms and help beneficiaries with SMI or SED thrive in their communities. Strategies are also needed to help connect individuals who need inpatient or residential treatment with that level of care as soon as possible. To meet this milestone, state Medicaid progr ams should focus on improving access t o a continuum of care by taking the following actions. Access to Continuum of Care Including Crisis Stabilization 3.a The state's strategy to conduct annual assessments of the availability of mental health providers including psychiatrists, other practitioners, outpatient, community mental health Current Status: Indiana provides a comprehensive statewide se rvice array inclusive of: Outpatient behavioral health services currently delivered by providers across the State, as delineated in the attached Mental Health Services Availability Assessment Template. Medicaid rehabilitation option (MRO) delivered by the State's 24 CMHCs. All 92 counties in Indiana have at least one CMHC delivering care in the geographical area and most counties in the state, other than very rural ones, have more than one CMHC offering services within a county. 15 Prompts Summary centers, intensive outpatient/ partial hospitalization, residential, inpatie nt, crisis stabilization services, and FQHCs offering mental health services across the state, updating the initial assessment of the availability of mental health services submitted with the state's demonstration application. The content of annual assessments should be reported in the state's annual demonstration monitoring reports. These reports should include which providers have waitlists and what are average wait times to get an appointment Three \u00a71915(i) programs serving individuals with behavioral health needs. Expanded SUD services in accordance with the State's approved SUD waiver. Partial hospitalization programs which are time -limited medical services intended to provide a transition from inpatient psychiatric hospitalization to community -based care or, in some cases, substitute for an inpatient admission. Indiana Administrative Code and DMHA contracts require CMHCs to provide a defined continuum of care directly, or through subcontract which includes: Individualized treatment planning to increase patient coping skills and symptom management 24/7 crisis intervention Case management to fulfill individual patient needs, including assertive case management Outpatient services, including intensive outpatient services, substance abuse services, counseling and treatment Acute stabilization, including detoxification services Residential services Day treatment Family support services Medication evaluation and monitoring Services to prevent unnecessary and inappropriate treatment and hospitalization and the deprivation of a person's liberty Further, House Enrolled Act 1175, passed in the 2019 legislative session, will expand access to behavioral health providers for Medicaid enrollees. Under this law, licensed clinical social workers, licensed mental health counselors, licensed clinical addiction counselors and licensed marriage and family therapists will be eligible providers for the supervision of a plan of treatment for a patient's outpatient mental healt h or substance abuse treatment services. Prior to this legislation, midlevel behavioral health practitioners were not eligible to independently enroll in Indiana Medicaid and were required to bill under the supervision of an HSPP or psychiatrist. Additionally, effective July 1, 2019, in accordance with the CMS approval of SPA TN 18- 012, Indiana Medicaid expanded crisis intervention services, intensive outpatient program services and peer recovery services to all Indiana Medicaid programs; these services were previously limited to the MRO option. This change will expand the available provider base from the Indiana's CMHCs to all Medicaid enrolled providers meeting the applicable criteria. 16 Prompts Summary OMPP and DMHA continually assess access and availability of behavi oral health services. For example, in accordance with the State's approved \u00a71915(b)(4) waivers for MRO services and \u00a71915(i) programs, FSSA utilizes information gathered from analysis of Indiana's MMIS, site reviews, and recipient reports and complaints to evaluate the need to expand provider agencies and/or provide training and/or corrective actions to assist provider agencies in increasing efficiencies for timely access to services. When \"timely access\" is identified as a provider agency issue, the State uses a request for corrective action and provides technical assistance and training in order to assist the agency in correcting the issue. If the issue is not remediated satisfactorily, further sanctions are applied, up to and including decertification of the agency as an MRO or \u00a71915(i) provider. Further, OMPP 's Provider Relations contractor identifies underserved areas by calculating the ratio of providers to members by county. Recruiting efforts are intensified in counties that are identified as not mee ting HRSA provider -to-member ratio standards. Utilizing the results of this analysis, the Provider Relations team outreaches to behavioral health providers not currently Medicaid enrolled. Provider Relations employs the following strategy to reach out to potential providers: Analyze the provider -to-population report to prioritize the geographic areas to be targeted. Analyze NPI reports to determine which specialties are underrepresented in the selected geographic region. Collaborate with residency programs to educate graduating classes about the benefits of providing services to the Medicaid population and encourage enrollment in Medicaid when residents graduate. Contact providers by telephone or via on- site visit. During the contact, Provider Relations will : Invite the provider to consider Medicaid enrollment. Explain the benefits of Medicaid enrollment. Educate the provider regarding any misconceptions about Medicaid . Mitigate the provider's objections. Offer to make an on- site visit to discuss enrollment and help the provider complete the online enrollment application, if applicable. Ascertain the reasons the provider chooses not to enroll, if applicable. Additionally, MCOs are contractually required to meet network adequacy standards for behavioral health providers in accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7438.68. Corrective action is implemented when standards are not met. 17 Prompts Summary Future Status: OMPP will continue to monitor provider network capacity on an annual basis. Additionally, DMHA plans to pilot two Crisis Stabilizati on Units (CSU) in the northern and southern parts of the state. The goals for these units are to provide an alternative to crisis evaluations within emergency departments and divert admissions to inpatient psychiatric units. FSSA's OMPP, DMHA, and Divisi on of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS) are partnering with the Department of Child Services (DCS) and Juvenile Justice agencies to explore pilot ing mobile response stabilization services (MRSS). MRSS would provide community- based crisis interv ention including short term follow -up and support for the youth and family to prevent reescalation, emergency department utilization and/or inpatient admission. Summary of Actions Needed : OMPP will annually identify geographic shortage areas and Provider Enrollment will conduct targeted outreach to non- Medicaid enrolled providers in those areas. The CSU is proposed for implementation in SFY2020 . The timeline for MRSS is currently under review. 3.b Financing plan Current Status: Please refer to Financing Plan below. Future Status: Please refer to Financing Plan below. Summary of Actions Needed: Please refer to Financing Plan below. 3.c Strategies to improve state tracking of availability of inpatient and crisis stabilization beds Current Status: In March 2018, FSSA implemented a new tool to help Hoosiers seeking treatment for SUD immediately connect with available inpatient or residential treatment services. This new tool is made possible by a partnership between the State, OpenBeds, a sof tware platform that manages health services, and Indiana 2 - 1-1, a non -profit organization that provides health care and other resource referrals to those in need. This service allows treatment facilities to list their vacancies in a real -time, broadly connected database and offers a comprehensive suite of information technology functionalities specific to mental health and SUD, and provides capability for: Transparency regarding the capacity of inpatient services, including recovery housing and community services, to provide an immediate and accurate inventory of available resources Secure and HIPAA -compliance digital communication for referrals with email and text notifications, including the ability to transmit client data, along with consent Digital registration and authentication for health systems and organizations Real-time analytics to track utilization and referral patterns across the region Patient marketplace or \"pull referral\" functionality to expedite patient placement Mobile platform 18 Prompts Summary Futur e Status: FSSA is currently in the process of expanding use of OpenBeds beyond SUD to include tracking availability of psychiatric inpatient and crisis stabilization beds. Summary of Actions Needed: Expansion of OpenBed s contract in Fall 2019 to includ e psychiatric bed capacity. 3.d State requirement that providers use a widely recognized, publicly available patient assessment tool to determine appropriate level of care and length of stay Current Status: Every individual served by a DMHA contracted provider receives a Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) or Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment (ANSA) to inform individualized treatment planning and level of care decision making. Individuals are reassessed every six months with adjustments t o level of care and/or treatment plan being made accordingly. Further, a s stated in Indiana Administrative Code 405 IAC 5 -21.5, IHCP reimbursement for MRO services is available for members who meet specific diagnosis and level of need (LON) criteria under the approved DMHA assessment tool (ANSA or CANS ). Additional MRO services beyond what is available for the assigned service package may be added with prior authorization (PA). MRO services are clinical behavioral health services provided to members and families of members living in the community who need aid intermittently for emotional disturbances, mental illness, and addiction. The CANS/ANSA also inform individual service needs and level of care that could include inpatient and/or residential services. In addition to use of the CANS and ANSA, determinations of medical necessity for behavioral health services are based on utilization management criteria implementation by the State's MCOs and utilization management vendor. Future Status: N/A Summary of Actions Needed: N/A e Other state requirements/policies to improve access to a full continuum of care including crisis stabilization Current Status : Please refer to previous sections. Future Status : N/A Summary of Actions Needed : N/A SMI/SED. Topic_4. Milestone 4: Earlier Identification and Engagement in Treatment, Including Through Increased Integration Critical strategies for improving care for individuals with SMI or SED include earlier identification of serious mental healt h conditions and focused efforts to engage individuals with these conditions in treatment sooner. To meet this milestone, state Medicaid progr ams must focus on improving mental health care by taking the following actions. Earlier Identification and Engageme nt in Treatment Current Status: The Vocational Rehabilitation Services (VRS) is a program of FSSA's Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS). VRS are available statewide, in all regions of the state. Eligibility for 19 Prompts Summary 4.a Strategies for identifying and engaging beneficiaries with or at risk of SMI or SED in treatment sooner, e.g., with supported education and employment VRS is determined in accordance with federal requirements at 34 CFR 361.42(a). Accordingly, eligibility for VRS includes a determination that an applicant meets the following conditions: Has a physical or mental impairment This impairment constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment VRS are required to prepare for, enter, engage in, or retain an employment outcome consistent with his or her abilities, capacities, career interests, and informed choice. Additionally, all applicants determined eligible for Social Security for Social Se curity Disability (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are presumed eligible for VRS. Individuals receiving VRS have an Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) based on the requirements at 34 CFR 361.45, following an assessment for determining v ocational rehabilitation needs. VRS are provided in accordance with the IPE and may include: Vocational counseling and guidance Medical treatment to correct or modify the physical or mental impairment Training (including vocational school, college or unive rsity, on- the-job, and other training) Rehabilitation technology (assistive devices and services) Placement assistance and follow -up (including supported employment) Other planned goods and services determined to be necessary to address an identified subst antial impediment to employment and to be required to enable the individual to prepare for, enter, engage in, or retain an employment outcome Supportive employment (SE) is available as a VRS. Through this service, individuals with the most severe disabili ties are placed in competitive jobs with qualified job coaches/trainers to provide individualized, ongoing support services needed for each individual to retain employment. The employer is contacted monthly and the employee is visited twice monthly, either at or away from the workplace, to address any issues that may threaten the individual's ability to remain on the job. Additionally, several of Indiana's CMHCs provide supportive employment services, an evidence- based service to promote rehabilitation and return to productive employment for persons with serious mental illness. These programs use a team approach for treatment, with employment specialists responsible for carrying out all vocational services from intake through follow -along. Job placements ar e: community -based (i.e., not sheltered workshops, not onsite at SE or other treatment agency offices), competitive (i.e., jobs are not exclusively reserved for SE clients, but open to public), in normalized settings, and utilize multiple employers. The SE team has a small client to staff ratio. SE contacts occur in the home, at the job site, or in the community. The SE team is assertive in engaging and retaining clients in treatment, especially utilizing face -to-face community 20 Prompts Summary visits, rather than phone or mail contacts. The SE team consults/works with family and significant others when appropriate. SE services are frequently coordinated with Vocational Rehabilitation benefits. Future Status: Continued operation of current programming. Summary of Actions Needed: N/A 4.b Plan for increasing integration of behavioral health care in non -specialty settings to improve early identification of SED/SMI and linkages to treatment Current Status : In 2012, FSSA in partnership with the Indiana Stat e Department of Health (ISDH) launched the Primary Care and Behavioral Health Integration (PCBHI) initiative, to develop a statewide strategic plan to integrate primary and behavioral health care services in Indiana. As an outgrowth of this initiative, the State was awarded the SAMHSA and National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASHMHPD) Transformation Transfer Initiative (TTI) Grant which allowed the State to implement a series of initiatives aimed at increased integration. Additionally, a process was established by which Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs), Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Community Health Centers (CHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) could become a state certified integrated care entity (ICE). Curr ently, there are 13 ICE sites operating within the State. ICE core requirements include: Core assessments for behavioral and physical health Integrated care plans Interdisciplinary team meetings Real-time physician/pharmacy consults Leadership support Evidence based practice and training Electronic health records and data sharing Quality outcome measures The State has also focused on school -based initiatives to increase behavioral health integration. For example, CMHCs across the State work in close co llaboration with Indiana schools. Currently , 85% of school districts have CMHCs providing services within their schools. Additionally, DMHA released an RFP in June 2019 to contract with no more than three regionally diverse social services providers to implement an evidence- based program that partners with school corporations, charter schools, and accredited nonpublic schools to provide social work services and evidence- based prevention programs to children, parents, caregivers, teachers, and the community to prevent substance abuse, promote healthy behaviors, and maximize student success. Further , the MCOs are contractually required to plan for, develop and/or enhance relationships with school - based health centers (SBHC) with the goal of providing accessi ble services to school -aged enrolled members. 21 Prompts Summary SBHCs provide on -site comprehensive preventive and primary health services including behavioral health, oral health, ancillary and enabling services. Additionally, Ind iana encourages the integration of primary and behavioral health care services through the use of an alternative payment methodology (APM) for federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) which consists of: (1) an adjustment to the FQHC's prospective payment system (PPS) rate; and (2) performance incentive payments limited to an established annual amount for each participating FQHC. To qualify for an APM, the FQHC must implement a care plan that fully integrates primary care and behavioral health at the FQHC through an integration plan approved by OMPP and DMHA which includes the following components: Incorporation of screening and evaluation processes to identify targeted patient population Establishment of appropriate levels of behavioral health staffing Physical integration of the provision of primary and behavioral health care together at the same FQHC location Performance of medical and behavioral health care services by the staff at the FQHC Full integration of medical records, billing and other data rela ting to primary and behavioral health care services Ongoing monitoring of the integration plan through data collection and evaluation Future Status : The State will ensure the financial sustainability of a physical health and behavioral health integration model following the end of the current grant funding . Summary of Actions Needed : OMPP , in partnership with DMHA is pursuing options for sustainability and expansion of the State's model for primary care and behavioral health integration. DMHA is subm itting an application for SAMHSA's (FY) 2020 Promoting Integration of Primary and Behavioral Health Care (Short Title: PIPBHC) grant and OMPP is exploring implementation of a health homes state plan amendment in 2021. F4.c Establishment of specialized set tings and services, including crisis stabilization, for young people experiencing SED/SMI Current Status : The State's review of the crisis continuum confirmed the following crisis services are being provided in addition to the CMHC mandated 24/7 crisis services: mobile crisis teams (5), assertive community treatment (ACT) (6), 23 -hour crisis stabilization units (7), short -term crisis residential (2) and peer crisis services (2). Future Status : DMHA plans to pilot two Crisis Stabilization Units (CSU) in the northern and southern parts of the state. The goals for these units are to provide an alternative to crisis evaluations within emergency departments and divert admissions to inpatient psychiatric units. FSSA's OMPP, DMHA, and Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS) are partnering with the Department of Child Services (DCS) and Juvenile Justice agencies to explore pilot ing mobile response stabilization services (MRSS). MRSS would provide community -based crisis intervention including s hort term 22 Prompts Summary follow -up and support for the youth and family to prevent reescalation, emergency department utilization and/or inpatient admission. Summary of Actions Needed : The CSU is proposed for implementation in SFY2020 . The timeline for MRSS is currently under review. 4.d Other state strategies to increase earlier identification/engagement, integration, and specialized programs for young people Current Status : Please refer to previous sections. Future Status : N/A Summary of Actions Needed : N/A SMI/SED.Topic_5. Financing Plan ate Medicaid programs should detail plans to support improved availability of non -hospital, non -residential mental health services including crisis stabilization and on- going community -based care. The financing plan should describe state efforts to increase access to community -based mental health providers for Medicaid beneficiaries throughout the state, including through changes to reimbursement and financing po licies that address gaps in access to community -based providers identified in the state's assessment of current availability of mental health services included in the state's application. F.a Increase availability of non - hospital, non- residential crisis stabilization services, including services made available through crisis call centers, mobile crisis units, observation/assessment centers, with a coordinated community crisis response that involves collaboration with trained law enforcement and other first responders . Current Status : The State's review of the crisis continuum confirmed the following crisis services are being provided in addition to the CMHC mandated 24/7 crisis services: mobile crisis teams (5), assertive community treatment (ACT) (6), 23 -hour crisis st abilization units (7), short -term crisis residential (2) and peer crisis services (2). Effective July 1, 2019, in accordance with the CMS approval of SPA TN 18- 012, Indiana Medicaid expanded crisis intervention services, intensive outpatient program serv ices and peer recovery services to all Indiana Medicaid programs; these services were previously limited to the MRO option. This change will expand the available provider base from the Indiana's CMHCs to all Medicaid enrolled providers meeting the applicab le criteria. Future Status : The State will annually monitor access to non -residential crisis stabilization services through an agreed upon methodology. In addition, the State will encourage and support non- CMHC providers to increase access to intensive outpatient, peer support and crisis intervention services. DMHA plans to pilot two Crisis Stabilization Units (CSU) in the northern and southern parts of the state. The goals for these units are to provide an alternative to crisis evaluations wi thin emergency departments and divert admissions to inpatient psychiatric units. FSSA's OMPP, DMHA, and Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services (DDRS) are partnering with the Department of Child Services (DCS) and Juvenile Justice agencies to explore piloting mobile response 23 Prompts Summary stabilization services (MRSS).

Summary of Actions Needed : The CSU is proposed for implementation in SFY2020 . The timeline for MRSS is currently under review. F.b Increase availability of on - going community- based services, e.g., outpatient, community mental health centers, partial hospitalization/day treatment, assertive community treatment, and services in integrated care settings such as the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic model . Current Status : As described throughout this template, and as outlined in the attached \"Overview of the Assessment of the Availability of Mental Health Services\" template, Indiana offers a comprehensive continuum of community- based services. Effective July 1, 2019, in a ccordance with the CMS approval of SPA TN 18 -012, Indiana Medicaid expanded crisis intervention services, intensive outpatient program services and peer recovery services to all Indiana Medicaid programs; these services were previously limited to the MRO o ption. This change will expand the available provider base from the Indiana's CMHCs to all Medicaid enrolled providers meeting the applicable criteria. Future Status : The State will annually monitor access to community -based services through an agreed upon methodology. In addition, the State will specifically monitor any changes to non-CMHC providers and the impact on access to intensive outpatient, peer support and crisis intervention services. Summary of Actions Needed : OMPP will annually identify geographic shortage areas and Provider Enrollment will conduct targeted outreach to non- Medicaid enrolled providers in those areas. 24 Prompts Summary SMI/SED.

Through this HIT Plan, the State intends to drive improvements in this area. Statement 2: Please confirm that your state's SUD Health IT Plan is aligned with the state's broader State Medicaid Health IT Plan and, if applicable, the state's Behavioral Health IT Plan. If this is not yet the case, please describe how this will be achieved and ove r what time period. This HIT Plan is aligned with the State's broader State Medicaid Health IT Plan (SMHP). The State is in the process of completing an updated SMHP with targeted completion by the end of calendar year 2019. Through this update process, areas of prioritization will take into consideration the milestones of this waiver. Statement 3: Please confirm that the state intends to assess the applicability of standards referenced in the Interoperability Standards Advisory (ISA)6 and 45 CFR 170 Subpart B and, based on that assessment, intends to include them as appropriate in Indiana will review the applicability of standards referenced in the Interoperability Standards Advisory (ISA) and 45 CFR 170 Subpart B for potential inclusion into our MCO contracts. The following standards are currently utilized by our MC Os: Documenting and Sharing Care Plans - The MC Os are contractually obligated to share care plans with primary medical providers (PMPs) and behavioral health providers with appropriate consent. The MC Os have agreements with health information exchanges, such as the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) and the Michiana Health Information Network (MHIN). 6 Available at https://www.healthit.gov/isa/. 26 Prompts Summary subsequent iterations of the state's Medicaid Managed Care contracts. The ISA outlines relevant standards including but not limited to the following areas: referrals, care plan s, consent, privacy and security, data transport and encryption, notification, analytics and identity management.

With multiple HIEs and large health sy stems that have been able to exchange effectively via EHR and prescription software vendors, it is difficult to accurately assess participation. Each HIE is able to easily report on its participants but the extent to which non- participating organizations a re identified and assessed individually is meticulous work. It is known that certain hospital, facility, and provider types that were not eligible for Meaningful Use (Promoting Interoperability) are not participating due to lagging technology and/or regula tory barriers, such as with CFR 42 Part 2. 7 See SMDL #16 -003, \" Availability of HITECH Administrative Matching Funds to Help Professionals and Hospitals Eligible for Medicaid EHR Incentive Payments Connect to Other Medicaid Providers .\" Available at https://www.medicaid.gov/federal -policy -guidance/downloads/smd16003.pdf . 8 Guidance for Administrative Claiming through the \"No Wrong Door System \" is available at https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/finance/admin -claiming/no - wrong- door/index.html . 27 Prompts Summary The aforementioned March 2019 HIS Assessment did reveal provider tracking of referrals may be facilitated by tools within the EHR but most still struggle with closing the referral loop. Future State : The State will conduct a survey to identify the volume of providers utilizing closed loop referrals and e -referrals to identify the baseline of current activity and identify options for increasing provider uptake. Summary of Actions Needed: The provider survey will be conducted by FSSA. The dates for completion will be based on prioritization of this activity as determined during completion of the updated SMHP. 1.2 Closed loop referrals and e - referrals from institution/hospital/clinic to physician/mental health provider Current State : The State does not have readily accessible data on the exact number of Medicaid -enrolled behavioral health providers who have adopted certified EHRs and are utilizing them for e -referrals and/or closed loop referrals.

The dates for completion will be based on prioritization of this activity as determined durin g completion of the updated SMHP. Electronic Care Plans and Medical Records (Section 2) 2.1 The state and its providers can create and use an electronic care plan Current State : The aforementioned March 2019 HIS Assessment revealed that while electronic care plans are utilized they are not standardized. HIEs receive what the provider delivers via continuity of care documents (CCD ) but c ontent and format are variable. Future State : The State will work toward compliance with the forthcoming CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule. Additionally, FSSA will survey IMDs to identify the baseline of current activities to identify options for increasing IMD activity in this area. Summary of Actions Needed: FSSA will monitor for CMS release of the final rule and determine required steps and timeline for compliance accordingly. The I MD survey will be conducted by FSSA. The dates for 28 Prompts Summary completion will be based on prioritization of this activity as determined during completion of the updat ed SMHP. 2.2 E -plans of care are interoperable and accessible by all relevant members of the care team, including mental health providers Current State : Indiana contracts with the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) to aggregate Medicaid claims with medical and pharmacy data in its repository to create a continuity of care (CCD) record that can be shared between Medicaid providers. The aforementioned March 2019 HIS Assessment indicates some MCOs and providers are receiving admit -discharge- transfer ( ADT), CCDs or other clinical data points and incorporating directly into their work flow for care coordination and quality management. Additionally, the majority of community mental health centers have certified EHRs and utilize Viewpoint, a referral porta l, to communicate among entities. Future State : As previously described, OMPP is exploring submi tting a health homes state plan amendment. A key component of this initiative will include leveraging HIT for enhanced integration and coordination. OMPP is currently in the process of developing HIT standards and requirements for participating providers. Addit ionally, the State will work toward compliance with the forthcoming CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule. FSSA will also survey IMDs to identify the baseline of current activities to identify options for increasing IMD activity in this area. Summary of Actions Needed: OMPP is exploring submitting a health homes state plan amendment with an implementation date by 2021. FSSA will monitor for CMS release of the final rule and determine required steps and timeline for compliance accordingly. Th e IMD survey will be conducted by FSSA. The dates for completion will be based on prioritization of this activity as determined during completion of the updated SMHP. 2.3 Medical records transition from youth- oriented systems of care to the adult behavioral health system through electronic communications Current State : State psychiatric hospitals utilize one EHR system which permits tracking of records as youth transition to adulthood. Future State : The State will work toward compliance with the forthcoming CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule. Additionally, FSSA will survey IMDs to identify the baseline of current activities to identify options for increasing IMD activity in this area.

Future State : The State will work toward compliance with the forthcoming CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule. FSSA will also survey IMDs to identify the baseline of current activities to identify options for increasing IMD activity in this area. 29 Prompts Summary Summary of Actions Needed: FSSA will monitor for CMS release of the final rule and determine required steps and timeline for compliance accordingly. The I MD survey will be conducted by FSSA. The dates for completion will be based on prioritization of this activity as determined during completion of the updated SMHP. 2.5 Transitions of care and other community supports are accessed and supported through electronic communications Current St ate: In 2017, DMHA released an RFP to procure a new EHR system to be used collectively by all state psychiatric hospitals. The State's expectation is that a modern EHR will facilitate interoperability. The required HIE functionality put forth in FSSA's sta tement of work for this project include: Admission, discharge and transfer (ADT) and census o Collecting and updating patient demographic information, family contact data, alerts, insurance coverage, management of room and bed, census activities, and leave- of-absence o Fully integrating the aforementioned data across the other core functions Clinical documentation: I ncludes assessments, treatment, treatment plans, and nursing care plans, including, but not limited to, historical patient data, patient risk crit eria, electronic document system capturing interdisciplinary Plans of Care and reporting, automated work lists, clinical decision support, and patient education tracking. The system must support multiple modes of data entry including, but not limited to, t emplate notes, third -party dictation, and voice recognition. This also includes fully integrating this data across the other core functions . Interfaces, data sharing and interoperability: o Using common standards and implementation specifications for electronic exchange of information in accordance with MU Stage 2 guidance . o Actual electronic exchange of clinical information with acute care hospitals, CMHCs, Public Health registries, LTC facilities, private practitioners, pharmacies, correctional facilities, judicial bodies, laboratories, and healthcare payers (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare, commercial insurance, Social Security Administration [SSA], private pay, etc.) Case management: Functionality includes, but is not limited to, the ability for designated staff t o track, manage, document, and receive alerts for case management activities. Having the State Psychiatric Hospitals interface with an HIE will give the Medicaid providers operating within the SPHs the capability to exchange health information with adjacent acute care facilities/hospitals, CMHCs, and other healthcare partners along the continuum of care. This specifically will allow Medicaid providers the capability to meet MU stage 3. More specifically the SPHs will be capable of bi -directionally exchanging summary of care records and CCDs when referring or receiving a Medicaid pati ent to or from another care setting. In addition, SPHs interfacing with the HIE will be capable of sending and receiving ADT notifications. These activities allow Medicaid providers within the SPHs to fulfill the objectives and enables them to report measu res in accordance with MU stage 3 for HIE. 30 Prompts Summary Future State : FSSA will survey IMDs to identify the baseline of current activities to identify options for increasing IMD activity in this area. Summary of Actions Needed: The IMD survey will be conducted by FSSA. The dates for completion will be based on prioritization of this activity as determined during completion of the updated SMHP. Consent - E-Consent (42 CFR Part 2/HIPAA) (Section 3) 3.1 Individual consent is electronically captured and accessible to patients and all members of the care team, as applicable, to ensure seamless sharing of sensitive health care information to all relevant parties consistent with applicable law and regulations (e.g., HIPAA, 42 CFR part 2 and state laws) Curre nt State: Consent/privacy is managed in a multitude of mechanisms across the Medicaid Health Information Sharing Enterprise, many still very manual, non- standardized and not electronically transmitted. HIEs rely on the participants to manage what informati on is delivered to them. Substance abuse disorder laws (42 CFR Part 2) require explicit patient consent and therefore typically are only shared in a one -off manual manner . Consent, segregation of highly sensitive records, and secure transport are difficult to implement and manage and therefore infrequently done electronically. Indiana is an opt -out state for HIE. Responsibility is on provider to communicate with patients. Patient data can be shared with HIE unless the patient explicitly requests it not to b e. Future State : To be determined based on prioritization of initiatives during the aforementioned SMHP update process. Summary of Actions Needed: To be determined based on prioritization of initiatives during the aforementioned SMHP update process. Interoperability in Assessment Data (Section 4) 4.1 Intake, assessment and screening tools are part of a structured data capture process so that this information is interoperable with the rest of the HIT ecosystem Current State : Within the integrated care entities (ICE), core assessments and adjudicated Medicaid claims data are aggregated and available via the Relias ProAct Tool. This tool exclusively houses Medicaid patients and an external facing interface is provided for each I CE and applies 400+ measures to Medicaid claims and non- claims data. It provides individual patient history, as well as population demographics and associated costs of diagnoses, medications and utilization. Future State : The State will work toward comp liance with the forthcoming CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule. Summary of Actions Needed: FSSA will monitor for CMS release of the final rule and determine required steps and timeline for compliance accordingly. Electronic Office V isits - Telehealth (Section 5) 5.1 Telehealth technologies support collaborative care by facilitating broader availability of integrated mental health care and primary care Current State : Indiana received $16 million from the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) Rural Health Care Pilot Program, and as a result, created the Indiana Telehealth Network (ITN). ITN formed an FCC Rural Health Care Steering Committee, which was made up of representatives from healthcare providers, telecommunication c ompanies, representatives from the Indiana Office of Community & Rural Affairs, and representatives from the Indiana Rural Health Association, the lead entity for the ITN. The five -year project was divided into three phases and the work successfully conclu ded in 2015. The table below presents a summary of the project phases. 31 Prompts Summary Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Reduced bandwidth costs Reduced Primary Rate Interface (PRI) costs Doubled the speed of existing broadband connections 85% funding for construction of fiber to their hospitals Completed ability to transmit images Improved economic opportunities Expanded ability to conduct Telehealth encounters over a dedicated health care network Disaster Recovery E-Learning Internet Access Videoconferencing Seamless interfaces with the Indiana Health Information Organizations (HIOs) As of December 2016, ITN's healthcare participants included 153 critical access hospitals, rural hospitals, urban partner hospitals, rural health clinics, urban partner hospit als, rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers, community mental health centers and data centers. Additionally, as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, a portion of Indiana's awarded funding is being utilized to implement Project -ECHO -Exten sion for Community Healthcare Outcomes. The primary goal of ECHO is to enable rural and traditionally underserved populations to receive high- quality care, when they need it, close to home. This low -cost, high -impact intervention is achieved by leveraging technology to connect expert mentors and multiple local primary care providers in online video -conferencing TeleECHO clinics. Future State : Continued operation of current programing. Summary of Actions Needed: N/A Alerting/Analytics (Section 6) 6.1 The state can identify patients that are at risk for discontinuing engagement in their treatment, or have stopped engagement in their treatment, and can notify their care teams in order to ensure treatment continues or resumes (Note: Current State : Some providers may have this capability, but the current volume is unknown. Future State : As previously described, OMPP is exploring submitting a health homes state plan amendment. A key component of this initiative will include leveraging HIT for enhanced integration and coordination.

Identity Management (Section 7) 7.1 As appropriate and needed, the care team has the ability to tag or link a child's electronic medical records with their respective parent/caretaker medical records Current State : The State's eligibility and enrollment system can link children and parents on the same case. Future State : To be determined based on prioritization of initiatives during the aforementioned SMHP update process. Summary o f Actions Needed: To be determined based on prioritization of initiatives during the aforementioned SMHP update process. 7.2 Electronic medical records capture all episodes of care, and are linked to the correct patient Current State: The aforementioned March 2019 assessment of Indiana's HIS indicates patient/client identification is inconsistent between entities. Patient matching is an issue for all entities. Health systems employ entire departments to deal with multiple issues surrounding the record integrity that include duplicate records or documenting on the wrong patient record. Resolving a merged record and identifying who may have received erroneous information may take many hours of work per case. Additionally, Indiana is currently participating in the National Governor's Association \"Harnessing the Power of Data to Achieve State Policy Goals: The Foundation for State Success in Improving Quality and Reducing Costs\" initiative, intended to address g overnance, cross -sector data sharing and systems capabilities. Future State : The State will work toward compliance with the forthcoming CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule. Summary of Actions Needed: FSSA will monitor for CMS release o f the final rule and determine required steps and timeline for compliance accordingly. 9 Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee.
