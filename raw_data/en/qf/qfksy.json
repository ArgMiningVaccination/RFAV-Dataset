The Callisto Protocol - The Truth of Black Iron Trailer Score distribution: - Positive: [43 out of Negative: [7 out of 85](/game/playstation-5/the-callisto-protocol/critic-reviews?dist=negative) - Dec 1, 2022A wonderfully exhausting exercise in futility is probably the best way of describing The Callisto Protocol as no matter the strength of my own resolve, I was constantly on edge and reveling in those fleeting moments where the game allowed me to breathe following yet another life-threatening fight. The constant fear and dread incited by the phenomenal visual and sound design are only complemented by the compelling story. The Callisto Protocol is, hopefully, the start of an exciting new franchise, and is another sign that survival horror is anything but dead. - Dec 7, 2022The Callisto Protocol is a game that any survival horror fan should try. It is also a sample of what the new consoles can achieve. Both graphically and in a matter of immersion. With an exciting story and beautiful settings. - Dec 1, 2022The Callisto Protocol is not a groundbreaking experience or the best horror game ever, but it's a pretty good one. The amazing visuals, great cast, perfect settings and intense combat make it one of the most enjoyable adventures of 2022 - although it's quite short (and sometimes glitchy). - Dec 1, 2022The Callisto Protocol immerses you in its world full of horror and gore to the bone combined with that wonderful photo-realism of the characters and environment. The gameplay is a pure Dead Space feeling but clunky. It has the features of a survival game but it still has a lot to implement. The game is more like a Josh Duhamel simulator. - Dec 1, 2022The Callisto Protocol is a satisfyingly gory spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, but it's ultimately more of a striking modern mimic than a scary new mutation. - Dec 7, 2022The Callisto Protocol prevails at setting the mood and making you feel like you are part of the action, but it comes up short when delivering an experience that keeps your attention longer than the initial jump scare. - Dec 4, 2022The Callisto Protocol isn't scary. It isn't fun. It isn't entertaining, fascinating, or mildly enriching. It lays a self-entitled claim to Dead Space's stylistic and mechanical elements yet wields not a single one with grace, instead performing a crude pantomime. It's mechanically unpleasant, bereft of a single original idea, and hostile to its own players. There's literally one jumpscare tactic reused at a rate best described as pathological. It's got some damn nerve wanting to be seen as a worthy successor - it can't even rival the weakest of pretenders. Score distribution: - Positive: [320 out of - Negative: [131 out of 562](/game/playstation-5/the-callisto-protocol/user-reviews?dist=negative) - - Aug 2, 2023Great game. It deserves at least 8 out of 10, 6.9 is not fair for such a beautiful game. - - Dec 3, 2022This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. Great gate, really great graphics, hard difficuly, but nonetheless great game... Expand - Feb 1, 2023First of all The Callisto protocol is not as bad as people make it out to be. The game does a great job at immersing you in its environmentFirst of all The Callisto protocol is not as bad as people make it out to be. The game does a great job at immersing you in its environment with sounds and visuals coming together making eerie creepy vibe. The story is okay , but nothing game changing. Combat is good , the dodge mechanic is not as bad as nerds made it seem. Yes combat can be repetitive but upgrading your weapons makes it way more exciting. Biggest complaint with combat is that more than 1 enemies at a time is nearly impossible at some points. The game is a great linear ride with one objective , get out. People have been spoiled with great games lately like god of war , elden ring , TLOUP1 remake. This game is very straight to the point something games now don't really do. This could have came out on ps2 and seen as a great game. This game doesn't have to be a masterpiece to be fun and worth a play through. Story : 7/10 Gameplay and combat : 7 /10 Visuals :10/10 Music :10/10...

The weak point is due to melee combat, the dodging is very strange.... Expand - Jan 20, 2023After 3h of gameplay it looks still same. Combat is same and boring. + For graphics. - Dec 14, 2022i dont understand how the creators of Dead Space manage to take all the fun and exciting parts from the first two games and forget to includei dont understand how the creators of Dead Space manage to take all the fun and exciting parts from the first two games and forget to include them. This pale, uninteresting replica of dead space is lacks all the suspense, inventiveness, and fun of dead space. It is tedious to play, boring to look at, and the gameplay mechanics, puzzle solving and map design are all just rehashed garbage from other games. There is no map, so prepared to get lost often. There is no ammo, so prepare to die alot because you will be attacked by many enemies at once. 4. I played through dead space 1 three times and i can barely muster enough excitement to finish this game. don't even get me started on the boss fight. since your character is slow as a sloth and you can barely turn around, prepare to die alot. and yep you can't skip the death animations. Why? probably cause the game developers hate you.... Expand Trailers - - 2:03 - (0 views) - - - - 2:22 - (0 views) - - 2:36 - (0 views) - - - - 0:33 - (0 views) - - - 1:19 - (0 views) "}
