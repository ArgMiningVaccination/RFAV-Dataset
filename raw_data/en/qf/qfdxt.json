A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications. It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences. The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security objectives. Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk. This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation. The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national and homeland security. The Cyber Sciences project supported long-term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber security. Information technologies enabled important new military capabilities and drove the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Meanwhile, cyber threats grew in sophistication and number, and put sensitive data, classified computer programs, mission-critical information systems, and future economic gains at risk. The basic research conducted under the Cyber Sciences project produced breakthroughs necessary to enhance the resilience of DoD information systems to current and emerging cyber threats.

In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. The Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems. The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information-intensive subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, and manufacturing. The project integrates these diverse disciplines to improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations or threaten National Security. Specific research in this project will investigate technologies to enable detection of novel threat agents (e.g., bacterial pathogens) and maintain warfighter health and improve recovery. This project also includes efforts to create innovative materials of interest to the military (e.g., self-healing materials).

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: Human Social Systems Description: The social sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social systems and behaviors relevant to national security such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD. However, current limitations to the speed, scalability and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD. Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context. The Human Social Systems thrust will address these limitations by focusing on the following technical challenges: (1) developing and validating new methods, models and tools to perform rigorous, reproducible experimental research at scales necessary to understand emergent properties of human social systems; (2) identifying methods to better characterize and quantify properties, dynamics, and behaviors of different social systems to enable better and more confident forecasting of changes in social systems, particularly when under stress; (3) developing an understanding of the complex effect of context and incorporating these effects into social science models; and (4) developing strategic forecasting and operational decision aiding capabilities that account for local contextual and cultural factors to assess the likely effectiveness of and/or responses to actions within an Area of Operations. This research thrust will provide DoD with new, reliable strategies to better understand and respond to social system issues at multiple scales (from small group to cities and/or regions) and will significantly improve DoD stabilization, deterrence, and/or gray zone mission outcomes. FY 2020 Plans: - Develop and deploy highly complex social simulations with known causal ground truth as test bed challenges for social science research communities.29.100 27.000 26.000 Volume 1 - 4 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 42 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

The FY 2021 decrease reflects a shift from design and development to testing and evaluation. Title: Machine Common Sense (MCS) Description: The Machine Common Sense (MCS) program is exploring approaches to enable commonsense reasoning by machines. Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and strategy games such as Chess, Go and Poker. In all of these application domains, the machine reasoning is narrow and highly specialized, and the machine must be carefully trained or programmed for every situation. This program addresses the challenge of general machine reasoning on par with commonsense human cognition. MCS is developing computational models that mimic core systems of human cognitive development that are grounded in perceptual, motor, and memory modalities; a simulated interaction and learning environment to support machine manipulation15.500 16.815 21.810 Volume 1 - 5 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 42 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 of grounded concept models; and commonsense knowledge repositories to support AI system development. AI systems that are capable of more human-like reasoning will be able to behave more appropriately in unforeseen situations.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects continued development of machine common sense technologies and simulation environment, and expanded efforts to assess performance against a benchmark commonsense challenge problem suite. Title: Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) Description: The Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) program is developing techniques to defend against deception attacks on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. GARD addresses the need to defend against deception attacks, whereby an adversary inputs engineered data into an ML system intending to cause the system to produce erroneous results. Deception attacks can enable adversaries to take control of autonomous systems, alter conclusions of ML- based decision support applications, and compromise tools and systems that rely on ML and AI technologies. Current techniques for defending ML and AI have proven brittle due to a focus on individual attack methods and weak methods for testing and evaluation. Techniques developed under the GARD program will address the current limitations of defenses and produce ML and7.600 17.244 19.100 Volume 1 - 6 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 42 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 AI systems suitable for use in adversarial environments.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects continued development of robust ML techniques and an ML risk evaluation testbed, and expanded efforts to evaluate techniques for use against an AI-enabled adversary. Title: World Modelers Description: The World Modelers program is creating explanatory models for natural and human-mediated systems at regional and global scales. Because of macro-economic interdependence, disruption of natural resources, supply chains, and production systems can have widespread consequences. World Modelers capabilities are focused on regional and global systems with the goal of generating timely indications and warnings. Water and food security are application domains of particular interest, as persistent drought may cause crops to fail, leading to migration and regional conflicts. The World Modelers program aims to develop techniques for automating the creation, maintenance, and validation of large-scale integrated models using publicly available news and analyst reports as a structuring mechanism, and government and commercial data as quantitative inputs. FY 2020 Plans: - Develop models for acute, high-impact phenomena such as natural disasters that disrupt civilian infrastructure. - Extend the integrated workflow to operate on compressed temporal scales, and optimize the extended workflow on food security, migration, and acute, high-impact use cases.16.800 17.500 19.050 Volume 1 - 7 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 42 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects continued efforts to develop models for acute high-impact phenomena, and expanded efforts to evaluate techniques in collaboration with transition partners. Title: Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) Description: The Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) program is developing data-driven methods to accelerate scientific discovery and robust design in domains that lack complete models. Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics and integrated circuits. In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, and synthetic chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models. The SD2 program will collect raw experimental data into a data and analysis hub, develop computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge directly from experimental data, and create data sharing tools and metrics that facilitate collaborative design. SD2 application domains include synthetic biology, solar cell chemistry, and protein design, which will impact future DoD capabilities in areas such as chemical and biological defense, and warfighter readiness. FY 2020 Plans: - Apply discovery algorithms to novel systems that have not been characterized by human experts, and extend algorithms that foster scientific understanding to accelerate novel design. - Integrate discovery algorithms with design protocols to automate the experimental process. - Improve experimental planning tools to reduce the experimental costs required to obtain a functional design. - Scale software and infrastructure to process experimental data, and evaluate tools by testing their ability to adapt protein and cellular circuit designs for use in biosensors. FY 2021 Plans: - Test design and discovery tools in supporting a design-test-build cycle to rapidly produce biosensors and stable solar materials. - Demonstrate automated experimental loops that provide rapid improvement in experimental performance. - Develop models of underlying scientific principles for domains such as complex systems design, biosynthesis, computational social science and information operations.20.500 21.000 19.000 Volume 1 - 8 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 42 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

FY 2020 to reflects ramping down of development of computational techniques that extract scientific knowledge from data, and expanded efforts to demonstrate and test techniques on biosensor and protein design and solar material synthesis. Title: Learning with Less Labeling (LwLL) Description: The Learning with Less Labeling (LwLL) program is developing technology to greatly reduce the amount of labeled data required to train machine learning (ML) systems. In supervised ML, a system learns through the use of labeled training examples to recognize and categorize attributes of images, text, or speech. Humans provide these training-data examples to ML systems and with enough labeled data, it is generally possible to build useful models. Obtaining large amounts of labeled data can be costly. LwLL is addressing this problem by creating ML algorithms that learn and adapt more efficiently than current ML approaches, and by formally deriving the limits of machine learning and adaptation. LwLL aims to create ML systems that are easier to train and use in variable, unpredictable, real-world environments, especially where training data is costly or sparse. FY 2020 Plans: - Develop ML algorithms that are robust to distributional mismatch between the data on which the system is trained and the data on which the system operates post training. - Develop estimates for the rate at which an ML system will converge with increased training in terms of the hyperparameters of the system. - Construct challenge problems and associated labeled and unlabeled data sets, and demonstrate increased learning rates and distributional robustness of the new ML algorithms. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop approaches to label reduction via automated transfer learning that discovers similar problems and learns what is important for a given task. - Develop theoretical limits for transfer learning for problem classes and domains of interest to DoD. - Demonstrate the capability of new ML algorithms to learn with far fewer labels, and to generalize to multiple tasks and domains on datasets relevant to DoD.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 The FY 2021 increase reflects continued development of ML techniques that require less labeled data for effective training, and increased efforts to demonstrate techniques on datasets relevant to DoD. Title: Young Faculty Award (YFA) Description: The goal of the Young Faculty Award (YFA) program is to encourage junior faculty at universities and their equivalent at non-profit science and technology research institutions to participate in sponsored research programs that will augment capabilities for future defense systems. This program focuses on cutting-edge technologies for greatly enhancing microsystems technologies, biological technologies and defense sciences. The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and national security issues. The aim is for YFA recipients to receive deep interactions with DARPA program managers, programs, performers and the user community. Current activities include research in fifteen topic areas spanning from Machine Learning and Many Body Physics, to Wideband Transmitter-Antenna Interfaces and Multi-Scale Models of Infectious Disease Dynamics. A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs.

The ASIST program is developing proof-of-concept software agents that demonstrate a machine theory of mind and the capability to participate with humans in an effective team by representing and helping to maintain shared models. ASIST aims to provide the basis for machines that can participate effectively with humans on tasks where teamwork is required.- 13.000 18.330 Volume 1 - 16 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 17 of 42 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

Title: Application-Tailored Artificial Intelligence (APTAI) Description: The Application-Tailored Artificial Intelligence (APTAI) program will develop concepts for AI capabilities whose designs and learning processes are influenced both by training data and by key concepts and features proposed by experts in the intended application domains. In this third wave approach, learning processes will incorporate both human experience and patterns extracted from data to converge on informative features, representations, abstractions, and inductive strategies. One expected benefit of this approach is the emphasis on features that humans find salient, thus reducing the number of counterintuitive mistakes made by AI methods and minimizing the vulnerability to adversarial attacks, both in training data and in operations. Another expected benefit relates to human interaction, because the use of domain concepts provides a built-in framing for explanations to human partners. An additional expected benefit is the facilitation of more rapid learning processes including potentially transfer learning and one-shot learning. The APTAI program will make use of specific national security domains to drive assessment and transition of these initial concepts. Candidate domains include undersea autonomous navigation, imagery analysis, multi-modal reasoning, and games in support of strategy and planning.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 Title: Formal Methods at Scale (FMaS) Description: The Formal Methods at Scale (FMaS) program will create new mathematical methodologies, techniques, and tools for proving and providing evidence of correctness for software systems whose size and complexity renders their modeling and analysis infeasible with current techniques. Formal methods are techniques for reasoning about and proving various properties for software code or design models, generally focusing on logical relationships that connect specifications and models with executable code. A key to scalability is to focus more narrowly on particular quality or functional attributes, such as security and safety, rather than address all features and functions of the components of a software system. A second key to scalability is to provide for composability, which enables trustworthy components to be efficiently assembled into trustworthy systems. The FMaS program will accelerate this new scalable formal methods paradigm by extending formal methods techniques, tools, and practices along several dimensions, including (1) the range of properties and qualities that are modeled and reasoned about, such as relating to security, safety, performance, fault tolerance, and real-time, (2) the complexity and the size of systems and their supply chains, including issues related to composability, (3) efficiency of formal methods-related modeling, tooling, and engineering practices, including more natural integration into mainstream tooling and practices, (4) ability to rapidly co-evolve systems and associated evidence, for example to respond to rapid evolution of threats and associated mission concepts, and (5) ease of use for non-expert developers and evaluators. FMaS aims to create formal methods applicable to software systems of the size and complexity commonly encountered in military and civilian mission-critical systems, and to speed the adoption of these methods into practice and tooling. FY 2021 Plans: - Formulate approaches for extending formal methods with respect to the range of properties and qualities that are modeled and reasoned about, such as relating to security, safety, performance, fault tolerance, real-time. - Address issues related to composability in order to increase the size and complexity of systems and their supply chains amenable to formal methods, including both custom mission-specific components, commodity components, and open source components.- - 10.000 Volume 1 - 18 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 19 of 42 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

Title: Knowledge Management at Scale Description: The Knowledge Management at Scale thrust is focused on the development of knowledge management tools that can efficiently capture, analyze and reason with expertise, experience and data. The technology development under this thrust will help address a critical need for assimilating and preserving critical national security knowledge and expertise that is currently being lost due to attrition and other factors. Specific objectives include the following 1) effective, trustworthy and easily accepted approaches for domain agnostic knowledge acquisition at scale; 2) capabilities to identify correlations or hidden factors relating to knowledge acquired from different sources; and 3) techniques for incorporating domain models and other data sources for more extensive reasoning-based applications. Example approaches towards achieving these objectives include identifying and demonstrating robust knowledge acquisition tools, exploiting AI techniques to establish a framework for knowledge analysis and causal reasoning, and developing automation tools that effectively elicit and impart acquired knowledge via user friendly interfaces. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop automated methods to identify and capture, fuse, and apply tacit organizational knowledge implicit in processes and actions of people acting on data. - Design and evaluate comfortable, trusted, and enticing software tools to be used by groups of non-technical people to capture, resolve, and apply effectively and timely different and overlapping aspects of their shared experiences.

The current manual adaptation paradigm is based on corrective patching, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. Predicting the myriad of possible environment changes that an application may encounter in its lifetime is problematic, and existing reactive approaches are brittle and often incorrect. Effective adaptation is realized through rigorously defined specifications that capture application resource assumptions and resource guarantees made by the environment.13.770 4.000 - Volume 1 - 19 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 20 of 42 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 The use of specification-based adaptation will allow BRASS applications to be correctly restructured in real time whenever stated assumptions or guarantees are broken.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: Transparent Computing Description: The Transparent Computing program developed technologies that enabled the implementation of more effective security policies across distributed systems. The scale and complexity of modern information systems obscured the linkages between security-related events, making it hard to discover attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). Transparent Computing technologies are particularly important for large integrated systems with diverse components such as distributed surveillance systems, autonomous systems, and enterprise information systems. The Transparent Computing program created the capability to propagate security-relevant information, track complete knowledge of event provenance, and ensured component interactions were consistent with established behavior profiles and policies.9.346 - - Title: Space/Time Analysis Space/Time (STAC) program developed techniques to detect algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities and side channel attacks in software. Historically, adversaries have exploited software implementation flaws through buffer and heap overflow attacks. Advances in operating systems have largely mitigated such attacks in modern systems, so cyber adversaries are now finding new ways of compromising software. Algorithmic complexity and side channel attacks are emerging as a new generation of attacks since they depend on intrinsic properties of software algorithms rather than implementation flaws. The STAC program developed analysis tools and techniques to detect vulnerabilities to these new attacks in the software on which the U.S. government, military, and economy depend.3.600 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 12.946 - - C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 Magnetic Miniaturized and Monolithically Integrated Components (M3IC) program aims to integrate magnetic components onto semiconductor materials, improving the size and functionality of electromagnetic (EM) systems for communications, radar, and electronic warfare (EW). Current EM systems use magnetic components such as circulators, inductors, and isolators that are bulky and cannot be integrated with electronic circuitry. This limits the utility of the magnetic components as well as their ability to impact overall system performance and function. Reducing the size, weight, and power of magnetic components and integrating them onto semiconductor chips, however, could provide new mechanisms for the control and manipulation of EM signals as well as enable broader exploitation of magnetic materials. For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems.

Title: A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) Description: The A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) program seeks to develop efficient radio frequency (RF) transmitters operating in the Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) ranges, for portable applications in underground and underwater communications. For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal. This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which are up to a mile wide. Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF. This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably greater than 1,000x reduction in antenna size. AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system. This new capability would enable a range of applications including wireless communications for use over very long distances and short-range underground and underwater RF links. Other potential applications include terrestrial navigation systems for GPS-denied environments and ground-penetrating radar for detecting unexploded ordnance, underground facilities, and tunnels. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate and deliver scaled VLF and ULF transmitters capable of transmitting signals that meet the program specifications for magnetic field, power consumption, and maximum linear dimension. - Further improve the efficiency of mechanical modulation techniques.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: Beyond Scaling - Materials Description: The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will investigate new materials to support next-generation logic and memory components. Historically, the DoD provided leadership in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors. However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and as commercial technology reaches an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling), there is risk that future DoD needs will not be met. The Beyond Scaling - Materials program will pursue potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels. These basic explorations include, novel mechanisms for computation based on inherent material properties, new methods to accelerate the identification and utilization of emerging materials, and innovative processes to vertically integrate these materials with others to realize superior computational mechanisms.

Currently, improvements in electronics largely depend on a regular reduction in the size of silicon components. As Moore's Law slows and the nation loses the benefit of free, exponential improvements in electronics performance, DoD will need to maximize the benefits of available silicon technologies through circuit specialization. This program will investigate the potential for lowering the barriers to designing specialized circuits and to incorporating privacy and security protections. Approaches include the use of machine learning and automated design tools to program specialized hardware blocks, integrate them into existing designs, and deploy them in complex systems. The program will also explore architecture options for physically protecting sensitive information. Advances under this program will support a new DoD capability to create secure and specialized hardware that does not depend on continued improvements in silicon transistors.

To overcome this limitation, L2M will pursue learning approaches inspired by biological systems, which continuously learn and improve their skills without losing previous knowledge. L2M will explore network structures that improve performance by processing new data seen in the field, learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks, and incorporate context into their understanding of the environment.

Title: Biology for Security (BIOSEC) Description: Based on initial research conducted under the Biological Robustness in Complex Settings (BRICS) program, the Biology for Security (BIOSEC) program seeks to investigate novel approaches to address the DoD need for rapid detection of unknown and/or emerging biological threats from state actors or violent extremist organizations (VEOs). This program will investigate approaches for identifying pathogens based on specific behaviors, or phenotypes, such as niche finding or cell toxicity. Unlike current methods, which rely on a priori knowledge of the pathogen and cannot detect or otherwise analyze unknown threats, this approach will handle scenarios involving engineered or undiscovered bacterial pathogens that do not have known hallmarks. Advances in this area will produce a completely new capability to assess the emergence of pathogens and to detect pathogens that have been specifically engineered to evade detection by traditional methods. Resulting systems may be used to alert deployed military personnel operating around the world to new biothreats, or in response to a U.S.-based discovery, outbreak, or pandemic. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate unbiased high-throughput isolation of microbes from complex samples. - Develop strategies for the maintenance and growth of all bacterial types from complex environmental samples. - Demonstrate effective processes for phenotyping small numbers of bacteria for the three principal classes of pathogenic traits: niche finding, attacking a membrane, and self-defense. - Implement data fusion and remedial algorithms for machine learning and modeling of pathogenicity. - Demonstrate isolation and bioinformatics protocols on complex samples that show the potential for integration into a unified platform. FY 2021 Plans: - Demonstrate continued platform integration (e.g., combined bacterial processing for isolation, integration, and data collection). - Demonstrate isolation and interrogation platforms on increasingly complex samples that simulate complex environments. - Demonstrate the ability to combine bacterial phenotypes and single-cell omics to support pathogenic trait mapping. - Demonstrate increased algorithmic performance on predicting pathogenicity of unknown bacteria.

Accomplishments/Planned 2020 FY 2021 Description: The Native Bioelectronic Interfaces effort will address the DoD need for improving warfighter recovery from injury by developing technologies that can accelerate the restoration and repair of complex tissues. This program will develop approaches that combine high-resolution biosensors to track the healing process in real-time with bioactuators to stimulate restoration where and when needed. The primary challenge to achieving this is the lack of a closed-loop interface that can manipulate highly complex signaling pathways in wounds and the developmental interdependencies that scale from cell to tissue. The program will develop new methods to convert dense multi-modal information into the body's native repair processes, and will leverage artificial intelligence to guide the delivery of the signals necessary for healing. Advances from this program will produce bioactuators that can release diverse stimuli with high spatial and temporal resolution, and biosensors that provide the requisite in situ measurement to guide the healing process. FY 2020 Plans: - Identify effective stimuli for directing growth, development, and repair. - Identify critical physiological changes and biomarkers that can report on cell growth and differentiation. - Develop first set of algorithms that can deliver preliminary intervention strategies.

Title: Analysis and Adaptation of Human Resilience Description: The Analysis and Adaptation of Human Resilience program explored new methods to maintain and optimize warfighter health in response to environmental insults such as new and emerging infectious diseases. Research efforts in this area applied recent advances in comparative biology, genetic sequencing, omics technologies, and bioinformatics to develop new tools for modulating health to ensure warfighter readiness. One approach to achieve the program's goal was to identify the fundamental mechanisms that enable certain species to be tolerant to various environmental insults. Genomic and physiological analyses of a wide array of resilient animal species were combined with sophisticated algorithms to identify important patterns of survival. By analyzing patterns in the underlying variability of host responses for resilient animals, a survival blueprint is being developed to restore and maintain warfighter homeostasis in response to infection. This approach was orthogonal to traditional infectious disease research, which primarily relies on reducing the pathogen load through drug intervention. Research efforts within this program may enable discovery of novel methods to optimize human health against infectious diseases caused by multi- drug resistant pathogens.5.939 - Blast Injuries FY 2019 Accomplishments: Conduct research in TBI treatment for blast injuries.5.000 - Congressional Adds Subtotals 5.000 - D.

Title: Deployable Medical Countermeasures for Warfighter Readiness Description: Maintaining robust protection and treatment against infectious disease threats during stabilization operations (e.g., Humanitarian and Disaster Relief [HADR]) can cause a drug discovery, manufacturing and supply chain burden. A major limitation of our current response to emerging biological and chemical threats is the lack of immediate availability of ideal medical countermeasures (MCM) for rapid response. The Deployable Medical Countermeasures for Warfighter Readiness program aims to develop an on-demand deployable platform to manufacture nucleic acid drugs at scale, in short timeframes. The platform will be comprised of a fully contained system capable of selectively manufacturing relevant doses of current Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) grade nucleic acid therapeutics at or near the point of care. This on-demand platform will enable countermeasures capable of combating novel threats, allowing a small force to prevent regional outbreaks from becoming global emergencies.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Neuro-Adaptive Technology Description: The Neuro-Adaptive Technology program explored and developed advanced technologies for real-time detection and monitoring of neural activity. One shortcoming of today's brain functional mapping technologies was the inability to obtain real- time correlation data that links neural function to human activity and behavior. Understanding the structure-function relationship as well as the underlying mechanisms that link brain and behavior is a critical step in providing real-time, closed-loop therapies for military personnel suffering from a variety of brain disorders. Efforts under this program examined the networks of neurons involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and anxiety as well as determined how to best ameliorate these disorders. The objective for this program was to develop new hardware and modeling tools to better discriminate the relationship between human behavioral expression and neural function and to provide relief through novel devices. These tools allowed for an improved understanding of how the brain regulates behavior and enabled new, disorder- specific, dynamic neuro-therapies for treating neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in military personnel. Technologies developed under this program include devices for real-time detection of brain activity during operational tasks, time synchronized acquisition of brain activity and behavior, and statistical models that correlate neural activity with human behavioral expression.6.078 - - Title: Enhanced Monitoring of Health and Disease Description: The Enhanced Monitoring of Health and Disease program has improved military health and force readiness by leveraging advanced data collection methods and prognostic capabilities to predict changes in health and spread of infectious disease from the individual to the population scale.

Advances in these areas will allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations. Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, will support new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY The RF Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS) program is addressing the performance limitations of conventional radio frequency (RF) systems such as radar, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and communications. The performance of future RF systems in the DoD will be defined by their ability to adapt and respond to their environment in real-time. We currently lack both the algorithms and computational power to manage the volume of data and complexity of decision-making that will be required.

Title: Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) Description: The Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2) program catalyzed the development of systems, called Collaborative Intelligent Radios (CIRs) that intelligently share and optimize wireless spectrum usage without prior knowledge of each other's operating characteristics. SC2 addressed the increasing demand for and reliance on unfettered wireless access. Today, assured access to the wireless spectrum involves restricting particular types of radios and radio operators to certain sets of fixed, pre- determined frequencies. Although this spectrum allocation approach helps ensure different radio signals do not interfere with each other, it is inherently inefficient and vulnerable to attack. First, allocated portions of the spectrum can remain unused or underutilized. Second, adversaries can easily characterize static spectrum allocations, identifying which ones to exploit or attack. SC2 addressed these challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimize use of the spectrum in real-time. In particular, SC2 participants were challenged to develop techniques that allow collaboration among dissimilar communications technologies. SC2 conducted two preliminary competitions and one championship event over three years. The resulting technology will define a new class of radio systems that efficiently thrive in the absence of pre-planned spectrum.25.184 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 46.513 16.277 6.576 C.

Title: Dispersed Computing Description: The Dispersed Computing program is developing techniques to distribute computing tasks across network computing elements to enable more efficient utilization of enterprise and Internet-based storage, processing, and networking resources. At present, enterprises and Internet-based information technology service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers. This brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing. The Dispersed Computing program is developing a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources. A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements. These dual-purposed network-compute elements make it possible to eliminate bottlenecks/chokepoints and to mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data, given network conditions and available network-compute elements. With Dispersed Computing technology, the network becomes the cloud, and computation is performed where it is most efficient to do so. FY 2020 Plans: - Develop automated mechanisms for redistributing workloads across dispersed network computation elements to achieve reliable and near-optimal performance even in the presence of dynamic failures and impairments. - Extend the user interface to provide operators with fine-grained visibility into the workloads being handled by the dispersed network computation elements on applications of interest. - Evaluate integrated prototype network-compute elements and demonstrate prototypes to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and commercial network providers. FY 2021 Plans: - Increase the operational scale of integrated network-compute elements to thousands of nodes while automatically redistributing workloads. - Optimize and evaluate integrated capabilities over networks with thousands of network-compute elements in terms of the reduction of network bandwidth consumed and the increase in computational utilization.18.000 16.300 10.200 Volume 1 - 67 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 12 of 34 R-1 Line #14Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYProject (Number/Name) IT-03 / CYBER SECURITY B.

Title: Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) Description: The Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program is developing the design, analysis and verification tools needed to allow systems engineers to design-in cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do other quality attributes when designing complex embedded computing systems. The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering. The CASE technical approach formulates cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering. CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber-physical systems. CASE technologies will enable the design of cyber-physical systems that robustly execute their intended function despite the efforts of sophisticated cyber adversaries. FY 2020 Plans: - Enhance cyber resilience design tools based on the results of cyber resilience challenge problems. - Apply design tools and techniques to exemplar cyber-physical systems including a military helicopter. - Integrate cyber resilience design tools into the engineering workflow of a defense system provider. - Use integrated design tools to re-engineer a portion of a defense platform to improve cyber resiliency in coordination with potential transition partners and other stakeholders.

Title: Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems (RADICS) Description: The Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems (RADICS) program is developing automated systems to enable a black start recovery of the U.S. power grid amidst a cyber attack on the energy sector's critical infrastructure. RADICS aims to enable skilled cyber and power engineers to rapidly restore electrical service after an attack that challenges the recovery capabilities of the impacted organizations (e.g., utilities, balancing authorities, independent system operators, bulk power markets). The potential for a cyber-enabled attack on the U.S. power grid is a national security issue, as the ability of the military to deploy and project force is dependent on the effective and efficient functioning of civilian logistics and supply systems. RADICS will develop technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, isolate compromised system elements, establish secure emergency communications networks, characterize attacks, and detect sensor spoofing.

Title: Intent-Defined Adaptive Software (IDAS) Description: The Intent-Defined Adaptive Software (IDAS) program, addressing issues encountered in the Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program, budgeted within this PE and Project, will develop technologies to represent the intent of software and its abstract constraints separately from its concrete instantiation, for the purpose of enabling rapid code synthesis and continual adaptation. Modern weapons platforms are increasingly dependent on complex software, increasing the risk of system failures and creating new attack surfaces for adversaries. Software engineers often manage complexity by choosing a particular option that fulfills the immediate needs of the development effort, e.g., by concretization. IDAS will develop techniques for deferring software concretizations until uncertainties are resolved, either at build time or during run time, for complex systems. IDAS technology aims to significantly reduce software development time and maintenance costs, thereby enabling DoD to acquire, sustain, and improve software-based capabilities more cost-effectively.

AMP will create the capability to analyze, modify, and fix legacy software in binary form even when the original source code and/or build process is not fully available. The AMP technical approach involves automatic discovery of known vulnerable components, goal-driven decompilation to isolate and analyze the vulnerable binary components, and minimal-change patching and recompilation to rebuild affected binaries with strong guarantees that the patch will not impair the functions of the system. The technologies developed by AMP aim to enable cyber defenders to quickly and accurately patch legacy binaries in the deployed software systems upon which our military depends. FY 2020 Plans: - Devise approaches for decompiling binary programs that can meet objectives such as alignment with available source code or fitness for a specified task. - Formulate strategies for producing a binary patch that is minimal with respect to the original binary when recompiled, with strong guarantees that the patch will not impair the functions of the system. - Design challenge tests for evaluating binary micropatching capabilities including challenges involving heavy vehicle firmware and other embedded and military systems.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but as trusted partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human speech and extract information contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act. The technologies developed in the Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; software developers and certifiers to design, implement, evaluate, and accredit cyber-physical systems with greater efficiency and confidence; and unmanned systems and semi-autonomous agents to perform critical missions in contested physical and virtual environments safely and reliably.

The current generation of DoD systems and platforms integrate cyber and physical subsystems. The capability of the engineering teams has not scaled with the enormous complexity of modern CPS. Engineering organizations require large teams of engineers that collectively possess the necessary domain knowledge (of component technologies, theories, and tools), but the prolonged timelines of the development process for modern CPS hinders DoD's ability to counter emerging threats. The Symbiotic Design program will address this challenge by transforming the human-focused, model-based design flows used today into a symbiotic process of collaborative discovery by humans and continuously-learning AI-based co-designers. The program will create technologies essential for AI co-design, notably design space construction, design composition, and design space exploration. The program will demonstrate the approach at realistic scales by a sequence of CPS design challenges of increasing complexity, and quantify the results with respect to development time, system performance, and innovation metrics.

Title: Assured Autonomy Description: The Assured Autonomy program is developing rigorous design and analysis technologies for continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems to guarantee safety properties in uncertain environments. Currently, the state of the art for test, evaluation, verification, and validation is only applicable to non-learning systems operating in well-characterized environments. As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance. Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems. The technologies being developed in Assured Autonomy will enable the DoD to more rapidly and efficiently deploy learning-enabled autonomous systems that can be trusted to operate safely in uncertain environments.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 decrease reflects a shift from development efforts to technologies being demonstrated on several learning-enabled autonomous platforms. Title: Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) Description: The Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) program is developing a multi-hypothesis semantic engine that generates alternative interpretations of events, situations, and trends from a variety of unstructured sources where there are noisy, conflicting, and potentially deceptive data. At present, information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media, resulting in insufficient interpretations because alternatives are eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence. AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from diverse media into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends. AIDA aims to provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly. FY 2020 Plans: - Enhance multimedia analytics through use of feedback from generated hypotheses. - Develop techniques to limit the over-generation of hypotheses by automatically discarding irrelevant or duplicated hypotheses.19.780 25.000 18.600 Volume 1 - 82 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 27 of 34 R-1 Line #14Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS B.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 decrease reflects ramping down of development of techniques for generating multiple alternative interpretations from multimedia data, and continued evaluations of techniques on synthetic and real-world data. Title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Description: The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program is developing a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future. AI is a critical enabler for U.S. military systems that will perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust. Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, not meaningful to a human user, or inconsistent with the full range of behaviors of the AI system. XAI will develop the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, in particular (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models that are meaningful to end-users. XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation data analytics and autonomous systems. FY 2020 Plans: - Refine the cognitive model of explanation, and show increased effectiveness of explanations generated by the systems. - Optimize explainable machine learning techniques and user interfaces for integration into prototype systems. - Expand the set of test problems in data analytics and autonomy for evaluating performance, explanation accuracy, and effectiveness of the systems.20.830 26.050 17.380 Volume 1 - 83 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 28 of 34 R-1 Line #14Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS B.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The reflects ramping down of development of explainable machine learning techniques, continued integration of techniques in machine learning systems, and expanded testing on problems in data analytics and autonomous systems. Title: Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AAI) Description: The Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AAI) program seeks to go beyond commercially-driven advances in AI and address important national security challenge applications. In particular, this program is focused on improving human-AI collaborations to mitigate current bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities. If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly accelerate the pace of innovation in many important DoD domains while also reducing the time and cost associated with approval and certification processes needed to transition and deploy new technologies. One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current developmental, approval, and certification processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to greater automation with minimal human intervention. Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems, particularly in novel and/or unanticipated situations. Approaches to addressing these challenges will leverage recent advances at the frontiers of AI research in transfer learning, causal reasoning and associated models. AAI application areas include the following: (1) machine-enabled techniques to efficiently capture, generate, and analyze disparate data sources to accelerate design and development of new materials and chemistries for DoD specific applications; (2) knowledge management tools that can efficiently capture, analyze and reason with expertise, experience, and data to prevent loss and increase value of critical national security knowledge/expertise; and (3) social context informed AI approaches to enable reliable and robust forecasting and decision aiding tools for stabilization, deterrence and gray zone operations. FY 2020 Plans: - Identify technical and programmatic criteria for military applications for testing and evaluating novelty-aware AI technologies. - Establish evaluation criteria and effective performance goals for novelty aware AI technologies in real military AI applications. - Identify data sources for development and training of AI systems for machine assisted human interviews and vetting processes.- 24.100 29.400 Volume 1 - 84 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 29 of 34 R-1 Line #14Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS B.

Title: Automated Rapid Certification Of Software (ARCOS)* Description: *Formerly Automated Knowledge Acquisition (AKA) The Automated Rapid Certification of Software (ARCOS) program is developing technologies that automate the evaluation of software assurance evidence to enable certifiers to determine earlier in the process that system risks are acceptable. Current software certification practices do not scale with the amount of software being deployed by the DoD, so certification is becoming a bottleneck to new system deployment. ARCOS technologies will address DoD software system certification time and cost. ARCOS technology will automatically generate strong assurance arguments that incorporate supporting evidence for certification criteria. ARCOS will also develop techniques to compose assurance arguments for pre-evaluated components into consolidated assurance arguments for new systems incorporating those components. FY 2020 Plans: - Design languages and tools for generating assurance case arguments suitable for integration in software development environments. - Develop techniques for extracting a model or specification of legacy software, and for analyzing the legacy assurance evidence. - Develop techniques for integrating diverse assurance evidence within a single structured representation. - Architect approaches for automatically generating and validating assurance case arguments and calculating their confidence level. FY 2021 Plans: - Extend assurance-case engineering tools to facilitate the design and implementation of software and associated assurance evidence. - Develop approaches to analyze legacy software assurance evidence and specifications to determine areas of insufficient assurance. - Scale data structure representations to accommodate assurance evidence from complex military platforms. - Demonstrate and validate automatically-generated assurance case arguments. FY 2020 to The FY 2021 increase reflects ramping up of development of assurance case engineering tools, and demonstration of techniques on evidence from representative military platforms.- 24.100 27.000 Volume 1 - 86 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 31 of 34 R-1 Line #14Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS B. in 2020 FY 2021 Description: The Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence (AI) Reasoning over Schemas (KAIROS) program is developing AI and machine learning technologies to aid a human operator in understanding complex sequences of events in the world. For the purposes of KAIROS, an event is an occurrence that results in an observable and recognizable change in either the physical world or human society. Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security. The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that use existing event-representation schemas and, when needed, create new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators. Given multi-media inputs, operators will use KAIROS technologies to identify subsidiary event elements, determine their temporal order, recognize complex event sequences, and link disparate events. KAIROS technologies aim to enable analysts and warfighters to understand unfolding events rapidly and accurately. FY 2020 Plans: - Develop and apply AI techniques for automated learning of new schemas for simple and complex events from open source data. - Develop temporal schemas to recognize patterns in complex event sequences. - Develop techniques for quantifying the degree to which a temporal schema models a complex sequence of event elements, and for quantifying the degree of confidence in those models. - Explore approaches for using partial matches to temporal schemas to interpolate or predict missing or future event elements. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop and assess the capability for machine learning of complex schemas from large multimedia data sets. - Develop and evaluate the capability for matching unfiltered simple events from unconstrained large data sets to an initial schema library. - Develop and assess machine learning classifiers for categorizing the temporal and causal relationship between two simple events that are part of a complex event sequence. - In collaboration with potential transition partners, establish thresholds for mission utility for anticipating future events that are part of partially-observed complex events in operational data. FY 2020 to Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects ramping up of development of techniques for learning complex schemas, and initiation of assessment of techniques on operational data. Title: Stylized Language Processing (SLP) Description: The Stylized Language Processing (SLP) program will develop automated language processing techniques for sources that exhibit high degrees of domain-specific specialization.

($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 information contained in the text and speech humans use for their everyday communications. Highly stylized language, for which standard NLP is dubitable, has been encountered in new language genres such as the language intrinsic to social media, for which style may be so heavy as to resemble a code. Importantly, stylized language in a constrained form is also characteristic of technical, legal, scientific, and other more formal sources encountered in specialized domains. Finally, the challenges that arise from language manifestations as influenced by culture, emotion, and media choice provide further motivation for language processing capabilities that exploit features of style. These cases challenge standard NLP but also offer opportunities for greater accuracy. The SLP program will develop language processing technologies for stylized language as it is used in specialized domains, new communication and social media, and by diverse cultures and populations. The techniques developed under the SLP program will be coordinated with DoD operators and applied to military application areas such as the engineering development of complex systems and intelligence analysis of foreign language information in cultural context. FY 2021 Plans: - Formulate automated techniques to process, translate, capture, transform, and utilize the information contained in technical, legal, scientific, and/or other stylized sources encountered in specialized domains. - Formulate automated techniques for understanding language manifestations as influenced by culture, emotion, and media choice. - Formulate initial applications of stylized language processing technologies to military application areas such as the engineering development of complex systems and intelligence analysis of foreign language information in cultural context. FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) Description: The Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) program will create technologies and tools to support the development of viable and trusted system that include AI and machine learning (ML) capabilities. Modern AI- dependent systems may include multiple AI components, drawing on a diverse set of AI-related techniques, ranging from machine learning (ML) to knowledge representation, search, planning, game theory, and optimization. Current methods for development of such systems remains primarily based on trial-and-error designs, with limited abstractions, architectures, and patterns. These developments can be costly, risky, and demanding of very high levels of expertise. To address this, EAISI researchers will develop abstractions, patterns, architectures, assurance techniques, and iterative processes that facilitate the analysis and synthesis of complex systems that must rely on AI-based components and associated training data. One of the more difficult engineering challenges with AI is evaluation and assurance, since AI-based systems tend to resist traditional approaches to testing, inspection, and analysis. It is not possible to fully test an AI-based system for every situation it will ever encounter, so new techniques are needed for verifying and validating AI-based systems. EAISI aims to create software and systems engineering- - 17.200 Volume 1 - 88 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 33 of 34 R-1 Line #14Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 2R-1 Program INFORMATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN-MACHINE SYMBIOSIS B.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 increase reflects program Title: Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) Description: The Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program is developing technology to rapidly field machine translation and other language processing capabilities for low-resource foreign languages. The U.S. military operates globally, and frequently encounters low-resource languages, which are languages for which few linguists are available and automated human language technologies do not exist. Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets. As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand. LORELEI takes a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources. These are targeted capabilities that will be exercised to rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from any language in support of emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response. FY 2020 Plans: - Implement final improvements, and demonstrate capabilities on languages of interest to potential transition sponsors. - Integrate the situational awareness platform into the work space of transition partners, and support field tests.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Tactical Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems. The Tactical Technology Program Element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Aeronautics Technology and Information Analytics Technology. The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements. Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities to include the entire sea column such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, vessels for estuary and riverine operations, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, methods and techniques for servicing assets throughout the sea column, and high bandwidth communications. The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations. Programs seek to break the relative symmetry of land combat to give U.S. forces a decided advantage in the current and future ground battlefield. The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations. Programs seek to break the relative symmetry of land combat to give U.S. forces a decided advantage in the current and future ground battlefield. The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality. This project will develop methods and technologies to expand the maneuver trade space to include the vertical dimension, including subterranean environments, and will leverage advances in artificial intelligence to enable integrated manned-unmanned operations and decrease warfighter exposure through the use of autonomous agents. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) Description: The Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) program is developing and demonstrating new autonomous agents and techniques that can rapidly discriminate hostile intent and filter out threats during missions ranging from minutes to hours, leveraging natural or created stimuli to elicit behavioral responses among humans in an area. The program seeks to create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms operating in conjunction with U.S. ground forces that monitor an area overtly to detect hostile forces and establish Positive Identification (PID) before any U.S. troops come into contact. Military units follow strict rules of engagement (ROEs) that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior. This program will establish a Legal, Moral, Ethical (LME) working group comprising multiple individuals (technologists, military, university professors, ethicists, legal experts) to develop an understanding of how escalation of force can and should be appropriately applied in the context of supervised autonomous systems. URSA is exploring scenarios and probing behaviors that will enable identifying innocent civilians and individuals with hostile intent. This mission requires the integration and maturation of novel sensors, and unmanned ground and air vehicles which leverage current techniques in perspective and reactive autonomy to navigate cluttered urban environments. URSA is developing new search and probing behaviors to expose human intent and serve as evidence that a potential target is a threat. It is implementing new dimensions of evidence such as the human reactions to these probing actions to improve confidence in its decisions, and building a novel framework for escalating nonlethal force. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate initial URSA system capabilities in limited, controlled, performer-selected environments. - Continue to develop URSA system architectures.19.800 23.000 19.000 Volume 1 - 100 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 24 R-1 Line #18Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / TACTICAL (Number/Name) TT-04 / ADVANCED LAND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY B.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The 10.000 8.601 Title: Rapunzel Description: Urban combat demands that riflemen also serve as combat engineers manipulating their local environment to gain tactical advantage. The urban environment creates unique challenges in providing solutions for mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and concealment. Every pound that a warfighter wears or carries reduces their mobility and mission effectiveness, and, particularly in urban combat, reduced mobility paradoxically reduces their survivability. The Rapunzel program seeks to enable warfighters to manipulate the urban environment through the application of novel materials research. Rapunzel envisions soldier-borne or vehicle-borne utility-belt style packaged containers, reels, and spools of material that can perform urban engineering tasks such as create bridges between building rooftops, pull down enemy barriers, or provide false targets- 4.000 4.482 Volume 1 - 102 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 24 R-1 Line #18Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / TACTICAL (Number/Name) TT-04 / ADVANCED LAND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 and concealment. The program will identify those mass-manufactured materials, such as extremely high-tensile strength monofilament that can both provide novel mobility between buildings but also provide novel counter-mobility to enemy vehicles due to their electrical conductance properties. The Rapunzel program will leverage extensive existing research into early developmental materials and invest in the task-based development and packing to provide these materials at appropriate length and size scales for immediate tactical use. FY 2020 Plans: - Conduct trade space analysis and technical assessments regarding novel materials that are quickly field assembled and fabricated into lightweight components. - Initiate development of mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and concealment core requirements and systems architectures. - Initiate development of critical systems engineering approaches and perform baseline demonstrations derived from primitives of existing technologies that can be leveraged to refine program metrics. - Develop operational and technical performance models.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects completion of trade space analysis and shift to the lab environment materials tests. Title: Proportional Weapons Description: The Proportional Weapons program will create a real-time capability to analyze and apply proportional effects for families of weapons that suppress or breach any external structure to neutralize threats, clear spaces at range, keep them intact, and minimize collateral damage. Novel approaches are needed that are absolutely effective from the air or ground against several scales of primarily urban, concealed threats while not being catastrophically destructive. Current approaches to identifying, engaging, and assessing effects against evasive ground targets in complex terrain requires significant human oversight combined with human semantic reasoning tied to rules of execution, resulting in slow and methodical engagements. Proportional weapons will develop next generation effects for ground systems that provides extended range and tunable effects with greatly minimized impact to a warfighter operator. Proposed technical approaches will be scalable for application to dismounted warfighters, vehicle-borne (air and ground) systems, or as human-in-the-loop for future autonomous platforms.

Sustained Combat Operations in Undefined Terrain (SCOUT)* Description: *Formerly Highly Networked Dissemination of Relevant Data (3HNDRED) The Sustained Combat Operations in Undefined Terrain (SCOUT) program will explore an integrated system to aid ground troops in understanding and shaping the battlefield environment before, during, and after tactical operations. SCOUT will develop ground robotic platforms with enhanced, all-terrain mobility, extended endurance, and novel movement techniques to increase platform survivability and reduce detection. This capability will enable long-duration pre-mission reconnaissance, extending the timeline of current human scouts by 5-10x, and will support continuous patrolling or tactical resupply during sustainment operations. SCOUT is envisioned to host mission payloads that will integrate with other heterogeneous sensors, such as soldier-borne, vehicle-borne, weapon status indicators, and manned or unmanned ground/air assets, to form a complete picture of an area of interest. This will enable new, networked capabilities at the tactical level, such as automatic generation of reports populated with event, location, and status of forces, both manned and unmanned, to support response. SCOUT developed systems will provide mobility and extended endurance to enable increased payload access and information to pro-actively stage forces, enable on- demand resupply, or rapidly call for fires in support of timely operations. The confluence of mobility, endurance, and survivability developed under the SCOUT program will push the state of the art in unmanned ground systems and support on-the-fly battlefield management, providing an asymmetric advantage to U.S. forces.

Title: Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) Description: The Data-Driven Discovery of Models (D3M) program is developing automated model discovery techniques and tools that enable non-expert users to create empirical models of real, complex processes and phenomena. The ability to understand the battlespace is driven increasingly by analysis of sensor and open source data. The DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC) are fundamentally limited by a shortage of expert data scientists to construct empirical models that predict behaviors and anticipate contingencies during tactical and strategic planning. D3M is addressing this need by creating technologies that automate the construction of complex empirical models. D3M technologies include a library of data modeling primitives that are automatically selectable; automated approaches for composition of complex models from modeling primitives; and intuitive mechanisms for human-model interaction that enable curation of models by non-experts. D3M is focused on the types of empirical modeling problems commonly encountered by the DoD and IC.

Title: Causal Exploration of Complex Operational Environments Description: The Causal Exploration of Complex Operational Environments program is developing advanced modeling, analysis, simulation, and visualization tools to enable command staffs to rapidly and effectively design, plan, and manage missions in complex operational environments. The U.S. military increasingly operates in remote and unstable parts of the world where mission success depends heavily on cooperation with a wide variety of stakeholder groups on civil, economic, and military matters. These groups typically include host nation government organizations, local civilian groups, and non-governmental organizations, each of which has priorities, sensitivities, and concerns that may differ significantly. Current mission design and planning technologies do not adequately model the range of options or the inherent uncertainties. This program will develop tools to create causal, computational models that represent the most significant relationships, dynamics, interactions, and uncertainties of the operational environment including political, military, economic, and social factors. These tools will enable command staffs to design and quantitatively assess potential courses of action in complex operational environments.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Description: The Semantic Forensics (SemaFor) program, building on technologies introduced in MediFor, will develop technologies to defend against the falsification of multimedia and disinformation campaigns. Statistical detection techniques have been successful, but media generation and manipulation technology is advancing rapidly, and purely statistical detection methods are now insufficient. Existing media generation and manipulation algorithms are data driven and are prone to making semantic errors that provide defenders an opportunity for asymmetric advantage. SemaFor will create semantic and statistical analysis algorithms that determine if media is generated or manipulated; attribution algorithms that infer if media originates from a particular organization or individual; and characterization algorithms that reason about whether media was generated or manipulated for malicious purposes. SemaFor aims to create technologies to identify, deter, and understand adversary disinformation campaigns. FY 2020 Plans: - Devise initial algorithms that reason about semantic inconsistencies in multi-modal media assets to detect if they have been manipulated, if their purported sources are correct, or if the manipulation would have a negative real world impact. - Create baseline approaches for fusing multi-source semantic and statistical information into summary indicators for detection, attribution, and characterization of impact. - Formulate an architecture for a semantic media analysis system to support demonstration and evaluation. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop general semantic characterization algorithms that reason about whether a media asset or narrative is synthetic. - Develop mechanisms for explaining algorithmically-generated semantic inferences, and apply semantic analysis techniques to multimedia. - Develop a system prototype and evaluate performance on existing and purpose-built text, image, video, and audio libraries. - Develop challenge problems that emphasize threat scenarios in collaboration with DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) partners.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronics Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible. The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter. Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority. The Electronic Technology project supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures. Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors. Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards. This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research. The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. This project will therefore pursue electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead exploit new concepts in circuit specialization, by the optimization of materials, architectures, and designs to achieve specific circuit function at high performance. Because electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies, this envisioned electronics specialization will require incorporation of security safeguards. Accordingly, programs within the Beyond Scaling project will reduce barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and new techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority. The Electronic Technology project supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures. Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors. Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards. This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 Title: Modular Description: The Modular Optical Aperture Building Blocks (MOABB) program aims to greatly improve the cost, size, weight, and performance of free-space optical systems. These systems enable applications such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR), laser communications, laser illumination, navigation, and 3D imaging. Specifically, MOABB will construct millimeter-scale optical building blocks that can be coherently arrayed to form larger, higher power devices. These building blocks would replace the traditional large and expensive precision lenses and mirrors, which require slow mechanical steering, that form conventional optical systems. MOABB will develop scalable optical phased arrays that can steer light waves without the use of mechanical components. These advances would allow for a 100-fold reduction in size and weight and a 1,000-fold increase in the steering rate of optical systems. FY 2020 Plans: - Synthesize multiple light beams from a single optical phased array aperture of one square centimeter area. - Demonstrate integration of laser sources and optical phased arrays on photonic chips. - Create and characterize a prototype LIDAR module using optical phased arrays.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 The FY 2021 decrease reflects final demonstrations. Title: Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) Description: The Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program will develop novel magnetic sensors capable of providing high-sensitivity signal measurements in the presence of ambient magnetic fields. In recent years, the value of magnetic imaging, for example for cardiac and other biological signals, has shown tremendous potential for advanced research and clinical diagnosis. Practical application, however, has been limited. Interference from natural and manmade ambient magnetic fields has required that the measurements be performed in specialized, magnetically-shielded research facilities. The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources. The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal. This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications. In addition to medical research and clinical diagnosis, AMBIIENT sensors promise to enable diverse sensing applications including magnetic gradient navigation, anomaly detection, perimeter monitoring, and ultralow frequency communications. FY 2020 Plans: - Complete sensor package architecture meeting AMBIIENT size weight and power, accuracy, and sensitivity goals. - Fabricate and test architectures for direct gradient sensing of magnetic fields. FY 2021 Plans: - Design sensor package architecture meeting AMBIIENT size weight and power, accuracy, and sensitivity goals. - Integrate control electronics for direct gradient sensing of magnetic fields.

Linearity, power efficiency, and dynamic range are fundamental characteristics that allow RF systems to reliably transmit clear signals. Improving these characteristics is essential to operating in a crowded RF environment and to enabling next-generation communication, sensing, and electronic warfare systems. Traditional RF transistor designs typically require a trade-off between linearity and broadcast power, and poor linearity results in undesired interference. DREAM will overcome this tradeoff by employing new transistor materials, architectures, and designs. The resulting DREAM-enabled technologies will allow future RF electronics to increase their operating range without polluting the already-congested RF spectrum and while consuming less system power.

Title: SHort Range Independent Microrobotic Platforms (SHRIMP) Description: The SHort Range Independent Microrobotic Platforms (SHRIMP) program is developing and demonstrating multi- functional millimeter-to-centimeter scale robotic platforms with a focus on untethered mobility, maneuverability, and dexterity. To achieve this goal, SHRIMP conducted foundational research in the area of micro-actuator materials and energy efficient power systems for extremely size, weight, and power constrained microrobotic systems. The program's platform development activities will leverage recent advances in low power, application specific integrated circuit electronics and low power sensors from the internet of things community to increase the functionality of microrobotic platforms while increasing platform mobility, maneuverability, and dexterity. The microrobotic platform capabilities enabled by SHRIMP will provide the DoD with significantly more access and capability to operate in small spaces that are practically inaccessible to today's state-of-the-art robotic platforms. Such capability will have impact in search and rescue, disaster relief, infrastructure inspection, and equipment maintenance, among other operations. Foundational research efforts are funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01.

Title: Focal Description: *Formerly Intelligent Spectroscopic & Temporal Fusion (INSPECT) The Focal Arrays for Curved Infrared Imagers (FOCII) program will add curved focal plane arrays to broadband infrared (IR) imagers to enhance battlefield detection and discrimination while maintaining situational awareness. The resulting desired capability is analogous to human vision that enables wide fields of view in a compact optical system package. Currently fielded imaging systems are flat broadband infrared sensors that rely on large and complex optics to correct aberrations and improve illumination and resolution. FOCII will (1) leverage curving strategies for state of the art focal plane arrays combined with advances in designing and manufacturing stress relief features to demonstrate hardware that simultaneously provides maximum resolution and illumination, and (2) develop novel designs for IR imagers that enable minimal size, weight and cost for size- constrained applications. This will enable new applications in passive seeker technology for missiles, overhead persistent infrared imaging, 360 degree situational awareness, infrared search and track, and long range targeting. FY 2020 Plans: - Develop mechanical stress models for use with existing broadband imaging hardware. - Fabricate initial curved focal plane array prototypes that meet program goals for radius of curvature and size of pixels. FY 2021 Plans: - Measure baseline spectral uniformity of curved large area focal arrays. - Measure mechanical stress of curved large area focal arrays to validate mechanical stress models. FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects the program shifting from fabricating initial curved focal plan array prototypes to measuring mechanical stress of curved large area focal arrays.- - 142 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 23 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / ELECTRONIC B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 The Wideband Adaptive RF Protection (WARP) program will develop radio frequency (RF) front-end technology that can protect wideband digital radios against external electromagnetic threats and self-interference, through tunable filtering, limiting, and/or signal cancellation. Today's advanced wideband DoD systems, such as multi-function phased arrays, are open to all frequencies by design with little or no RF filtering. This is due to a lack of tunable and reconfigurable filters that are small enough to integrate into the arrays, limiting the use of wideband multi-function arrays in contested environments. The ability to create tunable and reconfigurable bandpass and bandstop filters in the range of 2-18 GHz will be important for implementing transmit/ receive modules in next generation multi-function arrays. Another important area of interference mitigation is self-interference. Specifically, in electronic warfare, it would be advantageous to be able to receive and perform signal intelligence functions while simultaneously transmitting a high-power jamming self-protect signal. WARP will develop the signal cancellation technology that will listen to the transmitted jamming signal and subtract it from the input of the receiver so faint signals near the noise floor can still be detected. Program research will provide feedback mechanisms that intelligently correct these problems. Whether for self- induced interference or external interference jamming, WARP will develop intelligent filtering and self-interference cancellation technologies to protect wideband DoD receivers. FY 2020 Plans: - Begin investigating new materials, devices and/or circuit architectures that will enable frequency tuning of band pass and band stop filters in chip-scale size for use in next generation wideband receivers for DoD systems. - Begin investigating new materials, devices and/or circuit architectures that will enable cancellation of signal leakage between two adjacent antennas for simultaneous transmit and receive electronic warfare applications on small platforms. FY 2021 Plans: - Demonstrate new materials, devices and/or circuit architectures that will enable frequency tuning of band pass and band stop filters in chip-scale size for use in next generation wideband receivers for DOD systems. - Demonstrate new materials, devices and/or circuit architectures that will enable cancellation of signal leakage between two adjacent antennas for simultaneous transmit and receive electronic warfare applications on small platforms. FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects the program shifting from investigating to demonstrating RF front-end technology that can protect wideband digital radios against external electromagnetic threats and self-interference, through tunable filtering, limiting, and/or signal cancellation.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 used within the DoD and industry. The medical community utilizes sensitive magnetometers for magnetoencephalography and magnetocardiography. In addition to being diagnostically relevant, such sensitive magnetometers could enable future human- machine/brain-machine interfaces. The DoD and industry also uses magnetometers for magnetic anomaly detection, which may allow for the discovery of mineral/oil deposits, discovery of old wellheads, or the detection of improvised explosive devices. In addition, magnetometers offer the possibility of magnetic navigation, which may operate in GPS-denied environments. High sensitivity electrometers are used by industry to locate live current and static electricity sources. Recent developments have resulted in the potential to develop highly sensitive vector electrometers and magnetometers, which would enable the consequent development of sensitive full tensor gradient sensors. Such tensors offer more degrees of freedom than their scalar or vector counterparts and potentially provide additional information about the source. FY 2020 Plans: - Design prototype gradient electrometer. FY 2021 Build magnetic or electric field tensor gradiometer. - Develop tensor-based algorithms for DoD relevant applications. - Initiate research into building a magnetic or electric field tensor sensor. FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects a shift from design to building preliminary magnetic/electric field sensors. Title: High Operating Temperature Sensors for Hypersonics and Turbine Engines (HOTSHOT) Description: The High Operating Temperature Sensors for Hypersonics and Turbine Engines (HOTSHOT) program seeks to enable electronics and sensing in harsh temperature environments for next generation vehicles. Currently, sensing systems are not robust to the temperature extremes expected over a mission lifetime. This technology gap hampers the ability to capture flight test data from air vehicles (boost glide, air-breathing, etc.) during development. HOTSHOT will develop the material, device, and sensor technologies required to create high-temperature capable sensing systems. These new material choices allow transduction, signal conditioning, digitization, and processing at elevated temperatures, thus reducing the need for temperature shielding of these components. Reduced shielding drops the on-vehicle size, weight, and power requirements for many components. HOTSHOT will enable faster and more predictable design of new air vehicles, which will lead to more efficient system performance. FY 2021 Plans: - Demonstrate initial results of transduction and signal conditioning at elevated temperatures. - Release of initial design parameters for selected electronics process.- - 11.000 Volume 1 - 144 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 23 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / ELECTRONIC B.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects Title: Data Privacy for Virtual Environments (DPRIVE) Description: The Data Privacy in Virtual Environments (DPRIVE) program will enable data privacy at the user and application level, through the development of new hardware accelerators, to achieve acceptable computational times. The program plans to provide strong privacy protections at the tactical edge with no more than one order of magnitude penalty in computation time and enable very strong privacy at the enterprise level with no more than three orders of magnitude penalty over unencrypted processing. The DoD is increasingly reliant on cloud computing services and storage. Cloud-enabled virtualized storage and the accompanying virtualized computing play a key role in data processing for planning and operations. Networks are also becoming more virtualized spaces, such as in 5G systems. The growing virtualization storage, computing, and networking puts data privacy of all users at risk. DPRIVE will build hardware to accelerate the computation of homomorphic encryption, which enables mathematical operations to execute on encrypted data such that the data is never unencrypted. The program will enable the development and deployment of these hardware accelerators to edge computing devices where power and time are a premium as well as enterprise computing facilities where the amount and sensitivity of the data requires increased protection. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop algorithms and simulate performance for both edge and enterprise mission sets. - Create a hardware design model. - Prove the ability to compute deep neural networks on encrypted data. FY 2020 to FY - 12.000 Title: High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) Description: The High power Amplifier using Vacuum electronics for Overmatch Capability (HAVOC) program seeks to develop compact radio frequency signal amplifiers for air, ground, and ship-based communications and sensing systems. HAVOC amplifiers would enable these systems to access the high-frequency millimeter-wave portion of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, facilitating increased range and other performance improvements. Today, the effectiveness of combat operations across all domains increasingly depends on DoD's ability to control and exploit the EM spectrum and to deny its use to adversaries. However, the proliferation of inexpensive commercial RF sources has made the EM spectrum crowded and contested, challenging our spectrum dominance. Operating at higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave, helps DoD to overcome these issues and offers numerous tactical advantages such as high data-rate communications and high resolution and6.000 6.000 - Volume 1 - 145 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 10 of 23 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-01 / ELECTRONIC B.

FY 2020 Plans: - Fabricate single-beam vacuum amplifiers and test at high average-power output. to FY 2021 reflects Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) Description: The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program is developing inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. When GPS is not available, these inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information. The program will exploit recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors can suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, new photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies. PRIGM will focus on two areas. By 2022, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms. By 2030, it aims to develop advanced inertial MEMS sensors that can provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions. These advances should enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision, and shock tolerance. PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service Labs to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations. Basic research for this program was funded within PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and advanced technology development for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-15.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Description: The WIRED program addresses the need for low-cost, high-performance imaging sensors in the short-wave and mid-wave infrared (SWIR/MWIR) bands. These sensors will provide increased standoff distances for small unmanned aerial vehicles, low-cost missiles, handheld weapon sights and surveillance systems, helmet-mounted systems, and ground-vehicle- mounted threat warning systems. WIRED proposes to manufacture these sensors at the wafer scale, which reduces costs by processing dozens to hundreds of camera imaging arrays at a time. Wafer-scale manufacturing has already driven a revolution in optical imaging in both the visible and the long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectrum, with high-resolution digital cameras and LWIR sensors having become commonplace or widely-available. However, no similar technologies exist for the SWIR/MWIR bands. WIRED could therefore drive a similar revolution in SWIR/MWIR. The program aims to significantly reduce the weight and volume of MWIR detectors, which today require heavy cryogenic cooling systems, and increase the resolution of SWIR detectors by dramatically reducing their pixel size relative to the state-of-the-art. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate improved performance of the MWIR imager compatible with requirements for relevant DoD applications. to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 decrease reflects program completion. Title: Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) Description: The Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES) program is developing extremely stable chip-scale atomic clocks for unmanned aerial vehicles and other low size, weight, and power (SWaP) platforms with extended mission durations. Atomic clocks provide the high-performance backbone of timing and synchronization for DoD navigation; communications; electronic warfare; and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems. However, atomic clocks are limited, particularly by temperature sensitivity, aging over long timescales, and a loss of accuracy when power cycled. By employing alternative approaches to confining and measuring atomic particles, ACES could yield a 100x - 1,000x improvement in key performance parameters related to each of these limitations. ACES will also focus on developing the component technologies necessary for low-cost manufacturing and for deployment in harsh DoD-relevant environments. Among its many benefits, program success could help reduce the risk posed by a growing national dependence on GPS, allowing systems to maintain their timing accuracy in the event of temporary GPS unavailability. FY 2020 Plans: - Fabricate a fully integrated prototype including electronics and physics package meeting SWaP objectives such that prototypes can be delivered and tested. - Deliver prototype to government facility for testing and verification of GPS-independent timing accuracy.

Title: Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) Description: The Limits of Thermal Sensors (LOTS) program aims to demonstrate long-wave infrared (LWIR) detector technologies with both high performance and low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C). The resulting technologies would enable improvements in imaging systems such as night-vision goggles, infrared-guided missiles, and missile threat warning systems. Currently, LWIR-enabled systems must choose between large and expensive cryogenically-cooled detectors, which offer high sensitivity and low response times, and uncooled detectors called microbolometers, which offer significant SWaP- C reductions at lower performance. LOTS seeks to develop microbolometers that can compete with larger cameras in terms of higher sensitivity required to detect signals over long ranges and lower response time required to avoid image blur. These technologies will allow DoD to deploy smaller, lighter, and cheaper sensors on critical, high-value assets while maintaining or improving their ability to engage fast-moving or distant targets. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate microbolometer arrays on improved read-out integrated circuits and develop design variants appropriate for different platforms and use cases. - Build final cameras for demonstration in relevant environments. - Demonstrate the utility of high performance microbolometers for low-cost infrared search and track applications, including evaluating the impact of jitter. FY 2020 to FY Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) Description: The Direct On-chip Digital Optical Synthesis (DODOS) program aimed to integrate diverse electronic and photonic components to create a compact, robust, and highly-accurate optical frequency synthesizer for various mission-critical DoD applications. DODOS leveraged recent developments in the field of integrated photonics to enable the development of a ubiquitous, low-cost optical frequency synthesizers.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. This project will therefore pursue electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead exploit new concepts in circuit specialization, by the optimization of materials, architectures, and designs to achieve specific circuit function at high performance. Because electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies, this envisioned electronics specialization will require incorporation of security safeguards. Accordingly, programs within the Beyond Scaling project will reduce barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and new techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: Beyond Scaling - Materials Description: The Beyond Scaling - Materials program is demonstrating the integration of novel materials into next-generation logic and memory components. Historically, the DoD had taken the lead in shaping the electronics field through research in semiconductor materials, circuits, and processors. However, as DoD focuses on military-specific components and commercial investments eschew the semiconductor space, U.S. fundamental electronics research is stagnant just as an inflection point in Moore's Law (silicon scaling) is about to occur. This program is pursuing potential enhancements in electronics that do not rely on Moore's Law, including research not only into new materials but also into the implications of those materials at the device, algorithm, and packaging levels. Research areas include heterogeneous integration of multiple materials, \"sticky logic\" devices that combine elements of computation and memory, and leveraging three-dimensional vertical circuit integration to demonstrate dramatic performance improvements with older silicon technologies. Further research will support innovation in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs focused on DoD-relevant businesses. The program is demonstrating the manufacturability of functioning switches, memory, and novel computational units in a large-scale system.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 and spatially distributed next-generation RF systems. Current U.S. test infrastructure is no longer able to successfully exercise RF systems in relevant environments, which should account for hundreds of DoD systems coordinating against hundreds of adversary systems. Due to the critical dependency of nearly all platforms and missions on the RF spectrum and the increasingly advanced RF capabilities of peer adversaries, current infrastructure limitations represent a critical capability gap. Existing test approaches are either: 1) small-scale laboratory tests under well controlled but unrealistic conditions or 2) massive training exercises, which occur at most annually due to the required cost and manpower and do not fully collect necessary data. To overcome these limitations, DRBE is leveraging advances in massively multi-core computing hardware and high-bandwidth digital cross connects to emulate realistic RF environments that account for RF platform movement, signal propagation effects and delays, signal interference, and interactions between RF systems. The electronics architecture which supports these goals is beyond anything that exists today, based on the power and latency requirements that this emulation environment demands. DRBE is pursuing three technical thrust areas: architecture, massively multi-core computing, and scenario modeling. The resulting test environment will allow plug-and-play connections for hundreds of RF systems in a 100 km battlespace test. Multi- system exercises will then be quickly executed through many different combat scenarios and variations. DRBE is serving to develop concept of operations (CONOPS), inform battle plans, and fine-tune the performance of both individual and large groups of RF systems. FY 2020 Plans: - Complete first-generation DRBE system design to the level of a Concept Design Review (CoDR). - Complete DRBE real-time High-Performance Computer (HPC) design to the level of a CoDR. - Emulate first-generation DRBE system performance using non-real-time software.

Title: Guaranteed Architectures for Physical Security (GAPS)* Description: *Previously a part of Beyond Scaling - Architectures The goal of the Guaranteed Architectures for Physical Security (GAPS) program is to develop hardware security and software architectures with provable security interfaces. These interfaces will physically isolate high risk transactions during both system design and system build and track that such protections are enforced at run-time. GAPS will reduce the inherent complexity through the development of hardware and software that will be open, extendible, and compatible with size, weight, and power constrained environments to enable security across DoD and commercial systems. The program will substantially lower the barrier to safely enabling high-risk transactions, thus allowing for: a) fast computer-to-computer transactions; b) physical spatial isolation reducing the need for unreliable software partitioning solutions; and c) more complex missions without putting sensitive data at risk.- 7.000 12.000 Volume 1 - 156 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 21 of 23 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / (Number/Name) ELT-02 / BEYOND SCALING TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) Description: The System Security Integrated Through Hardware and firmware (SSITH) program seeks to secure DoD and commercial electronic systems against cybersecurity threats by developing novel hardware/firmware security architectures and hardware design methodologies. Current responses to cybersecurity attacks typically consist of developing and deploying software patches to address specific vulnerabilities in a software firewall without addressing potential vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware architecture. To address this challenge, SSITH is driving new research in electronics hardware security and exploiting current research in areas such as cryptographic-based computing and hardware verification. Implementation of these advanced ideas has been enabled by the extremely capable semiconductor technology driven by Moore's Law. The program is also investigating flexible hardware architectures that adapt to and limit the impact of new cybersecurity attacks.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions. A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets. This program element will examine concepts and architectures that move the U.S. away from a dependence on monolithic, ultra-capable, vulnerable, and unsustainably costly assets; replacing them with disaggregated assets that are agile, affordable, and easily replaced/maintained. Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities. Development of smaller, simpler, and more agile launch vehicles and infrastructure will be pursued. In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies as well as exploring novel in-space manufacturing technologies and techniques will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity and functionality of space systems, space-derived information, and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this program element include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness, and precision control of multi-payload systems. Studies will actively seek to take advantage of new commercial developments which may enable both rapid constitution/reconstitution of assets, and agility/functionality not previously available for military systems.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY Title: Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) Description: The Reconfigurable Imaging (ReImagine) program aims to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process and relay image information. This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC. Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates. These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame. Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements. Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect the specialized data over the full image frame. The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs. Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate or with 3-D depth information. The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band. By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs will enable real- time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate the ReImagine reconfigurable sensing system concept using the Gen-1 reconfigurable ROIC. - Complete the Gen-2 ROIC tier 1 and submit to the foundry for manufacturing.22.738 21.000 9.960 Volume 1 - 181 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 12 R-1 Line #56Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B.

Title: Wideband Secured and Protected Emitter and Receiver (WiSPER) Description: The Wideband Secured and Protected Emitter and Receiver (WiSPER) program aims to develop an ultra-broadband technology platform to demonstrate a robust, secure and protected communication link. WiSPER technology provides high signal coding gain to deliver a secured and protected link with significantly enhanced capacity for next generation DoD communications. Current terrestrial tactical radios operate with limited bandwidth at prescribed low frequency bands, which are unable to support high capacity with multiple users, and are vulnerable to interference and jamming. WiSPER technology addresses military needs for assured communications, electronic warfare (EW) communications deception, throughput, security, and size, weight, and power limitations of future command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The program will develop an ultra-broadband compact antenna, radio frequency front end electronics, mixed signal circuits, and featureless waveform technologies. The WiSPER program will culminate with the integration and demonstration of a secured communication link. Technologies developed under the WiSPER program are planned for transition to the Services. FY 2020 Plans: - Complete system study of transceiver architecture for ultra-broadband, secure communication links. - Perform initial studies of antenna, integrated circuits, and waveform to implement ultra-broadband communications. - Simulate and optimize the transceiver architecture design.

Title: Portable Optical Integrated Network Transceivers (POINT) Description: To enable advanced communications and improve network resiliency, the Portable Optical Integrated Network Transceivers (POINT) program aims to develop low size, weight, and power (SWaP) photonic transceivers and demonstrate them in free-space optical (FSO) links for micro-satellites and small mobile platforms. The high-SWaP of existing optical terminals with gimbals and telescopes are incompatible with micro-satellite payload capacity and mission requirements. POINT will leverage recent development of optical phased array based transmitter technology combined with wide field of view, dual-mode, high- speed imaging receivers. The integrated optical transceivers will have no moving parts, resulting in a radical reduction in SWaP, enabling advanced and resilient communications for small Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and other mobile platforms. The program will develop and demonstrate an FSO link applicable to LEO-LEO or LEO-Ground missions, providing high bandwidth, efficient, and secure communication links for resilient command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in space. Other terrestrial uses of the technology include interference-free operation in denied environments and low probability of intercept/low probability of detection tactical links. Technologies developed under the POINT program are planned for transition to the Services. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop and mature chip-scale photonic transmitters and receivers with sufficient bandwidth, range, and field of regard to acquire and maintain robust FSO links up to 1 Gbps at 200 km. - Develop gimbal-free FSO terminals with form-factor and SWaP compatible with deployment on micro-satellites and small mobile platforms. FY 2020 to FY Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) Description: The Precise Robust Inertial Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program is developing inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable. The program exploits recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies. PRIGM is focusing on two areas: (1) By 2020, it aims to develop and transition a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, to DoD platforms; and (2) By 2030, it aims to develop Advanced Inertial MEMS Sensors that can12.600 12.000 - Volume 1 - 183 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 12 R-1 Line #56Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 provide gun-hard, high-bandwidth, high dynamic range navigation for GPS-free munitions. These advances will enable navigation applications, such as smart munitions, that require low-cost, size, weight, and power (SWaP) inertial sensors with high bandwidth, precision and shock tolerance. PRIGM will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL-3 devices to a TRL-6 transition platform, eventually enabling the Service laboratories to perform TRL-7 field demonstrations. The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical/electronic interface identical to existing DoD-standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems. Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion. This program has basic research efforts funded in PE 0601101E, Project ES-01 and applied research efforts funded in PE 0602716E, Project ELT-01. FY 2020 Plans: - Deliver two MEMS-based, navigation-grade, integrated IMU prototypes for government evaluation. - Evaluate MEMS-based, navigation-grade, integrated IMU prototypes (non-gun hardened) in laboratory environment. - Evaluate MEMS-based, navigation-grade, integrated IMU prototypes (non-gun hardened) 2021 Statement: The FY 2021 reflects program completion. Title: Rapid Array Development (RAD) Description: The Rapid Array Development (RAD) program is building an immersive electromagnetic environment for use by the warfighter to understand the effects of electronic maneuvers and developing new electronic maneuver warfare (EMW) techniques. The program is leveraging recent developments in flexible and adaptive radio frequency (RF) hardware, access to a larger variety of more powerful computing platforms, and advances in software virtualization to radically change the development and deployment cycle for EMW techniques. Currently, the development cycle for EMW algorithms is long and costly. However, they must be able to evolve rapidly in order to adapt to new modes of operation and changing operating parameters associated with modern military threats. The programmable RAD testbeds will ultimately train warfighters on how to deal with legacy and emerging threats in the RF spectrum through maneuvers, signal jamming tactics, signal intelligence gathering, and other missions. The outcome of RAD will be better tactics, techniques, and procedures for handling EMW as well as the identification of new technology assets for deploying EMW capabilities. Technologies developed under the RAD program are planned for transition to the Services. FY 2020 Plans: - Explore development of a processing platform capable of executing EMW algorithms, array configuration, data flow, and end- user interactions. - Design a software framework for rapidly developing new EMW applications.11.533 10.779 - Volume 1 - 184 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 12 R-1 Line #56Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / 3R-1 ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIESProject (Number/Name) MT-15 / MIXED TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION B.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: Beyond Scaling - Access Description: The Beyond Scaling - Access program will demonstrate the design and fabrication of advanced electronics through collaborations with leading industry players. It accomplishes complementary goals of working in a commercial environment for innovation beyond-SOTA to develop electronics for military capabilities, while simultaneously strengthening our domestic ecosystem and ensuring that the DoD has enduring access to SOTA technologies. Although the United States has led the development of advanced electronics since its inception and is home to three of the five leading-edge silicon foundries, recent investments by foreign competitors are threatening this leadership. Additionally, the fabrication cost of next generation microelectronics has increased at an alarming rate. While the commercial sector is able to spread these costs over a large volume of products, the low volumes used by the DoD has led to a cost barrier in meeting its future technology needs. This program will forge forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the DoD. Activities include establishing design capabilities for advanced digital logic in SOTA foundries, developing new architectures for field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) using commercial manufacturing flows, and lowering the technical hurdles for ubiquitous heterogeneous integration by revolutionizing back end compound semiconductor processes. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Services.

Title: Millimeter Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS) Description: The Millimeter (MIDAS) program is developing a common millimeter wave phased-array tile that is scalable to large arrays to provide wideband frequency agility from 18-50 GHz with element-level digital beamforming. Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form- factor. We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35. One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile. This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery when transmitting. Digital beamforming also enables multiple beams to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously. This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages. To achieve these goals, the program will develop a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block. The program will be executed in two primary technical areas. First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology will be used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems. Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance compound semiconductors will be used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system. Technologies from this program are intended for transition through commercial industry to the Services. FY 2020 Plans: - Fabricate and test millimeter wave frequency low-power, 16-element, element-level digital phased arrays in advanced silicon CMOS. - Begin designs of millimeter wave 64-element digital phased arrays in advanced CMOS co-integrated with compound semiconductor power amplifiers and wideband apertures. - Continue demonstrating advancements in the fundamental technologies relevant to millimeter wave digital arrays in the areas of converters, filters, oscillators, and broadband apertures.

Title: Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES)* Description: *Previously part of Beyond Scaling - Access The Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) program aims to develop optical signaling technologies for digital microelectronics. Distributed and parallel computing architectures are now pervasive across all size scales, from personal- scale multicore processing units to enterprise-scale high performance computing systems, and span application domains from consumer electronics to DoD systems. Increasingly, however, the benefits of parallelism are constrained not by the limits of computation at individual nodes but by the movement of data between nodes. PIPES will advance microelectronics capabilities by intimately integrating photonics with advanced integrated electronics to yield system connectivity with an unprecedented combination of high aggregate bandwidth, power efficiency, channel density, and link reach. Specifically, PIPES will develop photonic input/output (I/O) capability for application-specific integrated circuits and FPGAs, widely used in advanced DoD sensors and RF systems. The goal of the program is improving I/O bandwidth density, efficiency, and reach by >100x to enable disruptive DoD system parallelism and performance scaling. As PIPES technologies mature, they are anticipated to proliferate into central processing units, graphical processing units, and emerging tensor-flow processing units that will impact a wide range of dual- use applications including artificial intelligence, machine learning, large scale emulation, and high performance computing. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to larger scale commercial performers and the Services.

Mixed-mode Ultra Scaled Integrated Circuits (T-MUSIC)* Description: *Previously part of Beyond Scaling - Access The Technologies for Mixed-mode Ultra Scaled Integrated Circuits (T-MUSIC) program will develop an on-shore ultra-broadband radio frequency (RF) mixed-mode semiconductor integrated circuits foundry platform for the critical interface to convert high speed analog signals to a digital representation for commercial and military systems. The mixed-mode circuits take signals from the physical world (analog, RF) and transform them to be processed in computing systems (digital). As defense and commercial wireless applications move to higher frequencies to carry faster data traffic, integrating the broadband mixed-mode circuitries with high speed digital processing logics onto one integrated chip is needed to attain the performance required for future systems. T-MUSIC seeks to integrate high-speed, high-performance analog and digital electronics together in highly scaled silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundries on-shore. Such processes will enable the high integration and performance needed for DoD-relevant and commercial 5G/6G applications. The goal of T-MUSIC technology is to enable wireless operations beyond 100 GHz with very wide bandwidth with low noise and high dynamic range. In parallel, T-MUSIC aims to develop the next-generation terahertz (THz) mixed-mode devices based on the advanced digital CMOS fabrication platform. The T-MUSIC program will establish advanced on-shore foundry capabilities to establish a long-term domestic world-class RF mixed- mode System-on-Chip technology for intended transition to DoD and commercial applications.

Title: Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) Description: Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters and features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations. The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating. Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission. There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network. The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales. Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability. The DyNAMO program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments. The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services. FY 2020 Plans: - Conduct ground test of integrated system. - Conduct field test of integrated system with instantiations of inter-network coordination, mission-based control, and real-time optimization to show the quantitative and qualitative value of DyNAMO for a variety of military missions. - Integrate program software into tactical radio hardware. - Demonstrate Army, Navy, Marine, and Air Force inter-network scenarios.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 decrease reflects a shift from testing and initial integration to final demonstrations and further refinement of the system. Title: Geospatial Cloud Analytics (GCA) Description: The Geospatial Cloud Analytics (GCA) program will develop technology to access and analyze global-scale, multimodal geospatial data and pilot an analytics-as-a-service business model. Exploiting multiple sources and modalities at a global scale requires the development of technologies and systems that provide common access points to commercial data, computational power to preprocess data and make it exploitable by analytical tools, and new models supporting sensing and analytics as services, including sharing of tools and results between individuals and consortiums. GCA creates a capability for near real time monitoring of global events and change detection across various environments and warfighting domains. By exploiting the vast amounts of geospatial information from new commercial satellite constellations and other sources, GCA will create the technology foundations needed to provide global awareness of gray zone activities for DoD military mission planning and execution. It will do so by augmenting commercial capabilities with defense assets, not vice versa, and thereby will improve speed, agility, and scalability. Technology from this program will transition to the Services and DoD Agencies. FY 2020 Plans: - Complete a multi-source, multi-modality platform with global-scale analytics. - Demonstrate ability for DoD users to use the analytics services in an operationally relevant environment. - Refine the analytics services based on feedback from end users FY 2021 Plans: - Begin development of additional future advanced analytics services based on feedback from end users. - Transition analytics services to additional DoD military users and other Government entities. FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 decrease reflects a shift from platform and software development into testing of the analytics services in operationally relevant environments.21.965 19.993 7.889 Title: Network Universal Persistence (Network 9.829 Volume 1 - 195 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYST...

Accomplishments/Planned Programs in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Description: Current radios send network control information and data using the same wireless link. This produces a common failure mode when that wireless link degrades. In many of today's military wireless networks, even brief wireless link outages create a loss of network connectivity that can take more than two minutes to recover once the wireless link is re-established. During these network outages, data transmission is not possible. The Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments. Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost. The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links. The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless links and design and implement mechanisms to maintain synchronization across those separate links. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services. FY 2020 Plans: - Demonstrate a communication system that provides reliable communications in the presence of jamming. - Demonstrate physical communications channel divided into two separate functions and radio frequency bands. - Complete design of radio architectures and build and test prototypes. - Complete design of network architectures and build and test prototypes. - Demonstrate radio architectures in highly mobile scenarios with large amounts of environmental attenuation. FY 2021 Plans: - Design and build a wireless hardware and software demonstration platform. - Complete integration of network control algorithms onto multi-band or multiple radio platforms. - Test and verify that the operation of the integrated hardware and software meet program goals. - Demonstrate network connectivity and data throughput on wireless channels in the presence of high levels of interference. FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 decrease reflects a shift from system development to testing. Title: Protected Forward Communications (PFC) Description: The collaborative application of combat power in ground tactical operations demands reliable exchange of rich information and precise coordination of actions across various echelons. These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command. The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries. This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 decrease reflects transitioning from design and prototyping activities to experimentation and assessment activities. Title: Composable Logistics and Information Omniscience (LogX) Description: The Composable Logistics and Information Omniscience (LogX) program will develop and demonstrate software for real-time logistics and supply chain system situational awareness (diagnosis), future state prediction (prognosis) and resilience at unprecedented scale and speed. The software will integrate a range of technical innovations spanning human-machine interface, dynamic data visualization, and distributed/collaborative software design. Based upon technologies developed in the Prototype Resilient Operations Testbed for Expeditionary Urban Systems of Systems (PROTEUS) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), the LogX capability will allow users to achieve a more distributed and resilient logistics command and control (C2) system utilizing planned cloud-based data environments. The new capability will be tested in an experimental environment tied to current logistics datasets.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2021 increase reflects additional effort required to conduct demonstrations and prepare systems for deployment in operational settings. Title: Multi-Domain Analytics (MDA) Description: The Multi-Domain Analytics (MDA) program will develop network and data management tools for automating the establishment of cross-domain networks in support of data analytics and decision making tools. The tools will manage information flow to support data correlation and fusion across multiple, isolated databases and networks. Technology advances are making it possible to pass messages across heterogeneous waveforms and networks, but there are no technologies today that can determine if it is the data that is most important to end users and systems. Building upon technologies developed in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical edge (SHARE) program (budgeted in this PE/Project), MDA will combine network management with data analytics, information exploitation and fusion technology to route information in an understandable context, based upon information need and value. MDA also seeks to address multi-level security configuration issues that often add delays and limit interoperability. The MDA program will enable automated data analysis across different networks without manually moving impracticably large amounts of data. Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services.

Title: Dynamic Airspace Control Description: The Dynamic Airspace Control program will develop and demonstrate alternate means of creating the local airspace picture and dynamically managing the local airspace without requiring high power radars or communications. This capability will support the simultaneous operations and airspace deconfliction of a wide array of airborne systems, such as manned and unmanned weapons systems and non-combatant aircraft. Based on technologies developed in the Systems of Systems- Enhanced Small Units (SESU) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E/Project NET-01), Dynamic Airspace Control will consist of an artificial intelligence engine and a mix of traditional and non-traditional sensors to create the air picture. It will also leverage legacy Airspace management tools to take advantage of prior investments in technologies, such as human-machine interfaces, and to minimize the impact on training. The artificial intelligence engine will generate a real-world model enabling automated airspace deconfliction for a variety of simultaneous missions (e.g., helicopter search and rescue, fires, and surveillance with unmanned airborne vehicles). The program will use traditional and non-traditional sensors, such as flight plans, air platform self-reporting, and passive sensing in order to confirm flight plans or to detect unidentified air platforms in the airspace. Technologies from this program will transition to the Air Force. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop representative airspace vignettes and identify performance metrics. - Design and develop the software architecture, development environment (DEVOPS), and interface specifications to host the artificial intelligence engine algorithms and interoperate with legacy airspace management tools. - Define required training data sets. - Identify non-traditional sensor options and develop models.

FY 2020 to FY 2021 Increase/Decrease Multi-Network Exploitation (MNE) will create an end-to-end logical network to enable tactical network resilience and assurance to ensure critical information is exchanged between systems and their users. This will include the research and development of a common underlying (physical or virtual) infrastructure that permits the transfer of information across multiple paths and between multiple systems. Based on technologies developed in the Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient Networks at the Tactical Edge (SHARE) program (budgeted in this PE/Project), the MNE program will develop networking systems that are sensitive to the tradeoffs of delivery of both timely and precise information. MNE will investigate innovations to layers in the network stack to offer new opportunities for ensuring critical systems and user information are delivered in virtual slices across multiple networking paths, including combinations of tactical and commercial networks, even when the underlying physical networks are not designed to operate with each other. MNE will demonstrate improved access, quality of service, and data rates with reduced latency on scaled networks to ease application to enterprise and tactical networks. Technology developed by the MNE program will transition to the Services.

Title: Spectrum Efficiency and Access Description: The Federal Government is working to transition large swaths of spectrum (up to 500 MHz) from Federal (DoD is the primary contributor) to civilian use for broadband telecommunications. The DoD will need more highly integrated and networked sensor and data capacity over the next decades and will therefore need new technology that requires less spectrum to operate. The objective of the Spectrum Efficiency and Access program was to investigate improvements in spectral reuse, such as spectrum sharing of sensor and radar bands with communication systems. The program leveraged technologies originally developed for radar anti-jam and interference mitigation that could enable spectrum sharing by allowing overlay of communications within the same spectral footprint. The approach included exploring real-time control data links between radars and communications systems and developing the advanced waveforms and components to enable radars and communication networks to operate in close proximity. The ultimate goal was to turn the DoD spectrum loss into a net gain of up to hundreds of MHz in capacity.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Network-Centric Warfare Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts. It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi- urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.

Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) Description: The System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program seeks to implement an architecture framework capable of assessing and demonstrating potential operational benefits of integrating various system capabilities to improve mission success in contested environments. Such assessments would optimize system-level trades of requirements and architectures to leverage an integrated set of system characteristics and capabilities. The demonstration assessment metrics will measure individual and combined system performance to streamline resource allocation to maximize operational impact. In addition, providing a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment to assess complex systems will enable greater utility of emerging system technologies, since they can be assessed in near-real-world simulations without the real-world costs of testing fully integrated systems. The program will also develop system synthesis and integration technologies that enable rapid assimilation of new and off-the-shelf technologies into the system of systems architecture. These technologies will break down current barriers to entry that new technologies face in system of systems using formal methods, compositional reasoning, and automated design space exploration. Technologies from this program will be transitioned to the Services.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Description: Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment. To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program will develop tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications), while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies. The program will develop tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification. RSPACE will also develop tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-ISR techniques. During execution, the tools will provide lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and support assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent. The tools will dynamically respond as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic re-planning capability and easily adapt to technology refreshes. RSPACE tools will transition to the Air Force and the Navy.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces. B.

Title: Disaggregated Strike Group - Manta Ray* Description: *Previously Missileer Group - Manta Ray (DSG - Manta Ray) program seeks to develop a new class of long duration, long-range payload capable unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) at an acquisition and lifecycle cost significantly less than current payload-capable UUVs. This new class of UUV will give the combatant commander an amplification of capacity without disrupting current operations by remaining independent of manned vessels and ports once deployed. The primary goal of the DSG - Manta Ray program is to open a design space for future UUVs that are capable of both long duration missions and large payload capacity. A secondary goal of the program is to advance key technologies that will benefit other naval designs such as low lifecycle cost UUV operations, long duration energy management techniques, biofouling reduction technologies, and long duration navigational enablers. The anticipated transition partner is the Navy.

Title: No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS)* Description: *Previously part of Maritime Missileer, formerly called Disaggregated Strike Group - Surface No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) seeks to develop small, low-cost, disaggregated naval platforms to demonstrate the ability to perform persistent power projection and force application combat missions currently conducted from large, high-value capital ships. The NOMARS program seeks to design a ship that can operate autonomously for long durations at sea, enabling a ship design process that eliminates considerations associated with crew. NOMARS focuses on exploring novel approaches to the design of the seaframe (the ship without mission systems) while accommodating representative payload size, weight, and power. The goal of the program is to demonstrate the feasibility of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) that can operate autonomously for months to years without human intervention, in large numbers, with only periodic, depot-based maintenance. This capability will enable disaggregated persistent USVs, which allows the surface fleet to credibly threaten peer adversaries and negate their investments in high-cost weapon systems designed to counter large naval targets such as aircraft carriers. A successful NOMARS program will prove feasibility of a small unmanned ship with significantly improved reliability and functional performance over current USVs providing a pathway to allow a distributed lethality concept to become viable: small ships, in large numbers, each of which is individually low cost and low value, but in aggregate presents a significant deterrent. FY 2020 Plans: - Begin evaluation of design trade space and initial concept development. - Begin technology exploration activities related to self-health autonomy and other critical subsystem technologies.

Title: Angler Description: The undersea domain has significant importance to national security and military operations. Yet it is a challenging domain in which to operate due to extreme water pressures, restricted communications, ever changing bottom environments, and marine fouling and corrosion. The Angler program seeks to improve U.S. operations in this domain by enabling underwater robotic systems significantly ahead of the state-of-the-art. These robotic systems would be able to search and manipulate objects autonomously, even in dark, turbulent, and semi-opaque sea conditions without the need for human control and without reliance on the Global Positioning System (GPS). Key Angler technical challenges include sensing techniques that provide high-resolution navigation without GPS, perception and manipulation strategies for objects with unknown parameters, long duration autonomy approaches to support mission execution, and autonomy approaches that do not rely on human intervention. This program also has a companion applied research effort budgeted in PE 0602702E, Project TT-03. The anticipated transition is to the Navy.

Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 The Sea Train program will develop and demonstrate connector approaches to couple the vessels, the control laws required to drive the vessel in open ocean conditions, sensor approaches to understand the wave environment to efficiently navigate the vessel, and the autonomy required to connect and disconnect the vessels without human intervention. The goal of this effort is to improve transport efficiency over what can be achieved with current monohull designs. This allows for the efficient transport of smaller vessels into and out of theater, an operation that is normally accomplished today by carrying smaller vessels on board larger vessels or reliance on at-sea refueling of smaller vessels.

Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals. At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk. Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time. The POSYDON program will distribute a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around an ocean basin at known locations. A submarine or AUV will be equipped with an acoustic receiver and appropriate software in order to obtain and maintain location. By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV can determine its range from each source and thus calculate its position. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Navy. FY 2020 Plans: - Transition POSYDON hardware to Navy undersea test bed. - Demonstrate mission planning tool to guide system employment. - Conduct modeling and simulation to demonstrate concept of operations for deep and littoral mission.

Title: Mobile Offboard Command, Control and Attack (MOCCA) Description: The Mobile Offboard Command, Control and Attack (MOCCA) program sought to counter the fourth-generation submarine signature quieting technology that has significantly degraded passive anti-submarine warfare (ASW) sonar detection range and targeting performance. The MOCCA program aimed to nullify submarine signature reduction trends with active sonar projectors deployed from a mobile unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) and cooperatively processed with onboard submarine acoustic receive sonar systems. The off-board UUV sonar projector was planned to operate under positive control at a significant distance from the cooperative submarine using communication links. The program achieved breakthrough capability for novel low probability of intercept/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) communication signaling. The MOCCA communication system was integrated into submarine onboard sonar systems. Communication technologies from this program transitioned to the Navy.1.889 - - Title: Tactical Undersea Network Architecture Description: Systems fighting as a network are vulnerable to a loss of connectivity in a contested environment. This connectivity is important for synchronizing forces, establishing and maintaining situation awareness, and control of remotely operated vehicles and systems. Additionally, undersea systems are challenged to maintain connectivity and must carry their own energy and operate over their design lifetime with little to no maintenance and repair. These factors inhibit their use in collaborative networks and prevent the full exploitation of the potential of undersea systems. The Tactical Undersea Network Architectures program sought to overcome these limitations by developing the technologies necessary for autonomous, reliable, and secure undersea data transfers; true plug, play, and operate standards; and rapid, cost-effective deployment technologies. The program developed and demonstrated novel technology options and designs to restore connectivity temporarily for existing tactical data networks in contested environments using small-diameter optical fiber and buoy relay nodes. The program focused on innovative system architecture designs, lightweight optical fiber technologies, and rapidly deployable buoy node designs and component technologies. The Tactical Undersea Network Architecture program emphasized early risk reduction with scaled at-sea integrated demonstrations of increasing complexity. Program technologies transitioned to the Navy.1.220 - - Title: Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) Description: The Tactical Exploitation of the Acoustic Channel (TEAC) program provided the capability to coherently combine acoustic energy from a distributed network of underwater acoustic sources to improve signal transmission in an undersea environment. The ability to cohere multiple underwater sensors is showing an impact for a number of compelling applications including surveillance, communications, and vehicle positioning. For all of these applications, sensor gain had been achieved by deploying large, costly, and cumbersome cabled arrays. The TEAC program created the opportunity to deploy groups of low unit- cost sources that work cooperatively to focus energy undersea.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment. The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment. Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner. This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: Aerial Dragnet Description: Aerial Dragnet seeks to detect multiple small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in complex and/or urban terrain before they are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of friendly assets. Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons: they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other moving objects. Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use. Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensors mounted on distributed aerial platforms. The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows Aerial Dragnet to detect, track, and classify UAS incursions rapidly, thus enabling multiple defeat options. This program focuses on the development of payloads to be hosted on unmanned aerial platforms, comprising of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation. The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city-sized areas. Aerial Dragnet technologies are expected to transition to the Army, Marine Corps, and Department of Homeland Security.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2019 Title: Dynamically Description: Dominance of the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum is critical to successful U.S. military operations. Radar systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, and communication systems require custom software and hardware that is costly and time- consuming to build and integrate onto platforms. The Dynamically Composed RF Systems program addresses these challenges by developing adaptive, converged RF array systems. This enables enhanced operational capability by dynamically adapting the system for tasks to support radar, communications, and EW in a converged manner. This program will design and develop: (1) a modular architecture for collaborative, agile RF systems; (2) advanced techniques for RF apertures and airframe integration and the associated wide-band agile electronics to support converged missions over those apertures; (3) a heterogeneous signal processing complex implementing hardware-agnostic RF operating modes (the RF Virtual Machine); (4) software tools for the control, coordination, and scheduling of RF functions and payloads at the element level to maximize overall task performance (a System and Sensor Resource Manager (SSRM)). This capability can be adapted to address diverse missions. Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services.

Title: Military Tactical Means (MTM)* Description: *formerly Cross-Domain Multi-Modality Sensing & Targeting The Military Tactical Means (MTM) program will develop sensors and exploitation techniques capable of performing wide-area search to detect high-value targets in order to task engagement systems to close effects-chains. Finding and prosecuting targets with distributed effects-chains requires the ability to detect, track, and maintain custody of targets across sensors with different modalities residing in various domains. Building upon technologies from the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) program, budgeted in this PE/Project, this program will examine both the sensors and the exploitation needed to perform this wide-area search for missions in denied territories and maintain positive chain of custody hand-offs to one or more targeting sensors. The sensors developed under this program will concentrate on sensor modalities that are mostly geometry-invariant and have the potential to be used in highly proliferated systems, such as small satellite constellations and small terrestrial platforms (e.g. class-I or II unmanned aerial system). The exploitation portion of this program will develop algorithms to ensure consistency when passing chain of custody between sensors in different domains with possibly different sensing modalities and will also be designed to increase confidence and accuracy as targets are passed between sensors. Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services and other government agencies. FY 2020 Plans: - Begin development of exploitation algorithms suitable for abstracted target characterization to enable consistent chain of custody. - Begin development of multi-mode sensor modules. - Begin modeling of processing algorithms with emulated and real data. - Begin development of measures of performance (MOP) and measures of effectiveness (MOE).

The NKE program will include EW innovation as a subset of NKE's broader objectives where signal includes electromagnetics and other non-kinetic modes of operation. A new paradigm will be employed in NKE focused on offensive measures, as opposed to the traditional approach that concentrates on protection with attacks that are typically defensive and/or responsive in nature. NKE will develop new technologies as required, but will primarily focus at the system level, where multi-system architectures will be developed. System management and non-kinetic battle assessment technologies will be required to support the multi-mode NKE mission. The NKE systems are applicable to force-on-force conflict, but will also provide new options for conducting hybrid operations at all scales of conflict. Technologies will be transferred to the Services.- - 7.527 Volume 1 - 230 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 14 R-1 Line #59Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

Title: Small Satellite Sensors Description: The Small Satellite Sensors program will develop and space-qualify Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) sensor and inter-satellite communications technologies and establish feasibility for new DoD tactical capabilities to be implemented on small (< 100 kg) satellites. Experimental payloads will be flown on small satellites, and data will be collected to validate new operational concepts. Small satellites provide a low-cost and quick-turnaround capability for testing new technologies and experimental payloads. Operationally, small and low-cost satellites enable the deployment of larger constellations, which can provide greater coverage, persistence, and survivability compared to a small number of more expensive satellites, as well as the possibility for launch-on-demand. This program seeks to leverage rapid progress being made by the commercial sector on small satellite bus technology, as well as investments being made by DoD and industry on low-cost launch and launch-on-demand capabilities for small satellites. The program will focus on developing, demonstrating, and validating key payload technologies needed by DoD that are not currently being developed for commercial space applications.

Instead of relying on passive collection of sensory data, COMPASS will employ active sensing and recommend actions that U.S. Forces and allied partners can take to stimulate the environment and reveal any hostile strategies. To achieve this goal, COMPASS will build and demonstrate tools to: 1) develop a dynamic model of hostile activities in a gray zone environment, 2) assess the decision space to recommend which actions may provide the highest value information, and 3) monitor execution of these actions to assess incremental progress toward reducing the ambiguity of the operating environment and suggest adjustments. COMPASS will transition to the Services. FY 2020 Plans: - Increase complexity of the gray zone environment and improve the effectiveness of the algorithms for action generation. - Expand situational awareness to include social activities such as economic, political, and influence campaigns. - Improve the functionality of the tool to account for adversaries that adapt their behavior. - Conduct experiments and demonstrations for operational users to assess utility and explore transition.

As a corollary to time synchronization, this program also enabled GPS-independent positioning to maintain precise time synchronization between collaborating mobile users. Key attributes of this program are global availability, minimal and low cost infrastructure, anti-jamming capability, and performance equal to or better than GPS, achieved through recent advances in optical clocks and time transfer. Demonstrations on relevant platforms in relevant environments were used to validate the technology. Technologies from this program transitioned to the Navy.4.056 - - Title: Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) Technology Description: Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems provide the capability to detect, identify, and track high value targets from collected sensor data. ATRs have typically been designed for specific sensors and provide only limited, static mission support due to pre-programmed target lists and operating modes. Extending ATR technology to accommodate sensor upgrades or include new emerging targets has been costly and time-consuming. The objective of the ATR Technology program was to develop technologies that reduce operational limitations while also providing significant performance improvements, dramatically reduced development times, and reduced life-cycle maintenance costs. Breakthroughs in deep learning algorithms and embedded computing systems promised dramatic improvements in ATR utility. The program focused on three core areas:1.624 - - Volume 1 - 234 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 13 of 14 R-1 Line #59Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2021 Defense Agency Date: February 2020 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400 / SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.
