We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of long-term vaccine effectiveness. Methods: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Web of Science from December 2019 to November 15, 2021, for studies evaluating the long-term vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmedCOVID-19 or COVID-19 hospitalization among individuals who received 2 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca vaccines,or 1 dose of the Janssen vaccine. Long-term was defined as >5 months after the last dose. We calculated the pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with 95% confidence interval for COVID-19 between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as100%\u00d7(1DOR). Results: In total, 16 studies including 17,939,172 individuals evaluated long-term vaccine effectiveness and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled DOR for COVID-19 was 0.158 (95% CI: 0.157-0.160) with an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 84.2% (95% CI, 84.0- 84.3%). Estimated vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization was 88.7% (95% CI, 55.8% -97.1%). Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 during variant period was 61.2% (95% CI, 59.0% -63.3%). Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization across a long-term period for the circulating variants during the study period. More observational studies are needed to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness of third dose ofa COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccine effectiveness of mixing COVID-19 vaccines, COVID-19 breakthrough infection, and vaccine effectivenessagainst newly emerging variants. (Received 17 December 2021; accepted 21 December 2021) The first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine was authorized for emergency use by the US Food and DrugAdministration on December 11, 2020. 1Over the past several months, research studies have yielded substantial data on short- term ( 3 months) vaccine effectiveness2-4against symptomatic COVID-19. For example, the short-term vaccine effectiveness isknown to be very high at 95% for the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID- 19 vaccine, 94.1% for the Moderna vaccine, 70.4% for theAstraZeneca vaccine, and 66.3% for the Janssen COVID-19 vac- cine. 1,5-7 In the third year of the pandemic, individuals are still at risk of acquiring COVID-19 even with vaccines available.8,9Infection and hospitalization rates among unvaccinated individuals are 5 timesand 11 -29 times higher than those in vaccinated individuals, respectively. 10,11Also, the authorized COVID-19 vaccines protect against the variant,12even with increased community transmission.10,13 Although these vaccines are effective for a wide range of COVID-19 -related outcomes,1,6,14,15the duration of the immuneAuthor for correspondence: Alexandre R.

We reviewed the literature on the long-term vaccine effective- ness of COVID-19 vaccines for COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospi-talizations. Pooling the results of published studies allows for moreprecise estimates of the long-term vaccine effectiveness. The infor-mation provided from subset analyses during the variant period is significantly important given the ongoing pandemic with thisvariant. Methods Systematic literature review and inclusion and exclusion criteria This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)statement 19and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in was registered on Prospero ( September 13, 2021 (registration no. CRD42021278162). The approval ofour institutional review board was not required. The inclusion criteria for studies in this systematic review were as follows: original research manuscripts; published in peer-reviewed scientific journals; involved vaccinated and unvaccinatedindividuals; evaluated the long-term effectiveness of COVID-19vaccine; and observational study design. Long-term was definedas>5 months after the second dose for mRNA (Pfizer/ BioNTech or Moderna) or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, or 1 dose of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. The literature search was lim- ited to December 2019 to November 15, 2021. Editorials, commen-taries, and published studies from non -peer-reviewed sources (eg, MedRxiv) were excluded. Studies without comparison betweenvaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (or other vaccinated con-trol group), and studies without vaccine effectiveness data werealso excluded. Search strategy We performed literature searche s in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Embase (Elsevier Platform),Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus (whichincludes EMBASE abstracts), and Web of Science. The entire search strategy is described in Supplementary Appendix 1.W er e v i e w e dt h e reference lists of retrieved article s to identify studies that were not identified from the preliminary li terature searches. After applying exclusion criteria, we reviewed 55 papers, 17 of which met the inclu-sion criteria and were include d in the systematic literature review (Fig. 1). Data abstraction and quality assessment Titles and abstracts of all articles were screened to assess whether they met inclusion criteria. The reviewers (A.R.M., B.M.T., H.S.,L.M.B., M.A., M.A.A., and T.K.) abstracted data for each article.Reviewers resolved disagreements by consensus. The reviewers abstracted data on study design, population and location, study period (months) and the calendar time, demo-graphic and characteristics of participants, types of COVID-19vaccine, and the date of whole-genome sequencing if available.Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was considered the primaryoutcome to calculate vaccine effectiveness after 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 hospitalization was consideredas a secondary outcome. We collected the hazard ratio (HR), the relative risk (RR), the odds ratio (OR), and vaccine effectivenesswith 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We have also described thestatistical analysis performed per each study to describe the esti-mated COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. Risk of bias was assessed using the Downs and Black scale. 21Reviewers followed all ques- tions from this scale as written except for question 27 (a single itemon the power subscale scored 0 -5), which was changed to a yes or no. Two authors performed component quality analyses inde-pendently, reviewed all inconsistent assessments, and resolveddisagreements by consensus. 22 Statistical analysis To meta-analyze the extracted data, we calculated the pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for COVID-19 or COVID-19 hospi- talization between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 100% \u00d7(1DOR). We per- formed stratified analyses by vaccine PfizerBioNTechCOVID-19 vaccine [2 doses], Janssen COVID-19 vaccine[1 dose]), by COVID-19 status (ie, COVID-19 or COVID-19 hos- pitalization), and by the variant period. 23-33We performed stat- istical analysis using R version 4.1.0 with mada package version 0.5.4.34Analogous to the meta-analysis of the odds ratio methods for the DOR, an estimator of random-effects model following theapproach of DerSimonian and Laird is provided by the mada pack- age. 34For our meta-analysis of estimates of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, we used a bivariate random effects model, adoptinga similar concept of performing the diagnostic accuracy, whichenables simultaneous pooling of sensitivity and specificity withmixed-effect linear modeling while allowing for the trade-offbetween them. 35,36Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated with I2estimation and the Cochran Q statistic test. Results Characteristics of included studies In total, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria23-33,37-42and were included in the final review (Table 1). Almost all of these studies were nonrandomized (16 studies), and of these, 12 were retrospec-tive cohort studies. 23,24,26-28,30-33,37,39,40Also, 1 study was a prospective cohort study29and 3 studies were case -control studies.25,38,42Only 1 study was a randomized clinical trial.41All but 1 of these studies evaluated the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (16 studies).23-26,28-33,37,39-42Of these studies, 13 analyzed the Moderna vaccine23,24,26,28-32,37,39,40,42; 7 studies analyzed the Janssen vaccine,26,27,29,37-39,421 of which evaluated only the Janssen vaccine27; and 3 studies analyzed the AstraZeneca vaccine,31,37,381 of which evaluated mixing COVID-19 vaccines.31 Most of the studies included in our review were conducted in the United States (12 studies)23,24,26-30,33,39-42; 1 study was a multi- center study performed in Europe (assembling data from England,France, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, andSweden) 38; and 1 study was performed in each of these countries: Belgium,37Qatar,25Sweden,31and Portugal.32All studies were per- formed between December 2020 and October 2021.23-33,37-42 Moreover, 10 studies evaluated long-term vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19,25-27,29-31,33,38,40,418 studies evaluated long-term vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19 hospitalizations,23-25,28,31,32,39,42 with 2 studies overlapping.25,31The study duration varied from 5 to 14 months.23-33,37-422 Alexandre R.

Among the 16 studies, 8 studies evaluated the long-term vaccine effectiveness of mRNA or viral vector vaccines for COVID-19hospitalization. 23-25,28,31,32,39,42The estimated long-term vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 was 88.7% (95% CI, 55.8% - 97.1%). In stratified analyses, 6 studies evaluated long-term vaccineeffectiveness for COVID-19 hospitalization with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 23-25,28,39,42and 5 studies with the Moderna vac- cine.23,24,28,39,42The estimated long-term vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19 the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccinewas 85.4% (95% CI, 84.8% -86.0%). The estimated long-term vaccine effectiveness for COVID-19 hospitalization with the Moderna vaccine was 89.8% (95% CI, 89.2% -90.4%). Only 1 study evaluated COVID-19 hospitalization during the variant period with mRNA vaccines. 24This study did not report the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness but reported that the adjusted odds ofCOVID-19 was higher among unvaccinated and previouslyinfected patients compared with fully vaccinated individuals(adjusted odds ratio, 5.49; 95% CI, 2.75 -10.99). 24 The results of meta-analyses were homogeneous for COVID-19 with mRNA or viral vector vaccines (heterogeneity P=.76; I2=0%); studies evaluating individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine alone (heterogeneity P=.55; I2=0%); and studies evaluating individuals vaccinated with mRNA or viral vector vaccinesduring the variant period (heterogeneity P=.50; I 2=0%). Meta-analysis results were also homogeneous for COVID-19 hospitalization (studies evaluating individuals vaccinated withmRNA or viral vector vaccines (heterogeneity P=.67; I 2=0%); and studies evaluating individuals vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine alone (heterogeneity P=.28; I2=20%). However, results were not homogenous for studies of COVID-19 hospitalizationonly evaluating individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTechvaccine alone (heterogeneity P=.07; I 2=51%) or for studies of COVID-19 hospitalization only evaluating individuals vaccinatedwith the Moderna vaccine alone (heterogeneity P=.21; I 2=32%). Discussion This systematic literature review and meta-analysis showed that the long-term of vaccine effectiveness with COVID-19 vaccines(primarily the mRNA vaccines) for COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization were high at 84.2% and 88.7%, respectively.However, the long-term vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19during the -variant -dominant period was lower at 61.2%. These results suggest that 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccinemay lose effectiveness after a few months, and more prospectivestudies are needed to investigate the short- and long-term vaccine effectiveness after the third dose of the COVID-19 vaccines. A growing body of early global research shows that the author- ized COVID-19 vaccines remain highly protective against thedisease 's worst outcomes over time with some exceptions among older and immunocompromised people. 43,44In our systematic literature review, we analyzed only the estimated pooled vaccineeffectiveness for the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and the viral vector COVID-19 vaccines. These are the first COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA and around the world, 45-48and they pre- vent COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization.2,4,10,12,15,49The long duration of the studies (from 5 to 14 months, as shown inTable 1) included in our systematic literature review helps to better elucidate the long-term vaccine effectiveness in the context of a global pandemic with new SARS-CoV-2 variants 12,13and to better understand that the decrease of vaccine effectiveness is associatedwith a waning of humoral immune response after a fewmonths. 13,17Although the overall long-term vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization were moder-ately high ( 80%), a number of published studies demonstrated significantly lower vaccine effectiveness ( 60%) during the -variant period. 25,26,29,30,39,41 Our systematic review included 11 studies evaluating the wide- spread circulation of the variant contributing to the majority of recent COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalizations.23-33The stud- ies in this systematic review antedate the emergence of theB.1.1.529 (omicron) variant announced by the World HealthOrganization (WHO) on November 26, 2021. 50We need more studies on the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VOC) that have multiple spike-protein changes and that may be more infectious orcause more severe disease than other circulating variants. 51Some deletions in the spike-protein gene can alter the shape of the spikeand may help it evade antibodies. 52No COVID-19 vaccine is 100% effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as demonstrated by break-through infections, 8,53but they are highly effective at preventing severe disease and death.25Although the long-term vaccine effec- tiveness was not as high as the short-term vaccine effectiveness, it isnot clear whether the waning of immunity is due to the passage ofTable 2.

Fully vaccinated is defined as receiving 2 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca vaccine, or 1 dose of Janssen vaccine.10 Alexandre R. Marra et al https://doi.org/10.1017/ash.2021.261 Published online by Cambridge University Presstime or the coincident spread of the variant (from June to September 2021).23-33 Our study had several limitations. Most of the studies included in the meta-analysis were observational studies, which are subjectto multiple biases. 54However, this is the most common study design in the infection prevention literature.54None of the included studies reported possible adverse events after vaccineadministration. We could not perform further analyses stratifiedby immunocompromised status due to the limited number of stud-ies. Only 1 study compared immunocompromised individuals toimmunocompetent individuals and reported that the effectivenessof mRNA vaccination against COVID-19 hospitalization thanamong immunocompetent individuals (90%). 28Because our study focused on the long-term vaccine effectiveness after the seconddose, we could not evaluate the impact of a third dose. Becauseof the low number of included studies of viral vector vaccines, itwas not possible to perform a stratified analysis for these. It wasnot possible to evaluate the long-term vaccine effectiveness ofthe Moderna vaccine against COVID-19 because there were notenough studies. 26,30There are not enough studies comparing each 1 of the 2 mRNA vaccines to draw conclusions about the vaccineeffectiveness for COVID-19 during the variant dominant period. 25,30Also, it was not possible to evaluate the COVID-19 hos- pitalization vaccine effectiveness during the -variant -dominant period. It was not possible to make any conclusions about the long-term vaccine effectiveness of mixing vaccines because just1 study assessed this. 31From that study, mixing COVID-19 vac- cines (first dose with the AstraZeneca vaccine adding a mRNAprime-boost showed a higher vaccine effectiveness (68%) than thatof 2 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine (50%). 31Lastly, each study used a different approach to report the incidence of COVID-19 (eg, inci-dence rate per person years). Therefore, we decided to perform ourmeta-analysis and stratified analysis with a bivariate approach topreserve the 2-dimensional nature of the original data from theselected studies. 23-33,38-42 In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccines can effectively prevent COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization for a relatively longperiod. These vaccines are also effective in preventing COVID-19 during the -variant period, though vaccines were less effective. These data are very important to help motivate individuals to seekvaccination. More observational studies are needed to evaluateother types of COVID-19 vaccine (eg, viral vector or inactivatedvirus) effectiveness, vaccine effectiveness of a third dose, vaccineeffectiveness of mixing COVID-19 vaccines, COVID-19 break-through infection after vaccination, and genomic surveillancefor better understanding vaccine effectiveness against the new viralvariants.
