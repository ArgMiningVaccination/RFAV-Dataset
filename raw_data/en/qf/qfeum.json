These toxins can be a simple as the things we eat and drink, like processed foods, dyes, sugars, and alcohol; to the things we are exposed to in our environment. Over time, there is a buildup of toxins in our body that eventually will affect the body processes and deteriorate our health. Symptoms of a body that needs to detox include achy joints or muscles, fatigue, brain fog, and headaches. More serious symptoms that may arise include autoimmune diseases, increased acne, irritable bowel, acid reflux, and many more. In order to rid your body of these toxins that have built over a period of time, one needs to detox. Now, this doesn't mean it needs to be extreme, it just means that you stop putting bad things in your body and replace them with the good. Detoxing is hard, so following a program that is already established with clear guidelines and supplementation to help with the detox process would be most beneficial. Good detox programs will eliminate all forms of sugar, artificial sweeteners, flour, trans and hydrogenated fats, MSG, caffeine, and alcohol. Theses items are replaced with real, whole, and fresh foods, protein, and healthy fats. Supplementation is often utilized with a meal plan to help the body eliminate built up toxins more efficiently, and give body the extra support it needs while detoxing. Benefits of detoxing include feeling better, having more energy, feeling sharper with the mind, and having more restful sleep. Loosing weight is also typical with detoxing. Cravings for sugar and complex carbs, and the need for caffeine decrease. Detoxing is a good way to jump start a new lifestyle to start making better food choices long-term rather than in the short-term. Once the detox is complete, the introduction of foods that were restricted during the detox may help discover food sensitivities that were otherwise unknown. Before starting a detox, make sure to talk to a medical professional first, as some diseases or conditions and certain medications need to be taken into consideration.
