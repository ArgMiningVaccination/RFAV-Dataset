A spell could consist of ritual action, a set of words,", "sitename": "Fandom, Inc.", "date": "2023-09-06", "cleaned_text": "even more powerful... the |[Bonnie](/wiki/Bonnie_Bennett)about spells in [Monster's Ball](/wiki/Monster%27s_Ball) One of the defining characteristics of a [witch](/wiki/Witch) is their ability to [cast spells](/wiki/Witchcraft#Spell_Casting); a \"spell\" being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a [magical action](/wiki/Witchcraft). A spell could consist of ritual action, a set of words, a verse, or any combination of these, many of which are archived in books known as [Grimoires](/wiki/Grimoire). Spells are bound by [Nature](/wiki/Nature) and can range from simple to complex, depending on the need of the casting witch. Nature demands balance and as such, every spell has a loophole, no matter what magic is used to cast the spell. The majority of spells used by practitioners of [Traditional](/wiki/Traditional_Magic) and [Spirit Magic](/wiki/Spirit_Magic) are spoken in an ancient [language](/wiki/Character_languages#Spell_Language) very similar to Latin. However, witches who practice other forms of magic have been known to use spells in different languages; for example, the Nine Covens of New Orleans, which practices [Ancestral Magic](/wiki/Ancestral_Magic), performs their spells in [French or French Creole](/wiki/Character_languages#French), while [the Travelers](/wiki/The_Travelers), practicing [Traveler Magic](/wiki/Traveler_Magic), typically perform their spells in a language similar to [Czech](/wiki/Character_languages#Czech). [Dahlia](/wiki/Dahlia) and [Freya Mikaelson](/wiki/Freya_Mikaelson) perform spells using a yet to be identified ancient magic in [Old Norse](/wiki/Character_languages#Old_Norse), similar to modern-day Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese, Danish and Swedish with some Serbian/Croatian words in between. [Cleo Sowande](/wiki/Cleo_Sowande), however, has performed a number of black magic spells in [Yoruba](/wiki/Character_languages#Yoruba). Despite the language that spells are performed in, syllables and phonetics of spells are important and, when performed wrong, can cause spells to not work as intended or not at all. Biological Spells[ ] Biological spells allow witches to affect the organic tissue of a living being by changing the state of a body and its natural processes. Although it is most commonly used for healing, other spells can be used to paralyze the body or preserve the recently deceased. Under extremely rare circumstances, it can be utilized to rapidly advance the age or completely alter the state of life. - Pain Reduction Spell: A spell that can be used to reduce the physical pain of another person. While the pain diminishes, the spell, however, does not have any real healing properties. - Incantation: Asinta Mulaf Hinto, Sho Bala. - Used by: In [Masquerade](/wiki/Masquerade), Bonnie Bennett performed this spell on Elena, to reduce the pain of the injuries the latter suffered because of the spell that linked her to her doppelg\u00e4nger, Katherine. - Healing Spell: Typically an advanced spell that is used to heal the injuries and recover from non-fatal wounds. Such spells are capable of healing injuries at different proficiency levels, speed, and effectiveness. For some, the tedious nature of such spells takes years to learn. - Incantation: Unknown - Used by: In [The Return](/wiki/The_Return), Damon states that [Emily](/wiki/Emily_Bennett)practiced healing spells although it took her years to learn to use them. In [Pictures of You](/wiki/Pictures_of_You), Bonnie, using Expression, rapidly recovered from Elena's vampire's bite; her wound healed within seconds. Similarly, in [The Walking Dead](/wiki/The_Walking_Dead), she was burned on her face after Elena attacked Katherine, who she was linked to. After Bonnie unlinked herself from Katherine, she recovered near instantly. In [Sanctuary](/wiki/Sanctuary), [Freya](/wiki/Freya_Mikaelson)showed her penchant for healing spells with Rebekah who was possessing the witch body of [Eva Sinclair](/wiki/Eva_Sinclair). Freya healed her broken hand after saving her [the Kindred](/wiki/The_Kindred). Uniquelly, in [I Love You, Goodbye](/wiki/I_Love_You,_Goodbye)and [Ashes to Ashes](/wiki/Ashes_to_Ashes), she used a similar spell to completely restore the corpses of Vincent Griffith and Eva, respectively, so that she could place Finn and Rebekah's spirits back into their vessels. Finn's spirit, and subsequently Vincent's, was spared from death by [Freya's talisman](/wiki/Freya%27s_Talisman)despite Vincent's body having been severely burned and charred in an explosion while Rebekah had stabbed her vessel in the throat so that her spirit would return to her Original vampire body. In both instances, Freya was able to restore the bodies of both individuals so that possession was possible. In [Night Has A Thousand Eyes](/wiki/Night_Has_A_Thousand_Eyes), Dahlia performed a similar spell on the then Regent, Josephine LaRue. Dahlia simply blew onto her hands, breaking the curse that her mother cast that ultimately crippled her hands, making them swollen and arthritic. In [Haunter of Ruins](/wiki/Haunter_of_Ruins), Hope healed the broken wing of a butterfly after having removed the [bracelet](/wiki/Hope%27s_Bracelet)that suppressed her magic. Hayley also mentions that she knew of Hope's tendencies to heal injured fireflies. In [Goodbyes Sure Do Suck](/wiki/Goodbyes_Sure_Do_Suck), as Rafael began dying after the Necromancer severed his connections with his former acolytes, the witches of the Salvatore school magic began various magical analyses and healing spells to save Rafael. Though spells, however, did not did not work as intended. In [Follow the Sound of My Voice](/wiki/Follow_the_Sound_of_My_Voice), Ben, having recovered from his death at Aurora's hands, believes he was healed by Cleo with her spells. However, she informs him that he healed on his own. She tried to heal him, but it hurts when she tries to perform magic now. Whatever Aurora did in her subconscious, she fears, has damaged her in a way she doesn't understand yet. - Paralysis Spell: A spell used to paralyze a target's body, including even those of vampires, which has the effect of preventing them from moving at all. - Incantation: Unknown - Used by: In [Disturbing Behavior](/wiki/Disturbing_Behavior), Gloria performed this spell on Stefan Salvatore to prevent him from moving so that she could extract information from him about Elena, whom she saw in a vision with Esther's Talisman. - Preservation Spell: A powerful spell that allows a witch to preserve their own or the body of another being. Such a spell protects the deceased's body from any form of decay indefinitely. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Unknown - Used by: In [Dangerous Liaisons](/wiki/Dangerous_Liaisons), [Esther](/wiki/Esther_Mikaelson)tells Elena that the witch [Ayana](/wiki/Ayana)performed this spell on her at the point of the latter's death so that she may one day return to her body and undo the vampire plague she created. In [Live Through This](/wiki/Live_Through_This), it was revealed that a similar spell was used on Julian's body. Presumably cast by the Heretics, they hoped to one day reunite his trapped spirit, within the phoenix stone, with his body. - Sleeping Beauty Spell: A spell that allows a witch to induce a mystical coma onto a target whose waking time is tied to another's death. The target's body is kept at perfect health and preserved until they wake up. The spell ensured that with the caster's death, became irreversible and that should the spell be tampered with, as to exploit a loophole, both linked targets shall die. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Target, Blood of linked individual - Used by: In [I'm Thinking Of You All The While](/wiki/I%27m_Thinking_Of_You_All_The_While), Kai performed this spell, which was suggested by Lily Salvatore; sending Elena into a preserved sleep, linking both her life and that of Bonnie's. So long as Bonnie was alive, Elena would stay asleep. Kai wanted, in part, to make Damon suffer by making him choose between his best friend and his girlfriend. - Blood Gathering Spell: A simple spell that enables a witch to telekinetically gather and collect the blood of a specific target to one point, whether it is the witch's blood or that of Incantation: Unknown - Vincent's Target's blood - Used by: In [From a Cradle to a Grave](/wiki/From_a_Cradle_to_a_Grave), Davina used this spell to gather what was left of Klaus' blood that splattered on a car not too far from the Abattoir. She did this in an attempt to save as many vampires as she can from the poison of the werewolf bite, but what she collected was only enough for a single vampire, who was given to Josh. In [Heart Shaped Box](/wiki/Heart_Shaped_Box), Finn, to save his sister's life, used his magic, while trapped within her pendant, to draw the blood from her wound upwards through the coffin and the ground so that she could be detected by Klaus. In [No More Heartbreaks](/wiki/No_More_Heartbreaks), Vincent performs a similar spell to collect what remains of Lucien's blood in an attempt to heal the poisoned Cami. - Fertility Spell: An unknown ritual related to fertility. - Incantation: In Unum Edito, Dominus In [Wheel Inside the Wheel](/wiki/Wheel_Inside_the_Wheel), Dahlia performed this unknown spell over a fire in her cottage while she was holding her necklace. - Metamorphosis Spell: An extremely rare and unique spell that can only be accomplished with comparable magical strength. At the most complex form of this spell, complete transmogrification can be performed. This is considered the most advanced form of all biologically-related spells. - Incantation: Non-verbal - Requirements: Extremely powerful and advanced magic - Used by: To date, this spell has only been accomplished twice, in two variations, with the latter at the most complex stage. The witch that performed the magic to accomplish such feats was Freya while she was linked to Dahlia through her unique form of connective magic and while her magic was augmented through Dahlia's immortality slumber spell. In [The Devil is Damned](/wiki/The_Devil_is_Damned), Freya accelerated the growth of a caterpillar causing it to undergo complete metamorphosis into a butterfly in mere seconds. In [Exquisite Corpse](/wiki/Exquisite_Corpse), at the most complex level seen, Freya transmogrified or completely altered the form of the former witch Lenore, who was possessed by Esther, into a flock of starlings. Once altered the birds continued to live on and fly away for a few seconds, then each began to die one by one. Whether the death of the starlings was caused by Freya or through the transmogrification process, it remains to be seen. With the body destroyed in the process, Lenore was unable to be consecrated while Esther's spirit returned to the Ancestral plane. To date, no other witch has been able to perform such spells including Freya, as Dahlia's connective magic and magical augmentations have been removed. In [I Thought You'd Be Happier To See Me](/wiki/I_Thought_You%27d_Be_Happier_To_See_Me), Lizzie and Josie travel through Alaric's memories. On their eleventh birthday, Josie remembers that Hope, who wasn't invited, turned their cake filling into worms and Lizzie retaliated with a Motus spell. Hope tried to Incendia Lizzie's dress though Josie put up a shield spell and it deflected her spell and set their presents on fire - Corruption Detection Spell: A spell that allows a witch to test for magic infused in a target's body. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Blood of the Target - Used by: In [Behind the Black Horizon](/wiki/Behind_the_Black_Horizon), Davina, fearing for Kol, performed this spell on his blood and found that the Ancestors corrupted her resurrection spell and infused him with their magic. - Substance Concentration Spell: A spell that allows the casting witch to concentrate a substance, in this case, the Beast Serum, to a localized point within a biological system, specifically, Aurora's heart. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Target - Used by: In [Where Nothing Stays Buried](/wiki/Where_Nothing_Stays_Buried), Vincent performed this spell on Aurora to concentrate the Beast serum into her heart. Once localized, he'd be able to extract the serum from her. He also claimed that for the spell to work it would take a \"little while\", at least less than a day, to concentrate the serum. Eventually, he was successful in removing the serum from Aurora, only in turn to give it to Marcel, who became the Beast of prophecy. - Sleeping Beauty Reversal Spell: A direct reversal spell to break the mystically induced coma and life-link between two individuals without triggering the curse's secondary effect; to immediately cause death to the linked individuals. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Linked Target(s), Various Herbs, Candles, Grimoires - Used by: In [I Was Feeling Epic](/wiki/I_Was_Feeling_Epic), Bonnie broke Kai's sleeping spell by reverse engineering his original spell and woke Elena from her mystical slumber. Bonnie admits it took some time to break the spell, though the exact explanation as to how she circumvented the original spell's \"loophole-free\" nature and not to cause instant death to her or Elena, is unknown. - Confirmation Spell: A spell that utilizes blood of a target to confirm whether or not if other individuals are linked to them. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Blood of the Target - Used by: In [Gather Up the Killers](/wiki/Gather_Up_the_Killers), Marcel asked Vincent to confirm whether or not Elijah had died since his sireline had not been killed off. Upon doing so, he confirmed that Elijah and his siblings were anchored to Klaus' life. - Beast Anti-Venom Spell: A direct cure to the lethal strain of engineered werewolf venom that was included in the magical concoction to create the Beast's enhanced bite. - Incantation: La candidat au somme la toxique cantus - Requirements: The Seven individual strains of Werewolf venom, five dark objects, chalk seven-pointed star, seven candles, linked target's blood - Instructions: A seven-pointed star is drawn on the ground and seven candles are placed just within each point of the star. Each of the seven strains of werewolf venom is placed at each point outside of the star. The witch infuses the linked target's blood with their magic, of which she amplifies by using unknown dark objects. - Used by: In [Gather Up the Killers](/wiki/Gather_Up_the_Killers), Freya reversed engineered a cure by combining the seven strains of werewolf toxin and Klaus' blood into a mystical anti-venom to rub over the bites of Elijah and Kol. With all of the ingredients, she had enough for a small bowl of anti-venom; a single dose, each, and no more. - Liquid Gathering Spell: A spell that allows the casting witch to gather and concentrate a liquid, such as tears, into a small vial. - Incantation: Les lames colligo. Ad me gluttuli. - Requirements: Target liquid - Used by: In [Til the Day I Die](/wiki/Til_the_Day_I_Die), Davina performed this spell to collect Hope's tears as an ingredient to another spell. - Lineage Spell: A spell that tests the blood to determine whether magic is present in any form. Variations in this spell reveal ancestors. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Target's blood - Used by: In [Malivore](/wiki/Malivore_(Episode)), Emma left this spell with Hope so that she could perform the spell on Landon to determine if he was supernatural in some way. After performing the spell, she concludes that Landon has zero magic in his bloodline. Emma points out that most humans have at least some trace of magical blood in their veins from a far-flung ancestor, but by all accounts of Alaric's tests, Landon does not. In [This Christmas Was Surprisingly Violent](/wiki/This_Christmas_Was_Surprisingly_Violent), Landon reveals that he had Josie perform a lineage spell on Rafael while he was trapped in wolf-form. He wanted to see if he had any ancestors who might know how to turn him back into his human form. - Ailment Resistance Spell: A spell that directly affects the constitution of the casting witch, enabling them to resist certain physical ailments. - Incantation: Resistus maledi. - Requirements: None - Used by: In [There's a Mummy on Main Street](/wiki/There%27s_a_Mummy_on_Main_Street), Josie, Lizzie, and Hope confronted a mummy. The mummy attacked first with a plague of hornets but the witches cast a bubble boundary spell to protect themselves. The mummy retaliated with another attack to cause Hope and Lizzie to vomit up beetles, effectively incapacitating the two and preventing them from casting more spells. Josie, however, was quick on her feet and performed this spell to resist the mummy's 'curse' and remained unaffected, allowing her to defeat the mummy with a fire spell. - Heartbeat Control Spell: A spell that allows the casting witch to control the rate of another person's heartbeat, as to keep them calm. Other variations of the spell can help one to regular their breath or to completely stop the heart altogether. - Emma's First Incantation: Used by: In [The Boy Who Still Has a Lot of Good to Do](/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Still_Has_a_Lot_of_Good_to_Do), Emma performed this first spell on Rafael, who was experiencing \"lunar psychosis\", to keep him calm. She indicated that Rafael's mind was in flux, between his wolf and human state, which made it difficult to access his memories due to a premature revision back into his human form. What Rafael needed most was for his mind to be surrounded by things that are familiar to him and connect him to his humanity and not his lycanthropy. Emma performed this second spell while placing her hand over his heart which caused him to take a deep, calming breath. In [We All Knew This Day Was Coming](/wiki/We_All_Knew_This_Day_Was_Coming), Freya performed this spell on Hope to stop her heart as she decided to become a tribrid to stop Malivore. The spell was rather peaceful and not sudden cardiac arrest. - Strength Augmentation Spell: A spell that allows the casting witch to alter the strength of another person. - Incantation: Viribus. - Requirements: Target - Used by: In [You Remind Me of Someone I Used to Know](/wiki/You_Remind_Me_of_Someone_I_Used_to_Know), Josie siphoned magic from Landon and performed this spell on him to help him with his self-confidence before they stated their annual charity football game. Questioning what she had done, Josie hands him a football and has him see for himself. He throws the ball clear across the field and strikes the Mystic Fall High School bus, cracking the glass panels of the door. - Pigmentation Spell: A spell that changes the pigmentation of one's skin. - Incantation: Pellis tinctura. - Requirements: Target - Used by: In [This is Why We Don't Entrust Plans to Muppet Babies](/wiki/This_is_Why_We_Don%27t_Entrust_Plans_to_Muppet_Babies), a young [Alyssa Chang](/wiki/Alyssa_Chang)turned Lizzie and Josie's skin pastel purple when they wouldn't give her a flower that Caroline gave them. - Moratorium Spell: A spell that alters the perception of time while delaying one's activities, so that the targets will move in slow motion. - Incantation: Morator - Requirements: Target(s) - Used by: In [What Problem?](/wiki/What_Cupid_Problem%3F), Alyssa performed this spell on MG and Kaleb, seemingly and effectively slowing them down in time to make them move in slow motion. This spell was enough to defy physics as when MG jumped the banister railings, he did so in slow motion. The spell was stopped when Kym knocked Alyssa unconscious. - Humanity Spell: A spell that restores a vampire's humanity, should they have switched it off. - Incantation: Non-verbal - Requirements: Vampire - Save Them All](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Save_Them_All), Josie, corrupted by dark magic, forcefully restores Jade's humanity. In [Someplace Far Away From All This Violence](/wiki/Someplace_Far_Away_From_All_This_Violence), Dark Josie seemingly performed this spell over Hope claiming it would switch her humanity back on. While Hope told her the spell didn't work, Josie already figured it wouldn't because she didn't have that kind of power as she's a fully activated tribrid now. She claimed she wanted to see what happened when she snapped her fingers and see if she could see fear in her eyes. - Echolocation Spell: A spell that materializes the voice into a ball of sound and radiates outward. Once the sound has come into contact with another object, it will reverberate and emit a call out to the casting witch. - Incantation: Ohun. Pada. - Requirements: None - Used by: In [We All Knew This Day Was Coming](/wiki/We_All_Knew_This_Day_Was_Coming), Cleo performed this spell to help her locate a door out of the darkness. The spell led her to the Necromancer's prison of the Ice Dream Palace. - Blood Weapon Creation Spell: A spell that uses hardened blood to form a glass-like weapon. - Incantation: Vitris. - Requirements: Blood - Used by: In [See You On The Other Side](/wiki/See_You_On_The_Other_Side), Hope performed his spell after biting into her forearm to form her flowing tribrid blood into a hardened weapon capable of slaying Malivore. After retreating within his vessel, Landon encouraged her to end Malivore. As they shared a kiss goodbye, she plunged the sword into his chest. Her tribrid blood was consumed in flames as it destroyed Malivore and his darkness. - Ash Gathering Spell: A spell that enables a witch to telekinetically gather and collect the ashen remains of an Original vampire. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Ashes - Used by: In [Everything That Can Be Lost May Also Be Found](/wiki/Everything_That_Can_Be_Lost_May_Also_Be_Found), Rebekah and Freya explain to Hope that for the past three years they've been all over New Orleans using magic to collect Klaus' remains to hold his funeral. Boundary and Sealing Spells[ ] Boundary spells allow witches to erect invisible barriers surrounding a set space for a set amount of time, preventing beings from entering or leaving the said location. However, they do not affect inanimate objects. Several Boundary Spells are tied to astrological events such as lunar or solar phases. Sealing spells are a more potent form of boundary spells, especially when coupled with the casting witch's blood. When this is done, the spells are nearly impossible to break unless they are from the same bloodline. - Tomb Sealing Spell: A powerful spell used to entrap vampires within a certain area. Furthermore, the spell would seal the door to prevent anyone from opening the door to the tomb. - Requirements: [Emily's Talisman](/wiki/Bennett_Talisman), a Comet (original); two descendant witches, Pentagram, 5 Torches - Used by: On September 25, 1864, [Emily Bennett](/wiki/Emily_Bennett)performed this spell upon Fell's church to save the tomb vampires from burning. In [History Repeating](/wiki/History_Repeating), Damon revealed this information to Stefan, telling him that Katherine and the other vampires had been spared. In [Fool Me Once](/wiki/Fool_Me_Once), Sheila and Bonnie Bennett performed this spell to both lower and raise the seal that bound vampires to the tomb. Given the powerful nature of the spell, it proved to be exhausting to perform and Sheila claimed there was no guarantee that they could get the spell back up again after they lowered it. While the vampires did escape the tomb, it was later proven in [Masquerade](/wiki/Masquerade)that they were, in fact, able to raise the seal that was capable of binding vampires within the tomb. However, it should be noted that the spell was considerably weakened as it would allow vampires to enter. Unlike Emily's original spell, this spell was also performed without the aid of a comet. - Requirements: - Tomb Sealing Counter Spell: A spell that can reverse the effects of the Tomb Spell. When performing the spell, the boundary can be lowered. In doing so, it can allow vampires to enter, but not leave. With enough magic, the seal can be lifted, breaking the boundary completely allowing vampires to enter and leave freely. - Incantation: Phasmatos Salves Nas Ex Malon, Terra Mora Vasa Quo Ero Signos. - Requirements: Pentagram drawn on the ground, Four torches representing Earth, Air, Fire, Water, A bottle of water; A full moon, - Used by: In [Fool Me Once](/wiki/Fool_Me_Once), Sheila and Bonnie Bennett performed this spell to \"open\" the tomb since the [Bennett Talisman](/wiki/Bennett_Talisman), the tomb's \"key\", was destroyed. The original spell was impossible to break unless one knew exactly how it was created 145 years prior by Emily Bennett. This proved true as Sheila stated that opening the door didn't remove the seal that bound vampires within the tomb. However, as descendants of Emily, she and Bonnie were able to use this spell to lower and temporarily remove the seal though it proved to be an exhausting and powerful spell to put the seal back up. In [Rose](/wiki/Rose_(Episode)), Bonnie confirmed that it took both Sheila and herself to undo Emily's spell. Despite this, and the weakened spell freeing the tomb vampires, over time the spell remained intact after Sheila and Bonnie resealed the tomb. This proved to be true in [Masquerade](/wiki/Masquerade)when Stefan and Damon used the tomb to imprison Katherine. After Jeremy was taken hostage by Katherine in the tomb after a failed attempt to retrieve the moonstone, Bonnie attempted to perform this spell again in [The Sacrifice](/wiki/The_Sacrifice). To have enough power to perform the spell, she channeled Luka Martin. However, after Luka started to suffer from Bonnie's spell, Jonas broke her connection to his son, preventing Bonnie from lowering the seal. In [By the Light of the Moon](/wiki/By_the_Light_of_the_Moon), Elijah and Elena reached a peaceful agreement to which she requested Stefan's release from the tomb. Elijah tasked Jonas with lifting the spell. At the time, as a more skilled witch than Bonnie, he and Luka both channeled the full moon and they were able to lift the seal, a full day after Bonnie's attempt. However, it should be noted that the original spell had been greatly weakened as this was the third attempt at lowering the spell. Furthermore, it currently remains unknown whether or not the original spell remains in effect as direct descendants of Emily could not completely remove the spell, even though the Martin witches were able to lift the spell to release Stefan. - Bennett Sealing Spell: A unique spell of the Bennett witch bloodline that utilizes their magic (or blood) to make a potent sealing spell near impossible to break without the specific ingredients. - Incantation: Phasmatos veras nos ex malom. vasa quo errum signos - Requirements: A Bennett Witch - Used by: In [Masquerade](/wiki/Masquerade), Bonnie Bennett cast this spell on a room in the Lockwood Mansion that would trap Katherine, Stefan, and Damon so that none of the guests are aware of the fight to kill her. She later adapted the spell again to prevent humans, Elena and Alaric, from leaving the location in [By the Light of the Moon](/wiki/By_the_Light_of_the_Moon)and [The Sun Also Rises](/wiki/The_Sun_Also_Rises), respectively. In [Bringing Out The Dead](/wiki/Bringing_Out_The_Dead), it is revealed that [Abby Bennett Wilson](/wiki/Abby_Bennett_Wilson)performed this, or a similar spell on Mikael's tomb after desiccating him. It is unknown how the spell was lifted for Katherine to locate and free Mikael. In [Graduation](/wiki/Graduation_(Episode)), Bonnie sealed the boiler room under the High School to prevent Kol, recently released Ghost from the Other Side while the veil was down, from stopping her from putting the veil back up. In [I'm Thinking Of You All The While](/wiki/I%27m_Thinking_Of_You_All_The_While)Bonnie performed this spell on the Salvatore crypt, which housed Elena's coffin so that her body would be protected from vampires seeking the cure. This spell was destroyed when the Heretics siphoned away the spell. In [Somebody That I Used to Know](/wiki/Somebody_That_I_Used_to_Know), it is revealed that Virginia had [Lucy Bennett](/wiki/Lucy_Bennett)perform the same spell on the [The Armory](/wiki/The_Armory)'s Vault, sealing it shut so that no other witch except a Bennett could unseal. In [Kill 'Em All](/wiki/Kill_%27Em_All), Bonnie, after unsealing the vault, performed this spell on the Armory itself, sealing the entire building, so that whatever was released from the vault could not escape. The spell was later siphoned away by Lizzie and Josie. Note: In all known uses, the incantation was only ever performed on screen once, performed by Bonnie in [Kill 'Em All](/wiki/Kill_%27Em_All). - Bennett Unsealing Spell: A direct counterspell to undo the Bennett Sealing spell, of which only a Bennett witch is capable of performing. - Incantation: Terra Mora Vantis Quo Incandis, Terra Mora Quo - Requirements: Bennett Witch - Used by: In [Masquerade](/wiki/Masquerade), Lucy Bennett cast this or a variant counterspell to remove Bonnie's boundary spell in the Lockwood Mansion. In [Kill 'Em All](/wiki/Kill_%27Em_All), Bonnie performed this spell on the Armory's Vault, opening it for Alex. - Unsealing Spell: A spell that enables an enchanted door, or something that has been magically sealed, to open. - Town](/wiki/Our_Town)and [The Ties That Bind](/wiki/The_Ties_That_Bind), respectively, Bonnie Bennett performed these spells upon Esther's magically sealed coffin to try and unseal them, though the spells failed. In [Bag of Cobras](/wiki/Bag_of_Cobras), Freya used a non-verbal form of this spell to unseal a storage unit that contained stuff from Hayley's childhood and parents. - Doorway Sealing Spell: A spell used to lock and seal the doors of a room. - Davina's Incantation: Unknown - Bonnie's and Kicking](/wiki/Alive_and_Kicking), Davina kept Mikael locked away in the attic of [St. Anne's Church](/wiki/St._Anne%27s_Church)locked behind what Kol described as a rather complex spell. No one could enter nor could Mikael leave unless Davina summoned him with the Bracelet of Obedience. Once he was summoned, the spell that locked him within would be undone and the door would open, allowing entry to others. In [Live Through This](/wiki/Live_Through_This), Bonnie Bennett used this spell to seal a doorway when she and Enzo were running from Oscar. It is also possible that she used the same spell to seal the Salvatore Crypt in which Elena's body was placed. Both spells were eventually siphoned away. In [Death Keeps Knocking On My Door](/wiki/Death_Keeps_Knocking_On_My_Door), Hope, upset with Alaric, performed this spell to lock him inside his office so that she could confront the Necromancer. In [We're Gonna Need A Spotlight](/wiki/We%27re_Gonna_Need_A_Spotlight), Hope performed her second incantation on the Salvatore school's auditorium doors when the mind-controlling slugs infected the majority of the students and began to chase after her and Landon. She stated that the spell would hold the 'pod people' for now and when the temporary effects of the spell began to wear off, Emma reinforced the spell with the added chains that Dorian applied to hold back the infected students. In [This is Why We Don't Entrust Plans to Muppet Babies](/wiki/This_is_Why_We_Don%27t_Entrust_Plans_to_Muppet_Babies), Alyssa spelled the doorknob to \"do not disturb\" so she could make out with Jed. In [We All Knew This Day Was Coming](/wiki/We_All_Knew_This_Day_Was_Coming), this is one of the spells that Dorian listed in preparation for the Merge. He believed that if that day ever came, Alaric wouldn't be thinking straight and he'd be fighting until the last second to try and save them. - Room Isolation Spell: A minor boundary spell to seal a room. The spell erects an invisible barrier to prevent specified targets from leaving or to enable certain ones to enter. - Incantation: Unknown - Freya's Incantation: Apn\u00e9 s\u00e0 mene - Used Liv Parker a similar spell, in [While You Were Sleeping](/wiki/While_You_Were_Sleeping)and [The Day I Tried To Live](/wiki/The_Day_I_Tried_To_Live), so that Elena could not feed on innocents and again so that Damon and Elena could not stop her from taking revenge on Kai, respectively. Nora performed a similar spell within the Salvatore house to prevent Caroline from leaving the room they tortured her in. She would later give the spell 'slack' telling Caroline that she could use some space to stretch her legs, in [Never Let Me Go](/wiki/Never_Let_Me_Go). While the previous spells have been used to entrap vampires specifically, it is not exclusive. In [I Was Feeling Epic](/wiki/I_Was_Feeling_Epic), Katherine reveals that Kai Parker was kind enough to set that trap, crafting the spell to prevent Elena, a human, from leaving the boiler room. The spell, however, was bound specifically to Elena as Stefan, the recently cured vampire, could come and go as he pleased. Katherine also mentions that Kai could not reverse the spell as he was permanently indisposed (trapped in his new prison world). It is likely, however, that Bonnie broke his spell and freed Elena. In [Voodoo Child](/wiki/Voodoo_Child)Freya, using sage, performed her spell on a room in the Abattoir so that Keelin would be safe from the Hollow. Freya claimed that the spell would only allow her entry into the room. In [The Feast of All Sinners](/wiki/The_Feast_of_All_Sinners), Dominic performed this spell within St. Anne's Church, restricting Marcel and Sofya's advances towards him and his master, the Hollow. After they spoke, coming to a truce, he released the spell and allowed them to come forth so that he could bow to the Hollow, who was still possessing Hope. In [All's Well That Ends Well](/wiki/All%27s_Well_That_Ends_Well), Hope spelled Landon within his room to protect him from what the banshee claimed would happen; that he would die if Cleo stayed at the school. In [I Was Made To Love You](/wiki/I_Was_Made_To_Love_You), Hope cast a spell to keep Landon sealed away in the [Old Mill](/wiki/Old_Mill)to figure out who or what he was. When he attempted to pass the threshold, the barrier reacted to him and Hope admitted that it only works on supernatural creatures. After he reacted to her blood, she reversed the spell and came to his aid, though believed he was a vessel to Malivore. Asking Cleo to go get Alaric, Cleo enacted another barrier to enclose her and \"Landon\" within the [Old Mill](/wiki/Old_Mill). \"Landon\" was actually a golem of Cleo's creation in her attempt to force Hope into activating her vampire potential. Cleo would also perform this spell on Alaric's office, sealing him and the amnestic Necromancer within. In [We All Knew This Day Was Coming](/wiki/We_All_Knew_This_Day_Was_Coming), this is one of the spells that Dorian listed in preparation for the Merge. He believed that if that day ever came, Alaric wouldn't be thinking straight and he'd be fighting until the last second to try and save them. - Fire Boundary Spell: The spell allows the witch to trap individuals within a circle of fire.

Given that Klaus was able to inscribe the events of his Mother's murder upon its walls, an unknown witch cast the spell over the cave sometime after the death of 'The Original Witch', Esther. Later, based on Esther's knowledge of the spell, it can be assumed it was cast by her mentor, Ayana, as she was the only other known witch of her village. Furthermore, Esther's possession spell, a witch possessing her daughter's vampiric body, was able to circumvent the bounds, allowing Esther to pass through, as shown in [Heart of Darkness](/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness). [Threshold Spell](/wiki/Invitation): Seemingly an ancient spell that dates back to the creation of vampires. The spell bars entry to vampires into the boundaries of a property or home that is owned by a living person (including witches, werewolves, Doppelg\u00e4ngers, etc.) without first being [invited](/wiki/Invitation)in by the owner. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Unknown - Used by: Though not much is known about the creation of this spell, so called by Bonnie, it was presumably created by the Spirits of Nature, or by Nature itself, that turned against Esther when she created the first vampires.

In [Never Let Me Go](/wiki/Never_Let_Me_Go), Bonnie states to Matt that the reason vampires are unable to cross the threshold of owned property (by the living) was due to magic. It is also worthy to note that there is no known magical loophole to this spell. As the only way to remove the spell is for the owner of the property to die, which has been shown on numerous occasions. Bonnie goes on to state that to reenact the spell and to reseal the house, they'll have to sign over the deed to someone else. Should a vampire be within the bounds of the property of which the deed is signed over to another, the vampires within will be magically and forcibly pulled/pushed from the house, as seen with Stefan and Caroline. - Blood-Knot Sealing Spell: A spell unique to the Bennett bloodline that utilizes the power from two generations of witches to seal an object. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Blood from a specific bloodline - Used by: In [Dangerous Liaisons](/wiki/Dangerous_Liaisons), Esther reveals that when she died, her friend and mentor, the Witch [Ayana](/wiki/Ayana), performed this spell upon Esther's coffin after she preserved her body.

In [Ashes to Ashes](/wiki/Ashes_to_Ashes), Dahlia created a small, localized boundary around herself and Freya so she could kill her and the Original without any interference from either. However, the recently resurrected Esther was able to cross the boundary with ease, suggesting that the boundary was to keep out vampires.

In [A Ghost Along the Mississippi](/wiki/A_Ghost_Along_the_Mississippi), Freya cast a salt boundary spell around Aurora, who was heavily drugged and confined within the spell. However, she escaped via Lucien either aided by another witch of his or by one of the numerous dark objects he stole. In [Dead Angels](/wiki/Dead_Angels), Vincent, as Regent, placed a boundary spell within a portion of Lafayette Cemetery to protect Cami from Klaus. While the spell prevented Klaus (vampires) from entering, the Sister Witches had no issues and were able to cross the salt line.

In [No More Heartbreaks](/wiki/No_More_Heartbreaks), Davina performed a salt boundary spell within [Rousseau's](/wiki/Rousseau%27s)when she confronted Lucien. He, however, was easily able to pass over the salt barrier with the assistance of the Ancestors, who rendered the spell useless. In [Gather Up the Killers](/wiki/Gather_Up_the_Killers), Vincent, at Marcel's request, crafted a new boundary spell that would allow vampires to enter but unable to leave and strong enough to contain an original, so that Klaus could fight Alistair but not flee the compound. In [Haunter of Ruins](/wiki/Haunter_of_Ruins), Freya contained Keelin in a salt circle bound by numerous candles to keep her safe and to prevent her from fleeing again (or to be set free by Hayley).

In [Long Time, No See](/wiki/Long_Time,_No_See), Alaric tasked Kaleb and Cleo with setting up traps in order to catch and contain any Malivore monsters after the arrival of a leprechaun. Cleo placed salt in doorways and performed this spell. While casting, the salt ignited with fire and she drew the flames to the opposing end of the salt line. Once complete, the fire subsided and the boundary was set. With the space consecrated, if a monster entered the space, it would be unable to leave. Cleo summoned the psychopomp, Charon, within the bounds of one of her consecrated spaces.

A binding circle is drawn using a concoction of various ingredients that form a white powder. When it is drawn on the ground, the spell confines a person or object within the marked space, preventing anyone else from entering. It is a convoluted spell that can be broken by powerful binding agents such as rock salt, volcanic ash, eye of newt, or the [blood](/wiki/Blood)of a more potent [witch](/wiki/Hope_Mikaelson). - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Sacrificial Magic - Used by: In [Dance Back from the Grave](/wiki/Dance_Back_from_the_Grave), Papa Tunde performed this spell on a few unnamed vampires before setting his sights on the Original vampire, Rebekah Mikaelson.

Though not reinforced, it remained a complex spell that persisted over time, to which Rebekah indicated that it would take a powerful source of magic for her and Cassie to channel to break. In [No Quarter](/wiki/No_Quarter), Freya, again used raw magical power by channeling Hayley, used the second spell to weaken Vincent's reinforced boundary spell that had been in place for five years. However, even channeling Hayley and then using her power, she was unable to break the spell, only weakening it enough to free Klaus. In [I Hear You Knocking](/wiki/I_Hear_You_Knocking), Freya performed yet another variation of this spell to break through the Hollow's spell that barred entry to the abandoned house where it first appeared. The spell was too strong to break on her own accord and, with Elijah's arrival, she was able to channel him and successfully broke through the spell. In [Keepers of the House](/wiki/Keepers_of_the_House), Freya attempted the second incantation over a safe in Marcel's penthouse, though the spell failed.

She later broke the spell so Cami could make her own choice. - Barrier Spell: The spell allows a witch to erect a boundary spell quickly in a small vicinity around them.

Once the unicorn, carrying the mind-controlling slug past the barrier, it was trapped and, by Hope's account, harmless.

In [What Cupid Problem?](/wiki/What_Cupid_Problem%3F), Hope performed a barrier spell within the school's gymnasium to prevent [Pothos](/wiki/Pothos)from escaping. However, the spell only functioned to prevent him from crossing a wall-to-wall boundary and not encompass the room. This allowed Pothos to fly up and break through the roof. In [You Can't Save Them All](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Save_Them_All), Hope performed her third spell to protect herself from Kai, as her previous attack failed and he rushed her with his vampiric speed. Alyssa also performed a similar spell to protect her while she attempted to sever Kai's connection to the 2018 Prison World. After Wendy and Jade were freed from the Prison World, they and Alyssa were moved from the boarding school to the [Old Mill](/wiki/Old_Mill)and placed behind a barrier spell by Josie.

In [This Can Only End in Blood](/wiki/This_Can_Only_End_in_Blood), MG and Lizzie practiced siphoning Ken, via a dummy, to trigger the explosion and Lizzie casting a shield spell to protect herself. During their practice run, she failed to create a barrier and was covered in a silly string-like material, indicating that she would have died in the explosion. Later, after Ken triggered the werewolves' curses, forcing them to turn, MG acted as bait to lure them into the tunnels underneath the Salvatore School.

In [I Hear You Knocking](/wiki/I_Hear_You_Knocking), the Hollow cast a similar spell on the abandoned house and blocked Freya's advances. This was done so that Marcel and Klaus would fight to the death and prevent Freya's, or another's interruption. On both occasions, these spells were powerful enough to prevent Freya's entry and she needed time and something to channel to break and/or weaken. In [A Spirit Here That Won't Be Broken](/wiki/A_Spirit_Here_That_Won%27t_Be_Broken), the Hollow cast the boundary spell over a room within the LaForge house, where she held Hayley captive and bound it to her protection totem.

Cloaking and Illusion Spells[ ] Cloaking spells allow witches to either render a being, location or object physically undetectable to the senses or magically undetectable by locator spells, making it so that magic cannot track them. [Illusion](/wiki/Illusions) spells are an advanced form of Cloaking spells that allow witches to project into the mind of a target and affect the senses to perceive a false reality of a being, location or object which they can then manipulate. - Illusionary Cloaking Spell: More commonly known as an invisibility spell, this spell allows a witch to cloak themselves and their targets \u2014 be it a person, object or certain locations completely based on one's perception. However, magic can be disrupted by [magical objects](/wiki/Ms._Cuddles). The distance in which a witch can cloak their target is directly proportionate to their level of skill. - Used by: When Bonnie could not cloak the four coffins, [the Spirits](/wiki/Bennett_Coven)of the [Witch Burial Ground](/wiki/Witch_Burial_Ground)cloaked the Mikaelson family coffins whenever they sensed allies of Niklaus, in [The New Deal](/wiki/The_New_Deal)and in [Our Town](/wiki/Our_Town). In [The Ties That Bind](/wiki/The_Ties_That_Bind), the Spirits later reversed the spell when Klaus threatened their living descendants, including Bonnie and Abby. In [Fade Into You](/wiki/Fade_Into_You), [Joshua Parker](/wiki/Joshua_Parker)used this spell to cloak his house and later to render himself invisible. In [I Alone](/wiki/I_Alone), Kai interrupts Elena and Damon's attempt to rescue Bonnie from the prison world. After siphoning some of Liv's magic, he performs this spell to disappear.

In [Woke Up With a Monster](/wiki/Woke_Up_With_a_Monster), Kai, having siphoned the entirety of the anti-magic spell that covered Mystic Falls, kidnapped Elena to practice and get his magic under control. Before Elena, he practiced on the manager at Mystic Grill, where he was finally able to perform a cloaking spell on him. Once he figured it out, he explains, it's easy to do and to undo. Which he promptly undoes the spell to show Elena the managed body of the manager. Wanting to rescue Elena, Damon wanted to have Liv cloak him so he could sneak into Mystic Falls High School, without Kai noticing. Liv agrees to do the spell, but she's not going into the school. If Kai sees her, she's dead. Instead, she tells him that she's strong enough to do the spell from outside while he goes in. Despite their plan, as Liv begins the spell, she disappears. Instead, Luke appears before Damon, having been cloaked himself, and tells him that Liv doesn't have the time for this. Luke then promptly disappears with the Invisique spell. Luke's magic was stronger than her own and she couldn't fight it. With his plan disrupted, Damon opts for plan B. Josette will perform the cloaking spell to help Damon rescue Elena, however, given that she's out of practice with her magic, she'll have to remain by his side for the spell to work, meaning she'll have to go inside the school, potentially facing Kai. With plan B working, Jo and Damon can rescue Elena, though now cloaking three people, including herself, the spell was becoming too taxing for her and she eventually reached her limit. She collapsed and, with her, the spell too, which revealed them. Kai finds them and cloaks himself and Elena. When \"Kai\" reappears, Damon attempts to impale him with a mop handle, but Kai appears next to the 'fake' Kai, revealing that he also glamored Elena with an illusion spell to make her look like him. In [Age of Innocence](/wiki/Age_of_Innocence), Valerie recounts to Caroline when she first met Stefan, in 1863 at the Mystic Falls County Fair.

In [Live Through This](/wiki/Live_Through_This), Valerie seeks out to destroy Julian's body to prevent Lily and the others from resurrecting him from the Phoenix Stone.

In [That's Nothing I Had to Remember](/wiki/That%27s_Nothing_I_Had_to_Remember), Lizzie used the Invisique spell on her and Landon. Landon hoped that if they were invisible then they could pit the reanimated zombie jogger against the croatoan. This doesn't work so they lure it into a cell and lock it in.

Still cloaked, she took the opportunity to help Josie reconnect with Finch by knocking her books from her arms so she would be prompted to help pick them up with her. After a successful reintroduction, Lizzie dragged her to the side of the locker and continued to guide her. Later that night, Lizzie performed the spell again to follow Finch back into the Salvatore School to see who she was seeing after she rejected Josie. Lizzie, however, learned that Finch was a werewolf and was using the school's basement to shift under the full moon. In [Fate's A Bitch, Isn't It?](/wiki/Fate%27s_A_Bitch,_Isn%27t_It%3F), Josie performed this spell over herself and Finch so they could hide from Ethan, who Lizzie was given an impromptu tour of the Salvatore School.

However, Klaus deduced that this Elijah was an illusion and Esther came forth. In [Woke Up With a Monster](/wiki/Woke_Up_With_a_Monster), Kai performed an illusion spell over Elena, which made Damon perceive that Elena was himself. Damon attacked the illusion of Kai, nearly staking Elena in the heart. Kai, who was cloaked, revealed himself moments later after Damon rushed to Elena's side. In [Dead Angels](/wiki/Dead_Angels), Madison utilized an illusion spell to taunt Klaus, while she was safely behind Vincent's boundary spell to keep out vampires. Once the illusion was broken, she attacked Klaus by combining telekinesis and pain infliction before she snapped his neck. In [I Hear You Knocking](/wiki/I_Hear_You_Knocking), the Hollow created illusions, via a dark magic \"infection\" upon Klaus and Marcel, appearing to them as people that they feared or hated to torment them to eventually get them to fight each other to the death. In [A Spirit Here That Won't Be Broken](/wiki/A_Spirit_Here_That_Won%27t_Be_Broken), the Hollow used the illusions of [Jackson](/wiki/Jackson_Kenner)and Keelin to appear to Hayley and Freya, respectively, as they attempted to kill her.

In [This Year Will Be Different](/wiki/This_Year_Will_Be_Different), [Professor Vardemus](/wiki/Rupert_Vardemus)performed this spell, which seemed to have initiated from his ornate ring, on the [Salvatore Boarding School for the Young & Gifted](/wiki/Salvatore_Boarding_School_for_the_Young_%26_Gifted)headmaster's office to change the appearance from that of the former headmaster, Alaric.

It was also used by Freya so that she and Hayley could torture Aurora without disruption in [Out of the Easy](/wiki/Out_of_the_Easy). - Cloaking Spell: A spell developed and used to hide specifically from locator spells. Various witches employ different means and magics that range in power to stay effectively hidden from other witches. - Requirements: Sandalwood - Used by: Esther has used this spell on at least two occasions. Once in [Do Not Go Gentle](/wiki/Do_Not_Go_Gentle)to successfully hide from Bonnie's locator spell and then again in [Wheel Inside the Wheel](/wiki/Wheel_Inside_the_Wheel), while possessing the witch [Lenore](/wiki/Lenore), to keep Elijah hidden from Klaus and his allies. In [From a Cradle to a Grave](/wiki/From_a_Cradle_to_a_Grave), Klaus instructs Rebekah to find a trustworthy witch to cast a cloaking spell on Hope. Later, Rebekah finds and has an unnamed witch to cast the spell. It is mentioned later, in [The Devil is Damned](/wiki/The_Devil_is_Damned), that it was so powerful, that it would take a hundred witches to break. This was notable as Esther searched for Rebekah since her possession of Cassie and later as Lenore though could not find her directly and utilized her Starlings to find Rebekah. Finn, possessing Vincent, used numerous and varying types of locator spells, to no avail, to find Hope and ultimately took Freya's knowledge and power to find her. Davina, since [Rebirth](/wiki/Rebirth), established a rather powerful cloaking spell, while utilizing Esther's grimoires, to effectively hide from Esther in both of her vessels.

In [Haunter of Ruins](/wiki/Haunter_of_Ruins), Klaus mentions that Hayley's safe house they were staying at was cloaked. As far as who cloaked the house remains elusive, meaning Hayley could have had a witch to cloak it to protect Hope or that Freya could have cloaked it upon her awakening.

The spell acts upon one's sight and hearing to alter the perception of the target's senses (of touch) into believing the manifestation is real. The loophole to this ingenious spell is that should one be without their vision or hearing, they would be able to walk right through the spell. The spell held the siren(s) for two centuries.

Elijah [reveals](/wiki/Klaus_(Episode))to Elena that Nature would not stand for such an imbalance of power, that a hybrid would be deadlier than any werewolf or vampire.

A flashback in [Always and Forever](/wiki/Always_and_Forever)reveals Elijah and Mikael binding Klaus for Esther to cast the spell after his first transformation. In [Don't It Just Break Your Heart](/wiki/Don%27t_It_Just_Break_Your_Heart), Freya attempted to cast this spell on Hope, who was willing to be cursed to get her mother back.

Bonnie explained that, with the ring came certain rules. The witch who spells the ring has the power to de-spell the ring, so if she were to hurt another person, she'd remove the spell that allows her to walk in the sun. In [Ordinary People](/wiki/Ordinary_People), Rebekah recounts the story of the creation of the Original vampires. She explained that the sun became their enemy and it kept them indoors for weeks.

Unlike Esther's spell, Genevieve's spell worked by the rings drawing strength from the Original Hybrid, Klaus, so that whenever one of the werewolves used the ring, it would weaken him. In [Alive and Kicking](/wiki/Alive_and_Kicking), Esther, while possessing Cassie, would later use her original spell to create, and to teach the spell to other witches, the rings to control the werewolves of the Bayou.

While the creation of dark objects of New Orleans was orchestrated by Kol using witches learned in Kemiya, other sects of witches have created dark objects using various other spells and types of magic. One such notable example was the creation of the [Blood Fountain](/wiki/Dark_Objects#Throughout_Legacies)by [the Travelers](/wiki/The_Travelers), presumably using [Traveler magic](/wiki/Traveler_Magic). In [Not Those Who Wander Are Lost](/wiki/Not_All_Those_Who_Wander_Are_Lost), Hope stole a grimoire from Professor Vardemus that contained black magic spells that described Papa Tunde's blade.

Malivore however wanted to torture Ryan more so than release Hope, who is \"toxic\" to him. In [This Christmas Was Surprisingly Violent](/wiki/This_Christmas_Was_Surprisingly_Violent), Ryan mentions the truth spell that Hope previously performed on him while they were both trapped within Malivore. Ryan tells Hope that she was wrong and that he didn't hate her, but to cover his emotions, he told her that the truth spell was still working. In [What Cupid Problem?](/wiki/What_Cupid_Problem%3F), Hope mentions that she performed a truth spell on Alyssa, hoping it would reveal where she magically hid the ascendant.

The sword also glows around any supernatural being, in which Kurutta used to track the oni. The spell was cast a number of years before [1308](/wiki/Timeline), by an unknown witch using black magic presumably in Mutsu Province Japan, as Kurutta spent that time housing the demon as it could not fully control his broken mind. In 1308, Kurutta encountered Malivore and was consumed.

The only other way for Keepers to escape is to trade places with another maiden that they trap. When a new maiden accepts the deal, the bracelet that traps the maidens and binds the Keeper to the labyrinth will also protect them from the minotaur. Should the bracelet be destroyed, the labyrinth will persist and the minotaur will then go after the Keeper to kill her.

To activate the dark object's effect, Ryan cut his hand and the next person he cut with it, his consciousness would be transferred to them. In [You Will Remember Me](/wiki/You_Will_Remember_Me), Aurora explains to Hope that [Agatha St. Clair](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Four_Minor_Characters#You_Will_Remember_Me)had been watching her for a long time and was the reason how she knew to create the Trident. Aurora then tricked Hope into using the Trident, cloaked as Papa Tunde's blade, against her to move their consciousness into each other. Aurora was now in Hope's tribrid body and Hope in Aurora's ancient vampire body. - Electromagnetic Charge Spell: The spell that charges modern-day electronics, such as lights, by providing an electrical current. - Incantation: Illustrant. - Used by: In [This Christmas Was Surprisingly Violent](/wiki/This_Christmas_Was_Surprisingly_Violent), Josie used this spell to turn on the Christmas lights and music when she and the other students, Alaric and Dorian sprung their trap on the Krampus. - Earpiece Enchantment: An enchantment that is performed on the casting witch and target's ears, allowing them to speak to and hear one another from a distance. - Incantation: Unknown. - Used by: In [What Cupid Problem?](/wiki/What_Cupid_Problem%3F), Hope performed this enchantment on MG's ear to help him get information about where Alyssa hid the ascendant. MG also comments that the enchantment itself is itchy and when messed with causes feedback. Continuing to mess with one's ear will cause the enchantment to break. - Breaking Enchantment: An enchantment that is placed on an object that causes the object to break when put back together. - Incantation: Unknown. - Used by: In [You Can't Save Them All](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Save_Them_All), Hope mentions that Alyssa placed this spell on the ascendant, so that every time she repaired it, it would just break again. She also tells Landon that she can't just unspell it. - Pearl-Bladed Weapon Enchantment: An enchantment that is placed upon a pearl-bladed weapon that is used to stop a person from becoming a berbalang. - Incantation: Unknown. - Used by: In [You Can't Run From Who You Are](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Run_From_Who_You_Are), Josie used the prism to interact with her subconscious, the darker version of herself. She took one class on Sanskrit the previous year and had forgotten everything, but believed that her subconscious hadn't. Her subconscious agreed because her consciousness cared. Reading the passage she learned that an enchantment had to be placed on a pearl-bladed weapon and to stab the person transforming into the berbalang in their heart to undo the transformation process. - Alarm Spell: A spell that places a magical alarm over an location that will alert when tampered with. - Incantation: Unknown. - Used by: In [Someplace Far Away From All This Violence](/wiki/Someplace_Far_Away_From_All_This_Violence), Josie's magical alarm is triggered by Hope who broke into Alaric's weapons cabinet in his office at the Salvatore School. Josie explained that she placed the spell over the cabinet sometime after Cleo first attempted to kill Hope in [I Was Made To Love You](/wiki/I_Was_Made_To_Love_You). Despite the active spell, the weapons were moved and cloaked by Cleo sometime after [We All Knew This Day Was Coming](/wiki/We_All_Knew_This_Day_Was_Coming). - Blood Muting Spell: A spell that mutes the frequency of a divine being's blood bound to an object, such as a bangle. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Bangle, Blood - Used by: In [The Story of My Life](/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Life), Cleo, while examining Ben's blood, discovered that his blood resonates at a frequency that neither she nor Jed, who has enhanced senses, cannot hear. She assumes that is why monsters are finding him and attacking him, because they can hear it. To stop the monsters from hearing it, she bound a spell that muted his blood's frequency to a bangle and placed it on his wrist. As long as he wears the bangle, he should be protected. In [Was This the Monster You Saw?](/wiki/Was_This_the_Monster_You_Saw%3F), Hope returned to the Salvatore School because she had set Lizzie down a dangerous path to raising the gods and needed their help. To force their hand, she placed a barrier spell around the school and broke Ben's enchanted bangle so that monsters would make their way to the school. After the school agreed to work alongside her, and not for her, she recreated the enchanted bangle. - Dark Object Activation Spell: A specific spell that activates a particular dark object. - Incantation: Actus - Requirements: Hope's thermostat-turned-dark object - Used by: In [Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost](/wiki/Not_All_Those_Who_Wander_Are_Lost), Hope stabbed Aurora with the thermostat-turned-dark object and performed this spell to activate it. Once cast the dark object rapidly spun and buried itself into Aurora's chest. Unlike Papa Tunde's blade, Aurora was still conscious of the effects of the object and was suffering. Once Lizzie telekinetically removed the object, it seemed to deactivate on its own. - Manticulum Creation Spell: An enchantment that uses algorithmic magic to calculate probabilities. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Device - Used by: In [The Only Way Out is Through](/wiki/The_Only_Way_Out_is_Through), Professor Vardemus brought his [Manticulum](/wiki/Enchanted_Objects)to the Salvatore School to war game their battle with the gods. On its own, it's not particularly useful; however, they combined with the likes of D&D power charts, encoding their powers into the device to calculate the outcome of any attack or defense that would happen in an actual battle. - Game-Automaton Conjuration Spell: A spell that conjures a playing field with magically sculpted automatons to strategize battle plans. - Incantation: None - Requirements: None - Used by: In [The Only Way Out is Through](/wiki/The_Only_Way_Out_is_Through), Professor Vardemus created a field of battle for Hope and the others to strategize their battle with the gods. He explained that vampires can move across the board in one turn while the speed of the gods varies. For the game, he used magic to sculpt Aurora de Martel, Jen, her father, Ken, and Lizzie Saltzman. The two sides would alternate turns, with the [Manticulum](/wiki/Enchanted_Objects)declaring success or failure of their moves based on the scores they fed it. Immortality and Creation Spells[ ] Immortality spells allow witches to alter the age of living beings to the point of an indefinite lifespan. Witches, as servants of Nature, cannot become immortal and practice their witchcraft and may instead use age-altering spells to extend their lifespans beyond normal means. In some instances, immortality spells concurrently result in the creation of new immortal species. Immortal beings, however, are a direct violation of Nature's rule that all living things must die; therefore, there are consequences that act as a balance, a loophole that can undo such magic. For example, the creation of immortals resulted in the creation of [doppelg\u00e4ngers](/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger) as a balance, whereas the binding ingredients for the creation of vampires became their greatest weaknesses. Creation spells, oftentimes coupled with various forms of immortality, result in new supernatural beings. The [Brotherhood of the Five](/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Five) and the [Huntress](/wiki/Rayna_Cruz) were supernaturally gifted vampire hunters, the latter of which also aged much more slowly and had multiple lifespans. Neither, however, were immortal, unlike [Malivore](/wiki/Malivore), which was created as a supernatural golem to wipe out and contain other supernatural creatures. [The Immortality Spell](/wiki/The_Immortality_Spell): One of the most powerful spells in history as well as one of the greatest achievements in the history of witchcraft. The spell allowed one to transcend death in the form of an elixir. When drunk, the recipient of the spell becomes a true [immortal](/wiki/Immortality)with peak physical conditioning and enhanced psychic abilities. Being a violation of nature's laws, mortal doppelg\u00e4ngers would be created as a consequence to be a version that can die. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Unknown - Used by: In [Original Sin](/wiki/Original_Sin), Qetsiyah reveals the truth surrounding the myth of the Immortality spell. She performed the spell over 2000 years ago which was intended for her then fianc\u00e9, Silas, and herself to drink at their wedding. However, he stole the elixir and He and Amara drank the potion in an act of betrayal. They would become the world's first true [Immortals](/wiki/Immortal), with Silas also losing access to this magic. [The Cure for Immortality](/wiki/The_Cure): A powerful spell that crafted the only known elixir to cure true immortality, as well as various other forms such as vampirism, and render an immortal being vulnerable to death. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Unknown - Used by: In [Original Sin](/wiki/Original_Sin), Qetsiyah recounts how in 1st century B.C. she created the Cure as a means to undo her Immortality spell after she found out that Silas betrayed her. While she had two elixirs for immortality, she only created one cure, as she desiccated Amara and used her to bind the Other Side. - Original Vampire Creation Spell: A modified version of Qetsiyah's immortality spell which, unlike its older counterpart, worked ritualistically to create the first vampires \u2014 the Original vampires. The spell made its targets completely immortal, except to the object that was called upon for their immortality, the White Oak. The spell also made them physically superior to werewolves in every aspect; such as enhanced speed, strength, agility, and fangs. However, Nature provided every weakness to their strengths, affecting more so their [vampire](/wiki/Vampire)descendants to the point of fatality. The spell was also interwoven with a linking spell so that if the Original sire was destroyed, so would their sireline. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Spirit or Dark Magic, The [Sun](/wiki/Sunlight)/ Celestial Event (Full Moon; possibly), [White Oak Tree](/wiki/White_Oak_Tree)(or Human life-link), Doppelg\u00e4nger blood, Death of targets, Blood (to complete transition), - Used by: Esther created and used this complex, multifaceted spell on her [children](/wiki/Mikaelson_Family)to protect them from their village's werewolves, spawning the first ever [vampires](/wiki/Original_Vampire)in history. Esther drew from the sun for life, the White Oak Tree, one of nature's eternal objects, for immortality, and blood from [Amara](/wiki/Amara)'s doppelg\u00e4nger, [Tatia](/wiki/Tatia). Rebekah recounts the spell that created them in [Ordinary People](/wiki/Ordinary_People)to Elena. Interestingly, when Esther first created the spell and utilized the sun for life, seemingly, the sun was not necessarily a requirement to reverse her spell, as she had planned to channel the power of a full moon. Esther performed this spell for a second time upon Alaric in [Do Not Go Gentle](/wiki/Do_Not_Go_Gentle), turning him into an [Enhanced Original Vampire](/wiki/Enhanced_Original_Vampire), though she learned from her previous mistake and bound Alaric's life to that of Elena's. In [The Battle of New Orleans](/wiki/The_Battle_of_New_Orleans), while Genevieve crafted Klaus' the Moonlight rings, Klaus confirms that Esther had crafted several spells in preparation to turn her children immortal; among them being spells for enhanced speed, strength, agility, and fangs. Additionally, in [Red Door](/wiki/Red_Door), Davina studied Esther's Grimoires, combining her knotting spell with her sirebond spell as she attempted to reverse engineer the sire link. In [Heart Shaped Box](/wiki/Heart_Shaped_Box), Kol confirms that the sire link is a facet of her most powerful spell used to protect those she loved most, so that should her children be threatened, their sirelings would aid and protect them, at least to ensure their own survival. Ayana's warning, that performing the spell was the making of a plague, is likely what prompted Esther to incorporate this into her spell. In total, Esther combined and incorporated at least six different, individual spells to create vampires, not to mention the objects she called upon for additional power. To date, this is the most complex spell ever performed. This is again demonstrated in [Behind the Black Horizon](/wiki/Behind_the_Black_Horizon), as it took an entire coven of an indeterminate size, \"ages\" to reverse-engineer for Lucien to modify. Davina, even with Esther's Grimoires at her side along with Kol, took several years just to reverse-engineer one aspect of the spell, the sire link. - Enhanced Original Vampire Creation Spell: Esther modified her original spell to create an \"Enhanced\" Original vampire to eradicate the Original vampires. Esther, however, added a new facet to the spell, a human life-link so that once the task was complete, the final vampire would be able to perish. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Dark Magic, The [Sun](/wiki/Sunlight), Elena's Blood (as a Human life-link) / Doppelg\u00e4nger blood, Death of target, Blood (to complete transition), - Used by: Esther performed this spell for a second time upon Alaric in [Do Not Go Gentle](/wiki/Do_Not_Go_Gentle), turning him into an [Enhanced Original Vampire](/wiki/Enhanced_Original_Vampire), though she learned from her previous mistake and bound Alaric's newly immortal life to that of Elena's human life. Should she die, so would he. - Hunter Creation Spell: The complex spell turned its targets into immortal-opposing [supernatural hunters](/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Five), bestowing upon them several unique abilities and attributes. On the original members, the [Hunter's Mark](/wiki/Hunter%27s_Mark)was a map to [the Cure](/wiki/The_Cure)in the form of a body tattoo. They were supernaturally endowed peak physical conditioning, an invulnerable mind to psychic abilities to combat Silas, and a blood lust to kill immortal beings, such as vampires. Upon being slain by those which they hunt, the [Hunter's Curse](/wiki/Hunter%27s_Curse)would activate and psychologically torment their murderers until their own demise. This status could also be passed on to other humans known as \"Potentials\". How potentials were chosen remains unknown, though they would also inherit the mark upon their predecessor's death. Unlike the original members, the mark would only grow with each kill of an immortal being, i.e. vampires and Originals. - Incantation: Phasmatos Sintu Corpora, E Ero Immortalis. - Requirements: Targets, Storm (lightning), Fire, Ceremonial Jug - Used by: In [The Five](/wiki/The_Five), Alexander recounts the Five's creation of how the were bound by fire in the last breath of a dying [Bennett witch](/wiki/The_Witch_of_The_Five)in the 12th Century. The witch performed this spell to create the Brotherhood of the Five for a single purpose: to oppose Silas and destroy vampires. It is presumed that Qetsiyah communicated with her from the Other Side, as it has been shown that most Bennett Witches have communed with the Spirits, guiding her to their creation. This is based on the claim that she made to Stefan in [Original Sin](/wiki/Original_Sin), stating that [her] hunters have failed in their task to kill Silas. - Huntress Creation Spell: The spell turned its target into a self-resurrecting huntress linked to the vampire trapping, [phoenix stone](/wiki/Phoenix_Stone). Due to the link, Rayna has a metaphysical connection to all of her targets that lets her see what they are seeing. The Huntress was bestowed 8 lives intertwined with great longevity, extraordinary physical strength, increasing with each new life, a blood lust to kill vampires and an immunity to magic. A failsafe was instilled such that any immortal with the mark of the phoenix sword will die when Rayna's last life is over. - The Shaman's Plea: Hear me, great spirit, hear me. We call upon you in this moment of need. We bring you an offering. A woman who desires justice for herself, for our tribe. Drink. She drinks the tea of protection so that she may be strong and so that no magic may touch her. She accepts our singular lives, so that she may have many. She wields a weapon of judgment, one that thirsts for the blood of those that prey upon us. Link her spirit with this sword. This blade draws blood from a vampire. It will connect you. It will guide you. It will aid you in their destruction. - Requirements: Tea of protection, Eight Shamans, Shaman Dagger, Fire, Phoenix Stone - Used by: In Woman's Work](/wiki/This_Woman%27s_Work), in 1857 a group [The Eight Everlastings](/wiki/The_Eight_Everlastings), bestowed this power upon [Rayna](/wiki/Rayna_Cruz)to oppose vampires. - Longevity Spell: A spell used by witches of old in conjunction with various unknown herbs to delay their aging process, extending their life greatly. However, age will eventually catch up with them. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Unknown Herbs; Black magic - Used by: In [The End of the Affair](/wiki/The_End_of_the_Affair), [Gloria](/wiki/Gloria)a powerful 'old-school voodoo' witch was able to use herbs along with this spell to slow down the aging process. She slowed her aging down such that she was over 100 years old despite being no more that 40 years old biologically. In [We'll Always Have Bourbon Street](/wiki/We%27ll_Always_Have_Bourbon_Street), another witch whom was from New Orleans, [Nandi LaMarche](/wiki/Nandi_LaMarche)was capable of slowing her own aging such that she was meant to be more than 80 years old yet did not look more than 50 years old. In [One Wrong Turn On Bourbon](/wiki/One_Wrong_Turn_On_Bourbon), when Klaus mentions that the years have been kind to Freya. In turn, she responds that sunblock, love, and literal witchcraft were the reason. In [You Will Remember Me](/wiki/You_Will_Remember_Me), Hope uses a black candle to negate hers and [Agatha St. Clair](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Four_Minor_Characters#You_Will_Remember_Me)'s magic. In response, Agatha rapidly aged as she used black magic to stay young. [Immortality Slumber](/wiki/The_Immortality_Slumber_Spell)Spell: A powerful ritual that allows witches to reach a form of pseudo-immortality, without being left powerless as a balance. The spell functions by placing the witch into a deep slumber that would last a century, arresting all biological functions besides the growth of the witch's magic. The witch would then awake, but is allotted only but a single year to walk the Earth before the cycle repeats itself. It is worth nothing that during their century slumber, the witch cannot be killed or harmed and during their year of life, the witch would remain immortal in all ways. - Incantation: Magi somn et immortalis. Binde oss. - Requirements: Runic Symbols, Circle Salt - Used by: In [Save My Soul](/wiki/Save_My_Soul), Dahlia placed this spell on herself and her niece Freya, in hopes that they would become the world's most powerful witches, as well as to achieve the closest thing to immortality without losing her magic. - Immortality Slumber Reversal Spell: A powerful binding spell that can be used to undo a spell which grants witches longevity, invulnerability and heightened magic at the price of being alive for one year per century using their three sources of power, to create a weakness. The spell can be bound to different forms such to a weapon or to a certain location, creating a killing ground where said witch would be rendered mortal. - Incantation: Drende moral associeres. Drende moral associeres. - Requirements: Soil from witch's homeland, Blood of the witch they loved most, Ash of witch's oppressors, Ring of salt (Weapon), Sage (Killing Ground) - Used by: In [Night Has A Thousand Eyes](/wiki/Night_Has_A_Thousand_Eyes), Davina used this spell to bind Dahlia's weaknesses (that which linked her to the mortal coil, the source of her hatred and that which broke her heart) to a small dagger. In [City Beneath The Sea](/wiki/City_Beneath_The_Sea), Freya used the spell to bind Dahlia's weaknesses to the Compound, creating a killing ground, where Dahlia could then be rendered mortal. In [Fire with Fire](/wiki/Fire_with_Fire), Freya bound the ingredients to kill Dahlia to their father's knife. - Upgraded Original Vampire Creation Spell: A modified version of Esther's Original vampire creation spell that created a superior, rather an Upgraded Original vampire. The spell was reverse-engineered by a coven of witches that would create an elixir that would turn its target into an immortal hybrid-like Original vampire with fangs laced with a new strain of werewolf venom that would even kill an of Mikaelson Witch, Seven types of Werewolf Venom, White Oak, Massive Source of Power, Death of Target, Dark / Ancestral Magic - Used by: In [Behind the Black Horizon](/wiki/Behind_the_Black_Horizon), Vincent as Regent to the Nine Covens of New Orleans was forced by the Ancestors to turn Lucien into the 'Beast' of prophecy whom he made the deal in exchange to destroy the Mikaelson Family. In [No More Heartbreaks](/wiki/No_More_Heartbreaks), Vincent wanted to take responsibility for Camille's death as he was the one that performed the spell that turned Lucien, however, Freya reminded him that he used her blood, her family's magic. Which meant they had both made him. In [Where Nothing Stays Buried](/wiki/Where_Nothing_Stays_Buried), Vincent comments that the spell was performed with \"some ugly magic that only the spirits have access to\" as he was a conduit for the Ancestors and he didn't use his power. - Upgraded Original Vampire Creation Reversal Spell: A powerful spell that is able to undo the effects of the Upgraded Original vampire creation spell; the spell will turn an Upgraded Original vampire back into a regular vampire. - Incantation: Anular forte \u00e9 les forte a las. - Requirements: Mikaelson Witch, Magic that Powered the Original Spell (i.e. Ancestral Magic), The Beast - Used by: In [No More Heartbreaks](/wiki/No_More_Heartbreaks), Freya, begins to use Lucien's blood as a means to figure out how to undo the spell that created him. In [Where Nothing Stays Buried](/wiki/Where_Nothing_Stays_Buried), using Esther's Grimoires, Freya was able to create the reversal spell needed to undo Lucien's transformation into an Upgraded Original vampire. Esther's grimoire states that a witch who creates a new supernatural species (i.e. Esther and the creation of vampires) is the only witch who can reverse the spell. Even though Vincent originally cast the spell, the magic he used was given to him by the Ancestral spirits, meaning that their power, not the casting witch, was needed to cast the reversal spell. In [Where Nothing Stays Buried](/wiki/Where_Nothing_Stays_Buried), Freya was successful in casting the reversal spell when she forcibly took the Ancestor's magic using Davina as a focal point as her spirit had been called to the mortal plane by use of a Hand of Glory. - Golem Creation Spell: A powerful spell using black magic to create an immortal golem from mud, capable of consuming any supernatural or human being into an endless space inside itself. Furthermore, the creation spell was interwoven with a spell to cause insatiable hunger and another to wipe the memories of the aforementioned beings consumed from the collective consciousness. The Necromancer refers to the spell as \"the Triad Spell\". - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Black Magic, Mud - Used by: In [I'll Tell You a Story](/wiki/I%27ll_Tell_You_a_Story), [Ryan Clarke](/wiki/Ryan_Clarke)recounts the creation of the golem called Malivore. Around a millennia ago, dragons, terrifying monsters that ravaged the region, remained unmatched by any of the other factions on their own. However, an unholy alliance was formed between a [witch](/wiki/Legacies_Season_One_Minor_Characters#I'll_Tell_You_a_Story), a [werewolf](/wiki/Legacies_Season_One_Minor_Characters#I'll_Tell_You_a_Story), and a [vampire](/wiki/Legacies_Season_One_Minor_Characters#I'll_Tell_You_a_Story); the triad. Together they combined their blood and the witch using black magic, creating an 'immortal' golem capable of consuming the dragons. Since they were responsible for the creation of the golem, the spell made it unable to harm other witches, werewolves, or vampires. Spelling the golem to have an insatiable hunger, it continued to consume every monster it could, swallowing them into an endless space inside itself. Ryan also states that since they were the ones who created him, only they could destroy him. All they needed to do was wipe away the symbol on his forehead. However, before this could happen, Malivore betrayed his creators by making a deal with all the humans he'd saved. Over time, he realized he was alone and fashioned beings like him, his \"children\", though they were imperfect, flawed, and none of them had his powers, though all of them had weaknesses. The golems were also sterile and unable to reproduce to continue his legacy. He was created to be the only one of his kind and never intended to be a species with his own \"bloodline\". In [You Can't Save Them All](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Save_Them_All), having discovered that memories of someone, i.e. Kai was missing, Josie mentions that she's felt the spell affecting her mind before. To restore the missing memories, she purged her, Jade's and Alaric's minds of the undue supernatural influence. In [Goodbyes Sure Do Suck](/wiki/Goodbyes_Sure_Do_Suck), the Necromancer reveals to Alyssa that he intends to raise Malivore with the Triad spell, however, he will rewrite the spell so that Malivore will serve him, instead of the Triad, and be his servant forever. In [Hold on Tight](/wiki/Hold_on_Tight), the Necromancer began his evil plan to raise Malivore. He began at Mystic Falls High School. He consecrated the space, tethering the grounds to another dimension, preparing it to become a Repository Monstrum. With a blood sacrifice, he drew out an omega symbol on to the floor and, inside, the Triad symbol to overwrite control of Malivore. However, to continue the spell, it required far more blood than he had at his disposal and intended to use the school, teeming with human beings, as sacrifices. While the Necromancer prepared the school, Alyssa continued with the spell at the Salvatore Crypt with the Malivore pit and [the Necromancer's Grimoire](/wiki/The_Necromancer%27s_Grimoire). The pit already contained Rafael's werewolf blood and she added her witch blood. But once she added MG's vampiric blood, her spell would be way more powerful than the first one. It had to be because Malivore needs to serve the Necromancer. The spell, however, would require a sacrifice and would eventually kill MG. He would grow weaker with every monster raised from Malivore until he died. After Malivore was raised, the mark on his forehead changed to the omega symbol as opposed to the original mark of Triad. The spell and its modifications are contained within the Necromancer's grimoire. After Malivore's death and resurrection in the prison world, he no longer has a symbol on his forehead. In [The Only Way Out is Through](/wiki/The_Only_Way_Out_is_Through), Jen explained that the forgetting spell doesn't work on the gods; however, since their power depends on belief, which had diminished over the years, Malivore became the ultimate death sentence. A creature that could make the world forget you ever existed. - Golem Dissolution Spell: A powerful spell that is able to alter the effects of the Golem Creation Spell; the spell uses black magic to trap and dissolve the golem back into its natural state, a black pit. The spell however, only binds the immortal golem and does not destroy it. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Knife, Urn, and Chalice; Eleven witches and black magic - Used by: In [I'll Tell You a Story](/wiki/I%27ll_Tell_You_a_Story), [Ryan Clarke](/wiki/Ryan_Clarke)recounts the binding of the golem called Malivore. After Malivore created Ryan, he grew to despise his creation; Ryan was clay pretending to be something he wasn't and as a result Malivore threw him away like all his other failures who came before. Ryan betrayed Malivore and told the humans of the descendants of his original worshipers how he was violating Nature, trying to birth a new species. The humans paid witches who used black magic to trap and dissolve him, to return him to his natural state. The witches used three artifacts, a knife, an urn, and a chalice, to bind the immortal golem to his dissolved form, unable to be unlocked except by Malivore's blood. - Consciousness Golem Creation Spell: A spell using black magic to give a person's consciousness solid form. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Black Magic, Prism, Target, Trident - Used by: In [It Will All Be Painfully Clear Soon Enough](/wiki/It_Will_All_Be_Painfully_Clear_Soon_Enough), Josie devises a plan to close the portal to Malivore in Mystic Falls and consult with Professor Vardemus, unbeknownst to her he was actually Ryan Clarke in a magical disguise. With Ryan's tutelage she and Landon created \"Simulandon\". Using the [prism](/wiki/Stones_and_minerals#Prism)and a [trident](/wiki/Dark_Objects#Throughout_Legacies)given to her by Ryan, Landon manifested his subconscious and then Josie gave it form \u2014 she turned him into a golem. The newly formed golem had the prism embedded within his chest that glowed bright white. The trident was used to bind the mind, body and spirit of Simulandon in conjunction with a spell using black magic. Josie, however, bound him to the lunar cycle so when the moon reaches its apex the following night, he'll disintegrate. Josie and Landon planned to use Simulandon as a decoy, by pumping Simulandon with Hope's blood and sending him through the portal to close it. Malivore won't be able to send him back, as he'll disintegrate, and the portal will remain closed. - Cleo's Golem Creation Spell: A powerful spell using black magic to create a golem from \"Malivore mud\". Landon Between [Yup, It's a Leprechaun, All Right](/wiki/Yup,_It%27s_a_Leprechaun,_All_Right)and [Long Time, No See](/wiki/Long_Time,_No_See), Cleo used the bust of Landon that she helped Hope make to create a golem of Landon and imbued him with Hope's memories of the real Landon. Cleo's spells created an idealized, perfect version of Landon. Believing the real Landon to be dead, Cleo hoped that Hope would use him as a coping mechanism. With time running out, Cleo was forced to take matters into her own hands and attempted to force Hope to become a fully realized tribrid. In [One Day You Will Understand](/wiki/One_Day_You_Will_Understand), while Cleo was sharing her memories with Josie and Alaric, she showed them how she performed this spell several times over. Using mud from Malivore she created her only friends under her imprisonment only for Malivore to consume them. He forced her to continue to create monsters because he was hungry and desperate by design in accordance with the spell that created him. She spent many years alone until she was inspired to create a vessel for Malivore, the [Vitruvian Man](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Three_Minor_Characters#One_Day_You_Will_Understand). However, she tricked Malivore and had complete control over the vessel and escaped. She eventually sealed herself away in the [artifact](/wiki/Project_Pandora)until she was released by Hope. She followed Hope to the Salvatore School and sought to join the school. She repeated the spell several more times. Learning the school was in need of financial assistance, she used Malivore mud to create a leprechaun and brought wealth to the school. She also did not summon the Ferryman, but created a golem of both the Ferryman and of Landon in her attempt for Hope not to open a portal to the prison world to risk Malivore's escape. - Protoclown Creation Spell: A powerful spell to bring an clown effigy to life. - Incantation: Unknown. - Requirements: Clown effigy - Used by: In [Was This the Monster You Saw?](/wiki/Was_This_the_Monster_You_Saw%3F), during a Roman village's annual harvest festival in [100 A.D.](/wiki/Timeline)an [Egyptian Woman](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Four_Minor_Characters#Was_This_the_Monster_You_Saw?), a conscripted, then exiled, witch, brought a clown effigy to life. Originally, the Roman villagers used the clown effigy to confess all their sins then they would burn it, believing that it would destroy all their misdeeds along with it. The witch instead used it to punish the villagers for taking her away from her home. Seemingly, the spell kept the creature alive for some two millennia. Invocations and Cleansing[ ] Invocations allow witches to call on spiritual beings, namely witch spirits, to be granted vast amounts of power, should they be willing, and protection. They may come in the form of spells or rituals used to commune with the dead or, occasionally, to summon the living. For New Orleans specifically, acts of consecration \"bless\" deceased witches into a separate purgatorial domain, the Ancestral Plane, so that the witch's magic continues to fuel the community and their living descendants. Spells related to Cleansing and Purification typically occur after an occurrence with said spiritual beings, especially if they are associated with darkness or dark magic that can infect or possess another being. They can also be used to purge spiritual 'infections' that corrupt individuals. - Spirit Harnessing Spell: A spell that can charge a witch with a large amount of power and focus it into said witch by invoking the Spirits. The spell is cast at a [site](/wiki/Magic_Hotspot)where many witches have met violent deaths. Provided their willingness to grant such power, said witch has to focus on her intention and agree to their terms. - Incantation: Sa vas est cure est vos facultas... - Requirements: Site where a number of witches have met with violent deaths, Spirit Magic - Used by: In [Know Thy Enemy](/wiki/Know_Thy_Enemy), the [witches spirits](/wiki/Bennett_Coven)of the [Witch Burial Ground](/wiki/Witch_Burial_Ground)performed this spell to grant Bonnie Bennett the use of their magic as she focused her magic. As they began to chant, she was overwhelmed with pain and cried out. Jeremy attempted to help and go to her, though they used telekinesis to prevent him from reaching her. Once the spell subsided, Bonnie's pain ceased and was empowered by the magic of the 100 dead witches. - S\u00e9ance Spell: A spell used to contact the spirits from the Other Side. Powerful witches are able to seek out specific spirits and may in turn, be possessed by them. In that respect, a witch acts much like a medium and allows said spirit to interact with the physical plane. - Incantation: Phasmatos Manex, Un by: In [History Repeating](/wiki/History_Repeating), Bonnie Bennett first used it to contact her ancestor, Emily, to inquire about her Talisman. In [As I Lay Dying](/wiki/As_I_Lay_Dying), She used it once more to contact Emily, requested by Stefan, to inquire about whether there was a cure for a werewolf bite. - Expression-Cleansing Spell: A spell used by a coven of witches, minimum of 12, that invokes the spirits of nature to cleanse a witch of Expression. Said witch needs to be a willing party as part of the ritual involves her calling out to the spirits (with the incantation) as well. However, doing so causes a lot of pain as the practice of Expression rejects the spirits. - Incantation: Phasmatos - Requirements: Coven (min. 12) of witches linked as one / Spirit Magic - Used by: In [Because the Night](/wiki/Because_the_Night), the spell was performed by Aja and her coven in an attempt to cleanse Bonnie Bennett of Expression Magic. - Channeling the Ancestors: Different rituals and invocations used to invoke the Ancestral spirits, commune with them and channel their collective power and will. - Davina, Monique, and Abigail's Spell: This spell is commonly used by the Harvest Girls to commune with the Ancestors. Each Harvest Witch will take a different position: one will do a handstand, one will be sprawled/contorted against the wall and the other would be laying on the ground. - Incantation: Vie dans des [The Big Uneasy](/wiki/The_Big_Uneasy), Monique, Abigail, and Davina performed this spell, seeking guidance from the ancestors about resurrecting the final harvest girl. - Genevieve's Spell: This spell allows a witch to commune with the Ancestors and give them a foothold in the physical world, allowing them to successfully interact with it in various ways. It also gives them control over the witch in question. - Incantation: C'est cette nouveau vie, nouveau \u00e2me m\u00e9lange avec nous. - Requirements: Ancestral Magic. The spell is performed by crunching a handful of herbs, laying out a witch's personal object and sprinkling salt on the altar. However, more witches can use this spell without any of the formerly mentioned necessities. - Used By: In [A Closer Walk With Thee](/wiki/A_Closer_Walk_With_Thee), Genevieve performed this spell to contact the Ancestors, specifically the Leader. She pleaded for another way to appease them and not to turn her into a monster; to sacrifice baby Hope. The Ancestors forced her compliance by throwing her across the cemetery and performed a pain infliction spell on her until she agreed to their terms. In [From a Cradle to a Grave](/wiki/From_a_Cradle_to_a_Grave), Genevieve, Monique, and Abigail performed this spell as they were preparing to sacrifice Hope. Seemingly, it was to contact and bring them to the cemetery within the Ancestral Plane as after the arrival of the Originals, the Harvest Girls called upon their collective power to attack Klaus, Hayley and Elijah. - Sophie and Katie's Spell: This spell is used to charge a witch with a large amount of ancestral power and focus it into one or more ancestral witch by invoking the Ancestors.The spell is cast in the cemetery where the ancestors are buried, by sprinkling salt on an altar and focusing on her intention. - Requirement: Ancestral Magic. The witches place several trinkets on a small altar and sprinkle the salt upon it. They then proceed to focus on the ancestral power and absorb it as their Ancestors can be heard. - Used By: In [Tangled Up In Blue](/wiki/Tangled_Up_In_Blue), Sophie tricked Katie into diverting the attention of using magic from her to Katie by using her love for Thierry. - Contacting a Witch Ancestor: This spell allows a witch to communicate with a specific dead witch among the Ancestors and with their permission, channel their power. - Incantation: Ven el forte es cufe, Ven el forte es cufe, Ven el forte es cufe, Ven el forte es cufe. - Requirements: Ancestral Magic, Tomb of target ancestor, Candles - Used By: In [You Hung the Moon](/wiki/You_Hung_the_Moon), Davina used this spell to contact C\u00e9leste Dubois to gain permission to channel her power to temporarily block The Crescent Curse. - Regent Ancestral Communion Spell: A powerful spell that allows the New Orleans Regent to go into a chanting trance-like state to directly commune with the Ancestors. - Incantation: L'objet perdu que petis est in que petis in civitate... l'objet que... que... - Requirements: Ancestral Magic, Various stones and herbs, Burning sage, Candles - Used By: In [An Old Friend Calls](/wiki/An_Old_Friend_Calls), Vincent used this spell to seek the Ancestors help to find the last remaining white oak bullet that Aurora hid. - To Channel A French Quarter Witch: A spell that allows a New Orleans witch access to the French Quarter Coven's Magic to perform spell unique to that coven. - Incantation: Ou f\u00e9 konfyans cherche de l'aide. - Requirements: Ancestral Magic, The Remains of a French Quarter [Witch](/wiki/Davina_Claire) - Used By: In [High Water and a Devil's Daughter](/wiki/High_Water_and_a_Devil%27s_Daughter), Vincent, using Davina's remains, channeled her to successfully call out to her spirit and to channel her magic to successfully complete a second Harvest. - Davina, Monique, and Abigail's Spell: This spell is commonly used by the Harvest Girls to commune with the Ancestors. Each Harvest Witch will take a different position: one will do a handstand, one will be sprawled/contorted against the wall and the other would be laying on the ground. [Rite of Consecration](/wiki/Consecration): A ritual to prepare a deceased witch's body so that they may join their Ancestors within the Ancestral Plane. In doing so, their magic will flow back into the Earth, fueling the witch community. This particular funeral rite is practiced by the Nine Covens of New Orleans. Presumably, other cultures that practice Ancestral Magic perform similar rites. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Ancestral Magic, White robes or shrouds, rose petals, oil and blessed water, sage, torches or incense - Used by: In [Always and Forever](/wiki/Always_and_Forever), Sophie performed her sister's consecration when she was murdered, for practicing magic, by Marcel. In [Tangled Up In Blue](/wiki/Tangled_Up_In_Blue), Sophie would also perform Katie's consecration after she was killed by Klaus. In [Sinners and Saints](/wiki/Sinners_and_Saints), Sophie, with Rebekah and Hayley's help, collected the bodies of fellow witches from the bayou so that she could consecrate them. In [Apr\u00e8s Moi, Le D\u00e9luge](/wiki/Apr%C3%A8s_Moi,_Le_D%C3%A9luge), Sophie attempted to consecrate C\u00e9leste's bones, though there was no magic to flow back into the Earth, as she was possessing the witch Sabine. Needing a witch to consecrate in order for Sophie to become an Elder, the Mikaelsons agreed to allow Esther, their mother, to be consecrated. This was accomplished through an elaborate ritual via Hayley, and by extension Hope, of owning New Orleans property, thereby having the consecration on New Orleans soil. In [Long Way Back From Hell](/wiki/Long_Way_Back_From_Hell), Monique consecrates her Aunt Sophie after killing her the night prior for her lack of faith in the Ancestors. Some time during or after [I Love You, Goodbye](/wiki/I_Love_You,_Goodbye), Rebekah, presumably with Davina's assistance consecrates Kaleb Westphall who housed Kol's spirit, both of which joined the Ancestors. In [You Hung the Moon](/wiki/You_Hung_the_Moon), the consecration of twelve Versailles witches from the Ninth Ward was overseen by their loved ones and Davina, current Regent. In [Dead Angels](/wiki/Dead_Angels), Davina consecrated Ariane's body, though not a native to New Orleans and was granted sanctuary in the Ancestral Plane. In [Where Nothing Stays Buried](/wiki/Where_Nothing_Stays_Buried), Vincent consecrated Davina's body in their attempt to resurrect her. - Calling Spell: The spell's true purpose is unknown though it can be assumed it was an invocation of the Ancestors, due to the whispering voices surrounding the witch casting the spell. - Incantation: Attendez notre appel. - Requirements: Ancestral Magic - Used by: In [Le Grand Guignol](/wiki/Le_Grand_Guignol), Monique used this spell while lying in the cemetery to commune with Ancestors. [The Magic Purification Spell](/wiki/The_Magic_Purification_Spell): The most powerful Traveler spell which serves as the means to break their curse by destroying \"impure\" forms of magic (i.e. any form of magic other than Traditional Magic). Once the spell begins, it will spread and unbind the \"impure\" magic, layer by layer until no other magic remains. The only known loophole to stop the spell is by killing one of the last two doppelg\u00e4ngers. - Incantation: Zah Pet Par Veet Eezol Ehmit Pro Kleh Et Tee. - Requirements: The spell will start with dozens of bodies inhabited by the Travelers as they all, through ingestion of the combined doppelg\u00e4nger blood, start chanting. As they chant, their human vessels slowly die from blood loss. As the spell begins to spread, all existing forms of spirit magic will be stripped away, layer by layer, together with all other forms of magic deemed unnatural by the Travelers. This process will continue until all forms of magic have been reversed completely. - Used By: In [Promised Land](/wiki/Promised_Land)Markos' Travelers began the spell to remove all forms of Magic and leave behind only pure magic; Traditional Magic. Given the function of the spell, various effects will occur. Given that they were created with dark magic, the spell will result in the extinction of vampires and hybrids. The spell will reverse the effects of vampirism, ultimately returning them human and to their last state of being, which was death. The spell will also reverse the effects of lycanthropy, i.e. removing their triggered-werewolf abilities and return them to their untriggered states. The spell, however, will not remove the werewolf curse in its entirety, meaning that the curse can be triggered again. As the spell spreads, it will \"purify\" and neutralize all \"impure\" forms of witchcraft, such as dark or Spirit Magic. This will, seemingly, disempower witches who solely practice non-traditional or non-pure forms of magic, though it would not prevent witches from utilizing Traditional Magic. It will also break the Travelers' Curse, a two-millennium old curse, restoring their access to Traditional Magic with the intention of Travelers becoming the powerful coven of witches they were 2,000 years ago. It should also be noted that with the Magic Purification Spell, previously resurrected individuals such as Alaric, while stripped of his vampirism, continued to live, meaning that the magic that resurrected him countless times before (Emily Bennett's spelled Gilbert Ring) remained unaffected. It could be perhaps that the magic used to create this enchantment was pure, as deemed by the Travelers, or that the magic of a resurrection spell does not persist once the individual has been fully revived. - Defense Spell: A powerful spell primarily that allows ancestral witches to call on the entire collective power of the Ancestors. However, if death occurs in one of the witches performing the spell, the collective power of the Ancestors will fade. - Incantation: La m\u00e8re, le p\u00e8re, le fr\u00e8re, la sur. - Requirements: Ancestral Magic, Place of power / Within the City of the Dead - Used by: In [From a Cradle to a Grave](/wiki/From_a_Cradle_to_a_Grave), Monique Deveraux and Abigail used this spell in their confrontation with the Originals and Hayley, which allowed them to easily subdue all of the Originals. - Ancestral S\u00e9ance Spell: A ritual that allows ancestral witches to contact the spirits that are suspended between life and death. - Incantation: Elikopte fant\u00f4mes solitaire mouri, vous reveler... - Requirements: Assorted herbs, Stones, Chalk inscriptions (a circle surmounted by a cross with arms of equal and glyphs), Possession of target, Blood from caster, Candles. - Used by: In [A Closer Walk With Thee](/wiki/A_Closer_Walk_With_Thee), Davina and Abigail attempted to contact [Tim](/wiki/Timothy)using his Violin after being killed by Klaus, though the spell was unsuccessful. - Bird Calling Spell: The spell allows a witch to call forth flocks of birds through a series of gestures. Tremors would occur before hundreds of birds come flying, directed by the witch. - Used by: In [Every Mother's Son](/wiki/Every_Mother%27s_Son), Esther Mikaelson used this spell to control hundreds, if not thousands, of starlings to do her bidding. - Used by: In - Bracelet of Obedience Summoning Spell: The spell that will summon a certain person bound and/or controlled by the bracelet of obedience. - Incantation: Jwenn In [Alive and Kicking](/wiki/Alive_and_Kicking), Davina used this spell to summon Mikael to her rescue upon being attacked by a pack of werewolves. - Spiritual Communion Spell: The spell will allow a witch to commune with an object bound spirit, making them appear in spirit form only to the caster. - Incantation: Trette che che che nunc que fra dom mina... - Requirements: Object or talisman that the spirit resides. - Used By: In [The Other Girl in New Orleans](/wiki/The_Other_Girl_in_New_Orleans), Freya used this spell to speak to her brother Finn, whom she trapped his soul into her talisman. - Revelation Spell: The spell can be used to reveal cloaked entities, shielded with dark magic. - Incantation: Revele votre vrai soi. - Used By: In [No Quarter](/wiki/No_Quarter), Vincent attempted this spell to unveil a dark entity though his magic paled in comparison and the only thing that was revealed was a symbol. - Cleansing Spell: The spell can be used to cleanse a person of dark magic, possession or to break a link from a target to a totem. - Incantation: Nettoyer timoun sa yo. - Used By: In [No Quarter](/wiki/No_Quarter), Vincent performed this spell as a ritualistic action, using sage and other items to purify himself after coming into contact with an unknown, [dark entity](/wiki/The_Hollow). In [Haunter of Ruins](/wiki/Haunter_of_Ruins), Vincent performed this spell on [Adam Folsom](/wiki/Adam_Folsom)and three other witch children to break the unknown dark witch's spell that he set into motion on them. Vincent also recounts how he and two additional witches attempted the cleansing spell on Eva, though it failed and, presumably, in the process or through her use of sacrificial magic, she lost her unborn child. In [Keepers of the House](/wiki/Keepers_of_the_House), Vincent performed this spell on Hope, after they returned to New Orleans. However, the spell seemed to make her worse though, seemingly this was the result of the spell that was placed on the four other children in an attempt to Anchor the Hollow to the sacrifices. - Purification Spell: The spell can be used to purify the mind infected with dark magic or that of possession. Should the \"infection\" be deeply rooted, the spell can fail. Various forms of this spell exist as it can be chanted freely as a spell, be enchanted upon beads or other objects, or be brewed into a potion. - Incantation: Reinigen monde tavo veneno. - Used By: In [I You Knocking](/wiki/I_Hear_You_Knocking), the Hollow caused Klaus to hallucinate Freya to perform this spell. The Hollow then claimed that the only way to break the link, once the spell failed, was to destroy the target of the spell, Marcel. [Dominic](/wiki/Dominic)used a similar spell to enchant prayer beads, some he had for himself, and another set he had to enchant for Marcel. Dominic claimed that enchanted beads, planted where the first manifestation occurred, would break the link. Freya concocted a purification potion that she originally planned to purify Klaus and Marcel though Klaus believed he could use the link to peer back at the Hollow. After the Hollow manifested itself as a shadow, she threw the potion at it and, seemingly, caused the spirit to retreat. - Summoning Spell: The spell that will telekinetically summon a certain person to the casting witch. - Incantation: Unknown. - Requirements: None - Used by: In [This is the Part Where You Run](/wiki/This_is_the_Part_Where_You_Run), Josie performed this spell to free Landon from within the werewolf transformation cell and to bring him from the [Salvatore Boarding School for the Young & Gifted](/wiki/Salvatore_Boarding_School_for_the_Young_%26_Gifted), through the woods to their party. It is implied that Josie created or just learned this spell as she was worried that she bruised Landon and that she was still working out the kinks. - Astral-Summoning Spell: A combination of a summoning spell and astral projection, tied to a personal object, such as a ring, as to summon a person to a location. - Incantation: Unknown. - Requirements: Personal object (ring) - Used by: In [Malivore](/wiki/Malivore_(Episode)), Bonnie performed this spell for Dorain by combining a summoning spell with an astral projection spell on a ring so that the [unnamed dryad](/wiki/Dryad)could reunite with her former lover, [Oliver](/wiki/Oliver_(Season_One)). The spell summoned Oliver's astral body in a physical enough form so that he could hold the necklace bound ring in his hands. - Croatoan Summoning Spell: A spell used to create or summon a croatoan. - Incantation: Unknown. - Requirements: Personal object (from the casting witch) - Used by: In [That's Nothing I Had to Remember](/wiki/That%27s_Nothing_I_Had_to_Remember), Sebastian recalls how his lover, a witch named Cassandra, summoned something worse than Sebastian. Something that would ferret out the lies of the Puritan hypocrites were concealing from the rest of the village and to keep them from finding Sebastian. The spell worked too well and wiped everyone out, including Cassandra, who was keeping Sebastian's secret, before she could dispel it. - Croatoan Dispelling Spell: A spell used to Incantation: Finis habentis maleficia. - Requirements: Personal object (from the casting witch) - Used by: In [That's Nothing I Had to Remember](/wiki/That%27s_Nothing_I_Had_to_Remember), Hope used Cassandra's necklace that she gave Sebastian to dispel the croatoan. After the spell was cast, it was rendered into a puddle of blue-black goo. - Psychopomp Summoning Spell: A spell used to summon a psychopomp. - Incantation: Unknown. - Requirements: Dark Magic (Cleo, presumably); Photo of Landon, Hope's blood, Sigil, Candles (Hope) - Used by: In [Long Time, No See](/wiki/Long_Time,_No_See), Cleo came up with an alternative method in the hopes of rescuing Landon from the prison world. Upon her studies, she thought that a psychopomp, a creature capable of traversing dimensional planes, would prove useful. Specifically, in Greek myth, [Charon, the Ferryman](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Three_Minor_Characters#Long_Time,_No_See)would carry souls across the River Styx if his bounty was paid. Cleo believed if the right price was paid, Charon could bring him back, and not just his soul. While Kaleb was skeptical, Cleo was certain that there were spells capable of summoning what the school considers monsters. This led him to believe that such a spell would require dark magic, something that the school doesn't allow or practice. Cleo, however, doesn't believe that magic is good or bad, and that it's about intention. Despite their conversation, Cleo presumably uses dark magic and summons Charon within her consecrated space, though she notes that the spell was much more taxing than she initially believed and fell nearly unconscious with a nosebleed. In [One Day You Will Understand](/wiki/One_Day_You_Will_Understand), Cleo explained to Alaric that she did not summon the Ferryman, but in reality created a golem of the Ferryman using Malivore mud. It remains unknown if there is a spell to actually summon the Ferryman, or a psychopomp in general. In [Just Don't Be a Stranger, Okay?](/wiki/Just_Don%27t_Be_a_Stranger,_Okay%3F), Hope performed this or a similar spell to summon Landon from Limbo, who had willingly taken the mantle of \"ferryman\" from [Lynn](/wiki/The_Ferryman). - Dispelling Spell: A spell to dispel other spells, it acts as a magical skeleton key. It's a particularly powerful dark spell given the requirements. - Incantation: Daemonium. Accipe sarificium tenebris! - Requirements: Dark Magic, a human sacrifice - Used by: In [I Was Made To Love You](/wiki/I_Was_Made_To_Love_You), suffering from amnesia, the Necromancer assumed that with each dark act, he became more monstrous and was eventually able to read his grimoire, where before he couldn't. He found the spell and performed the spell to release Alaric from his office that was spelled shut by Cleo. After performing the spell, she stabbed the knife into his own chest as the sacrifice, a feat that he believed that made Alaric not look at him as a monster. Seemingly with his dying breath, he believed he accomplished his mission in his renewed life and wished that Alaric would accomplish his own. - Summoning Ritual: A spell using a human sacrifice to perform a summoning. - Incantation: Surge peregrinus, profundus lemures talis. - Requirements: Many witches with a lot of power, a human sacrifice and presumably dark magic - Used by: In [This Feels A Little Cult-y](/wiki/This_Feels_A_Little_Cult-y), [Andi](/wiki/Andi)brainwashes around two dozen witches under the guise of a [Wellness Retreat for Witches](/wiki/Wellness_Retreat_for_Witches)and a psychotropic drug created by [Triad Industries](/wiki/Triad_Industries). Of the many witches, Lizzie is led to believe that she will be beside Andi during the sacred purification ritual. However, after Hope's arrival Lizzie comes back to her senses and is filled with negative emotions. As the witches gather, a [blue crystal witch](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Three_Minor_Characters#This_Feels_A_Little_Cult-y)chants and begins the ritual. Andi continues to dose the various witches with more drugs but, eventually, the ritual is stopped. Andi explains that she doesn't remember who she cut the deal with or who the spell was supposed to summon but it was bound with an unbreakable covenant spell. With her fate seal, one way or another, Andi sacrificed her life to complete the spell. Hours later, [Ryan Clarke](/wiki/Ryan_Clarke)is raised. - Dark Summoning Spell: An extremely advanced summoning spell that uses black magic to summon a person from across dimensions. - Incantation: Pervenio, supervenio, advehor. - Requirements: Black Magic, Salt Sigil, Personal object - Used by: In [See You On The Other Side](/wiki/See_You_On_The_Other_Side), Josie found the spell within the pages of [the Necromancer's Grimoire](/wiki/The_Necromancer%27s_Grimoire). Encircled in a salt line, Josie performed this spell to summon Landon out of Malivore. While casting the spell, a tendril rose up from within Malivore's darkness and wrapped around Landon's wrist, but Cleo stopped the spell. The spell, however, overwhelmed Josei as she continued to cast and she was consumed by the dark magic and became \"Dark\" Josie once again. This was brief though as Finch was able to pull her out from the darkness with a kiss. Altering the salt sigil and siphoning from Jed and Wade and using various items representing Cleo and Landon, she performed the spell a second time and successfully summoned Cleo from out of Malivore, bringing her back to the Salvatore School. - Dark Summoning Reversal Spell: A spell that stops the summoning action of the original spell.. - Incantation: Y\u00f4 k\u00far\u00f2 \u00ec\u00ffe. - Requirements: - Used You On The Other Side](/wiki/See_You_On_The_Other_Side), a tendril rises out of the darkness within Malivore and wraps around Landon. To stop the tendril, Cleo performs this spell and explains that she believed someone was trying to summon Landon, seemingly unaware if it was Malivore or someone else. Linking Spells[ ] [Linking](/wiki/Linking) spells allow witches to establish a magical bond between two or more people, connecting mind, body, soul or even life force. [Blood](/wiki/Blood) is often used to perform linking spells as it aids in strengthening the connection between the people that are being bonded together. Unlinking spells servers that bond, voiding the connection. - Linking Spell: The spell is used to link two or more beings together, such that any harm comes to one, it is also inflicted upon the other(s). The spell can be used to link similar species, i.e. witch to another witch, or to different species, i.e. human to vampire. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Spirit Magic (varies per spell) - Used by: In [Masquerade](/wiki/Masquerade), [Lucy Bennett](/wiki/Lucy_Bennett)used this spell to [Katherine Pierce](/wiki/Katerina_Petrova)together to ensure that Katherine wouldn't be killed because whatever harm came to her, Elena would be harmed as well. In [Because the Night](/wiki/Because_the_Night), [Aja](/wiki/Aja)called out to her coven for help to cleanse Bonnie of Expression magic. They channeled each other one by one using spirit magic until they linked to their leader. They accomplished this without the use of a verbal incantation. With the process complete, Aja, was one witch with the power of a full coven. However, since the witches were linked as one, when Aja was killed, her coven died in the process as well. In [Best Served Cold](/wiki/Best_Served_Cold), and proved in [Mommie Dearest](/wiki/Mommie_Dearest), the [Heretics](/wiki/Heretics)bound [Julian](/wiki/Julian_(Season_Seven))'s life to [Lillian Salvatore](/wiki/Lillian_Salvatore). Lily stated that if he dies, so would she. She also states that this spell took the cooperation of the entire family implying that it took a lot of magic for the Heretics to enact. In [Phantomesque](/wiki/Phantomesque), the Hollow cast a linking spell on the recently resurrected Davina to ensure her survival, and to gain Kol's obedience with her, so that if she died, so would Davina. - Life Force Binding Spell: A spell that binds the life energy of one person to that of another person. This allows a person to be revived from death without upsetting Nature's cycle of life and Rises](/wiki/The_Sun_Also_Rises), it is revealed that [Emily Bennett](/wiki/Emily_Bennett)used this spell to bind a woman's life force to her child's. The child died, but the mother's life force flowed through which restored her life, but caused the mother to die. Emily's descendant, [Bonnie](/wiki/Bonnie_Bennett), also performed this spell to bind [John Gilbert](/wiki/John_Gilbert)'s life force to [Elena Gilbert](/wiki/Elena_Gilbert)'s so that Elena would come back to life after being sacrificed. In [We All Knew This Day Was Coming](/wiki/We_All_Knew_This_Day_Was_Coming), this is one of the spells that Dorian listed in preparation for the Merge. He believed that if that day ever came, Alaric wouldn't be thinking straight and he'd be fighting until the last second to try and save them. - Original Linking Ritual: A spell used to link the Original vampires together so that if one of them were to be killed, the others would die as well in the process. - spell called for a drop of doppelg\u00e4nger's blood and allowing the Originals consumed it at the same time, they would then be bound together as one. - Used by: In [Dangerous Liaisons](/wiki/Dangerous_Liaisons), [Esther Mikaelson](/wiki/Esther_Mikaelson)performed this ritual to link all of her children together in an effort to kill them, including Klaus. She laced champagne with [Elena Gilbert](/wiki/Elena_Gilbert)'s blood to create the link between [Finn](/wiki/Finn_Mikaelson), and [Rebekah Mikaelson](/wiki/Rebekah_Mikaelson). - Expression Linking Spell: A non-verbal spell that allows the witch to link two people, including themselves in a matter of seconds simply by focusing. The witch will then be able to restrain the target's movements and distance which they can go to however far she pleases, acting as a leash. However, like any linking spell, whatever happens to one is also inflicted on the other. - Requirements: Expression - Used by: In [The Walking Dead](/wiki/The_Walking_Dead), Bonnie Bennett has used this spell to link herself to Katherine, to keep her away from Silas. - Expression Triangle Linking Spell: A non-verbal spell that uses Expression to charge and link three sacrificial hotspots. With all three hotspots linked, a spell can be used to drop the Veil as the caster sees fit, such as inside the Expression Triangle. - Requirements: Expression - Used by: In [The Walking Dead](/wiki/The_Walking_Dead), Bonnie Bennett has used this spell to charge and link each hotspot of the Expression Triangle to drop the Veil. Seemingly, since this link was established with Expression, upon Bonnie's death, she could no longer channel the Expression Triangle to restore the Veil and, in [Graduation](/wiki/Graduation_(Episode)), had to subsequently use the Full Moon to gather enough power to perform the spell. - Qetsiyah's Mind-Linking Spell: A powerful linking spell that connects the mind of a doppelg\u00e4nger to that of their immortal, using the doppelg\u00e4nger's energy to fry the doppelg\u00e4nger's conscience mind to damage an Immortal's brain and render their mental abilities useless. As the doppelg\u00e4nger's damaged brain will not heal from the spell, the linked Immortal's brain will not heal. If the spell is not lifted, the only loophole for the Immortal is to temporarily kill their doppelg\u00e4nger to regain their psychic powers until the doppelg\u00e4nger revives. Incantation: Adatu Khan In [Original Sin](/wiki/Original_Sin), Qetsiyah performed this spell by channeling the power of the herbs she surrounded herself with to connect Stefan to Silas and neutralize his mental abilities. - Traveler Mind-Linking Spell: A spell that is able to connect mind of two people (presumably, two doppelg\u00e4ngers) allowing the receiver of the spell to have visions of the target's life. - Incantation: Odka na vonas czech nat, Misteni - Requirements: Traveler Magic / Coven of Travelers, Doppelg\u00e4nger blood, Barrels of fire, The target's doppelg\u00e4nger - Used by: In [While You Were Sleeping](/wiki/While_You_Were_Sleeping), the Travelers used this spell on Stefan to find the location of the most recent Salvatore Doppelg\u00e4nger, [Tom Avery](/wiki/Tom_Avery). This spell appears to be a more crude and weaker variation of Qetsiyah's, as it required doppelg\u00e4nger blood and an entire coven of witches - The Merge Ritual: The Merge is a powerful ritual and a practiced tradition of the Gemini Coven. It works by merging the strength of twin witches. The twin who is naturally stronger absorbs the other twin's magic and the weaker twin dies. The spirits of both witches merge in the process to create a new being with traits from both witches in the body of the survivor. The witch who survives typically has their personality more dominant, but with changes from the deceased witch's personality. Successfully completing the Merge also bestows Leadership upon the Coven as well as reestablishes the linking spell that binds the coven as one. - Incantation: Sanguinem desimilus... Sanguinem generis fiantus. - Requirements: Celestial event, drawn from both witches - Used by: In [Fade Into You](/wiki/Fade_Into_You), Jo and Kai performed the Merge, though Jo had already relinquished her magic and Kai was banished to a prison world. When Kai escaped, Joshua Parker attempted to force Luke and Liv to Merge In [Prayer For the Dying](/wiki/Prayer_For_the_Dying), though Tyler intervened. Jo accepted her duty, and attempted to Merge with Kai, though again Luke intervened. Between Luke and Kai, Kai resulted in the successful witch, gaining Luke's magic. In [Let Her Go](/wiki/Let_Her_Go), Kai confirms that his new status as the Gemini Coven Leader, his life is linked to both his coven and to their [Prison Worlds](/wiki/Prison_Worlds)and that should he die, they too will die and the dimensions would be destroyed. In [Life Was So Much Easier When I Only Cared About Myself](/wiki/Life_Was_So_Much_Easier_When_I_Only_Cared_About_Myself), Josie's dark magic alter-ego decided to perform the Merge five years ahead of their 22nd birthday, citing that their coven's tradition was only a guideline. Lizzie eventually concedes to Josie's demands and participates in the ritual. Fortunately for Lizzie, who lost the battle of wills, Hope's Plan B of being temporarily linked to Landon caused her to resurrect upon Landon's death with her mind protected from the Merge. - Confirmation-Representational Linking Ritual: A complex ritual used to confirm whether if another person is pregnant while using representational magic, which uses the concept of \"like attracts like\" to link the pregnant person to another. - Incantation: Non-Verbal - Requirements: Ancestral / Representational Magic, Target's hair, Goblet, Candles, Salt Symbols, Wooden surface, Herbs, Target's hair, Full Moon (Possibly) - Used By: In [The Originals](/wiki/The_Originals_(Episode)), Jane-Anne Deveraux performed this complex representational ritual upon Hayley and her surrounding environment to ascertain that she was in fact pregnant with Klaus' child. The intricate ritual ties the targets hair to the spell while each item represents a certain environmental or physiological change such as the following: lighting a candle wick to simulate flames on a map, a bubbling goblet to simulate a salted vehicle, a humming witch to cause litany interference on a mobile phone and finally a blown out candle to cause the target to fall unconscious. Presumably, the unknown salt symbols linked Hayley to Sophie, as Jane-Anne knew of the consequences of practicing witchcraft in the Quarter under Marcel's rule. With Hayley linked to Sophie, the fate of Klaus' child was now controlled by the witches in the hope to overthrow Marcel and reclaim their magic and city. - Genevieve's Mind-linking Spell: The spell allows a witch to connect two minds together. A potion concocted using herbs, the witch's blood and host's blood, which will then be drunk by the target. Doing so allows the drinkers to see into the host's mind and access their memories which the witch can then guide through. - Incantation: -TBA- - Requirements: Ancestral Magic, Blood of target to be drunk, Herbs - Used by: In [Long Way Back From Hell](/wiki/Long_Way_Back_From_Hell), Genevieve performed this spell on Klaus and Rebekah Mikaelson to show him her betrayal, getting her revenge on Rebekah for killing her in her previous life. - Connective Magic: A powerful spell that bonds a supernatural creature to a witch, allowing her to draw on their strengths to gain more power without harming the target. - With a Witch: The spell connects the power of two witches allowing one witch to draw power from the other, while augmenting the latter's power. It is unique such that the former was able to fully channel power even when the latter is miles away. - Incantation: Med dette Five Torches, Circle of salt, Runic Symbols, Waning crescent moon at its apex (possibly) - With an Immortal Being: The spell connects the power of a witch to an immortal allowing the former to draw on the latter's strength to achieve true immortality in conjunction with the immortality slumber spell. However, neutralizing or killing said immortal being would similarly affect the witch. - Incantation: Med arveno som et svar. Med arveno som et svar. - Requirements: Salt drawn in an infinity symbol, Candles, Blood of targets, Chalices - Used by: In [Save My Soul](/wiki/Save_My_Soul), [Dahlia](/wiki/Dahlia)performed this spell with Freya's aid to connect their magic and draw from Freya's power while augmenting the latter's magic. In [Ashes to Ashes](/wiki/Ashes_to_Ashes), she performed it once more with Klaus to free herself from the immortality slumber restriction of being limited to only a single year awake, per century. Unlike with Freya, by binding herself to Klaus, whose strength as an immortal allowed her to break this restriction, his weaknesses were also shared with her; i.e. being daggered with the Golden White Oak Ash Daggers. She would later break the connective magic bound to both Klaus and Freya via the Melting Spell through representational magic and while utilizing a waning crescent moon at its apex, respectively. - With a Witch: The spell connects the power of two witches allowing one witch to draw power from the other, while augmenting the latter's power. It is unique such that the former was able to fully channel power even when the latter is miles away. [The Rite of Nines](/wiki/The_Rite_of_Nines): A ritual that augments an ancestral witch's power through the linking and subsequent sacrifice of one witch from each of the nine covens of New Orleans \u2014 preferably young and prodigious. The immense amount of magical power gained by the witch performing the ritual is believed to elevate them to a level of strength unlike any other witch in any of the New Orleans covens. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: 9 children from each of the nine covens - Used by: In [They All Asked For You](/wiki/They_All_Asked_For_You), it is revealed that Eva Sinclair attempted to complete the Rite of Nines, but was stopped before she could complete it. - Link Exploitation Spell: A spell that exploits the shared 'link' between witches under a unified coven through the magic they practice collectively, from leader to members and vice versa. Through their magic, witches can spy upon other members of their coven, hearing them as if they were present in the same room and, additionally, by forcing enough magic through the 'link', can cause all witches to fall unconscious. - Incantation: Non-Verbal - Requirements: Collectively practiced magic (Dark Magic); Source of Power (Hand of Glory), optional. - Used By: In [Heart Shaped Box](/wiki/Heart_Shaped_Box), one of the witches of the Sisters' coven was able to tap into this shared \"link\" to listen in on Davina and Kol's conversation about the Sireline Unlinking spell she was developing. The witch listening in went into a trance-like state to focus while scribbling down the conversation. Aya claimed that since Kol was linked to the Hand of Glory, whatever he and Davina said, the Sisters would be able to hear it. This was possible because the same magic that the Sisters and Davina practiced was the same magic that called forth Kol's spirit from the Ancestral Plane via the Hand of Glory. Later, Kol and Davina, channeling the magic in the Hand of Glory, exploited the same \"link\" and were able to knock out Davina and subsequently the remaining Sister witches before they were able to kill Hayley. Furthermore, it is unknown how this \"link\" was established as there was no initiation ceremony or ritual and seemingly was established when Davina took command of the coven. Also, while the magic that was practiced among them was \"linked\", they were not linked together through a traditional linking spell, i.e. when one witch died the others continued to live. Furthermore, it does not seem to be a leader dependent spell to establish this \"link\" as both Ariane and Madison were killed while leading the coven, though the members did not die along with them, which would hint towards some kind of empathetic link via their collective or shared magic. - Sacrificial Anchorage Spell: A spell that uses sacrifices to anchor a spirit to the living world. Targets are placed atop a large ornate altar affixed with bones and skulls on which is inscribed with the marking of the \"Ouroboros\". Once the spell is enacted, it creates a fire boundary spell around the targets to prevent the sacrifices from being removed. The spell then brings its targets into the veil as the spirit latches on to them. - Incantation: Vinculum mond sa. - Requirements: Sacrificial Anchor(s) - Used by: In [Keepers of the House](/wiki/Keepers_of_the_House), Will, as a conduit of the Hollow activated this ritual to draw out Klaus and Marcel by using four children as anchors, though they were the intended targets. - Chain Spell: A linking spell that is about the fluid movement of energy from witch to witch. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Two or more witches - Used by: In [We're Being Punked, Pedro](/wiki/We%27re_Being_Punked,_Pedro), Dorian was teaching a class on how to perform a chain spell; Hope, Lizzie, and Josie were present, among other students, while Penelope was missing due to personal reasons. While preparing the spell, Hope, Lizzie, and Josie were called to Alaric's office for performing dark magic and starting a fight at the game, respectively. - Mimic Spell: A simple spell that causes the target to mimic the actions of the casting witch. - Incantation: Imitantor Pupulus - Requirements: Target - Used by: In [There's Always a Loophole](/wiki/There%27s_Always_a_Loophole), Hope performed this spell on [Ryan Clarke](/wiki/Ryan_Clarke)after she learned that he wanted to test her theory about being the loophole to end Malivore. If she was right, she'd sacrifice herself and Ryan would be from his father. After casting the spell, she and Ryan, who was forced to do the same action, jumped into Malivore. In [I'll Never Give Up Hope](/wiki/I%27ll_Never_Give_Up_Hope), Hope performed this spell again on Ryan to make him stop talking and to walk in the opposite direction of her to be alone while trapped in Malivore. In [Fate's A Bitch, Isn't It?](/wiki/Fate%27s_A_Bitch,_Isn%27t_It%3F), Hope performed this spell on Ryan, again, believing that he was hiding something from her after she agreed to work with him to find the Malivore portal. Bound to the spell, she forced Ryan to bite open his wrist to drop some of his Malivore mud to locate the portal, however, she learned that his has changed\u2014he was human. - Mimic Reversal Spell: A spell that reverses the effects of a mimic spell. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Target - Used by: In [I'll Never Give Up Hope](/wiki/I%27ll_Never_Give_Up_Hope), Hope performed this spell to remove the effects of the mimic spell she previously cast on Ryan. When Malivore attempted to expel her, Ryan convinced Hope to break the spell so he could \"save\" her, though in truth he wanted to be expelled along with her. However, as much as Malivore wanted to expel Hope, he wanted to torture Ryan more and would stop his attempts whenever Ryan grabbed hold of Hope. - Object Linking Spell: A spell that links two or more objects, spells or people together. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Target(s) and Object(s) - Used by: In [This is Why We Don't Entrust Plans to Muppet Babies](/wiki/This_is_Why_We_Don%27t_Entrust_Plans_to_Muppet_Babies), it's revealed that Alyssa Chang performed this spell several years prior on Lizzie's notebook and Lizzie. In the Library, Alyssa set the notebook on fire causing Lizzie to suffer severe burns, sending her to the hospital. Again she performed a similar spell on the 2018 ascendant and the newly created one. When Lizzie and Josie sent the Sandclock to the prison world, they were also sending themselves and Alaric along with it. However, they didn't send it to the 2028 prison world, instead it was sent to Kai's 2018 prison world. Alyssa also added a time delay spell so that no one would realize what happened until it was too late. In [Hold on Tight](/wiki/Hold_on_Tight), Alyssa linked the Malivore pit to the Necromancer's location. As monsters were raised from his blood sacrifices, they would appear at this location at Mystic Falls High School. After she decided to do what was right and save MG, she worked with Lizzie and Josie to create a new prison world. Together they moved all the spells Alyssa linked from their world to the prison world and banished Hope, Landon, the Necromancer and all the monsters with him to the prison world. With the spell complete, Alyssa and MG were free. - Unbreakable Covenant Spell: A spell that forms an unbreakable agreement between two parties, so that should one break the agreement, the exchange becomes null and both lose what was intended to them \u2014 no exceptions. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Target(s) - Used by: In [Facing Darkness is Kinda My Thing](/wiki/Facing_Darkness_is_Kinda_My_Thing), the Necromancer proposed this spell to Alaric since the latter couldn't trust him. The Necromancer explained that if both of them don't hold up their end of the bargain, neither of them will gain what they want. The Necromancer wanted the dark magic within Josie and Alaric wanted Josie returned safely. Alaric also bargained for Rafael, Alyssa, and Chad's resurrection with the ties between them and the Necromancer, as 'puppets', to be severed. He also wanted Landon to be brought back as well. Alaric eventually agreed to the bargain which prompted Lizzie siphoning the dark magic out of Josie and transferring it into the Necromancer. Upholding his end of the bargain, the Necromancer resurrected Rafael, Alyssa, and Chad. Landon, however, never awoke from being stabbed with [the Golden Arrow](/wiki/The_Golden_Arrow). In [We're Not Worthy](/wiki/We%27re_Not_Worthy), the Covenant spell was yet to be completed as Landon refused to be resurrected, in spite of everyone's willingness to give the Necromancer the dark magic. The spell, as he described, prevented the Necromancer from using the dark magic until Landon was brought back. In [Goodbyes Sure Do Suck](/wiki/Goodbyes_Sure_Do_Suck), as a consequence of Alaric's wording with the Covenant spell, the Necromancer exploited a loophole and, upon severing his ties, Chad, Rafael, and Alyssa began to die as the Necromancer was the one who had brought them back. In [This Feels A Little Cult-y](/wiki/This_Feels_A_Little_Cult-y), [Andi](/wiki/Andi)recalls that [18 months prior](/wiki/Timeline)she brokered a deal with [Ryan Clarke](/wiki/Ryan_Clarke)and bound it with a Covenant spell. Though Ryan was forgotten after being consumed by Malivore, she recalled the specifications of the deal. Should she fail the summoning ritual, which was to resurrect him as a human, she would die. After attempting the ritual, she used herself as the sacrifice as she would die regardless. In [Someplace Far Away From All This Violence](/wiki/Someplace_Far_Away_From_All_This_Violence), MG, Josie, and Cleo collectively performed this spell with Hope so that she would stay at the Salvatore School and listen to their ideas in their attempt to bring back her humanity. In exchange for no physical harm to them or any of the students, they would give her any of Alaric's weapons from his cabinet. Any slightest act of violence, however, would break the covenant spell. In [You Will Remember Me](/wiki/You_Will_Remember_Me), Hope confronts [Agatha St. Clair](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Four_Minor_Characters#You_Will_Remember_Me), having learned that she bound the magic of the covenant spell to those loyal to Triad. To keep it an unbreakable alliance, any act of treason was punishable by death with fire. Hope believed she was bluffing, though when she began to tell Hope where to find the others, she burst into flames and died. Likewise, [Greg](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Four_Minor_Characters#You_Will_Remember_Me), his pack, and [Aurora de Martel](/wiki/Aurora_de_Martel)are all bound by the same spell. In [Was This the Monster You Saw?](/wiki/Was_This_the_Monster_You_Saw%3F), Aurora and Lizzie agreed to perform this spell on themselves so that they could trust one another on their quest to raise a god. Lizzie's Triad brand is on her right forearm. In [I Wouldn't Be Standing Here If It Weren't For You](/wiki/I_Wouldn%27t_Be_Standing_Here_If_It_Weren%27t_For_You), Lizzie explained that her brand disappeared, meaning either Aurora found a way to undo the spell, or the purpose of their covenant had been completed, i.e. someone raised a sleeping god. Ben successfully raised his father to gain his boon. Locator Spells[ ] Locator spells allow witches to discern the location of an object or person anywhere in the world. Locator spells are ineffective if the person or object is being hidden with a cloaking spell. - Locator Spell: A simple spell in which the casting witch will receive a vision of the object or person's location. Alternatively, using the target's blood and a map can be used to ascertain a more precise location. In some instances, it's not possible to get an exact address or even a location if the target is cloaked or deceased. - Bonnie and Olivia's Incantation: ibi ti wa. - Requirements: Map, Object or blood belonging to target - Used by: In [Fool Me Once](/wiki/Fool_Me_Once), [Sheila Bennett](/wiki/Sheila_Bennett)performed this spell for Stefan to find her granddaughter, [Bonnie Bennett](/wiki/Bonnie_Bennett), after she was kidnapped by Anna and her minion, Ben. She states that the spell was 'simple', though that can be attributed to her knowledge and experience of the craft. In [Total Eclipse of the Heart](/wiki/Total_Eclipse_of_the_Heart), Damon threatened Bonnie to find a witch to perform a locator spell for him to find Dr. Maxfield. Bonnie helped the 'newbie' witch, Olivia, learn this spell and tracked Wes in Richmond, Virginia. In [Gone Girl](/wiki/Gone_Girl), Bonnie came to Liv again with Jeremy to ask for her help in locating Elena. Ignoring how Bonnie taught her previously, Liv took Jeremy's hand and performed the spell while asking if Elena looked anything like her cousin. She explained to Bonnie that she was searching for her with her mind and that she would take all the help she could get. After repeating the spell for a second time, Liv located Katherine, who had possessed Elena's body, to a church. In [Man on Fire](/wiki/Man_on_Fire), Olivia comes clean and tells Bonnie that the stuff she had been teaching her, she had learned in first grade and that Bonnie was an \"easy in\" to protect the doppelg\u00e4ngers. In [Black Hole Sun](/wiki/Black_Hole_Sun), Bonnie performed this spell with Kai's blood to pinpoint the whereabouts of the 1994 Ascendant. Bonnie began with a map of Portland, Oregon, but as she continued the spell, Kai's blood didn't move and she felt that something wasn't right and perhaps that she needed a bigger map. Continuing the spell with a map of the United States, Kai's blood moved towards Mystic Falls, Virginia. Bonnie turned and placed her hand on Kai's coat and the candle flames spiked and then went out as the Ascendant was located. In [A Bird in a Gilded Cage](/wiki/A_Bird_in_a_Gilded_Cage), Bonnie performed this spell again to locate the 1903 Ascendant after she and Kai transported themselves, Elena and Damon to the 1903 Prison World. Kai explained to Elena that the Ascendant can't travel between worlds and that they would have to find its mirror image in 1903. While holding Kai's hands, she claimed that she located the Ascendant, although that was a ploy to get Kai alone to kill him as she believed he hadn't changed. In [Live Through This](/wiki/Live_Through_This), [Beau](/wiki/Beau)used a similar spell to locate Julian's body using his ring at Lily's request. In [Cold as Ice](/wiki/Cold_as_Ice), Bonnie performed a locator spell for Damon to locate Julian. The spell located him in a town called Sunbury. After arriving in Sunbury, Damon asked Bonnie if she could do a \"zoom-in\" spell or do something to be a little more accurate, such as an exact address. Bonnie, however, explained that it doesn't work that way. In [Nostalgia's a Bitch](/wiki/Nostalgia%27s_a_Bitch), Sheila, as a subconscious manifestation within Damon's mind, helped Bonnie and performed a locator spell to find Damon, using the letter he wrote to her when he planned to desiccate himself until Elena awoke from her slumber.

In [One Wrong Turn On Bourbon](/wiki/One_Wrong_Turn_On_Bourbon), Freya mentions that she used every Locator spell she knew in every language, yet she could not locate Hayley from Hope's cloaking spell. In [Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea](/wiki/Between_the_Devil_and_the_Deep_Blue_Sea), Hope studied several grimoires that contained locator spells in twelve ancient languages. Vincent also mentioned that when Hayley first went missing, there were a dozen witches out on the streets of New Orleans performing locator spells, trying to find her. In [What, Will, I, Have, Left](/wiki/What,_Will,_I,_Have,_Left), Caroline mentions that she had her entire Honors Tracking class on attempting to locate Hope and Roman. They, however, could not pinpoint their location, and although they were cloaked, could only track them in a specific direction which was heading somewhere just outside of New Orleans. Ultimately, they failed in their endeavor to locate them. In [Maybe I Should Start From The End](/wiki/Maybe_I_Should_Start_From_The_End), after Landon was taken hostage by [Seylah Chelon](/wiki/Seylah_Chelon)and the magical compass was ditched in an unsuspecting couple's mailbox, Hope used the compass to perform a locator spell to track Landon and Seylah to a motel room. In [I'll Never Give Up Hope](/wiki/I%27ll_Never_Give_Up_Hope), Josie used a similar spell to help Landon track Rafael who, still in wolf-form, went missing. In [This Year Will Be Different](/wiki/This_Year_Will_Be_Different), Lizzie performed this spell in her attempt to locate [Sebastian](/wiki/Sebastian). To cast the spell, she had to picture his face and touch the map. Should they be found within its boundaries, then the spell will cause the map to glow. With the spell having failed, she decided to move on to the next one. Despite showing up just moments later, Sebastian was not located with her spell and he got past the school's magical defenses twice. In [You Remind Me of Someone I Used to Know](/wiki/You_Remind_Me_of_Someone_I_Used_to_Know)Hope attempted to cast a locator spell to find Rafael, who was still confined to his wolf form, though she was interrupted and caught by Landon. After deciding to let him come with her, she performed the spell and tracked Rafael to a small location in the woods near the Salvatore Boarding School. However, they found the shunka first. In [This Christmas Was Surprisingly Violent](/wiki/This_Christmas_Was_Surprisingly_Violent), Landon reveals that he had Josie perform a lineage spell on Rafael and a locator spell to find his true parents. The spell tracked Landon's father to North Carolina. In [What Cupid Problem?](/wiki/What_Cupid_Problem%3F), Landon asked [Druscilla](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Two_Minor_Characters#What_Cupid_Problem?)to perform a locator spell, using Pothos' severed wings, to find Pothos. Her spell was successful and she tracked him to [Mystic Tap](/wiki/Mystic_Tap). In [Kai Parker Screwed Us](/wiki/Kai_Parker_Screwed_Us), Wendy performed this locator spell, at Jade's request, so she'd be able to find out where Alaric had run off to. Despite it not being very sporting, Jade believed that the punishment fit the crime. In [Yup, It's a Leprechaun, All Right](/wiki/Yup,_It%27s_a_Leprechaun,_All_Right), Hope used the [leprechaun](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Three_Minor_Characters#Yup,_It's_a_Leprechaun,_All_Right)'s blood to perform a locator spell to track his whereabouts. The spell led her and Cleo to a parking garage, where the leprechaun was consuming various forms of wealth. In [Do All Malivore Monsters Provide This Level of Emotional Insight?](/wiki/Do_All_Malivore_Monsters_Provide_This_Level_of_Emotional_Insight%3F), Hope performed a locator spell to track the [gremlin](/wiki/Legacies_Season_Three_Minor_Characters#Do_All_Malivore_Monsters_Provide_This_Level_of_Emotional_Insight?)using his \"goo\" or molted skin and tracked it to a field where it had taken Cleo. In [All's Well That Ends Well](/wiki/All%27s_Well_That_Ends_Well), Hope attempted to track Cleo with a locator spell but she cloaked herself to prevent Hope from finding her. Alternatively, Hope had to find her the old-fashioned way and transformed into her werewolf form. In [I Was Made To Love You](/wiki/I_Was_Made_To_Love_You), Alaric believed that the person responsible for the new influx of Malivore monsters was the Necromancer. To confirm his theory and prove that he escaped Malivore, Josie agreed to cast a locator spell using her blood and the Necromancer's grimoire. The spell led them to a funeral home. In [One Day You Will Understand](/wiki/One_Day_You_Will_Understand), Hope performed a locator spell to track down Landon after they were reunited.

In [Fate's A Bitch, Isn't It?](/wiki/Fate%27s_A_Bitch,_Isn%27t_It%3F), Hope performed a locator spell with her and Ryan Clarke's blood. Ryan misled Hope, initially letting her believe he was still a golem and, as such, his Malivore mud would be able to track him. Ryan, however, was not wrong and his blood led them to Malivore, though in his vessel, Landon. Similarly, Cleo performed a locator spell using the sculpture that she stole from the DaVinci art exhibit. As she performed the spell, the sculpture melted and pooled on a map of Alexandria, Virginia. Since the mud did not move, she believed the spell failed, but in truth Malivore was standing right in front of her, though in his vessel, Landon. In [We All Knew This Day Was Coming](/wiki/We_All_Knew_This_Day_Was_Coming), Lizzie performed this spell, along with other witches, in their attempt to locate Malivore and Ethan.

This resulted in her getting a small nosebleed due to using too much magic in a short amount of time. In [Do Not Go Gentle](/wiki/Do_Not_Go_Gentle), Bonnie Bennett specifically performs this spell to locate Esther after her resurrection, though the spell failed because Esther was channeling more power than that of Bonnie's. In [I Thought You'd Be Happier To See Me](/wiki/I_Thought_You%27d_Be_Happier_To_See_Me), Hope assumes that Freya spelled her necklace so they would be able to track her. To keep her family away from her, she returns the necklace to Rebekah. In [You're A Long Way From Home](/wiki/You%27re_A_Long_Way_From_Home), Finch is tasked to watch over maps spelled to track Hope but believes that Hope is just going around in a big circle.

Josie finally realized how selfish Lizzie was and refused Lizzie's attempts at reconciliation. The argument continued until Lizzie blamed Josie for being just as codependent on her as she was with Josie, that despite being awful and needy, Josie was happy to hide and be the one that everyone hated because she was too scared to be herself. Josie brushed off Lizzie's comment and told her that she'd come back for the part where she'd beg for her forgiveness. Upset, Lizzie siphoned magic from one of [Esther's Grimoires](/wiki/Esther%27s_Grimoires)to attack, while Josie siphoned from the wall of the Salvatore school to defend.

After Hope found Josie, her dark alter ego confronted them both. Hope attempted to stop her with the Icaeus spell, but 'dark' Josie siphoned the spell as it came towards her. In [This is What It Takes](/wiki/This_is_What_It_Takes), Hope used the Mittent incantation against Alaric after he pulled her out of the therapy box. She was determined to stay within the box, with that version of Landon, and refused to say the word that otherwise would have released her. She believed that the box was Alaric's attempt to get her to give up on searching for Landon. However, if that was Alaric's intentions, then he wouldn't have pulled her from the box early. In [One Day You Will Understand](/wiki/One_Day_You_Will_Understand), Cleo shares her memories of her past with Kaleb.

In modern day Mystic Falls, the original vessel for Malivore, the Vitruvian Man attacked Hope and Landon.

In [I Thought You'd Be Happier To See Me](/wiki/I_Thought_You%27d_Be_Happier_To_See_Me), Lizzie and Josie travel through Alaric's memories. On their eleventh birthday, Josie remembers that Hope, who wasn't invited, turned their cake filling into worms and Lizzie retaliated with a Motus spell.

In [The Story of My Life](/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Life), Hope used the Motus spell to take Lizzie's Red Oak stake.

In [One Day You Will Understand](/wiki/One_Day_You_Will_Understand), while Cleo was sharing her memories with Kaleb, she showed Kaleb how she performed this spell to stop her grandmother from giving herself over to Malivore. In her place, Cleo offered herself so that she could protect her grandmother who would continue to protect the village. While Landon and Hope were returning to the Salvatore School with the artifact, they were attacked by the Vitruvian Man.

Even in this initial stage, Freya believed she could successfully cast the spell, despite that the spirit of Eva Sinclair was powerful. She suggested that she would place the body into a deep sleep and once the spell was cast, she'd be fine. Klaus, however, did not trust Freya and wanted an impartial third party to verify Freya's spell; specifically Davina. Freya doubted that she'd be able to understand her magic, nor have the power to execute it. Additionally, should the host regain control of their body, as did with Eva, the possessing spirit would be lost within the host's subconscious mind, as evident with Rebekah. [Kenning](/wiki/Kenning)Spell: A spell that allows a witch to enter the minds of others and use them as proxies, seeing through their eyes, talking through their mouths, controlling their actions and, if need be, grant them a fraction of their power.

According to Niklaus, beings such as Originals and Hybrids have far stronger minds to be invaded by any Kenning Spell. In [When the Levee Breaks](/wiki/When_the_Levee_Breaks), Dahlia healed and used this spell upon Josephine, reanimating her body to send a message to Klaus and his siblings. In [Fire with Fire](/wiki/Fire_with_Fire), Dahlia used this spell to lure a half a dozen victims to her so that she could have Klaus feed on them, regaining his strength from being daggered. - Passenger Spell: Common spell used by the Travelers to possess another to become a [Passenger](/wiki/Passenger)in someone else's body. - Incantation: Jaryakat / vas.

A single candle placed at each corner's edge, with each side lined with four dark objects. Within the rhombus, Hayley holds Hope, the possessed target. Each point of the rhombus just crosses the square's face, directing the portion of the spirit to its vessel. - Used by: In [The Feast of All Sinners](/wiki/The_Feast_of_All_Sinners), Vincent prepared this ritual to split apart the Hollow's spirit to confine it within the Mikaelsons. Vincent and Freya were successful and removed the Hollow's spirit from Hope, dividing and confining her spirit within Klaus, Elijah, Kol, and Rebekah. However, to the Hollow's spirit not to regain her full control, they would have to remain separated for all time, from each other as well as Hope. While in New Orleans, the Hollow was able to \"whisper\" to the Originals, tempting them to draw them back together, though Vincent claimed the further they were apart, the less it would be apparent. - Bloodline Possession Spell: A spell that will transfer the spirit of a blood relative to another, so that when one dies, they will be able to possess a new host.

Once the Hollow died, her spirit managed to over take Hope and an ouroboros sigil appeared on the host's arm. - Spirit Confinement Reversal Spell: A direct reversal spell to the Spirit Confinement spell. The spell summons forth pieces of a previously split spirit and confines the recently reunited, whole spirit to the casting witch's body, acting as the new vessel. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Vessels holding the Hollow's spirit (Four Immortal Vampires, related by blood to the possessed target) within a salt square, absent of bisecting designs.

Three candles are placed at each corner's edge, with each side, at its center, with a bowl of blood between two candles. Within the center of the square, seven candles are placed. - Used by: In [The Kindness of Strangers](/wiki/The_Kindness_of_Strangers), Freya helped Hope prepare this spell to remove the dark magic of the Hollow from members of her family. Ultimately, Hope was successful at removing and reuniting the four pieces of the Hollow's spirit back into her body, acting as the new vessel. However, the resulting consequences were that Hope would hear the constant whispers of the Hollow as well as become afflicted with her dark magic, only able to quell the darkness by purging the magic through violence. Power Manipulation Spells[ ] Power Manipulation spells allow witches to manipulate the magic within a witch or object. They can transfer, cancel, add, subtract or most commonly, disrupt a source of magic, affecting its power. The effects of these spells are typically temporary with objects. - Halting Spell: The spell stops the flow of a witch's magic, canceling out any spell that is being performed or magic that is being channeled. The spell can either be performed on the witch casting the spell or the person that is being channeled. - Jonas' First In [The Jonas Martin performed this spell on his son, Luka, to break Bonnie's connection to him and prevent her from channeling him. In [The Dinner Party](/wiki/The_Dinner_Party), Jonas Martin used this spell as punishment to either strip or block Bonnie's access to her magic, leaving her powerless. His spell required physical contact to perform the spell. The latter is more likely as Bonnie was a, then, inexperienced witch and, to date, no other witch has demonstrated such a spell to forcefully take another witch's magic, only to willingly give it up. In [The House Guest](/wiki/The_House_Guest), he grabbed her and released the spell over her. In [Death and the Maiden](/wiki/Death_and_the_Maiden), [Silas](/wiki/Silas)used this spell to stop Qetsiyah's anchor transference ritual. The conflict of opposing magics caused strong winds to blow throughout the house and caused a power outage. In [Home](/wiki/Home), [Luke](/wiki/Lucas_Parker)used this spell to neutralize Liv's magic, which in turn stopped her spell to overwhelm the anchor. This later resulted in Damon being unable to pass through the Anchor. More powerful witches, such as the case with Luke and Liv, halting another witch's powers can result in the weaker witch being knocked unconscious. Qetsiyah, on the other hand, was at least equal in power to Silas and otherwise, physically unaffected. - Traveler Channeling Spell: One of the more powerful spells of Traveler Witches, the spell infuses the casting witch with a substantial amount of power with the use of doppelg\u00e4nger blood, allowing the witch to channel the power of every single Traveler. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Traveler Magic, Doppelg\u00e4nger Blood - Used by: In [Promised Land](/wiki/Promised_Land), [Markos](/wiki/Markos)performed this spell to bestow upon himself great power, enough to single-handedly fight off Damon with no effort.

Physical contact with the object or witch where the magic will be stored or sent, respectively. - Used by: Shortly before the original Merge between Josette Parker and Kai was to take place, she originally performed this spell so that Kai would not be able to complete the Merge. Once again in [Let Her Go](/wiki/Let_Her_Go), many years after giving up her magic she would perform this spell on Kai, transferring her magic to him, as he was dying from the altered Merge ritual with Luke. Ultimately, this saved her and the rest of her Coven from 'oblivion' as Kai would state. In [Facing Darkness is Kinda My Thing](/wiki/Facing_Darkness_is_Kinda_My_Thing), using a similar spell as her mother, Josie willingly gave up her power to siphon. She told Alaric that she'd give them up just for a while until she was ready to use it. She stored her power within a coin. In [Hold on Tight](/wiki/Hold_on_Tight), after Josie helped Lizzie save MG, she placed her siphon power back into her coin and asked Lizzie to hold on to it. She told Lizzie that she's still not ready to do magic again after being consumed with black magic and wanted to live a non-witch life, at least for a bit or however long it takes. - Bonnie's Magic-Relinquishment Spell: The spell allows a witch to freely give up their magic by placing it into an object and sending it through to another dimension. - Incantation: Sangina Mearma un magica - Requirements: Physical contact with the object - Used by: In [Do You Remember the First Time?](/wiki/Do_You_Remember_the_First_Time%3F), Bonnie performed this spell while in the 1994 Prison World to prevent Kai from taking her magic and freeing himself. She sent her magically imbued teddy bear, Mr. Cuddles, back to the mortal plane where it was later found by Caroline. - Magic-Reclamation Spell: The spell will reunite a witch who has relinquished their magic with it by holding the object in which they placed their power, by calling upon the elements of air and fire. - Incantation: Lectos espiritox. - Requirements: The object imbued with the - Used by: In [Christmas Through Your Eyes](/wiki/Christmas_Through_Your_Eyes), Josette performed this spell under Kai's command, as well as to protect Liv from Kai, to reunite with her magic. In [Let Her Go](/wiki/Let_Her_Go), Bonnie, using Silas' Tombstone which contained Qetsiyah's calcified blood, reclaimed her magic, presumably by absorbing the magic of her ancestor. In [Hold on Tight](/wiki/Hold_on_Tight), Josie temporarily reclaimed her siphon power to help Lizzie save MG from Alyssa. At MG's reassurance, they gave Alyssa the chance to do the right thing and, together, they were able to stop the Necromancer and Malivore. In [You Can't Run From Who You Are](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Run_From_Who_You_Are), Josie reclaimed her siphon power after coming to terms with her own identity and speaking with her subconscious. - Siphoning Spell: A unique spell that can only be used in conjunction with [Siphoning](/wiki/Siphoning), allowing a siphoner-witch to absorb the magic of a certain spell or source of magic, granting them power. The unraveling of large spells releases energy that can cause wind storms and dissolve metal. Alternatively, they can siphon sources of magic and redirect it without absorbing the magic themselves. - Kai's Incantation: Magia tollox terras. Solvo. - Requirements: Physical contact with the earth holding the magic (Kai); Salt boundary spell and eight torches or ten candles (Lizzie and Josie) - Used by: In [Christmas Through Your Eyes](/wiki/Christmas_Through_Your_Eyes), Kai performed this spell to extract all of the Traveler magic from their purifying spell and absorb it, which gave him access to a great amount of power. In [The Tale of Two Wolves](/wiki/The_Tale_of_Two_Wolves)Klaus approached Caroline for help with curing Hope of her magical affliction caused by the Hollow's dark magic; specifically the help of Lizzie and Josie, as they are siphon witches. That night under the full moon as Hope began her first transformation into a werewolf, Lizzie and Josie performed the spell, siphoning the dark magic that was the Hollow's spirit out from Hope. They drew the Hollow's essence into a salt boundary spell and proceeded to send her spirit into Klaus. In [Facing Darkness is Kinda My Thing](/wiki/Facing_Darkness_is_Kinda_My_Thing), Lizzie performed this spell on Josie, who was consumed by dark magic. Per Alaric's agreement, Lizzie transferred the dark magic into the Necromancer in exchange for the complete resurrection of Rafael, Alyssa, and Chad as well as for the Necromancer to sever his ties with them. In [Goodbyes Sure Do Suck](/wiki/Goodbyes_Sure_Do_Suck), Hope and Lizzie wanted to modify and reforge Ryan's Trident as a means to save Rafael from dying. Lizzie could then use it in conjunction with her siphon power to transfer energy instead of consciousness. Specifically, she would transfer Landon's phoenix energy into Rafael, sparing him though turning Landon into a mortal human in the process. As Lizzie began the spell, she discovered that there was no magic within Landon to siphon, as the Golden Arrow already killed off the phoenix part of him. - Creating a Focus of Magic: A spell that allows a witch to channel a large amount of magic, creating a focal point of power. It can be used to attract untrained witches drawn to large sources of power such as newborn siphoners. It is implied that the spell can tax the user to the point of death when performed by one witch if magic is taken more that they can give. - Incantation: [Valerie](/wiki/Valerie_Tulle), [Mary Louise](/wiki/Mary_Louise), [Nora](/wiki/Nora_Hildegard)and [Beau](/wiki/Beau), though Valerie remained to stay behind once the arrival of the [Huntress](/wiki/Rayna_Cruz)caused Beau's wound to reopen. Later Bonnie assisted Valerie in the spell to continue to create a focus of magic strong enough to attract Alaric's unborn children, who were at the time siphoning Caroline's vampirism and making it impossible for the Doctors to perform a C-section. - Sacrificial Channeling Spell: A spell that allows a witch to kill and channel the power and strength of a supernatural creature. The spell requires the sacrifice(s) to be placed within a symbol drawn on the ground. The process is normally fatal although in the case of Original vampires, the spell desiccates them when enacted. - Incantation: Symbole du masque et de l'ombre, embrace-toi. Sacrificial Magic [Dance Back from the Grave](/wiki/Dance_Back_from_the_Grave), [Papa Tunde](/wiki/Papa_Tunde)performed this spell on a large number of vampires, including the Original vampire, Rebekah Mikaelson to fuel his strength. While the spell killed all of the non-original vampires and only provided Tunde with a finite amount of power, it did, however, desiccate Rebekah, providing him with an infinite power source. Later, a similar, yet altered (using a different symbol) spell was used by [Finn Mikaelson](/wiki/Finn_Mikaelson), possessing Vincent Griffith, on his parents for power in [Gonna Set Your Flag On Fire](/wiki/Gonna_Set_Your_Flag_On_Fire). The difference in this spell is that Esther, who was a vampire, was not killed as a result of the spell like the victims of Tunde. [Eva Sinclair](/wiki/Eva_Sinclair)intended to use a similar version on multiple New Orleans Witches to complete [The Rite of Nines](/wiki/The_Rite_of_Nines). She continued to gather her targets in [They All Asked For You](/wiki/They_All_Asked_For_You). As she linked each target she would carve a sacrificial symbol on their foreheads, whom she would sacrifice once she had all the necessary components in [Exquisite Corpse](/wiki/Exquisite_Corpse). - Disruption Spell: The spell will neutralize all forms of magic in a certain place exactly for one minute. This includes all forms of spells and magical objects. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: A circle of salt, 4 candles - Used by: In [Gonna Set Your Flag On Fire](/wiki/Gonna_Set_Your_Flag_On_Fire), Davina and Kol performed this spell to disrupt Finn's boundary spell for a minute. - Overpowering Spell: A powerful spell that allows a witch to channel a great amount of power from different sources and pass it onto an already strong power source to overload the witch channeling that power source. The targeted witch will then be forced to either break the link to their power source, which would leave them weakened, or die from the overwhelming power. - Incantation: Los triforce com\u00e8te. Los triforce com\u00e8te. - Requirements: Various sources of power to be channeled, such as the dark magic of Dark Objects or and Original through Sacrificial Magic - Used by: In [The Devil is Damned](/wiki/The_Devil_is_Damned), Kol and Rebekah Mikaelson performed this spell together to force Finn to break his link to his sacrificial offerings (Mikael and Esther). By overloading his power source with the channeled power of dozens of dark objects (including the white oak stake) as well as Klaus himself acting as a sacrificial offering and an endless supply of magic, Rebekah and Kol were able to overload Finn's magic. Had he not cut himself off from his sacrifices, he would have disintegrated from the inside out. - Safe-house Spell: A powerful spell that uses a traditional blessing in conjunction with a disruption spell to prevent the use of magic within the boundaries and form a barrier against anyone who wishes to do harm upon a witch. It was powerful enough to last even after the caster's death and warrant Dahlia's wary. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Line of salt to dictate the boundary - Used by: In [Night Has A Thousand Eyes](/wiki/Night_Has_A_Thousand_Eyes), the Witch Regent, [Josephine LaRue](/wiki/Josephine_LaRue)performed this spell on Infirmary](/wiki/St._James_Infirmary)at the request of [Elijah](/wiki/Elijah_Mikaelson)to protect [Hope](/wiki/Hope_Mikaelson)from [Dahlia](/wiki/Dahlia).

It's also worthy to note that Freya was attempting to channel him prior, though he fought her, denying her his power, as he thought that saving her or any of his vampire siblings wasn't worth the effort. Furthermore, even with Finn's magic and Elijah's blood, she nearly succumbed to the poison that was meant to kill her until Jackson arrived with the antidote. Even with the proper ingredients, the antidote to her poison, and Finn's magic, it wasn't enough to completely reverse the Insanity Curse. - Safe-House Disenchantment Spell: A powerful spell that wears away the protective magics of a spell that disables magic meant to do harm, thus allowing magic to flourish once again. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Six white candles, chalk hand prints - Used by: In [The Devil Comes Here and Sighs](/wiki/The_Devil_Comes_Here_and_Sighs), [Van Nguyen](/wiki/Van_Nguyen)as the new Regent and channeling the Ancestors performs a spell on the safe house at [St. James Infirmary](/wiki/St._James_Infirmary)to wear away the magic that prevented harm by magic so that Kol would be free to lose control and attack innocents. The spell acted as a countdown as the magic wore aware of the original spell, each candle lighting as the spell progressed. Should all six candles be lit, it would indicate the spell's completion. - Davina and Vincent's Disenchantment Spell: A powerful spell that disrupts and counters the effects of disruption magic. - Incantation: Anpae kata sispann dife - Requirements: Two or more witches - Used by: In [The Devil Comes Here and Sighs](/wiki/The_Devil_Comes_Here_and_Sighs), Davina and Vincent performed the spell over the altar where Van performed his disruption spell to counter the effects of the Safe-House Disenchantment Spell. - Tapping into The Ancestral Well of Magic Spell: An extremely powerful spell that allows a non-ancestral witch to tap into and use the ancestral magic that is typically only granted by the ancestral spirits to the Regent. The spell is performed forcefully and requires a conduit between two planes of existence. - Incantation: An et ne van \u00e7a le eu. Che ke \u00e7a le aun - Requirements: Conduit between two planes (dead ancestral witch with a foothold) - Used by: In [Where Nothing Stays Buried](/wiki/Where_Nothing_Stays_Buried), Freya forcefully performed this spell through Davina's spirit, who had been manifested through a [Hand of Glory](/wiki/The_Hand_of_Glory). Even in spirit form, the amount of magic that was passing through Davina caused her to suffer as her eyes and nose started bleeding. - Sacrificial Empowering Spell: An extremely dark spell that calls for sacrificial magic to imbue the caster with incredible magic, though it requires the sacrifice of something that is \"truly loved\". The Sacrificial Magic Instruction manual details this specific spell and the sacrifices are not made to the Ancestors of New Orleans but something darker and far older.

By channeling the totem, it allows one access to a witch spirit's magic, giving the caster knowledge otherwise not known. This spell also leaves the casting witch vulnerable to the spirit being called upon through the represented totem. - Incantation: Din merkke otimo sekre - Requirements: Representational and of the Witch Spirit - Used by: In [I Hear You Knocking](/wiki/I_Hear_You_Knocking), Freya performed this spell to access the Hollow, it's magic and to perceive it's intentions for Klaus and Marcel. This left her open to its darkness though it remains to be seen if she was affected by the Hollow. While in a trance-like state while chanting, the Hollow manifested itself as a ball of light and Keelin intervened, saving her. - Disempowerment Boundary Spell: A spell that is able to neutralize a witch's magic while bound within a small radius of intertwined vines. Once a witch enters the circle, they cannot leave on their own volition. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Vines - Used by: In [High Water and a Devil's Daughter](/wiki/High_Water_and_a_Devil%27s_Daughter), Freya performed this spell to trap and interrogate Dominic for info to stop the Hollow. - Magic Bestowal Spell: A spell that bestows magic upon a Mother's unborn baby during her pregnancy. - Incantation: Neltoca teoyohtica...

It should also be noted that spirit or Astral forms of witches and non-witches alike can be willingly or forced out of one's own body into localized astral worlds, also known as a Chambre de Chasse. Advanced forms of projection can (i.e. Teleportation, Bilocation and Dimensional Transcending spells) allow witches to travel between different [planes of existence](/wiki/Dimensions) in addition to the manipulation of space around themselves or objects, i.e. localized teleportation. Known objects that have been teleported have typically been used to send a message; see Message Spells. - Spirit Projection Spell: A spell that is able to transport the spiritual body of a person to another area within the world. However, whatever happens to the spiritual body of the witch will be inflicted on their physical form. - Incantation: Phasmatos Tribum, Nas Ex Nas Metam. - Another witch to anchor their body - Used by: In [The House Guest](/wiki/The_House_Guest)Jonas Martin, performed this spell with his son, Luka, sending his spiritual form to find and undagger Elijah. Unlike the basic form of Spirit Projection, Jonas augmented the spell to give Luka tangibility (to grab the dagger), yet was still invisible and went unnoticed by enhanced vampiric senses. - The Other Side Transcending Spell: The spell stops the heart of the witch who is performing the spell to induce death, while tethering them to their body. This allows the witch to successfully enter the Other Side and even bring someone back with them if they are powerful enough. - Incantation: - Used by: In [Growing Pains](/wiki/Growing_Pains)Bonnie Bennett performed this spell to pull Elena's spirit from the Other Side and stop her transition into a vampire.

Should the banished target(s) die within the prison world, it will bring them back to life as if the death never occurred. - of a Bennett witch - Used by: In [Fade Into You](/wiki/Fade_Into_You)Joshua Parker, and his [coven](/wiki/Gemini_Coven), performed this spell upon his son, Kai, after he slaughtered his siblings while he was under the ruse that the coven was gathering to channel eclipse for the Merge ceremony. In [Let Her Go](/wiki/Let_Her_Go), it was revealed that the Gemini Coven previously banished the Heretics to the first prison world in 1903. Kai assumed that the Coven attempted the spell a second time in [I'm Thinking Of You All The While](/wiki/I%27m_Thinking_Of_You_All_The_While)though it was later revealed that the spell has another purpose than to trap a target within a prison world. In [It's Been a Hell of a Ride](/wiki/It%27s_Been_a_Hell_of_a_Ride), Bonnie taught Josie and Lizzie the spell, with her own added twist, and banished Kai back to the newly created February 17, 2018 prison world with no eclipse or Bennett blood to free himself. In [Kai Parker Screwed Us](/wiki/Kai_Parker_Screwed_Us), it's revealed that, previously, Bonnie and the Saltzmans either used a full moon, a meteor shower, or both to banish Kai to his newly created Prison World. Since then, [Emma Tig](/wiki/Emma_Tig), at Alaric's request and Caroline's sympathy, banished Jade, Wendy and Diego to Kai's prison world when they killed various students in [2018](/wiki/Timeline)and then [Sebastian](/wiki/Sebastian)in 2028.

She later performed the same spell to send her magic-infused teddy bear to the mortal plane in [Do You Remember the First Time?](/wiki/Do_You_Remember_the_First_Time%3F). Off screen, Kai would perform this spell, using Bonnie's blood to free himself. In [Let Her Go](/wiki/Let_Her_Go), she performed the 1994 spell for a final time to free herself. In [A Bird in a Gilded Cage](/wiki/A_Bird_in_a_Gilded_Cage)She would later perform the 1903 spell to free herself, Damon, Elena and Lily from the Prison World, while leaving Kai behind. In [I'd Leave My Happy Home For You](/wiki/I%27d_Leave_My_Happy_Home_For_You), Kai performed the 1903 liberation spell to free himself and Lily's 'family'. In [Goodbyes Sure Do Suck](/wiki/Goodbyes_Sure_Do_Suck), Hope and Lizzie ran out of options to heal Rafael. To save him, Hope had the idea to give Rafael peace as he defined it. Using the coven ascendant and a visible supernova the witches were able to banish Rafael to the unoccupied 2028 prison world. They would also send his parents, [Walt](/wiki/Walt)and [Lucia](/wiki/Lucia)who agreed to go with him, so that he wouldn't be alone. - Prison World Transportation Spell: The spell allows a witch to transport a set amount of people (or objects) to one of the Prison Worlds. According to Kai, there is a limit to the amount of people one witch can transport, implying two at most, while more witches can transport more people. - 1994's Prison World Incantation: Sanguinem illum acento... Meam Et Nos Mundo Carcerema. - Requirements: Ascendant, Blood of a Bennett witch, Celestial event or the Gemini Coven's Leader - Used by: In [Home](/wiki/Home), Sheila assured Bonnie that when the Other Side collapsed, she would be okay. In her last moments Bonnie and Damon, who she had physical contact with by holding his hand, were transported to the 1994 prison world to escape the Other Side's destruction. In [I Alone](/wiki/I_Alone)Liv performed the 1994 Transportation spell to send Elena and Damon to the prison, using Lucy Bennett's blood, to go in and free Bonnie. In [A Bird in a Gilded Cage](/wiki/A_Bird_in_a_Gilded_Cage), Bonnie Bennett and Kai Parker performed this spell to transport themselves, Elena and Damon to the 1903 Prison World. In [This is Why We Don't Entrust Plans to Muppet Babies](/wiki/This_is_Why_We_Don%27t_Entrust_Plans_to_Muppet_Babies), the various covens and witches of the Salvatore School used this spell to send the mora miserium to the newly created 2028 prison world. However, unknown to Lizzie and Josie, Alyssa linked the newly created ascendant to the 2018 ascendant and sent it to the wrong prison world. Additionally, Alyssa placed a time delay spell on the linking spell so that Lizzie, Josie, and Alaric would also be transported to the 2018 prison world. In [Goodbyes Sure Do Suck](/wiki/Goodbyes_Sure_Do_Suck), the Salvatore witches transport the student body to the 2028 prison world to say their goodbyes to Rafael, who's body couldn't be heal after the Necromancer severed his connection to his former acolyte. In [Hold on Tight](/wiki/Hold_on_Tight), Lizzie, Josie, and Alyssa created the 2029 prison world to banish Hope all the Malivore monsters that were linked to the Necromancer. After its creation they moved all the spells that Alyssa linked to their world to the prison world, freeing both her and MG from the Necromancer's plot to raise all the previously consumed Malivore monsters. In [Long Time, No See](/wiki/Long_Time,_No_See), Hope essentially forced Lizzie to perform the transportation spell in order to travel to the 2029 prison world to rescue Landon. Lizzie opted to spare Josie from performing the spell because she is her blind spot and didn't want her to go through with using magic. Using a planetary transit, the ascendant, and Bennett blood, Hope and Lizzie performed the spell within a circle of candles, however, when they began the spell, Lizzie began to experience pain. Josie recognized it as dark magic and reasoned that the Necromancer was full of it when they trapped him, thus, the prison world must be 'radioactive' with it. Since they opened a portal, it was infecting them. Josie pleaded with them to sever the connection, but Lizzie couldn't let go of the ascendant. Hope, however, encouraged her to push through the pain no matter the cost. Josie also steps through the circle and grabs hold of Lizzie, sharing her pain and was infected with dark magic, but before the spell could continue Landon appeared and struck the ascendant, sending a shockwave of magic through the air, knocking them backwards. In [We All Knew This Day Was Coming](/wiki/We_All_Knew_This_Day_Was_Coming), Hope asked Lizzie and Josie to perform the spell and send her to the 2028 prison world to talk to Rafael. She plans on becoming a fully activated tribrid and killing Malivore will kill Landon in the process. - Prison World Astral Projection Spell: A spell used to send one or more people to the prison world albeit partially where people existing in the prison world are unable to see, hear or touch them. However, with enough power, the witch is able to give the targets a tangible presence, allow them to physically interact with the world. - Incantation: Phasmatos Tribum, Invocia Cavea, Misero vessels passing through, Incomplete Ascendant / Chalk circle with various personal objects, chalk symbol in the center. - Used by: In [The Day I Tried To Live](/wiki/The_Day_I_Tried_To_Live), Kai Parker used this spell on Elena, Damon and Jeremy, allowing their spirits to access the prison world to send a message to Bonnie. The spell was evidently powerful enough to allow physical interaction (an astral form) with the Prison World when performed with a single person, as seen when Jeremy held the map. Though Kai's power was fleeting and susceptible to the overuse of his magic. In [You Can't Save Them All](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Save_Them_All), Hope performs this or a similar spell to astral project to the 2018 Prison World. In doing so, only Josie could see her. They warn Hope about Kai escaping through Malivore, but Hope believes he's already at the school. After Josie frees them from the Prison World, Lizzie, with Josie's help, astral projects to the collapsing dimension. She tells Sebastian about the Malivore pit in Fort Valley, Georgia. It's a door to another dimension and she wants him to dive into it, and maybe he can escape. After telling him, she vanishes. In [This is What It Takes](/wiki/This_is_What_It_Takes), Lizzie performs this spell to astral project into the 2029 prison world, using MG as a supernatural source to siphon from to power the spell. Once in the world, they find an apocalyptic version of Mystic falls as they roam the town looking for Landon. After sending MG back to his body, Lizzie remained for a while longer until she returned to her body. Unlike Kai's usage of the spell, Lizzie seemed to not need the ascendant, despite being destroyed. Kai destroyed his ascendent so that it couldn't be used again, although he could still perform the spell given that a crown wheel survived. In [Long Time, No See](/wiki/Long_Time,_No_See), Hope believed that Landon was alive and trapped within the prison world or Malivore, who was trapped in the prison world. Alaric wouldn't sign off on using the ascendent to go to the prison world without credible proof that Landon was alive. With Lizzie as her supernatural fact checker, they prepared the spell by drawing a chalk circle with intricate symbols and some of Landon's personal items. Once complete, they astral projected to the 2029 prison world and eventually found proof that Landon was alive. In [You Can't Run From Who You Are](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Run_From_Who_You_Are), Hope performed this spell and brought Landon with her to the 2029 prison world to speak to the Necromancer. Taking a page from Kai's playbook, she intended to sever the Necromancer's ties to the prison world which would cause the dimension to collapse in on itself, destroying everything inside of it, including Malivore. However, their plans were halted when they found the Necromancer's corpse dismembered and attacked by a [berbalang](/wiki/Category:Supernatural). [Chambre de Chasse](/wiki/Chambre_de_Chasse)Spell: An elaborate spell that creates a localized astral plane commonly used as a prison where witches bring their targets for mental target practice.

In [A Streetcar Named Desire](/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire), a Strix witch named [Cynthia](/wiki/The_Originals_Season_Three_Minor_Characters#A_Streetcar_Named_Desire)performed the same spell on Tristan, then pulled in Aurora so that they could reunite. The witch would later pull in Klaus and Elijah so that Aurora and Tristan could torment the two while the other Strix witches could unlink their sirelines. In [God's Gonna Trouble the Water](/wiki/God%27s_Gonna_Trouble_the_Water), an unknown witch performed this spell and transported both Elijah and Klaus' mind into the Chambre de Chasse. In [The Kindness of Strangers](/wiki/The_Kindness_of_Strangers), it was revealed that Freya constructed an elaborate replica of the Abattoir from her first visit with her family in 1914 for Hope. While Freya kept her siblings busy, Hope gathered Rebekah and Kol to draw back in the darkness of the Hollow, end the [curses](/wiki/Seer#Prophecies), and keep the firstborns safe. It was initially believed that Hope constructed the Chambre de Chasse, however, it contained the music room that Kol showed to Freya which was later wiped out by a storm; a room that Hope would have no knowledge of. Freya constructed the Chambre so that a key was hidden in meaningful locations throughout the Abattoir that were connected to Klaus, Rebekah, Elijah, and Kol. To continue her ruse, she too had a lock and key, though after she was exposed by Kol, she left the Chambre of her own accord. Once all four keys were found, they could leave through the door that led into a portion of Elijah's \"mental maze\". There, they could leave through their own separate doors that would return them to their bodies. While they hunted for their keys, Hope also sent Marcel into the Chambre to stop him from continuing her spell. In [We All Knew This Day Was Coming](/wiki/We_All_Knew_This_Day_Was_Coming), this is one of the spells that Dorian listed in preparation for the Merge. He believed that if that day ever came, Alaric wouldn't be thinking straight and he'd be fighting until the last second to try and save them. In [The Story of My Life](/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Life), Professor Vardemus had an enchanted Pentelic marble bowl that, when opened, would transport the person into a chambre de chasse.

In [You're A Long Way From Home](/wiki/You%27re_A_Long_Way_From_Home), Cleo reenters the Therapy Box alone and confronts Hope, Red Oak stake in hand. She had a vision of a tree and she should have known that Nature would have created balance near the place of the tribrid's birth.Since she came alone, Hope reasons that she still hasn't told anyone about it, but Cleo wants to test her theory first. Cleo casts this spell as Hope vamps towards her. Cleo teleports behind her and stakes her in the heart from the back. - Astral Projection Spell: A powerful spell that allows a witch to project their visible, astral form of their consciousness across vast distances such as to other continents.

In [For the Next Millennium](/wiki/For_the_Next_Millennium), Freya teleports her astral body from the bar she is partying over to the Bayou at Elijah's request. While he handled the issues concerning the wolves and searching for Hayley, she was able to watch over Hope. Though intoxicated she was able to perform the spell with relative ease. In [You Hung the Moon](/wiki/You_Hung_the_Moon), she returned to her body relinquishing Hope back into Elijah's care, suggesting that the spell can be held for short periods of time, i.e. a couple of hours. In [Beautiful Mistake](/wiki/Beautiful_Mistake), Freya used this spell several times to transport her mind to Rebekah's location on another continent. She also successfully transported both her and Elijah's astral forms to Morocco, to speak to Rebekah. In [Where You Left Your Heart](/wiki/Where_You_Left_Your_Heart), Freya performed this spell so that she could visit with and talk to Keelin, who had left New Orleans for Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. The spell, however, was sensitive and Freya's projection disappeared; adjusting her crystal she was able to re-materialize her projection. In [One Wrong Turn On Bourbon](/wiki/One_Wrong_Turn_On_Bourbon), Hope, who was nine years old, performed this spell to astrally project to her father at an unknown destination. In [God's Gonna Trouble the Water](/wiki/God%27s_Gonna_Trouble_the_Water), Ivy performed this spell as a favor for Klaus since he could not be physically present with Hope during Hayley's funeral. Though weary of her intentions, he accepts her offer and Ivy performs the spell. His astral form is sent back after Emmett and his vampires interrupt the funeral. After explaining the [prophecy](/wiki/Seer#C%C3%A9leste's_Prophecy)and the consequences of the dark magic, she performed the spell again so that he could be with Hope. The second attempt however, resulted in Hope sending his astral body away when she got upset with him. In [We Have Not Long To Love](/wiki/We_Have_Not_Long_To_Love), [Emmett](/wiki/Emmett)had his unnamed witch ally perform an astral projection spell to project his and his vampires' physical form to the Quarter to find out which side Vincent would chose; the vampire or the werewolves.

In [We're Being Punked, Pedro](/wiki/We%27re_Being_Punked,_Pedro), Hope mentioned that she learned this spell from her aunt, Freya, and that it's like a \"full-immersion video chat\". Using the letter that Landon gave to her after leaving with Rafael from their dragon encounter, Hope, with Josie's assistance, was able to astral project to Landon. The spell, however, was cut short because Josie was suffering from \"twin pain\" due to Lizzie's run in with [Salvatore: The Musical!](/wiki/Salvatore:_The_Musical!), [Alyssa Chang](/wiki/Alyssa_Chang)performed an astral projection spell to appear to [MG](/wiki/Milton_Greasley)in his bedroom at the Salvatore School.

In [The Story of My Life](/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Life), Lizzie performed his spell at Hope's command, as she is sire bound to listen, to project herself to MG and inform him of her recent events, such as becoming a witch-vampire hybrid, and explained that she was going to spend some time with her mom to get accustomed to being a vampire. In [Everything That Can Be Lost May Also Be Found](/wiki/Everything_That_Can_Be_Lost_May_Also_Be_Found), working with Alaric and the Mikaelsons, Vincent was able to cast and anchor the astral projection spell to bring Hope's astral body to New Orleans. Alaric placed her unconscious body inside a sigil that enabled Vincent to bring her astral form to them. It was in part because of Klaus' funeral as well as their attempt to get her to switch her humanity back on. Marcel explained that Vincent would drop the spell if she came back with him to spend time with their family, however Rebekah corrected his explanation as she could have left anytime she wanted. Until her humanity flickered, she was keeping herself in New Orleans though Vincent did eventually drop the spell and she was returned back to her mind. In [This Can Only End in Blood](/wiki/This_Can_Only_End_in_Blood), Hope performed an astral projection spell to appear to Ken and issue her own challenge; single combat between her and him after a two hour wait period.

There are two known loopholes to this spell.

The second, non-witches (i.e. vampires) can be given access through living, blood relatives that are New Orleans witches. - Davina's Incantation: Unknown - Vincent's Incantation: Pr\u00e9server a la vie sand, Life-Link, Poison, Dark Magic; Salt circle with four candles on the exterior and four black rocks/gems situated on the interior, being that is neither living nor dead (Ivy in transition) , witch (Vincent) - Used by: In [Wild at Heart](/wiki/Wild_at_Heart), Davina used this spell to gain access to the Ancestral Plane to speak with Kol about her plans for bringing him back. The Sister witch, Ariane, would also utilize a similar spell with Dark magic to enter the sacred afterlife dimension. It is interesting to note that she did not require a life-link, suggesting her magic alone sustained and/or brought her back. She would pass on the knowledge of this magic to Davina after her link to Josh was severed, unbeknownst to her, by Ariane herself. In [Give 'Em Hell Kid](/wiki/Give_%27Em_Hell_Kid), Vincent, while channeling Josh and bringing along Kol used this spell to access the Ancestral plane to untether it from the human plane. In [Voodoo in My Blood](/wiki/Voodoo_in_My_Blood), the four new 2019 Harvest Girls, [Amy](/wiki/Amy), [Jessica](/wiki/Jessica), Steph, [[2]](#cite_note-2)and an unnamed witch, exploited a loophole of this spell by using Hayley and Klaus' blood, which is tied to a New Orleans Witch (i.e. Hope), to give them an audience with the Ancestors, allowing them to transverse the Ancestral plane. Furthermore, by binding the spell to a salt circle, Davina was able to exploit the spell to physically appear before those who sought to free Klaus. This also functioned as the spell's weakness so that if the circle was broken Davina would be sent back to the Ancestral Plane whereas Klaus would be returned to the mortal plane. In [There in the Disappearing Light](/wiki/There_in_the_Disappearing_Light), Vincent performed his second incantation with Ivy, who in this rare instance, was neither of the world of the living or the dead, allowing her to traverse between the two. Exploiting this loophole, Vincent was able to come with her so he could show her first hand of the 'peace' she claimed to have foresaw within the Ancestral Well. Once within the Ancestral Plane, it was dark and cold and the witch spirits languished in horror. - Davina's Spirit Projection Spell: A spell that is able to transport the spiritual body of a person to another area within the world allowing that form to be unnoticeable to any other being. - Incantation: Mai tu mai lai, mai tu mai lai. - Requirements: Unknown herbs, Iron powder, Candle - Used by: In [Dead Angels](/wiki/Dead_Angels), Davina used this spell to spy upon Klaus and Hayley to gain knowledge of the weapon that could destroy the originals and its whereabouts.

Those that are linked to the immortal cannot die, and should the immortal be neutralized, so will the linked persons. An additional feature is that this spell inhibits the continuation of various poisons that are strong enough to kill powerful witches and original vampires and insanity curses. - Salt, Candles, Runic spellings of the linked targets in Elder Futhark, Blood of each linked target. - Used By: In [The Bloody Crown](/wiki/The_Bloody_Crown), Freya performed this spell, building upon the immortal life link spell from Dahlia and Esther's linking ritual while incorporating a Chambre de Chasse anchored through Klaus' Life.

When the Hollow's Acolytes confronted and stole the book back, Vincent attempted the spell again, channeling Marcel, though even with him, was not strong enough to speak to her spirit, as the living aren't meant to be there. That left Vincent with one option, to die. He took a neurotoxin and died, long enough to get the spell from the Hollow's mother. Vincent also used an hourglass to countdown the time Marcel had to revive him with an antidote, which was administered directly to Vincent's heart via a syringe. - Spirit Banishment Spell: A powerful spell that dates back 1,500 years and adapted to entrap a spirit within a totem or book, making it impossible for them to escape. The original spell was used to kill the body and banish the spirit from the mortal plane. - Vincent's Incantation: Arr\u00eater majik sa \u00e0 - Requirements: Salt Circle to bind a spirit - Used by: In [Voodoo Child](/wiki/Voodoo_Child), Vincent who communed with the Ancestors and the Hollow's mother, performed this spell on the Hollow's spiritual form, attempting to lock her inside her own grimoire for sacrificial magic. Before the spell could be completed, the Hollow's broke Vincent's circle and knocked him unconscious. Returning to possess Hope, she destroyed the book so that it could not be used against her again. - Object Teleportation Spell: A spell that is able to transport an object to another location. - Incantation: Phasmatos lacus. - Requirements: Adept Witch - Used by: In [Death Keeps Knocking On My Door](/wiki/Death_Keeps_Knocking_On_My_Door), the Necromancer resurrected a [Bennett witch](/wiki/Legacies_Season_One_Minor_Characters#Death_Keeps_Knocking_On_My_Door), one of many buried in the local cemetery that excelled in the art of mystical transportation, to transport the supernatural knife to [Malivore](/wiki/Malivore).

She can create holes, or doors, from the Prison World to the mortal plane. However, the magic that she siphons in the Prison World can't travel to the real world. The energy, however, needs to go somewhere, which means that someone will have to remain behind and be the anchor. When it came time to perform the spell, Josie instructed Lizze, Jade, Diego, and Wendy to place the spires in a circle to create a boundary spell. When she begins to siphon, doors will open beneath them and each door can only transport one person. Once she begins the spell, she cannot stop until it is done. With the spires in place, Josie cut her hand, dropping blood on the grimoire that demonstrates the spell and she began to siphon from the Prison World. Portals opened beneath her and the four spires. With Alaric taking Diego's place, Sebastian pushes him through a portal and agrees to become the anchor. All he has to do is place his hand on Josie and the spell is complete. The spell, however, that Josie performed to let them escape made the Prison World unstable and it eventually collapsed in on itself. [Shared Narrative Chambre de Chasse](/wiki/Chambre_de_Chasse): A variation of the Chambre de Chasse spell placed on a device, created by Rupert Vardemus. The [enchanted device](/wiki/Enchanted_Objects)then transfers the psychological concerns of those using it inside the device to form a shared narrative, designed specifically for therapeutic use. Those using the device will be rendered unconscious and have no awareness of the simulation until they reach the end of their narrative and be given an escape word. The order of symbols on the device can be used to increase the box's difficulty to its utmost level. The device also has a single user setting versus a shared narrative. - Incantation: Unknown. - Requirements: Device - Used by: In [There's A Place Where The Lost Things Go](/wiki/There%27s_A_Place_Where_The_Lost_Things_Go), to help address recent and suppressed traumas, Emma, instructed by Alaric, decides to hold a special group lesson. Using a device created by Professor Rupert Vardemus, who is famous in mystical therapeutic circles, it forms a shared narrative, a Chambre de Chasse, between those using it, specifically, Lizzie, Josie, MG, Rafael, Jade, and Hope. Emma, although conscious and self-aware, also uses it to oversee their session. Unbeknownst to Emma or the others, Ryan Clarke previously trapped the real Rupert Vardemus' consciousness within the device and used his identity to infiltrate the school. As the session progressed, Josie, being taken over by her dark magic-filled alter ego alters the device's \"rules,\" expelling the users one by one, starting with Emma until she was alone with Lizzie. Josie hoped to \"kill\" Lizzie so that her mind would be trapped within the device so that her body would wait for her to complete the Merge outside the Chambre de Chasse. In [Life Was So Much Easier When I Only Cared About Myself](/wiki/Life_Was_So_Much_Easier_When_I_Only_Cared_About_Myself), Alaric contacted Professor Vardemus for his help with strengthening the device so that he could use the Chambre de Chasse against Josie, keeping her safe until he and Caroline could help her permanently. Wanting to treat this like a \"monster\" problem, Kaleb and Hope used the box against Alaric. When tensions escalate further with the death of Alyssa, Hope uses the box against Kaleb to keep him from harming Josie. In [This is What It Takes](/wiki/This_is_What_It_Takes), Alaric suggests that Hope uses the \"Therapy Box\". He called Professor Vardemus and learned there's a single user setting. Alaric believed that, with just her in there, it should create one to deal with her specific problem, such as how to get Landon back. It's a desperate move, but Hope agreed. - Repository Monstrum Spell: A spell that uses blood sacrifices to consecrate grounds to tether them to another dimension. - Incantation: Caedis. Fomes. Navigem - In [Hold on Tight](/wiki/Hold_on_Tight), the Necromancer, using sacrificed the principle and six teachers at Mystic Falls High School to consecrate the grounds and tether them to the dimension, Mavliore.

She swooped in before she worked up the courage to stop her. MG mistakes her, thinking she's referring to the destruction of the ascendent, but she doesn't correct him. She tells him to enjoy his pool party and performs the spell to send his spirit back to his body. In [You Can't Run From Who You Are](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Run_From_Who_You_Are), Hope performed this spell on Landon's astral form after they were attacked by the [berbalang](/wiki/Category:Supernatural). She believed she could handle the monster and he could research what it was, should its bite prove more dangerous to her astral form. - Prison World Banishment Reversal Spell: A spell presumably to reverse the force-banishment to a prison world. - Incantation: Aven safa sa belise, de la Can't Run From Who You Are](/wiki/You_Can%27t_Run_From_Who_You_Are), the Necromancer, who had been released from Malivore sought to free himself from the prison world. The Necromancer's [spell](/wiki/File:LGC311-044-Crypt-Spell.png)incorporated various spells from numerous witches in presumably his attempt to create a spell that would force his release from the prison world. It's unknown if the spell had been completed, as various markings on the crypt's wall indicated it may have still been a work-in-progress, or if it would have worked as he was seemingly attacked and dismembered before completing the escape. Protection Spells[ ] Protection spells allow witches to provide protection to a target as a sort of insurance. Protection can vary based on the user's requirements however, most protection spells seen thus far have been used against immediate death. They can come in the form of enchantments such as a daylight ring's protection against sunlight. Protection spells do come with restrictions such as one use per spell or protection from a specific form of death (burning from sunlight, supernatural death etc.) most likely due to nature's rule that all living beings must die. Thus, it is highly likely that protection spells do not cover natural death (old age). It is highly possible that protection spells protect the soul and prevents one from truly dying as they are done beforehand in anticipation of danger/immediate death and dying before casting said spell would require a resurrection spell. - Injury Protection Spell: The spell protects a target, such as a a human, from injuries, even going as far as to allow the body to quickly recover from damaging magical attacks by a witch. - Incantation: Unknown - Used by: In [The Last Dance](/wiki/The_Last_Dance), [Maddox](/wiki/Maddox)performed this spell on Klaus, who was possessing Alaric, to safeguard his essence in resisting and enduring damage taken from Bonnie's magic, who had harnessed the power of the 100 dead witches. As such, he was able to fix the broken limbs inflicted upon him by Bonnie during their battle relatively quickly. - Protection Spell: A powerful spell that allows a witch to prevent themselves from permanently dying and/or from the soul from moving on after \"death\". Casting said spell allows them to resurrect should they meet certain doom. However, it appears to be a one time deal and have to be cast again should they wish to continue avoiding death. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Spirit Magic / Power from 100 witches (Bonnie), Ancestral Magic (C\u00e9leste) - Used by: In [The Last Dance](/wiki/The_Last_Dance), Bonnie Bennett, who had harnessed the power of 100 witches, used this spell before her fight with Klaus when he was possessing Alaric. She ultimately died from overexerting her magic only to revive a short while afterwards in a circle of candles in the [Witch Burial Ground](/wiki/Witch_Burial_Ground)with Jeremy. In [The Casket Girls](/wiki/The_Casket_Girls), C\u00e9leste Dubois (while possessing the witch Sabine Laurent) cast this spell before confronting Davina and Camille at the church. Davina, channeling the power from the other harvest witches proceeded to kill her and the three other witches by magically raising them off the floor and snapping their necks. She revived shortly after without any visible side effects. She was forced to cast it once again by Marcel on Davina to protect her from poisoning. Her speech with Marcel that \"they all should have done the same\", in addition to the speed at which she cast it on Davina, implies that while requiring to be cast again prior to every death, is a fairly common or easy to prepare spell. In [High Water and a Devil's Daughter](/wiki/High_Water_and_a_Devil%27s_Daughter), Dominic reveals that the night prior he cast a protection spell upon himself, that should he die, the Hollow's followers would be able to resurrect him using their Master's power. - Expression Protection Spell: The witch can protect anyone from permanent death simply by focusing. It was cast non-verbally by setting beakers of rock salt on fire. With a possession of the target's, the witch connects to them and allows them to resurrect should they meet certain doom . However, it appears to be a one time deal and have to be cast again should she wish to continue avoiding death. - Requirements: Expression, Rock Salt, Possession of target - Used by: In [After School Special](/wiki/After_School_Special), Bonnie Bennett, having recently graduated from learning expression, cast this spell onto [Shane](/wiki/Atticus_Shane)when he was confronted by Kol. While using the [Necklace](/wiki/Qetsiyah%27s_Talisman)that he just gave her and several beakers of salt for fire, she performed the spell. Though the spell was successful in protecting him from drowning and being impaled in the stomach, due to Bonnie's inexperience with handling expression, it accidentally [linked](/wiki/Linking)him with [April](/wiki/April_Young)such that whatever happened to him was also inflicted on her. - Qetsiyah's Daylight Protection Spell: A powerful enchantment placed upon an area that prevents vampires within to be unharmed by the sun. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Set building - Used by: In [Original Sin](/wiki/Original_Sin), Qetsiyah used this spell on her cabin to Stefan to survive without his daylight ring. This is perhaps an expanded version of the spell that created daylight rings for vampires. - Valerie's Protection Spell: A seemingly powerful spell placed upon individuals to keep them safe and unharmed. Surrounding individuals can also be protected. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Target - Used by: In [We're Planning a June Wedding](/wiki/We%27re_Planning_a_June_Wedding), Caroline mentions that Stafn called in a favor from Valerie. She placed this protection spell over Lizzie and Josie so they'd be safe, no matter what happened at [Stefan and Caroline's wedding](/wiki/Stefan_and_Caroline%27s_wedding), which they planned as a trap for Katherine. When Kelly staged an explosion, Lizzie, Josie, and Bonnie, who was chaperoning them to the restroom, were spared from the fiery blast. Bonnie then taught Lizzie and Josie the fire manipulation spell so that they could save themselves from the surrounding flames. - Protection Counterspell: A counterspell to reverse the effects of a protection spell. - Incantation: Ut non zna samo bol - Requirements: Target - by: In [High Water and a Devil's Daughter](/wiki/High_Water_and_a_Devil%27s_Daughter), Freya performed this spell to break through Dominic's protection spells to make him vulnerable to death. - Compound Protection Spell: A representational spell used to protect a location from harm or malicious intent. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Circle of salt, Representation magic (castle figurine to represent the Compound) - Used by: In [Queen Death](/wiki/Queen_Death), Freya performed this spell to protect the compound, whereas in the previous events she tied a boundary spell to her heart beat. This ensures that if she died a second time, the spell would not falter. - Protection Totem Creation Spell: A blue, glowing, crystalline-like orb that is spelled to augment a witch's magic while it protects them from permanent death, should the witch be killed. As an empowered magical totem, it can also be used to bind certain spells, though when destroyed, the bound spells will be undone. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Crystalline Orb - Used by: In [A Spirit Here That Won't Be Broken](/wiki/A_Spirit_Here_That_Won%27t_Be_Broken), the Hollow created this orb as a means to ensure that she would survive any confrontation with the Mikaelsons and to augment her magic. She gave the orb to Kol to hold on to and to protect, though Klaus later destroyed it, making her vulnerable. Freya has some knowledge regarding such totems as she stated that Dahlia used them as well when she was up to something particularly awful. - Projectile Deflection Spell: A seemingly simple spell that can deflect projectiles of indeterminate size, velocity and trajectory. - Incantation: Projectium deflecto. - Requirements: None - Used by: In [Screw Endgame](/wiki/Screw_Endgame), Hope attempted to cast his spell on herself and Lizzie, while in [the Keeper](/wiki/The_Keeper)'s labyrinth. She seemed confident enough that the spell would protect them from an oncoming, speeding car; however, the spell had no effect as the labyrinth negated magic, including Lizzie's ability to siphon. - Object Protection Spell: A protection spell that casts a protective barrier over an object to prevent it from breaking. - Incantation: Non-verbal - Requirements: None - Used by: In [I Couldn't Have Done This Without You](/wiki/I_Couldn%27t_Have_Done_This_Without_You), Hope insists on helping Josie with protecting the [mora miserium](/wiki/Mora_Miserium)and preventing it from breaking. Together, with Josie siphoning from Hope, casts this spell to envelop the mora miserium in a white light. Despite the spell, the glass began to crack. - Psyche Protection Potion: A protection potion that incorporates a linking spell. The potion's primary purpose is to create a fortified locality with the person's psyche, to keep two consciousnesses separate. The secondary purpose is to link one's life to that of another. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Strand of Landon's hair - Used by: In [Life Was So Much Easier When I Only Cared About Myself](/wiki/Life_Was_So_Much_Easier_When_I_Only_Cared_About_Myself), Hope created this potion for Lizzie so that when she won the Merge, she would have a fortified locality in her own psyche to hold Josie's consciousness separate from her own. After they detox Josie's body of the dark magic, they planned to transfer Josie's consciousness back to her own body. However, unbeknownst to Lizzie, Hope built in a Plan B into the potion. Using Landon's hair, she linked Lizzie's life to Landon's temporarily. Since Lizzie lost the Merge and died, Landon died too. However, given his ability to resurrect, Lizzie was also resurrected and her consciousness preserved in the process. Resurrection Spells[ ] [Resurrection](/wiki/Resurrection) spells allow witches to restore a dead being to life, returning the spirit back to its body. They are a violation of the Natural Order of life and death and may come with consequences. Even then, they usually require a massive amount of power and are considered among the hardest feats of magic, performable only by the strongest of witches. - Bonnie's Resurrection Spell: A powerful spell that allows a witch to raise a person from the dead. However, the person who is brought back from death will be cursed with the ability to see ghosts on the Other Side as a consequence. - Spirit Magic / Power of 100 dead witches - Used by: Jonas Martin first performed this spell on Lukas when he burned to death in [The House Guest](/wiki/The_House_Guest). The spell was unsuccessful due to having insufficient power. Bonnie Bennett later performed this spell to resurrect Jeremy Gilbert after he had been shot by Liz Forbes in [As I Lay Dying](/wiki/As_I_Lay_Dying). Initially the [Witch Spirits](/wiki/Bennett_Coven)denied Bonnie the power for spell, however, her ancestor, Emily Bennett, heard Bonnie's pleas of love and Jeremy was revived. In [Growing Pains](/wiki/Growing_Pains)Bonnie attempted the spell once again to resurrect Elena's spirit to prevent her from transitioning into a vampire, though the spirits denied her access to their power, thus she turned to a darker magic. - Bonnie's Resuscitation Spell: A spell used to revive a person immediately after death such as from cardiac arrest. - Incantation: En Dugas, Tuas, Animos - Used by: In [Before Sunset](/wiki/Before_Sunset), Bonnie Bennett on Jeremy Gilbert immediately after she magically stopped his heart. Though, whether it was the spell or his ring that brought him back remains uncertain. - Expression Resurrection Spell: A powerful spell that utilizes the extremely dark and potent magic of Expression to resurrect the body of the deceased. As such, this magic uses the indomitable will of the witch to make the manifestations of their will a reality. - Requirements: Expression, Target, Indomitable will - Used by: In [Into the Wild](/wiki/Into_the_Wild), Shane recounts that when he and Caitlin lost their son Sam, she tried to bring him back using Expression. In her attempt to resurrect him, she lost control of the magic and it overwhelmed and killed her. Ultimately, the spell failed. - Magic Combination Resurrection Spell: An extremely powerful spell that defies the will of Nature by combining powerful magic from the Spirits, the Darkness and Expression to resurrect a person. - Incantation: - Requirements: Spirit, Dark and Expression Magic, Indomitable will - Used by: In [The Walking Dead](/wiki/The_Walking_Dead), Bonnie performed this spell in an attempt to resurrect Jeremy Gilbert. However, as a result of the opposing forces of magic she channeled, Bonnie was overwhelmed and died in the process. Later, in [Graduation](/wiki/Graduation_(Episode)), when she put the veil back up, it was revealed that the spell proved to be a success and that essentially the spell provided a life for a life, i.e. Bonnie's life in exchange for Jeremy's. - Resurrection Spell: A powerful spell that allows a witch to raise oneself or another person from the dead. Particularly if the Veil to the Other Side has been lowered, a witch can cast the spell to make them a living, breathing mortal, seemingly without consequence. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Lowered Veil - Used by: In [Bringing Out The Dead](/wiki/Bringing_Out_The_Dead), Esther is resurrected as she is freed from her coffin, empowered by channeling the Bennett Witch bloodline. Whether it was the Spirits or her that performed the spell remains to be seen. In [Original Sin](/wiki/Original_Sin)Qetsiyah mentioned to Stefan that months prior, when Bonnie lowered the veil, she took the opportunity to resurrect herself as her hunters failed in their task to cure and kill Silas. She figured that it was time to handle things in person and she ultimately succeeded, albeit with a few issues along the way. In [Wheel Inside the Wheel](/wiki/Wheel_Inside_the_Wheel), Esther pulled Ansel from the Other Side before it collapsed, resurrecting him to the mortal plane. Even though the meaning as to how she performed the spell remains to be known, seemingly, the weakened Veil could have made it easier to perform such a spell. - The Choosing, Harvest and Reaping Rituals: A three part, in-depth ceremony where four French Quarter Witches are chosen and sacrificed, the Choosing and Harvest, respectively. The final part of the colloquially called [Harvest Ritual](/wiki/The_Harvest)ends with the previously four sacrificed witches being resurrected by the Ancestors at the request of the Elders performing the ritual. - The Harvest Invocation: Our magic fades as our ties to our ancestors weaken over time. We beseech them, accept this offering as a sign of our faith. To be born, you must sacrifice. Do you have faith? - The Reaping Invocation: After the Harvest comes the Reaping. Their sacrifices were made and accepted. We call upon our Elders to resurrect their chosen ones. - Vincent's Incantation: Resisite chonje vos elus. - Requirements: Ancestral Magic, specifically a French Quarter Elder Witch - Used by: In [Apr\u00e8s Moi, Le D\u00e9luge](/wiki/Apr%C3%A8s_Moi,_Le_D%C3%A9luge), after sacrificing Davina Claire and finishing the Harvest ceremony, Sophie Devereaux called out to the Ancestors to bring back the four harvest girls sacrificed. The invocation to the Ancestors was accepted, though not as initially expected, due to C\u00e9leste Dubois (while possessing the witch Sabine Laurent) stealing the power of the Harvest and redirecting its power to resurrect three different witches instead. As each witch died again, a Harvest Girl was resurrected in their place. In [High Water and a Devil's Daughter](/wiki/High_Water_and_a_Devil%27s_Daughter), Vincent was forced to complete the Reaping when Elijah sacrificed four French Quarter witches to reestablish the link between the Ancestral and mortal planes. When the Ancestors denied Vincent's offerings, he turned to and invoked Davina's assistance; she accepted and the four new Harvest Girls were resurrected. Vincent also made Davina the gatekeeper for all of the ancestral magic contained in New Orleans. It is also worthy to note that the Elder witch performing the Reaping ritual does not resurrect the harvest witches but in fact the Ancestors. Therefore, no resurrection \"spell\" is required, though the Elder has to invoke the Ancestors to the offerings to be accepted, or in reference to the 2019 harvest, denied. - Harvest Hijacking Spell: A powerful spell that deviates the immense power of the Harvest ritual to the caster, to be used however she pleases. The power is then able to do one of two things: To resurrect a total of three other witches from the [Ancestral Plane](/wiki/Ancestral_Plane)and/or to be bestowed onto the caster, empowering her further. - Incantation: Sacr\u00e9 sang du p\u00e8re. Sacr\u00e9 coeur de la mer. Donnez-moi, donnez-moi. - Requirements: Ancestral Magic, Voodoo Poppet filled with blood - Used by: In [Apr\u00e8s Moi, Le D\u00e9luge](/wiki/Apr%C3%A8s_Moi,_Le_D%C3%A9luge), C\u00e9leste (while possessing the witch Sabine Laurent) cast this spell right after Davina completed the Reaping to hijack its power to resurrect Bastianna, Genevieve and Papa Tunde and bestow her the power of a harvest girl. - To Pass Through [the Anchor](/wiki/The_Anchor): A spell that allows passage from the Other Side (via the Anchor to the Other Side) to the physical plane. - Incantation: Ohto Eestanay As Vazat Esvet Ohnaz Eespalit. - Directions: Because of the massive power needed to perform the spell, the Travelers channeled the magical power of blood of the last two surviving doppelg\u00e4ngers. - Requirements: Death of a Number of Travelers, Physical Contact with Anchor, Spell - Used by: In [Rescue Me](/wiki/Rescue_Me), the Travelers used this spell to resurrect their leader, Markos. They performed a mass sacrifice with dozens of members offering their lives so that Bonnie (as the Anchor to the Other Side) would be overwhelmed and Markos could push his way through into the world of living. It should be noted that the spell the Travelers cast, incorporated Markos' name into the spell, implying a single spirit, Markos, could pass through. In [Home](/wiki/Home), Liv Parker would perform the same spell although she did not use doppelg\u00e4nger blood for strength. Liv utilized the deaths of many Travelers to empower the spell and weaken the Anchor. While doing so she was greatly weakened while performing the spell. Unlike the Travelers, when Liv performed the spell, anyone who had a spiritual contact with the Anchor would pass over to the living world, while the spell was being cast. - Genevieve's Resuscitation Spell: The spell allows an Ancestral witch to revive a target that has recently stopped breathing. It is powerful enough to combat the Poppet Death Curse. - Incantation: Coeur bless\u00e9, battre avec mwen. - Requirements: Ancestral magic, Poultice made from Chamomile, Gris-gris pouch, Salt, Herbs - Used by: In [A Closer Walk With Thee](/wiki/A_Closer_Walk_With_Thee), Genevieve in the attempt to revive Hayley Marshall. She used a poultice made from chamomile and applied to Hayley's forehead as she chanted the words However, upon knowing how serious Hayley's affliction is, she resorted to using the contents of her gris-gris pouch. She poured out some salt near Hayley and drew symbols on it. She then sprinkled crushed herbs over Hayley's body until she eventually came to, being brought back from the brink of death. - Esther's Resurrection Spell: An extremely powerful spell, created by Esther a 1000 years ago, used to bring a person back from the dead. The spell gains its power by a witch channeling the energy of a Nexus Vorti, an event so infrequent that it is almost miraculous. - Incantation: La cendre \u00e0 l'os, de la chair \u00e0 la vie. De la cendre \u00e0 l'os, de la chair \u00e0 la vie. From ash to bone, from bone to flesh, from flesh to life. - Requirements: Circle of chalk or salt, Target's ashes, Nexus Vorti - Used by: In [From a Cradle to a Grave](/wiki/From_a_Cradle_to_a_Grave), it was revealed to have been created by Esther and Davina used this spell to resurrect the Original vampire, Mikael. Davina also added her own component to the spell (using a dark object) that would give her complete control over Mikael and bind him to her will, forcing him to obey her every command. She also drew power from three other dark objects for support. - Davina's Resurrection Spell: A convoluted spell that is implied to be capable of resurrecting a spirit from the Ancestral Plane. It utilizes the magical practice of representational magic, fueled by dark and sacrificial magic, to raise the dead. - Incantation: An Toi Lem, Briggitte Bratti... - Requirements: Ancestral Magic, 6 Black candles, 3 red candles, 2 sacrificed birds in a salt circle, Runic symbols (+4) around the salt circle, Practice of Representational Magic utilizing Dark and Sacrificial Magic, Paragon Diamond - Used by: In [City Beneath The Sea](/wiki/City_Beneath_The_Sea), Rebekah stumbles across this dark spell that Davina is concocting to resurrect Kol. Sometime later while she is silently chanting a spell over the birds, Vincent, known for his use of 'wild' magic when younger, comments that he has not seen a spell like this in a long time and that Davina is pretty brave to attempt it so young even for a Harvest Girl. He tells her that she should not being doing this spell alone and offers her the chance for Regency and all the magic that comes with it (Voodoo, Hoodoo, Sacrificial magic, Representational magic and even Necromancy) because she lacks power with just a paragon diamond, implying the spell is beyond the power and knowledge she currently possess to it to be successful. - Ancestral Resurrection Spell: A powerful spell used to resurrect a spirit from the Ancestral Plane using the collective power of the [Ancestors](/wiki/The_Ancestors). If the body has been destroyed, reconstituting the body of the target by means of turning ash and soil to flesh and bone will be required. Subsequently, the target rises from the hardened soil. - Davina's Incantation: Fian en che en kanu! Fian kanu! Fian en che Circle of salt, Target's ashes, Soil, Water, Sum total power of the Ancestors - Used by: In [Ashes to Ashes](/wiki/Ashes_to_Ashes), Davina performed this spell in an attempt to resurrect Kol Mikaelson using her power as [Regent](/wiki/Regent)and recreate his original body from his ashes with the knowledge of earth magic.

In [I Carry Your Heart With Me](/wiki/I_Carry_Your_Heart_With_Me), Bonnie Bennett, in her attempt to raise the dead, used this spell, though she claimed it was not strong enough to strengthen the connection between a deceased's body and soul. - Shamanistic Resurrection Ritual: A powerful spell that can allow a witch to resurrect a target whose spirit was previously trapped and bound to the [Phoenix Stone](/wiki/Phoenix_Stone)by locating the spirit in the stone and connecting them with their body. Not specifying the target's name can result in resurrecting an unknown spirit in the targeted body. - Incantation: Ababbas dagoineh mateesah zagoedan. - Requirements: The Phoenix Stone, The Deceased's Corpse, Invoking the Target's Spirit - Used by: In [I Carry Your Heart With Me](/wiki/I_Carry_Your_Heart_With_Me), Bonnie Bennett used this spell to resurrect both Oscar and Josette Laughlin, however, as she did not specify the names, she instead resurrected the spirits of two old vampires, previously trapped in the phoenix stone, inside their corpses.

Back in her original body, she intended to get the spell so that Freya would be able to resurrect Kol. Though it was a trap and the witch was working with the Strix; she destroyed the spell and subdued Rebekah. Later, Aya states that this spell could only be performed by [the Sisters](/wiki/The_Sisters)coven, as they were the only coven in the world to perform this particular spell, though Kol warns of how dangerous this spell could be for Davina. Davina was able to channel the Nexus Vorti, the result of Klaus' sireline unlinking spell, to bring back Kol in [A Streetcar Named Desire](/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire). In [Alone with Everybody](/wiki/Alone_with_Everybody), Kol reveals that Finn was also resurrected due to Davina's spell, either because the spell was tied to the blood of the Mikaelson family or he found a way to hijack it as a spirit. - Ritualistic Resurrection Spell: A ritual that utilizes a minimum of six witches to heal the deceased body of a fellow witch, of all harmed that previously came to it, and resurrect them using their blood and bone totems. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Target's body, Blood from the casting witches - Used By: In [Bag of Cobras](/wiki/Bag_of_Cobras), a gathering of six followers of the Hollow obtained Dominic's burned body and healed it completely, even restoring the damage caused by Elijah when he extracted his heart.

Lizzie began the spell but ultimately stopped when the patient's daughter arrived wanting to say her goodbyes to her father. Spells of The Other Side and Ancestral Plane[ ] These spells are connected to the purgatorial dimensions known as [The Other Side](/wiki/The_Other_Side), that traps the souls of all dead supernatural beings, and the [Ancestral Plane](/wiki/Ancestral_Plane), that specifically houses the consecrated spirits of New Orleans witch ancestors. These spiritual planes reside separately from one another. Both are inclusive of [the Veil](/wiki/The_Veil) that separates the living from the dead and either an [Anchor](/wiki/The_Anchor) that ensures its continual existence (The Other Side) or a Tether that connects it to the mortal plane (Ancestral Plane). - Creation of The Other Side: An ancient and powerful spell used to create an entire, worldwide, purgatorial dimension, commonly known as the Other Side. Such a spell required it to be bound by something eternal to its continual existence and as such, the Immortal Amara became its Anchor. The Other Side was meant to serve as a prison for Silas after his death, however the spell pulled every supernatural creature into its dimension. While on the Other Side, Witches had free reign, able to come and go and interact as they pleased while other species were isolated from one another. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: An eternal object (An Immortal) - Used by: In [Original Sin](/wiki/Original_Sin), Qetsiyah, revealed to Stefan that she performed this spell some 2,000 years ago to create and bind the newly-made supernatural [purgatory](/wiki/The_Other_Side)to Amara, an immortal. In [Death and the Maiden](/wiki/Death_and_the_Maiden), fearing the death of the newly human Anchor, Qetsiyah transferred the status and bound the anchor to Bonnie, an eternal spirit. It should also be noted that, for the spell to be properly bound, it requires something powerful, like an immortal being powerful, of which Qetsiyah considered a ghost as a viable candidate. - Creation of The Ancestral Plane: An old spell used to create a sub-limbo, purgatorial-like dimension, separate from The Other side. Similar to the spell that crafted The Other Side, it needed to be bound, yet the eternal object used was actually the Earth itself, specifically Lafayette Cemetery and surrounding New Orleans soil, allowing for its continual existence. Therefore, New Orleans' witches, though not limited to, have to be consecrated back to the Earth to enter the Ancestral Plane after death, or otherwise remain on The Other Side. Unlike the Other Side's creation, the binding of the Ancestral Plane weakens with time and another [ritual](/wiki/The_Harvest)has to be performed to reestablish the connection. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: An eternal object (The Earth) - Used by: In [The Rise](/wiki/The_Originals:_The_Rise), [Ysabelle Dalliencourt](/wiki/Ysabelle_Dalliencourt)obtained spells from Esther's grimoire enabled her to communicate with spirits, like [Hugo Rey](/wiki/Hugo_Rey)from the Other Side. Many years later, in [The Loss](/wiki/The_Originals:_The_Loss)it is revealed that, continuing to use Esther's grimoire, Ysabelle was able to exploit hole-like elements of the Veil. The spell made the veil permeable and she was able to locate their Ancestors on the Other Side, bringing them into the newly established Ancestral Plane. In [Give 'Em Hell Kid](/wiki/Give_%27Em_Hell_Kid), Vincent describes that the New Orleans cemeteries were designed specifically to house the spirits of their Ancestors and though does not directly bind the Ancestral Plane, like the Anchor to The Other Side, they are what enables the Ancestors to access and use magic on the mortal plane, an intersection between the physical world and the spirit world. - Veil Manipulation Spell: The spell manipulates the veil between the living world and the supernatural purgatory, such as lowering it, allowing all of the dead to interact with the living or to raise it, to banish the ghosts of deceased supernatural back to the Other Side. The spell can only be performed by the descendants of the witch Qetsiyah (the creator of the Other Side) \u2014 the Bennett witches. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Expression, Expression Triangle, a Bennett witch, Massive power, (Qetsiyah's calcified blood in Silas' tombstone/Full Moon) - Directions: A Bennett witch must reach a great focus of magic and draw strength from a large power source, such as a completed expression triangle. Then, she must draw on the power of a full moon or an equivalent of one such as Silas' tombstone \u2014 as it is filled with Qetsiyah's calcified blood. Such a combination of power will allow the witch to lower the veil. The witch can also decide if they are going to lower the veil in the entire world or only in a specific location. - Used by: In [The Walking Dead](/wiki/The_Walking_Dead), Bonnie Bennett successfully performed this spell to lower the veil within the expression triangle, to contact her ancient ancestor Qetsiyah. In [Graduation](/wiki/Graduation_(Episode)), Bonnie put the veil back up within the Expression Triangle, using the full Moon, sending all the ghosts back to the Other Sides. - Veil Exploitation Spell: On a small scale ritual, the spell is able to exploit a medium's abilities to see and interact with ghosts and to exploit that link to them a stronger foothold on the mortal plane. In doing so, it gives them the ability to physically interact with the world, to come and go as they please. This spell can also be used in conjunction with a banishing spell to fully exploit hole-like elements of the Veil to give any ghost, with unfinished business, free reign on the mortal plane. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Medium and their blood, the deceased's photo, dozen candles (Ritual); In conjunction with a banishing spell; Esther's Talisman as a binding agent. - Used by: In [Smells Like Teen Spirit](/wiki/Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit), Esther, a ghost utilized Matt's mediumship and his link to Vicki to give her a stronger foothold on the mortal plane, allowing her to be able to physically interact with the world. After Bonnie performed the banishing spell to reopen the Veil to resend Vicki's spirit, Esther, using her connection to her Talisman, exploited Bonnie's spell, wedging the door wide open and gave a free pass to any ghost with unfinished business. - Banishing Spell: A spell used to send an unwanted spirit back to the Other Side. Blocking any magic used to allow said spirit to gain a foothold on the mortal plane. - Incantation: Phasmatos Redux Redismo Sus Terra. - Requirements: Letting go of spirit and accepting their death - Used by: In [Smells Like Teen Spirit](/wiki/Smells_Like_Teen_Spirit), Bonnie Bennett performed this spell to resend Vicki Donovan's foothold on the mortal plane and to send her back to The Other Side. - Manifestation Spell: A spell that is able to reveal the presence of ghosts to the living also known as veiled matter, giving them a corporeal form. - Incantation: Door to the Other Side, Candles - Used by: In [Ghost World](/wiki/Ghost_World), Bonnie Bennett performed this spell to reveal why the Banishing spell appeared to not have worked. - Dark Magic Manifestation Spell: A spell that is used by an Ancestral Spirit, while on the Ancestral Plane, to reveal themselves to the living, giving them a corporeal form. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Dark Magic (presumably), Performed as a Spirit - Used by: In [Dead Angels](/wiki/Dead_Angels), Ariane, now consecrated to the Ancestors, seemingly performed a similar and altogether unique spell to that of the Ancestral Manifestation Spell. In doing so, the spell acted as a direct opposite as she was able to appear before Davina, a spirit to a living witch, whereas with the latter, a living witch summons a spirit. Thus far, no other witch spirit has been able to physically appear before a living witch while the veil to the Other Side was up or while separated (from the living) within the Ancestral Plane or other afterlife dimension. It is highly likely that Ariane utilized the dark magic that she practiced while living to perform this spell to appear to Davina, though, ultimately it remains to be seen. - Ancestral Manifestation Spell: A spell that utilizes a Hand of Glory to reveal the presence of an Ancestral Spirit on the Ancestral Plane to the living, giving said spirit a temporary corporeal form for as long as the candle burns. The spirit of the witch is bound in a salt circle, separating them from the Ancestral Plane. Should the circle be broken, the spirit will be forced to return. - Davina's Incantation: La ma me dicie, dic ka lore. - Freya's Incantation: Se que atrae us van el brun'en - Requirements: [A Hand of Glory](/wiki/The_Hand_of_Glory), Candles, Various herbs, Circle of salt. - Used by: In [Heart Shaped Box](/wiki/Heart_Shaped_Box), Davina was forced to use this spell, instead of being able to resurrect Kol, to gain information about the final components of her Sireline Unlinking Spell. In [Where Nothing Stays Buried](/wiki/Where_Nothing_Stays_Buried), Freya, while channeling Elijah, performed this spell to bring Davina's spirit forth from the Ancestral plane to prevent the Ancestors from destroying her spirit. Freya later sacrificed Davina to tap into the Ancestral well of magic which caused the circle to break, sending her back to the Ancestral plane. - Soul-Shredding Spell: A spell that is able to \"shred\" an ancestral spirit into pieces. This spell is performed on the Ancestral Plane and the witch casting the spell utilizes a life-blood stone. - Incantation: Vist aboli anima por eternum - Requirements: Life Blood Stone, Witch Spirits on the Ancestral Plane - Used by: In [Where Nothing Stays Buried](/wiki/Where_Nothing_Stays_Buried), [Kara Nguyen](/wiki/Kara_Nguyen), and various other Ancestors, performed this spell upon Davina for siding with the Vampires over her own kind. According to Kol this is the worst punishment that can be given by the Ancestors and a fate worse than death. The Ancestors tried to use it on him, but his vampire soul was too stained for their magic to work. Kol mentions if that was to happen, there would be no rescuing her. This is perhaps due to a body (as for resurrection) not being able to function properly without the soul as a whole versus a/several piece(s), as seen when vampire souls inhabit human bodies. In [Phantomesque](/wiki/Phantomesque), it was shown that, seemingly, Davina suffered no consequences from her soul being shredded upon her resurrection. - Soul-Conjuring Spell: A unique spell that is able to \"conjure\" the soul, or pieces of a shredded soul, of an ancestral spirit back to form while bringing them back into the Ancestral Plane. - Incantation: Localiser nan motus qui souffre de patitur. - Requirements: Performed on the Ancestral plane in front of the deceased's tomb, Candles, and Object related to the target (i.e. Davina's favorite record). - Used By: In [Give 'Em Hell Kid](/wiki/Give_%27Em_Hell_Kid), Vincent successfully used this spell to bring Davina, whose spirit was sent to a fate worse than death (shredded), back to the Ancestral plane. It is unknown whether or not this restored her soul as since Davina sent Vincent back to the mortal plane, she still persisted thereafter and retained the ability to use magic. in [Voodoo in My Blood](/wiki/Voodoo_in_My_Blood), it's revealed that Davina's soul persisted even when the link that bound the Ancestral plane to the mortal world was severed. - Ancestral Plane Untethering Spell: A spell that is able to sever the connection of the Ancestors with the mortal plane, cutting them off from magic. This spell must be performed on the Ancestral Plane and the witch casting the spell utilizes a mystical battery cell to destroy the link. - Incantation: Rompriez le lien vivant. - Requirements: Mystical battery cell (un d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'argent), Witch Spirit on the Ancestral plane, 'Cornerstone' of the tether (specific tomb). - Used by: In 'Em Hell Kid](/wiki/Give_%27Em_Hell_Kid), [Davina Claire](/wiki/Davina_Claire)with help from [Vincent Griffith](/wiki/Vincent_Griffith)was able to cut off the Ancestor's magic. While this spell cuts off the Ancestors' magic, it does not destroy the Ancestral Plane, like that of the destruction of the Anchor and the Other Side. This implies that, given enough magic and/or time, the Ancestral plane could be re-tethered (anchored) back to New Orleans cemeteries. This was proven true in [High Water and a Devil's Daughter](/wiki/High_Water_and_a_Devil%27s_Daughter)when Vincent initiated the Reaping from the new Harvest Ritual, enacted by Elijah by sacrificing four French Quarter witches, and accepted by Davina once her spirit was called upon. - Releasing the Ancestral Well: A powerful spell that utilizes the collective magic of the New Orleans' witch covens to release the ancestral spirits from within the Ancestral Plane, allowing all deceased witches, previously consecrated and held within the dimension, to find peace. - Vincent's Incantation: Ansanm Lib\u00e9rez-nous... Requirements: Cornerstone of the dimension (Lafayette Cemetery), Salt glyph, Numerous witches - Directions: A square, salt glyph is inscribed upon the ground. A smaller salt circle is drawn within with pointed arrows bisecting the corners at 90o angles. Outside the middle circle, four smaller circles bisect the base of the arrow tail, with the addition of an 'X', forming a 6-pointed star within the smaller circles. Within the square, at each side's face, four small candles are used. - Used by: In [There in the Disappearing Light](/wiki/There_in_the_Disappearing_Light), Vincent explains to Ivy that when New Orleans witches are consecrated, all of their power gets trapped in the Ancestral Well; however, as the living witches grow stronger, the dead languish. This was Ivy's fate. Seeking to allow their Ancestors to find peace, the Covens of New Orleans, under the direction of Vincent, perform this spell to release their Ancestors from the Ancestral Well. The integrity of the dimension, however, is unknown. Transference Spells[ ] Transference spells allow witches to dispatch the spell bound from one medium onto another, granting the latter its magical properties. The nature of said spells can vary although most are made up of curses. - Anchor Transference Ritual: The ceremony will successfully replace the current anchor of the [supernatural purgatory](/wiki/The_Other_Side)with another person or supernatural entity . If the next anchor is a spirit of a deceased, they will be given a foothold in the living plane, though they will remain dead, thus giving the deceased spirit the power to interact with both planes of existence. - Incantation: Im A Pran Khos Ai Pada Se Rassatam. - Requirements: Massive source of power (celestial events/doppelg\u00e4nger), Personal belonging of the next anchor, Talisman (Qetsiyah), Traveler Magic (presumably) - Used by: In [Death and the Maiden](/wiki/Death_and_the_Maiden), Qetsiyah performed this ritual to replace Amara, a former immortal and the original Anchor to the Other Side, with Bonnie, a ghost trapped on the other side. Being a spirit, Qetsiyah considered her a viable candidate to replace Amara, of which confirmed that Spirits are powerful and on par with immortal beings. - Gemini Surrogate Spell: A spell used by the Gemini Coven to transfer a baby from a dying mother into a suitable surrogate. This spell additionally cloaks the twins such that no form of modern science can visualize the babies. mother, Target holder, A whole coven of witches - Used By: While the main purpose of this spell is to banish a target to a prison world (Prison World Banishment Spell), it has a secondary function. In [I'm Thinking Of You All The While](/wiki/I%27m_Thinking_Of_You_All_The_While), it was performed by The Gemini Coven, initially thought to banish Kai once again to a prison world. However, Valerie reveals in [Best Served Cold](/wiki/Best_Served_Cold)that it was performed upon Jo as a final act to save her twin babies' lives. When they did this spell they transferred Josie and Lizzie Saltzman safely into Caroline's womb before they're mother died. In [Mommie Dearest](/wiki/Mommie_Dearest), many decades prior to current events, Valerie attempted the same spell to save her own child's life after she was brutally assaulted by Julian. Due to the lack of a coven's support , she was unable to successfully perform the spell and ultimately lost the baby. - Phoenix Scar Transference Spell: This spell can be used to transfer the curse mark of the Phoenix sword to a living blood relative. - Incantation: Sanguinem cicatrix ex cor pario. - Used by: In [Days of Future Past](/wiki/Days_of_Future_Past), Valarie attempted to perform this spell to transfer Stefan's scar to Damon. Rayna, however, stabbed Stefan with the Phoenix sword before the spell was complete which caused the spell to unravel with Valarie stating there was no curse mark to transfer. - Hex Transference Spell: This spell used the practice of representational magic to transfer an unwanted spell inflicted upon the target onto a clay doll. It, however, was unable to reverse the effects of a powerful death curse. - Love You, Goodbye](/wiki/I_Love_You,_Goodbye)Kol and Rebekah attempted this spell to reverse Finn's curse on Kol, however they were unsuccessful. - Dark Object Transference Spell: This spell was used to take the enchantment infused in a dark object to be placed onto another object, granting them its specific magical properties. - Incantation: Unknown - Requirements: Target object - Used by: In [When the Levee Breaks](/wiki/When_the_Levee_Breaks), Davina used this spell on one of the [Cursed Shackles](/wiki/The_Cursed_Shackles)to transfer its magic suppressing properties onto a [bracelet](/wiki/Hope%27s_Bracelet)that could be easily worn by Hope. - Huntress Life-Force Transference Spell: This spell will transfer the remaining life from the huntress to a desired target. The spell will also grant the new huntress all the qualities of the previous hunter, such as super strength and the drive to hunt and kill vampires. - The Shaman's Plea: Hear me, Great Spirit. Hear me. We call upon you in this moment of need. One has come before you. For many lifetimes as your servant, your vengeance. Let her journey end. Let another take her remaining years. Let another take up her burden. - Requirements: Target's (The New Huntress) Blood, Rayna (Current Huntress), Shaman Descendant who cast the original spell. - Used by: In [Kill 'Em All](/wiki/Kill_%27Em_All), the last living descendant of the shaman that cast the original spell transferred Rayna's last remaining life to Bonnie; unbeknownst to Damon, Rayna also had the Shaman transfer the status, as well as most of her abilities as the Huntress to her as well. - Sacrificial Anchor Transfer Spell: A spell to transfer the anchored life-force of a sacrificial spell to that of another being, such as a vampire. - Incantation: Mare leurs esprit. - Requirements: Sacrificial Anchor; Target intended to be transferred to - Used by: In [Keepers of the House](/wiki/Keepers_of_the_House), Vincent used this spell as a means of a loophole to undermine the Hollow's follower's spell. Since the spell could only be broken with the Anchor's death, i.e. the four children used in the original spell, Vincent transferred the anchor to Elijah so that he could be staked and \"die\" to break the spell; they were successful. - Cycling Spell: A temporary spell used to transfer or offload the effects of [darkness](/wiki/Dark_Magic)from one's mind to that of another, effectively clearing their mind. - Incantation: Unknown. - Requirements: Afflicted person, several large candles, five small candles, various colored liquids, unknown herbs, sage smudge stick, white powder, and white crystal - Used by: In [When The Saints Go Marching In](/wiki/When_The_Saints_Go_Marching_In), Freya mentions that Ivy had once told her of this spell while looking for a way to end the Hollow. Having found the blue binder in which Ivy kept the spell, Freya performed the spell on Klaus and Elijah to 'channel' the dark magic of the Hollow into Elijah so that Klaus could say his goodbyes with a clear mind. - Alias Vocem: A spell that allows one to speak through another as a conduit. - Incantation: Vauntidictus callimus vox. - Requirements: Personal artifact - Used by: In [All's Well That Ends Well](/wiki/All%27s_Well_That_Ends_Well), Hope performed this spell on Jed who held [Kaelan](/wiki/Kaelan)' necklace. The spell trapped the [banshee](/wiki/Banshee)'s voice within a body that could not scream. Going beyond the explanation of the spell, it seemingly gave the banshee access to Jed's mind as Alaric commented that when Jed turns under the full moon, they did not want a monster inside of his head. When he began to turn, the banshee also commented on how she never felt such strength before. Likewise, Jed was able to access the banshee's mind and he was able to discover the banshee's host's name and why Malivore wanted Cleo. Another interesting effect of the spell, when the spell was cast upon Jed, his eye took on the appearance of the banshee's eyes. - Transfusion Ritual: A powerful ritual that transfers properties from one being to another. - Incantation: Lati Ina Si okunkun. / Yara Lati Ina Requirements: Transfusion braid, Sigil - Used by: In [There's No I In Team, or Whatever](/wiki/There%27s_No_I_In_Team,_or_Whatever), Cleo's grandmother performed this ritual [circa 1464](/wiki/Timeline)on their village's greatest warrior. She had been infected with Long Spider poison in battle. The only solution was to perform this ritual to magically transfer the poison into Kasigo who had been exposed to it before and was immune. Cleo's grandmother successfully performed the spell and healed the warrior. Cleo shared this memory with Hope, inspiring her to do the same with Malivore. If they could perform the spell, they could free Landon and perhaps learn how to defeat Malivore since they're sharing a body. Within the therapy box, Hope performed this spell eleven times, each simulation a failure. Josie believed she couldn't be the one to cast the spell and took over. During the ritual, the spell was completed successfully, though to Malivore's favor. He was unintentionally inspired by Cleo and learned what Hope's plan was and instead transferred a [dybbuk](/wiki/Category:Supernatural)into Ryan. Going after Ryan to save him, Hope performed this spell and successfully transferred the dybbuk from his body.

Once successfully completed, the knot levitates and unties itself signifying that the linking spell has been broken. - Used By: The spell originates from Esther, of which Elijah states as one of my mother's later spells, eluding to the complexity and power required to perform the spell. In [Fruit of the Poisoned Tree](/wiki/Fruit_of_the_Poisoned_Tree), Elijah gives Davina the spell from their Mother's grimoire inorder to unlink Sophie and Hayley, through In [A Spirit Here That Won't Be Broken](/wiki/A_Spirit_Here_That_Won%27t_Be_Broken), Kol taught this spell to Hope so that she could unlink Davina from the Hollow.

She attempted to use the spell in [Red Door](/wiki/Red_Door)though she discovered that Kol destroyed her binding agent. Roughly a year later after it's inception, with Kol's help Davina was able to finish the spell with the correct ingredients, and revised the incantation to the first portion only. In [A Streetcar Named Desire](/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire), Davina was finally able to cast the spell with the assistance of The Sisters. They performed the refined spell on Elijah and Klaus, though the majority of the witches were killed, leaving Davina only able to break Klaus' link to his sireline. The resulting release of mystical energy from many generations of vampires was strong enough to create a Nexus Vorti.

For added protection, Alyssa sealed the room in a barrier spell. Hope, however, got to her before the spell was complete and talked her out of what she was doing. She explained that severing the connection would kill everyone contained within, but Kai had not told her that. Hope tells her that she's not a murderer, that being responsible for someone's death will remain with her. Alyssa remembers her parents and decides not to finish the spell.

The spell ultimately failed with Abby's death, as Esther's connection to the massive source of magic became unstable. - Vampirism Removal Spell: A spell that can reverse the magic of vampirism and turn a vampire back into a human again. This spell was later revealed to be a less-powerful adaptation of a spell designed to use to remove all Non-Traditional Magic from the Blood of the last pair of doppelg\u00e4ngers mixed together - Used by: In [Man on Fire](/wiki/Man_on_Fire), Markos used this spell on Sloan to make her a witch again after she became a vampire, though the spell reverted the target back to the state prior to becoming a vampire (death). - Heart Stasis Desiccation Spell: A powerful spell that temporarily stops a human heart while a vampire's heart is being stopped so that the vampire can be successfully desiccated. It is also powerful enough to be used on a Original - Requirements: Dark Magic, A Balance amongst the living. - Directions: To stop a vampire's heart, the witch must stop a human's heart as well. The spell also requires a physical connection to the vampire's bloodstream, such as a vein or artery (anything that is connected to the heart). The witch can circumvent this direct requirement herself by using a blood link. - Used by: In [Before Sunset](/wiki/Before_Sunset), it is revealed that in 1995, Abby Bennett-Wilson used this spell to desiccate Mikael. Upon performing the spell it nearly drained all of her magic and she almost died as a result; ultimately her magic never returned afterwards until she reunited with Bonnie.

The spell's effects are currently unknown. Trivia[ ] - The primary language many spells are spoken are Latin-based, though not completely. [[3]](#cite_note-3) [[4]](#cite_note-4) - Most spells invoke [the Spirits](/wiki/The_Spirits)through the Latin phrase \"Phasmatos Tribum\", which translates to \"Ghost Tribe\" \u2014 a reference to the Spirits themselves. [Expression](/wiki/Expression)doesn't require verbal spells for a witch to use, as it's already pre-existing powers simply need to be tapped into. - The only exception to this is when Expression is combined with other forms of magic that require verbal spells. - It has been shown and proven that powerful spells are bound to something even more powerful e.g. the moon, a comet, a doppelg\u00e4nger. - In a [deleted scene](https://youtu.be/ugtIEGdVwMI?t=144)of [History Repeating](/wiki/History_Repeating), Bonnie performs the S\u00e9ance Spell in an attempt to find a way to open the fourth coffin, which contained Esther Mikaelson.

The incantation was Lasha et me an liu ye, Matt Donovan, de paradis ta. However, canonically, in [Fifty Shades of Grayson](/wiki/Fifty_Shades_of_Grayson), Katherine makes no mention of this and Nadia needs to find another Traveler to teach her the Passenger spell.
