You may have heard that [vitamin D](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Vitamin%20D-HealthProfessional/), a commonly fortified vitamin, is good for calcium absorption and bone health. But what do vitamin D levels have to do with [symptoms](https://www.mymsteam.com/resources/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis) or risk of [multiple sclerosis](https://www.mymsteam.com/resources/multiple-sclerosis-ms-an-overview) (MS)? The research to date has shown that vitamin D might play a larger role as an environmental factor in MS than previously thought. In this article, we explore the role of vitamin D levels in the risk of MS and how vitamin D levels affect MS symptoms. Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to [many autoimmune diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047889/), including MS. In addition to supporting bone and muscle health, vitamin D levels also play a role in strengthening your [immune system and immune cells](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d/) (like T cells and B cells) \u2014 which are abnormal in MS. Some research suggests vitamin D has a [protective effect](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/expert-answers/vitamin-d-and-ms/faq-20058258). For example, studies found that people with higher levels of vitamin D (according to diet or blood measurements) had a [40 percent to 62 percent lower risk](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d/) of developing MS than people who had lower levels of vitamin D. Although evidence is mixed, some [studies suggest](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/expert-answers/vitamin-d-and-ms/faq-20058258) that for people with MS, high-dose vitamin D intake may reduce the severity of disease progression, disease activity, and relapse rate. Higher vitamin D levels during pregnancy [may also protect the baby from developing MS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4861670/). Along those lines, research has found that in people who had [clinically isolated syndrome](https://www.mymsteam.com/resources/clinically-isolated-syndrome-vs-ms) (early symptoms that suggest MS), [low vitamin D](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/1815002) levels were correlated with more severe progression of MS. The connection between low vitamin D levels and MS may also explain why people who live [further from the equator ](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-more-vitamin-d)\u2014 with less sunshine to help the skin produce vitamin D \u2014 have a higher prevalence and [increased risk of MS](https://mstrust.org.uk/life-ms/diet/vitamin-d) compared to people in warmer climates. Vitamin D comes in two main [forms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56061/) when it enters the body \u2014 vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D2 is largely human-made and added to many of the foods we eat. Most of our vitamin D3 intake comes from the ultraviolet rays in sunlight exposure. Sunlight hits the skin, and skin cells use the energy from sunlight to make vitamin D3. Both forms of vitamin D are then sent to the liver, where the vitamin D precursor is turned into another molecule called [25-hydroxyvitamin D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56061/) (25OHD). This molecule then goes to the kidney, which processes the 25OHD into a final form of vitamin D (calcitriol). From there, it goes on to do many things we associate with vitamin D, including fostering bone growth, maintaining calcium levels to help avoid osteoporosis, and strengthening the immune system. Because vitamin D comes from food and sunlight, getting higher levels generally means consuming more sources of the vitamin and getting more sun exposure. Few foods are naturally high in vitamin D, but they include fatty fish, eggs, beef, and cod liver oil. Other foods may be fortified with vitamin D, such as milk and some cereals. Vitamin D supplementation is also an option \u2014 more than 14,000 members of [MyMSTeam](https://www.mymsteam.com/activities) report that they take vitamin D supplements for their health. Supplements containing vitamin D2, vitamin D3, or a combination of both are all available. Various professional organizations, such as the [Institute of Medicine and the Endocrine Society](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990512/), have indicated optimal vitamin D levels and intake to use as guidance. People with a vitamin D deficiency who need vitamin D supplements should aim to have a blood level higher than 40 nanograms per milliliter. One option is taking high-dose vitamin D2 \u2014 generally [50,000 international units (IUs), once per week](https://www.mymsteam.com/resources/vitamin-d-and-ms-your-guide). Another option is taking vitamin D3, which is usually taken daily at a dose between [1,000 and 5,000 IUs](https://www.mymsteam.com/resources/vitamin-d-and-ms-your-guide). Always talk to your doctor for their medical advice before you begin taking supplements. They can help ensure vitamin D supplementation is safe for you, and they can recommend the right dose and frequency. In short, yes. Having too little vitamin D may be an issue, and you don't want to have too much, either. The effect of having too much vitamin D is called [vitamin D toxicity](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/vitamin-d-toxicity/faq-20058108). Some animal model studies show that vitamin D doses that are too high [can worsen](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/142/9/2737/5532100?login=true) MS symptoms and cause complications such as [encephalomyelitis](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/142/9/2737/5532100?login=true). Vitamin D toxicity can also lead to an overabundance of calcium in your system (a condition called hypercalcemia), which can have serious effects on your body. Vitamin D toxicity, also known as hypervitaminosis D, can occur in people who take [doses above 10,000 IUs](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001594.htm) per day. Signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity may include: Some members of MyMSTeam have wondered whether vitamin D supplements can cause urine to smell \u2014 and if so, whether it's an indication that their vitamin D levels are too high. Several vitamins, including vitamin B-6, can [cause urine smell to change](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15357-urine-changes). Although a strong smell to your urine probably doesn't mean vitamin D toxicity, it may indicate that you are dehydrated, which can in turn be a sign of excess vitamin D. Strong-smelling urine could also indicate a urinary tract infection. If you're worried you may have taken too much vitamin D, contact your doctor right away. In some cases, vitamin D toxicity can cause permanent kidney damage. Before you start taking vitamin D supplements, talk to your doctor about whether or not you have low vitamin D levels. In general, you should always talk to your medical care team before starting a new nutritional, vitamin, or herbal supplement. Your doctor or other health care professional, such as a clinical pharmacist or dietitian, can also help determine the dosage of vitamin D you may need to take depending on your other health conditions. For example, people with [renal insufficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3022248/) (a type of kidney problem) may need supplements with different vitamin D concentrations to achieve the same result. Vitamin D supplements [may interact](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-d/art-20363792) with other drugs, such as: If you're taking other medications, speak with your doctor before starting vitamin D supplements to find out if they're right for you and what a safe dosage will be. Your doctor may perform blood tests to track your vitamin D status and find out if your vitamin D levels are normal. One MyMSTeam member wrote about their experience with this process: \"I had a blood test to determine my vitamin D (25OHD) level twice a year, in mid-April and mid-October. Depending on the test result, my doctor would adjust the supplementation level for the next six months.\" If the levels are low, your doctor may recommend you take vitamin D supplements. People at higher risk for vitamin D deficiency usually have levels less than [30 nanomoles per liter](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/). Levels of 50 nanomoles per liter or 20 nanograms per milliliter or more are considered normal and sufficient for most people.
