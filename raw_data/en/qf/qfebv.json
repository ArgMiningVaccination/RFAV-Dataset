INTERNATIONAL Pope opposes extreme child bearing methods CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy lAP) -In a denunciation of having children Nat all costs,\" Pope John Paul\" said Sunday that practices such as artificial fertilization are the product of muddled morality. In his weekly public appear\u00ad ance at his summer residence out\u00ad side Rome, the pope made no mention of specific cases, but Italian newspapers in recent days have been filled with articles debating the case of a 62-year-old Italian woman who gave birth in July. That case involved a donated egg and hormonal treatment to let I the woman, who was past menopause, carry the implanted embryo to term. While acknowledging that a child is a Ngift for the parents,\" the pope said it has limits. \"In reality, the legitimate desire for a son or daughter cannot be interpreted as a sort of right to have a child which can be satis\u00ad fied at all costs, H the pope said.

Prosecutors weighed the clinic's rights against Paul Hill's right of free speech and ~\\....l~.m\" decided an\". arrest wasn't Hili warranted , FBI spokesman George Wisnovsky said Sunday. \"The decision was made based on where he was and what he was doing,\" Wisnovsky said from the FBI's Jacksonville office. \"The results of our investigation were forwarded to the U.S. attorney.\" The director of the Pensacola clinic had asked that Hill be arrested under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. Hill was a regular protester who advocated the killing of abor\u00ad tion doctors as justifiable homicide. Ladies Center director Linda Taggart complained that Hill had been screaming through the clinic's windows. The new law makes it a federal crime to obstruct, inten\u00ad tionally injure or intimidate any\u00ad one trying to obtain an abortion. \"They said they didn't think it was the time to arrest him,\u00b7 Tag\u00ad gart told the Pensacola News Jour\u00ad nal. \"Nobody can seem to do any\u00ad thing until it's too late. \" Hill, 40, is charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in the deaths of Dr. John Bayard Britton, 69, of Fernandina Beach and retired Air Force Lt.

Harris: I , ; I Mike Glover Associated Press DES MOINES -Recent days have brought fresh evidence of the problems facing Gov. Terry Branstad, who is rapidly becoming the poster child for threatened incumbents everywhere. Thoee who doubt Branstad is in the light of his political life need look no further than his own actions. The firat evi\u00ad dence came when he called for cam\u00ad paign finance reform, including limiting individ-L.'_-=-.... _~ ual contributions Branstad to $1,000 and I'Cllitical action committees to giving $5,000. That's fairly breathtaking from a governor who has vetoed three cam\u00ad paign finance reform bills, but it makes some sense in the political summer of 1994. That's because the governor is in a very unusual finan\u00ad cialaituation. In the past, Branatad baa counted on money as one of his biggest polit\u00ad ical weapons. He routinely raised three or four times as much l1li his Democratic rival while diamieaing complaints about the role that mon\u00ad ey played in hia campaigns. But this year things are different. Branatad spent more than $1.6 mil\u00ad lion to win a Republican primary and emerged broke. Since that time, Democrat Bonnie Campbell has demonstrated an ability to raise as much money as the governor, leav\u00ad ing the two in a financial dead heat. Branstad has a broader financial base with a longer list of contribu\u00ad tors from past campaigns, while Campbell is forced to rely on a smaller number of givers, who are asked to ante up more. Viewed in that light, Branstad's call for campaign finance reform makes perfect se~ . It also under\u00ad scores the reality that he doesn't have the financial overkill to which he has grown accustomed. The second development was a breakdown in talks for campaign debates. Bumps along the way aren't unusual when two rivalll set up campaign debates. Those meetings are high profile, and a politician generally wants to get his or her way in structuring debates. This time, however, it sounds as though neither side is ter\u00ad ribly eager to reach an agreement. That should be unsettling news for Branatad. In past campaigns, Democratic rivals have been desperate for cam\u00ad paign debates. They generally have been unable to muster the resources to get their message out and needed the high-profile -and free -plat\u00ad form that the debates offered. ~ a result, they took whatever crumbs Branatad offered. Debates were occasionally held on football saturdays when the lIIIIt thing on the minds ofmO&t votel'8 was politics. This time, however, Campbell may have concluded she has noth\u00ad ing to gain from a debate. He's already in trouble so she doesn't need to ,core a knockout punch during one of those meetings. Campbell', fund-raising ability means ahe will have the resources to make whatever points ahe chooses without being forced to rely on debates. Branstad probably has little to gain from campaign debates l1li well. The governor'a political instincts are to attack on command, and when he's in trouble those aggres\u00ad sive tendencies are heightened . Given his troubles, no one within five miles of a campaign debate would be safe from a Branstad salvo. In his calmer moments, Branstad probably understands he wouldn't do himself any good with an attack dog performance on television. Branatad has studiously ignored lawmakers of both parties during his 12 years in office, and he very clearly baa been stung by criticism from them. A lot of Republican law\u00ad makers endorsed Branatad's prima\u00ad ry opponent, Rep. Fred Grandy, and those defections hurt. IWIa S.

Iowa -Monday, AUgust 1, 1994 Viewpoints Demands on women unfair In a recent Michigan case, a woman lost custody of her 3-year-old daughter because she put the child in day care while she went to college. The father doesn't plan to stay home with his daughter either, however. Instead he will leave her with his mother. The judge apparently found that it was in the best interests of the child to be uprooted from her home so that she could spelld her days with Grandma. In another recent case, a woman lost custody of her son because she was a lesbian. Luckily this case was overturned on appeal, but the fact that her son was taken away for several months is a reminder to other lesbian mothers that the world is not yet safe enough to come completely out of the closet. What are the connections between these two cases? In both instances, single mothers were chastised for doing things which married women do every day -putting a child in day care and maintaining a loving relationship with a partner. But because both of these women had chosen to raise children without the help of a man, they we.re vulnerable to attacks on their parenting abilities. When a woman is beaten, even killed, by an abusive partner, someone invariably asks, \"Why didn't she just leave?\" But given the extreme backlash against single mothers, it should come as no surprise that many women prefer to take a few beatings every now and then in order to remain within a socially sanctioned nuclear family. Women are in a bind. They are ridiculed if they stay with an abu\u00ad sive spouse, but they are also punished if they leave. They are ch~stised for accepting welfare, but if they work or go to school, they are penalized for putting their children in day care. They can lose their children for being openly lesbian, and if they never marry at all, they are disparagingly termed \"spinsters.\" What it all comes down to is this: Unless a woman has a male partner whom she loves and honors and obeys, her ability to raise children will be questioned. This is not to overlook the value of men in family life or to down\u00ad play their importance. Yet there is an increasing trend in the Unit\u00ad ed States to give standing ovations to fathers who take responsibil\u00ad ity for their families, rather than accepting this as a given. Mean\u00ad while, women's sacrifices for their families are expected . , A woman who decides to raise her children without a man knows she is entering a dangerous world. Her lifestyle will be viciously scrutinized. Teachers and law enforcement officers have lower e~pectations for her children, and this quickly becomes a self-ful\u00ad mling prophecy. . No single mother will deny that raising children alone is a daunt\u00ad ing task. But a strong argument can be made that social forces 'Torking against single mothers are a greater source of anxiety than the absence of fathers. HlII'iti\"'dA'''II'''I\",t. Laura Fokkena Editorial Writer Call if you have any doubts Last week bo~h the Senate and the House opened hearings on the black hole that is the Whitewater land deal and the failed S & L, Madison Savings and Loan. President and Hillary Clinton lost thousands of dollars on the Arkansas land investment as did sever\u00ad al of their business partners and friends. More than a year after the issue was raised by the mass media and ignored by the general population, a few partisan publications rekindled interest in the story by attempting to connect it with the suicide of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster. , The mass media again gave the Clintons' poor investment more attention than it deserved, and the Republicans in the Congress, ipcluding Rep. Jim Leach, latched on with their talons and didn't l~t go. Clinton's more vocal opponents demanded a special prosecu\u00ad tpr. The president, ever a crafty politician, gave them one. I The special prosecutor, like the FBI and the U.S. Park Police, !bund no evidence that Foster's death was anything more than a ~uicide. To date, the special prosecutor has found no evidence of ihegality on the part of White House employees or the Clintons concerning Foster, Whitewater or Madison Savings and Loan. Some staff members showed poor judgment in how they handled ihi'ormation concerning the Justice Department's criminal investi\u00ad lfation of the failed S & L, but that was just dumb, not illegal. Not to be outdone, both the Senate and the House launched their own investigations. According to one wire story, staff attorneys for GOP senators questioned 37 people and collected 10,000 docu\u00ad Jilents concerning Foster's death. Their findings after three weeks? J1'oster's death was a suicide. Future revelations in the several costly ongoing investigations, liearings and depositions probably will be the same. The investiga\u00ad ~ons, hearings and depositions will find that the president knew very little about the Justice Department investigation, and he didn't interfere because he didn't have anything to hide. Some compare Whitewater to Watergate or Iran-Contra. They iinore the fact that the Watergate and Iran-Contra investigations Cound guilt rather than misjudgments and that people were con\u00ad victed and jailed rather than flred. After the proper investigations find that Clinton did nothing wrong, will Leach proclaim the president's innocence as loudly as he has accused him of wrongdoing? Or will he weakly charge that the absence of evidence proving the president's guilt doesn't mean the president is innocent? , Perhaps the next investigation should be conducted by the Hnpartial General Accounting Office and the voters. How many r'pngressional staff hours were dedicated to investigating Whitewa\u00ad ij!r? How much money was needlessly wasted on office work? How !Jluch of our representatives' time was spent on Whitewater rather tpBh attending to the real interests of constituents? , There is one way to find out: Call Rep. Leach at 1-202-225-6576 I\\Dd ask him. Or call his Iowa City office at 351-0789. His staff s,bould be willing to answer a few questions from a constituent.

Decorating problems for the self.-righteous My wife has a thing for bobbins. She likes to put them in baskets and look at them. \"Decorating prob\u00ad lems,\u00b7 she calls them. Like most college students, we're more or less poverty strick\u00ad en and putting bobbins in baskets and looking at them is one of the few entertain\u00ad ments we can almost afford. On a recent trip to nearby Kalona, Susan found a lamp made from a mon\u00ad ster bobbin. I could tell she loved it. \"Buy it,\" I said. She tried to get out of it, not wanting to spend money frivolously. \"Buy it,\" I said. She grimaced but cracked open her purse. As Susan waited for the merchant to ring up her purchase, I browsed disinterestedly at the jewelry case. That's where I saw the swastika. It was silver, I think, with some type of clear stones inlaid. I wanted to throw up. I felt if I didn't leave the store at once, I'd do the big spit right there. When I showed the pin to Susan, her eyebrows wilted with disappointment. She knew I was going to say we couldn't buy any\u00ad thing there. She wanted the lamp badly. Not wanting to spoil this small happiness for her, I thought I might still be able to satisfy my out\u00ad rage if I could at least get the merchant to acknowledge that he was profiting from hatred. \"Do you know you have a jeweled swastika brooch in here?\" I asked the man. \"Yes,\" he sighed, as if he'd heard it before. Susan's grip on the lamp tightened. \"Don't,\" she Baid. I was defmitely going to splash. \"Do you have a lot of Nazi customers?\" I asked the man. \"Did you know that's an Indian symbol for good luck?\" he said. \"iJli'iiJ\u00a7;1IIIIIIIIIIIII The truth is, I did know. But it made me angry that he knew. \"I wonder if it's been able to retain that meaning,\" I said. The man said nothing. He rang up the lamp. Susan paid, and the creep didn't say thank-you or goodbye or anything. It was just over. Outside, I entertsined some ideas out loud. I was going to contact an acquaintance in the Iowa International Socialist Organization at school who would organize a picket on the upcoming weekend of the Kalona quilt show, one of the town's biggest events (and business days) of the year. A raucous demonstration calling for the end of hatred and insensitive profiteering would be held in front of this very store. Bullhorns would echo through the streets. Candles would burn. Hell, I thought, I might even show up myself. Susan and I went to a few more antique stores and reminded ourselves it was a beauti\u00ad ful day. Susan smiled a lot, all cheeks and blue eyes. She was thinking of the lamp under her arm, of the shade she would buy for it, of the baskets that would go beneath it and the bob\u00ad bins that would be in them, which we would look at together. At the last antique store on the circuit, we found a cache of cheap quilts. Bonanzal I'd been aghast at the price of them so far. Then I saw a blue and white one that knocked the wind out of me, and again I felt bile on the rise. \"Where the hell are we?\" I said, as I unfolded the elaborately detailed quilt embroidered with large blue swastikas, \"the twilight zone?\" Aloud, I was outraged, impassioned. Inside, however, I was trembling with the moral victo\u00ad ry I was staking out for myself -no matter how cheap the quilts were, we wouldn't be spending money in this store! Then I read the note card attached to the quilt. It explained that the quilt had been sewn years before the war, when the terrible symbol hadn't yet acquired its contemporary meaning. The woman who made the quilt was so horri\u00b7 fied when the Nazis adopted the symbol that she made a cover for the quilt and never took it off, accounting for its near-perfect condition. I imagined how she must have felt lying beneath the quilt, trying like me not to feel sick, reminding herself again and again that ahe was warm. I felt my victory slipping away. The woman behind the counter of the store leaned out and smiled brightly at us. \"Your hair is so pretty,' she said to Susan. I stood there confronted with my own hypocrisy . I saw a symbol of something I have disdain for -racial hatred -and the reapolll8 it triggered overpowered my sensibilitie8 . I'm still not wild about the retailing of swaatikaa. It strikes me as unnecessarily insensitive con\u00ad sidering the modem connotations of the sym\u00ad bol, innocubus origins aside. But I knew that it had a previous incarnation and that there were likely understandable reasons for its ugly prel\u00b7 ence in little Kalona. I had my symbols confused . It wasn't the swaatika I was angry about, it was the money. Money is the one symbol for which Americana demand respect, and I'm loathe to report that I'm no different. Had the first merchant been a tad more servile, a bit more willing to surren\u00b7 der his meaning of the symbol to mine, I might have left his store with that rush of con\u00ad sumeristic pleasure. But he didn't, and now I only want to wedge Susan's bobbin lamp into his duodenum and take our money back. Learning a lesson is bad enough but paying for it in cash, that really hurts.

Final thoughts on the wife of my youth Three kegs, live disc jockey, card room, blunt room, Fri\u00ad day night, no people. The party was dead. Ali sat alone on a couch sipping the tap; he had started drinking again since he split from Nia. An old acquaintance spotted him as she passed by. \"Ali? Is that you?\" \"Sharice, hey, how you doin'?\" In days past, these two had a thing for each other. But Ali was dating Nia then, and Sharice moved out Welt. Now, the circumstances were different . Funny how they would meet here after all. Of course, the conversation eventually became personal. Ali suggested, \"We can do lunch tomorrow . Just tell your man I'm an old friend.\" \"What's my man got to do with this?\" \"Oh, so you do have a man. What's his name?\" \"No, I have a good man. His name is Malik.\" \"Malik? Was that the name he was born with? What did his momma name him, Mal\u00ad colm?\" Sharice glared at him while he snickered. \"Is that supposed to make me wanna eat lunch with you tomorrow? What name were you born with, anyway?\" \"Ali. I'm all true, you know that. Hey, I'm sor\u00ad ry, girl. You're right. A good man is hard to find.\" \"Right. Whether they're rich, poor, in school, in jail, selling drugs or on them, most brothers are either wannabe gangsters or sellin' out, chasing the light skin women or white ones and showing no respect to any sister who has her stuff together.\" \"Well, I WOUldn't say most brothers fall into those categories, although generally I would agree. American culture throws the light skin, super thin, super fine waif at you and, yes, my wife is very light. Her complexion may have been what initially attracted me to her, but I still think maybe you watch too much TV. I'll tell you something else, though, a good woman is hard to find, too.\" \"What do you mean?\" Sharice was glaring harder now. \"Now, don't get mad ... \" Ali took her back to earlier that Friday afternoon at the office of a divorce lawyer. After listening to the attorney, Ali said, \"Please try to appreciate my situation: My wife leaves me for another man, but she is too much of a coward to tell me. So I spent the next two months fruitlessly trying to reconcile. All the while, she's lounging with some dude and playing me like Super Nintendo until final\u00ad ly everything blows up in her face. She's bust\u00ad ed. Clearly we need a divorce and she is respon\u00ad sible. So is she punished? No. What does she get? Two hundred dollars a month in child sup\u00ad port from me, plus she gets to raise our child except for two months in the summer when my baby gets to visit her daddy. What do I get?\" The lawyer eased back into his chair and shook his head. \"So what do I get, Sharice? The tramp gets a new life with a new man and money from me for primary care of my child. What do I get for trying to be a responsible man and do the right thing? I get to lose my family and every month I pay money to a woman who doesn't deserve it, who could never tell me the truth about what was going on with this man, but nevertheless who now has the court-ordered privilege to raise my child without me.\" Sharice eased back into the couch and shook her head. Ali continued, \"It makes you wonder how many of those 'delinquent dads' on the states' hit lists are not paying child support because they have been scorned for trying to do the right thing?\" \"Just because your woman is a hoochla doesn't mean you don't take care of your baby.\" \"But that's what I'm talk.ing about. Money never mada me and it sure can't replace me. It takes time spent telling her black folktale. about Br'er Rabbit or John Henry, teaching her to play Hot Peas and Butter and Misl' Mary Mack, and just being there 24-seven filling her head with knowledge. The money just goes into her checking account and then who knows where?\" He was on a roll. \"You see, the judge takes 'primary care' to mean who has the nearest rel\u00ad atives? Who took the baby to the doctor the most? And so on. But it takes more than that to raise a black child in America. Who is going to teach her to dream? To continue to strive in the face of a white male global power system that ill against her? Certainly not someone who cannot even respect herself.\" \"But listen,\" Sharice had discovered a coun\u00ad the baby groWl up and leavea home? You knew Nia before the baby was born, and you would have been with her long after the baby had moved out. If the love isn't there, then your livea would be mieer\u00ad able. The baby haa nothing to do with that. In fact, she's better oft' not growing up in a home where two parente don't love each other.\" \"I did love her. I did. And she said she loved me.\" \"Well, sometimes love isn't enough. Kelp your head up, Ali. You're stlll young, attractive; you have a lot to give and the right woman will appreciate it IOmeday.\" She looked deeply into his eyes, held hi. trembling hands and smiled. He caught her radiant eye. with hi., and be wanted to return her affection. \"But you won't find it tonight, honey.

I DI SAFEWALK coverage doesn't tell whole story To the Editor: The members of the SAFEWALK stu\u00ad dent committee would like to respond to an article by Sheba Wheeler pub\u00ad lished July 5 and an editorial by Julia Cibul published July 6. The front-page article by Ms. Wheeler states that the program will be suspended due to lack of office space. Presumably taking that article as fact, Ms. Cibul expands upon that article to call for a re-evaluation of \"all facets of the service and focus on student needs. \" The editorial asserts that\" Associated Residence Halls, the Hillcrest Associa\u00ad tion, UISA and the Department of Res\u00ad ident Services should get their priori\u00ad ties in order and work together again. N We want to make sure everyone rec\u00ad ognizes that it was our decision as SAFEWALK 's coordinators to suspend the service, and that decision was not the responsibility of any other organi\u00ad zation. We are the same student committee members that conceived the idea of SAFEWALK in May of 1992, planned it for eight months, then implemented it in March of 1993. We have met twice weekly for nearly two years, recruiting and training over 75 volunteers, walk\u00ad ing residents 450 times and operating a service that has utilized over 250 vol\u00ad unteer hours per week for a total of 4,000 hours per semester. In addition to operating the pro\u00ad gram, we have sought the advice and support of several campus and com\u00ad munity offices and organizations, including the Department of Public Safety, Associated Residence Halls, Cambus, UISA, the Department of Residence Services, the Office of the Dean of Students, the Women's Resource and Action Center, the Rape Victim Advocacy Program, Alpha phi Omega and the UI Committee for Safety and Security. We have also sur\u00ad veyed 10 other universities with similar programs. According to Ms. Cibul, \"there is more talk than action: We beg to dif\u00ad fer. Let us restate that SAFEWALK is a pilot program. This means that we operate and constantly evaluate all aspects of our service. After much deliberation and examination of the patterns that evolved over the last three semesters, we have decided to explore the feasibility of a ride pro\u00ad gram. This brings a whole new set of logistics, yet both Ms. Wheeler and Ms. Cibullatch on to the lack of office space as the primary consideration for . our decision. This is simply not true. As Michael Villari clearly states, \u00b7We are in the process of changing its nature into a riding service that will allow us to offer more services to a larger amount of people around the cam\u00ad pus: We agree with Ms. Wheeler's state\u00ad ment that HSAFEWALK would be more of an asset to the community if the program could offer its services to a greater number of students. N That's exactly what our goal is. According to Ms. Cibul, \"no expansion is needed - just maintain the original service.\" That service is available to only 2,000 of the Ul's 28,000 students -expansion is imperative. Expansion is not an easy task, yet it does'not hinge solely on the necessity of locating office space. From the beginning, we as the com\u00ad mittee members not only wanted to develop a safety program, we wanted to do it right. Safety is not simple. We completely agree with Hillcrest resi\u00ad dent Lisa Rumack's characterization of SAFEWALK as a necessary service. Yet we want to operate a service that rec\u00ad ognizes the unique characteristics of the UI campus and makes the best use of the resources the UI already offer~ . If you want to get involved, then let us know. There is certainly a lot to be done with safety on this campus. Last semester, the UISA created the SAVE Commission for Safety and Anti-Vio\u00ad lence Education. It is this commission that will spearhead the safety effort on campus -we hope that many will participate . Regardless if a safety pro\u00ad gram is operating -whether it will be a walk or a ride program -we encourage every student, staff and fac\u00ad ulty member to continue to act responsibly about their personal safety. Dave Howard Michael Villari Iowa City Collectors of razor blade wrappers are urged to contact Italian man have any information concerning similar collections, please write to: To the Editor: When my husband and I visited Rome, Italy, last year, we became acquainted with a gentleman and his wife. This Alfonso Tozzi via Pescaglia 27-00146 Rome, Italy gentleman is a collector of various razor blade wrappers, especially Gillette. I am sure he would be delighted to hear from anyone as to where he may obtain such items or any information regarding similar collections. l I , t . , , . This seems to be a rather unusual collectible since elec\u00ad tric razor and disposable razors have been in existence for some time now. However, if any of your readers know of or IBlown Away' was great To the Editor: I was sad to read Tad Paulson's neg\u00ad ative review of the \"big-time action flick\" -\"Blown Away.\" It is true that this movie is a no-brainer. So what. It is wonderfully entertainingl Paulson is absolutely correct when he says that \"Blown Away\" 's special effects are \"commonplace .\" So what. In fact, most of what Mr. Paulson writes about this movie is true, but what I feel needs to be defended is what is happening away from the spe\u00ad cial effects. So I offer you two reasons why you should not miss this summer jewel. The first reason is the relation-ship between Jeff Bridges' character Jimmy Dove and Ryan Gaerity (played by the spectacular Tommy Lee Jones). Paulson calls this relationship a Hcat\u00ad and-mouse game.\" Fine. But what he does not mention is the need these two characters have to accomplish what they do best. They are both explosive artists. Each one of Ryan Gaerity's bombs is a work of genius. A masterpiece . Jimmy Dove's art is untangling these complex explosives. A \"cat-and-mouse game,\" maybe, but which one's the cat? My second and final point has to do with fantasy vs. semireal ity. If special effects, handsome heroes and witty one-liners are traits that make a good Uilian F. Celani Cranston, R.t. action film, then \"Blown Away\" is not a good action film. There is nothing \"fantastic\" about this movie, which is why I would place it in a genre that I will call the semi reality action film. It is \"semireality\" because, after all, it is fic\u00ad titious.

Forsyth Iowa City Don't use tax money for vivisection To the Editor: Regarding an article In the 01 about the use of animals in research at the UI. If most of the money for research comes from the public sector, then why isn't the general public allowed to come in the laboratory behind closed doors to see how their money is being used? Could the researchers be afraid the public might be outraged if they were to actu\u00ad ally see the experiments that go on? If there is no misery, suffering and pain going on, then why not allow anyone to watch and / or videotape at any time anyone wants to? Now I'm sure the biomedical research community can tell us of some great advance in knowledge from vivisec\u00ad tion. But how often do they tell us about the drugs that were tested on animals but were later found to have an adverse effect on humans? When there's big money in something, I can be sure the propaganda that comes out of it is biased and one-sided. If the researchers had to switch to alternatives, would it mean a reduction in the amount of money that comes in? Would it eliminate some jobs? How much of that research is done over and over again even thouy,h the results are known from past similar experi\u00ad lI\\eI\\\\s1 If research on animals is such a good thing, then why has there been an increase in cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and many more human ailments? The medical community should be more oriented in PREVENTION of illness rather than in costly remedies and cures. If you feel the same and would like to help end vivi\u00ad section, please contact the UI Animal Coalition.

U.S. Trade Representative Mick\u00ad ey Kantor announced the decision, saying he was acting because of \"Japan's failure to address long\u00ad standing discrimination against United States suppliers.\" American telecommunications giants have long complained that they are essentially locked out of the $10 billion telecommunications mar\u00ad ket because of discriminatory actions by the largely government-owned Nippon Telephone and Telegraph.

A high-level Japanese delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi arrived in Wash\u00ad ington on Thursday to make one last attempt to resolve the dispute before Sunday's deadline. However, the talks, which were led on the U.S. side by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, produced no breakthroughs and were recessed Saturday. Barshefsky said the negotiations were likely to resume in September .

On Sunday, the chief Senate Whitewater critic, Alfonse D'Amato, renewed charges on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Altman gave confi\u00ad dential material about the investi\u00ad gation to White House aides last Feb. 2 -one of whom briefed Presi\u00ad dent Clinton. When reporters pointed out that Hanson has told congressional com\u00ad mittees in closed-door interviews that she kept Bentsen informed, the secretary responded, \"That is not correct, and we have a different rec\u00ad ollection of that.\" \"Ms. Hanson's possible disclosure of information other than that relat\u00ad ing to the president would seem to go beyond what was necessary to achieve her stated purpose of assist\u00ad ing the White House with its press function.\" beyond what was necessary\" to achieve her stated purpose: helping presidential aides answer press inquiries, the report said.

A referral is a memo to the Jus\u00ad tice Department asking that agency to consider criminal prosecution.

Residents of four canyons were told to flee, and thousands of others were warned to be ready to evacuate if flames threatened their homes. Firefighters feared the blowtorch effect of rising daytime heat and high winds on the Rat Creek fire. \"It's been happening every day like that for the past five days,\" said Mike Ferris, a tire information offi\u00ad cer at the base camp for the fire about 80 miles east of Seattle. The Rat Creek fire destroyed five homes late Saturday night in the Blewett Pass area as the blaze jumped U.S. Highway 97 south of Leavenworth. While many Western fires were started by lightning, the cause of this blaze, which began Fri\u00ad day, was listed as suspicious . The residents east of Leaven\u00b7 worth were warned to evacuate dur-ing the night as the fire raced east\u00ad ward, more than doubling in size to nearly 13,000 acres. There was no official estimate of the number of people affected.

Some 3,000 people living in the Leavenworth area, plus more than 2,500 residents of the nearby towns of Cashmere, Peshastin and Dry\u00ad den, were put on alert to be ready to evacuate.

Director Benjamin Chavis Jr. denied Sunday that he sexually harassed a former employee and accused the woman in a countersuit of failing to keep her end of an out\u00ad of -court agreement. In his first public response, Chavis promised to fight the allega- .,.. tions and a $250,000 lawsuit the woman tiled in June against the NAACP that claims the group reneged on the settlement. Chavis came under fire because l\\e had agreed to give the woman up to $332,400 of the organization's money without telling the 64 tlAACP board members . Board members were furious when they learned last week of the settlement and the woman's lawsuit; at least one said Chavis should resign. Chavis said the accusati.ons of sexual harassment \"are completely false and have no merit.\" \"I do not minimize the harm of sexual harassment when it hap\u00ad pens,\" Chavis said at a news confer\u00ad ence. \u00b7We do not intend to allow these false allegations to usurp my energy or commitment to continue to lead the NAACP in the positive ~irection we embarked upon 18 months ago.\" Chavis and the ex-worker, Mary Stansel, reached their settlement in November 1993. According to court records, Stansel was to be paid $50,000 and then six monthly installments of $5,400. Under another provision of the agreement, the National Associa\u00ad tion for the Advancement of Colored People was to pay Stansel $250,000 if Chavis could not find her another Associated Press Benjamin Chavis, NAACP execu\u00ad tive director, privately agreed to use as much as $332,400 in NAACP funds to payoff a former employee who accused him of sexual harassment and is now being sued for reneging. for Chavis last year when he sought his job. NAACP officials said she worked as an interim assistant to Chavis for about a month. Stansel has an unlis.ted telephone ., -number in the Washington, D.C., area and could not be reached for comment. Board member Joseph Madison said Sunday that Chavis and Gib\u00ad son should step aside temporarily while the board investigates the case and conducts an independent audit of both of their offices. \"This is not an attempt to con\u00ad demn Dr. Chavis or Dr. Gibson, but assure the members and supporters of the NAACP that the appropri.ate checks and balances are in place,\" Madison said. The cash settlement came as the 85-year-old civil rights group finan\u00ad cially struggles. Recently Chavis revealed that the NAACP had a budget shortfall of nearly $3 mil\u00ad lion, had laid off 10 employees and expected to trim more jobs. Chavis said he settled with Stansel rather than fight the sexual harassment allegations in court to \"protect the NAACP from exposure to (alse and slanderous allegations.\" \"I made an protect the NAACP,\" Chavis said. \"I believe it would have been irresponsible of me ... to have allowed this matter to linger.\" Chavis_ said he learned of Stansel's lawsuit July 18 after he returned {fom the NAACP's annual meeting in Chicago.

And now, following Friday's shot\u00ad gun slayings of a doctor and his escort outside an abortion clinic, they know and accept that their duties put them at risk of deadly violence. \"When you open your eyes in the morning, you almost have to be willing to say it might be the day you die,\u00b7 said Debbie Myers, coor\u00ad dinator of 20 escorts volunteering their services in the Pensacola area. \"We've all had to look inside our\u00ad selves after what happened. Every\u00ad one knew what the realities were. We've always talked about it. Escorting is not for everyone,\u00b7 she said. An escort's primary mi88ion is to accompany abortion patients, many of whom are bewildered and frightened, through throngs of abortion protesters who gather out\u00ad side clinics. In trying to stop abortions, pro\u00ad testers use tactics like displaying pickled fetuses or bloody baby dolls, mimicking an infant's cry, shouting that women have died during abortions or telling patients that they are murderers and are condemning themselves to hell, DOCTOR Continued from Page 1 al protection for clinics. \"The extremists have embarked on a murder strategy. They have no legal right to threaten to kill us,\" Smeal said. \"We want federal mar\u00ad shals to come in to protect the clin\u00ad ics. There is no reason doctors, nurses, escorts and patients have got to risk their lives.\" There waS no nationwide order to post marshals at abortion clinics, according to U.S. Marshals Service spokesman Dave Branham . \"If we are out there, it's in response to a request for our pres\u00ad ence based on the Freedom of Acc:ess to Clinic Entrances Act,\" he said Sunday. However, the U.S. Marshal for Kansas, Rand Rock, said there would be an official announcement in Washington today. On Sunday, June Barrett and other family members were among 150 people at a memorial service for her husband at their church, the Pensacola Unitarian Universalist Fellowship . \"We all know he died doing some- HAITI Continued from Page 1 the Security Council, but their rep\u00ad resentatives asked to speak prior to the vote. Haitian Ambassador Fritz Longchamp, who represents the Aristide government, welcomed the outcome. , \"The Haitian community would like a8 much as possible to avoid military action, but there is no alternative to getting rid of the mili\u00ad tary,\u00bb he said after the vote. : Albright told NBC television's SIMPSON Continued from Page 1 After Camacho made that claim, prosecutors disputed that Fair\u00ad banks ever told him he could talk to the press about Simpson, who has pleaded innocent to killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Gold\u00ad man. The trial is set to start Sept. 19. . Shively's grand jury testimony stood out because it could place Simpaon away from his Brentwood mansion at the time when prosecu\u00ad tOrs believe the killings occurred. , Other witnesses said they saw Simpson before and after that peri\u00ad Od. : Shi\u00a5ely told the grand jury on June 21 that on the night of the 8layinga while she was driving to a RWANDA , Qontinued from Page 1 Rwanda is a catastrophe,\" said Prime Minister Faustin Twagira\u00ad qlungu. , 'There is no money in the central bank or in private banks because the ao-called self-proclaimed gov\u00ad e.l'nment has taken all the money,\" he laid, referring to the govern\u00ad ment driven into exile by the Rwan\u00ad dan Patriotic Front, which installed the new leadership . \"To find a solu\u00ad tion, we have the out\u00ad IIide world.\" , That meanl going, hat in hand, t:o the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Euro\u00ad pean Union and individual coun\u00ad tries, luch as the United States, for help. \"We need money and for that we MId creclit,\" Twapramungu IBid. Rwanda hal little to offer 81 col-according to abortion rights groups. But escorts say they are there for support, not as bodyguards. \"We don't guard clinics. We are there to see that the women get . safely inside,\u00b7 Myers said. \"It used to be we were human shields. We act as a human buffer. We try to minimize the emotional pain.\" Myers was the first escort assigned to greet Dr. John Britton, who began flying into Pensacola to perform abortions each Friday 17 months after Dr. David Gunn was slain outside an aflUiated clinic. Britton, wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot through the head Friday along with James Barrett, a retired Air Force officer who had met him at the city's airport. Bar\u00ad rett's wife, June, was wounded in the arm in the shootings. The Bar\u00ad retts were trained by Myers. Although most escorts are unarmed and all are trained in nonviolent procedures, Barrett was carrying a handgun in his pickup truck when the shootings occurred. \"My father was a military man. He believed his primary mission was the keeping of the peace. He believed that when he was killed on Friday. I would ask that we all continue his work. There is in our family a rededication to his princi\u00ad ples,\" Dandy Barrett Witty, James Barrett's daughter, said. Another volunteer made a public promise Sunday to carry on James Barrett's memory by continuing to escort patients. thing he strongly believed in,\" Bar\u00ad rett's son, Bruce, told the congrega\u00ad tion. \"He died with his boots on. He was a soldier in the war for human rights.\" June Barrett, escorted by her husband's grandson, Jason Witty, an Air Force ainnan in a blue dress uniform, accepted embraces and condolences from well wishers. The Barretta both were widowed and have children from first marriages. Dandy Barrett Witty urged oth\u00ad ers to continue her father's work. \"My dad knew it was dangerous, \" she said. \"Dad was a feisty 5-foot-7, 145-pound Mighty Mouse. I think he thought he was invincible .\" The Barretts, who moved here from Annapolis , Md., two years ago, were volunteers who helped escort patients from their cars into the clinic to shield them from protesters and picked up the doctor at Pen\u00ad sacola Regional Airport. Hill remained in jail Sunday without bond. He moved to Pen\u00ad sacola two years ago after leaving the Presbyterian ministry following \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that Latin American countries were con\u00ad cerned about \"some trend in inter\u00ad vention that is absolutely not true: Aristide sent a letter to the Unit\u00ad ed Nations on Friday calling on the international community to \"take prompt and decisive action under the authority of the United Nations\" to restore democracy in Haiti. Most council members, especially Latin American countries, said they would need specific clearance from grocery store, she saw Simpson rac\u00ad ing around in his white Bronco without its lights on just a few blocks from his ex-wife's house. \"He just gave me a real quick ,look, like what was I -you know -it loo~ed like he was mad or angry,\" Shively testified, according to transcripts released Friday. Shively said that despite her anger with prosecutors, she is still willing to testify at the trial. \"They told me to be prepared that I could be testifying,\" she said. \"I'm handling everything as if they're going to call me.\u00bb In other develop'ments in the Simpson case: \" Defense lawyer Robert Shapiro lateral other than plans and promises. Infrastructure is in piece . War deltroyed factoriel, schools, hospitals and bridges. For\u00ad eign help is needed to restore elec\u00ad tricity, running water and tele\u00ad phone service. Despite the huge international relief effort, Twagiramungu said people are dying of hunger allover Rwanda. Food Cropl are witherillf and dying in abandoned fields. Without continued massive aid, relief workers fear famine. No one knows how long it will take for this tiny country to feed itself. No one knowl how long mil\u00ad liona of refugees and displaced peo\u00ad ple willltay away from their homes and farms, living on handouts. Mo.t of Rwanda'. foreign exchange came from exporting \"I pledge to you I will pick up your burden as long as I can, and I will carry it so long as I have the strength and the life,\" said Julius Wernicke, 79, who spent a sleep\u00ad less night before attending the ser\u00ad vice at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship . \"I'm not going to back out now,\" Wernicke said. \"I recognize there is some risk. I just figure I'll be all right.\u00b7 William Caplinger , also a mem\u00ad ber of the church with Barrett and Wernicke, had escorted Britton from the airport the previous three weeks and would have been the doctor's driver if Barrett had not returned from an out-of-town trip. \"If it had been me, Jim Barrett would be out here today in my spot,\u00b7 said Caplinger, who became an escort after Gunn's slaying in 1992. \"Nothing has changed,\" Escorts were first used when demonstrations outside abortion clinics became more confrontation\u00ad al in the 1980s. They have been organized and trained at work\u00ad shops by such groups as the National Organization for Women. The Feminist Majority held a workshop in Pensacola this year on the anniversary of Gunn's death on what escorts could expect outside a clinic. One of the protesters outside the workshop was Paul Hill, the former minister held in Friday's shootings . He shouted outside the work\u00ad shop, \"Abortion is murder, and murderers deserve to be executed.\" a falling out with a congregation in Lake Worth. Although critical of federal authorities, Taggart has praised Pensacola police for helping protect the clinic, including officers who work as off-duty security guards. She said the shootings took place minutes before a guard was due to arrive. Police must defend someone's right to protest, said Sgt. Jerry Potts. \"We have done the best we can to be there and see that everyone's rights are protected, \" Potts said. But some abortion rights advo\u00ad cates said police haven't done enough. \"The reason this is happening here is that it's gotten the tacit approval of the community ,\" said Pensacola NOW member Debbie Myers, a clinic escort coordinator . \"These extremists are becoming more and more desperate. It will happen again. 'It's definitely like being in a war zone: Aristide before they could approve a possible U.S.-led invasion. The Haitian military ousted Aris\u00ad tide in 1991 and has defied a world\u00ad wide trade and oil embargo and a U.S. ban on most finsncial transac\u00ad tions with Haiti. U.S. forces finished four days of war exercises near Puerto Rico on Saturday and steamed toward Haiti to resume patrols off the coast of the Caribbean island. said Simpson's angry confrontation with Brown Simpson and her then\u00ad boyfriend, Keith Zlomsowitch , a day after a sexual encounter Simpson witnessed, merely showed a father's concern for his children's welfare, not an obsession which led to mur\u00ad der. \" Zlomsowitch's father told a newspaper his son dated Brown Simpson after she was separated from Simpson -but before their divorce was final. ' \"They met, they fell in love with each other, they went out together for a while and then they decided, 'Maybe we're not meant for each other,' \" Frank Zlomsowitch told The Tampa 7Hbune. 30,000 ton8 of coffee a year. But this year, because of the war and the people's panicked flight, there will be no exports. With the crops dead and factories destroyed, Rwanda needs people to rebuild. To lure them home and attract more aid, the new govern\u00ad ment has to instill confidence in its commitment to reconciliation and rebuilding. \"We have to assure not only the American people, but the whole world that we are not going to get into the trap of revenge, retribution and reprisals, We are here to build our nation,\" Twagiramungu said Sunday. \"We mUlt have a clear plan, that il our duty as a government,\" he aaid. \"But once we have that plan, they must help us.\" MONDAY PRIME TIME Doonesbury Doonesbury weu, r Shom No. 0620 ACROSS , Bend Exchange Polite form of Iddrell '1 Actor Cllhoun '.Make-for (argue Club\" 11 Rule UYleld U Dubbed one ... 1951 mov)e with 16\u00b7Across :a, Stumble :II River to Caspian :II Veterans Day mo.

New Orleans coach dies of apparent heart attack NEW ORLEANS (AP) -Two months after it hired Tommy Joe Eagles, the University of New Orleans was preparing for his funeral and looking for a new bas\u00ad ketball coach. Eagles, 45, died of an apparent heart attack Saturday in Salt Lake City, during a recruiting trip. An autopsy Sunday discovered that he had an enlarged heart\u00ad probably from a virus, said K.D. Kilpatrick of Kilpatrick Funeral Home in Ruston. The medical examiner's office in Salt Lake City could not make any statements, spokesman Rhett Thorpe said. UNO won't start its search for a new coach at least until Wednesday, athletic director Ron Maestri said. \"We're talking about some\u00ad body who never had a drink or a smoke,\" said Iowa State coach Tim Floyd, a longtime friend whom Eagles replaced May 31 at UNO. Eagles also was an avid jog\u00ad ger, and appeared to be in excel\u00ad lent health. PGA Rookie captures st. Jude Classic crown in playoff MEMPHIS , Tenn. (AP) - Rookie Dicky Pride sank a 20-foot putt on the first hole of a three\u00ad way playoff Sunday, capturing the $1.25 million Federal Express St. Jude Classic for his first victory on the PGA Jour. Pride joined Hal Sutton and Gene Sauers in the playoff by ral\u00ad lying with a 22-foot birdie putt on No. 18 after bogeying the 17th. Sauers, putting first on the playoff hole, came up inches short. Sauers was left of the hole after Pride's birdie putt. Pride shot his third straight 4- under-par 67 and finished at 267 tied with Sutton (64) and Sauers (66), who also birdied 18 to go to 267. Sutton won this tournament in 1985 and tied the course record of 30 on the front nine in moving into contention. He is playing the tour this year after using his one\u00ad time only exemption as a mem\u00ad ber of the Top 50 career money list. He took the lead at 17-under by two-putting from 20 feet for a birdie on No. 16. Pride had birdie putts lip out of the hole on Nos. 13 and 15 and moved into a tie at 17-under by birdying 16. But he bogeyed 17 as he stood on a root for a chip shot from the rough and sent his ball 30 feet past the hole. Six golfers led throughout the final round, and Gil Morgan blew a three-stroke lead at 18-under with a bogey on the par-4 13 and a double-bogey on 14. NHL Penguins' Lemieux unlikely ~o play 1994-95 season : PITISBURGH (AP) -Mario Lemieux will meet with Pittsburgh Penguins owner Howard Baldwin this week and likely will tell him he isn't healthy enough to play this season, according to sources close to the team. Lemieux, who missed nearly three-quarters of the 1993-94 season following his second back operation in four years, has missed at least 25 games over each of the last five seasons due to a bad back and Hodgkin's dis\u00ad ease. The Penguins would not con\u00ad firm broadcast reports Sunday night that Lemieux has decided to temporarily retire from the game or will sit out the first half of the season before deciding whether to return in the 1994-95 season. Baldwin has said only that he will meet with Lemieux this week in an effort to determine the Lemieux's plans for this season. Lemieux missed nearly two months of the '92-93 season after developing Hodgkin's disease. Doug Alden The Daily Iowan After winning the Prime Time League regular season, Goodfellow Printing-Imprinted Sportswear capped off the SUDlmer with a 103- 91 win over Lepic-Kroeger Real\u00ad tors-Active Endeavors in Sunday night's championship game. Goodfellow rebounded after a slow start and shut down Lepic\u00ad Kroger's outside game late in the second half to win the title. Lepic Kroeger was up by 12 points midway through the first half and led 43-39 at halftime, but Goodfellow exploded early in the second half. Val Barnes put Goodfellow up 46-45 with a 3-pointer early in the half for Goodfellow's first lead. Lep\u00ad ie-Kroeger went cold and Goodfel\u00ad low improved the lead to eight mid\u00ad way through the half. Lepic Kroeger cut the lead sever\u00ad al times, but Goodfellow always built the lead right back. Jermain Willform led Goodfellow with 29 points and Les Jepsen poured in 25 and had 14 rebounds. Lepic-Kroeger did not get any help from leading scorer Kenyon Murray. The Hawkeye forward went 2-for-10 from the field and ended with 12 points. Marcus Coty scored 35 in the losing effort. Hawkeye point guard Mon'ter Glasper had 13 points for Goodfel\u00ad low and said winning the league was rewarding. \"The first couple of games we played together, our team was kind of shaky. We got things to come together a t the end of the season and we came out with a championship. Mon'ter Glasper, Iowa guard \"This is my first PTL champi\u00ad onship and it feels good,\" Glasper said. \"The first couple of games we played together, our team was kind of shaky. We got things to come together at the end of the season and we came out with the champi\u00ad onship.\" Glasper said fatigue was a factor in the game and made Goodfellow adjust its game plan. \"I think we came together men\u00ad tally more than physically because we were kind of tired,\" Glasper said. \"In the second half, I was physically tired and I had to adjust my thinking to be more of a set-up man and get the offense (going) and get back on defense a little bet-T.

Goodfellow finished the summer night. Barnes scored 18 points, had six rebounds with a 12-4 record.

The previous record of 36:27 was held by Germany's Uta Pippig, who did not return to this year's race. Benson Masya also of Kenya won the men's division. He com\u00ad pleted the seven-mile course in 31 :S6, 14 seconds faster than the record set by Thomas Osano of Kenya last year.

Joseph White Associated Press BARCELONA, Spain -Differ\u00ad ent country, same result. Even when the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Raiders play in a foreign country, the fans get their money's worth. Jeff Jaeger, who last year twice beat the Broncos with winning kicks, did it again Sunday with a 39-yard field goal 4:32 into over\u00ad time to give Los Angeles a 25-22 victory in an American Bowl exhi\u00ad bition game. The game, played before the 'smallest American Bowl crowd since the international series began in 1986, featured three 2- point conversion attempts as both coaches experimented freely with the NFL's new rule. The game was classic Raiders VI. Broncos. Los Angeles threw long to open the game, and Denver rallied, though without John Elway, to tie it in the fourth quarter. \"It was a good experience for us,\u00b7 Denver coach Wade Phillips said, \"but we'll be ready for the Raiders when they come to our place, the third game of the year. We're point\u00ad ing toward that one.\" On the first play from scrim\u00ad mage, Denver's revamped sec\u00ad ondary was burned when Jeff Hostetler hit a wide open Jamel Jett deep over the middle for a 75- yard touchdown paS8. It was Jett's second moment of glory at the Montjuic Olympic Sta\u00ad dium. He won a gold medal here in 1992 as a member of the U.S. Olympic 400-meter relay team. \"I got chins the other day when I was out here,\" said Jett, who led Q From what yard line do NFL kickers kick off and how high Is the tee? See answer on Page 9. Record seasons likely in jeopardy RickGano Associated Press CHICAGO -Frank Thomu could face a big hurt in this the best season of his young career. He could be the MVP again, he might go the World Series, he even has a legitimate shot at the triple crown. Then again, he could finisli the season on a golf cOurse. . A strike, not the kind that goes whizzing by the bat at 90 mph but the one in which play. ers don't play ball, could deter\u00ad mine that. It's one part of the game Thomas has little or no control over. \"I'm not really concerned any: more. I knew it was going to happen. I'm just going to do whatever I can before the strike and that's it,\" said Thomas, who entered Sunday's game against Seattle with a league-leadina .365 average, 36 homers and!U RBI. With an Aug. 12 deadline near, the White Sox locker room became a baggage area Sunday as players got ready for what might be their final home gamt! of 1994 since they leave for a Coast trip this week. Belongings were being packed in big moving boxes and secured with tape. Indeed, it did look like the end of the season. \"I'm not going to concern myself worrying about recorda or anything like that because if you get caught up with that, you are going to let yourself down when you do come back,\" said Thomas. Thomas, Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. and Cleveland's Albert Bene are involved in one of the Amer\u00ad ican League's greatest home run races in years. \"We're just in a situation where we picked a bad year to have a good year,\" Griffey said before Sunday's game, the first all season he hasn't started. He'd been in a 7-for-36 slump but was still hitting .322 with 36 homers and 77 RBI. \"We picked a bad time to go out and hit home runs and get on base and hit doubles. \"We've got to stick together 81 See STRIKE.
