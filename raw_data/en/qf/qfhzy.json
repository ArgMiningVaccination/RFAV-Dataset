GALAZKA, MD, University of Virginia School of Medicine and Family Medicine Residency Program, Charlottesville, Virginia Lead is a metal that has been redistrib- uted i n the environment as a result of human activities over thousands of years. It has been used in con- stru ction, for decoration, and even as a food additive. It also has been a known health risk for centuries. Hippocrates is thought to have written the first case report of lead poisoning in 600 BC. The Romans also were aware of the toxicity of lead, with Pliny, Paulus Aegineta, and Vesuvius all commenting on its effects.1 There are no signs and symptoms specific to lead poisoning, making identification based solely on patient history and phy si- cal e xamination difficult. Symptoms that do occur are vague and commonly encoun- tere d in daily practice. These can include gastrointestinal issues (e.g., abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, vomiting), decreased growth in height, delayed sexual maturation, increased dental caries, and impaired neuro- logi c development (e.g., behavioral changes, mental impairment, seizures, coma).2,3 In the United States, an estimated 310,000 children younger than five years have ele- vate d blood lead levels.4 Primary preventive strategies such as eliminating lead as an addi- tive from paint and gasoline have resulted in lower blood lead levels among U.S. children.Definitions The C enters for Disease Control and Pre- vent ion (CDC) currently designates a blood lead level of 1 0 \u00b5g per dL (0.48 \u00b5mol per L) or higher as abnormal and requiring follow- up and intervention.4 Even blood lead levels lower than 10 \u00b5g per dL can affect cognitive development.2,5 Thus, a current dilemma is the nearly impossible task of eliminating all lead exposure in children. For physicians, identifying children at high risk; eliminat- ing e xposure to known sources of lead; and ensuring adequate nutrition, including pre- vent ing and correcting iron deficiency, are key strategies in the care of all children. Sources ofLead Table 1 lists com mon sources of lead to be avoided.3,6,7 Lead poisoning in children is usu- ally c aused by exposure to dust a nd paint chips from interior surfaces of homes with deterio- rati ng lead-based paint.6,8 The U.S. Consumer (http://www. cpsc.gov/) and the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/ nceh/lead/Recalls/default.htm) post recalls of products containing lead. Dust and soil have been contaminated by decades of deposition of airborne lead from leaded gasoline and lead-based paint. Children playing on bare The prevalence and severity of childhood lead poisoning have been greatly reduced since the removal of lead from paint and gasoline in the 1970s. Despite these efforts, approximately 310,000 U.S. children younger than five years have elevated blood lead levels. Health care professionals should perform targeted screening for lead poisoning in chil-dren who are Medicaid-enrolled or -eligible, foreign born, or identified as high risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) location-specific recommendations or by a personal risk questionnaire. Venous sampling is the preferred method for measuring blood lead levels, but a carefully collected finger-stick sample is an acceptable alternative. Capillary samples of elevated levels should be confirmed by a venous sample. The CDC recommends that the threshold for follow-up and intervention of lead poisoning be a blood lead level of 10 \u00b5g per dL or higher. Recom-mendations for treatment of elevated blood levels include a thorough environmental investigation, laboratory testing when appropriate, iron supplementation for iron-deficient children, and chelation therapy for blood lead levels of 45 \u00b5g per dL or more. Prevention consists of education and avoidance of lead-contaminated products. ( Am Fam Physi- cian. 2010;81(6):751-757, 759-760. 2010 American Academy of Family Physicians.)

Race and ethnicity have been linked to hi gher rates of lead poisoning, with non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans being at higher risk than non-Hispanic whites.7,10-12 Chil- dr en from households below the federal poverty level are also more likely to have elevated blood lead levels, SORT:KEYRECOMMENDATIONSFORPRACTICE Clinical recommendationEvidence rating References Targeted screening for elevated blood lead levels should be performed in children at one and two years of age who are Medicaid-enrolled or -eligible.C 6, 8 Targeted screening for elevated blood lead levels should be performed in all children deemed to be at risk.

In itialScreening Most children with elevated blood lead levels are asymptomatic; therefore, the decision for routine screening should not be based on signs or symptoms of lead poisoning. The CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend targeted screening of all Medicaid-enrolled and -eligible children, as well as those who were born outside of the United St ates6,8,16-21 (Table 2 6,8,14-19). This is a change from the universal screening used before 1997 because most children with elevated blood lead levels have since been identified by a national survey as Medicaid-enrolled or -eligible.4,6,20,22 The Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poison- in g Prevention recommends that all children enrolled in Medicaid be screened for elevated blood lead levels at 12 and 24 months of age or at 36 to 72 months of age if they have not previously been screened.8,20 This recommendation also applies to all children deemed to be at risk (as described above), and screen- in g at one year of age sh ould be performed regardless of health insurance status in these children.6 Screening of blood lead levels should be repeated at two years of age even if the level at one year is not elevated, because a low blood concentration in a one-year-old child does not preclude elevation later.6 Foreign-born children should be screened as soon as they arrive in the United States, because studies have shown a high prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in immigrants, refugees, and interna- ti onal adoptees.6,16-21 The number needed to screen (NNS) depends on the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels. Because the prevalence varies by location, an overall NNS cannot be calculated. Physicians should refer to the CDC Web site (http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/data/state.htm) for state- and county-specific prevalence data and screening policies to guide screening decisions for children who are not eligible for Medicaid.14 Diagnosis Venous sampling is the best method for assessing the level of lead in the blood because it limits cutaneous con- ta mination; a carefully collected finger-stick sample is an acceptable alternative.6,8,23-25 If finger-stick screening is used, any elevated blood lead level should be confirmed by a venous sample.26 Laboratories that perform blood lead testing are required to meet federal proficiency stan- da rds with an error range of \u00b1 4 \u00b5 g per dL (0.19 \u00b5mol per L) or \u00b1 10 percent, whichever is greater.8,26 As a result, a blood lead level of 8 \u00b5g per dL (0.39 \u00b5mol per L) could be reported as any value ranging from 4 to 12 \u00b5g per dL (0.19 to 0.58 \u00b5mol per L) and remain within the range of the proficiency standards. Management ofElevated Blood Lead Levels HIGHLEVELS Chelation therapy is recommended by the CDC for blood lead levels of 45 \u00b5g per dL (2.17 \u00b5mol per L) or greater.3,27 The CDC recommends consulting an expert such as a toxicologist before starting chelation th erapy.3 A complete blood count; reticulocyte count; urinalysis; and testing of electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creati- ni ne, and liver function should be performed and any iron deficiency should be identified.3,28 Abdominal radi- og raphy can identify any materials containing lead that remain in the gut.3,28 Enemas such as mineral oil, poly- el ectrolyte solutions, milk and molasses, and hypertonic Table Poisoning Screening Criteria Screenchildrenwhomeetanyofthefollowing criteria: All Medicaid-enrolled or -eligible children at one and two years of age All children who are identified as high risk based on results of a personal risk questionnaire (if one of the following questions is answered \"Yes\" or \"Don't know\"): Does your child live in or regularly visit a house that was built before 1950 (this could apply to a home day care center or the home of a babysitter or relative)? Does your child live in or regularly visit a house built before 1978 with recent or ongoing renovations or remodeling (i.e., within the past six months)? Does your child have a sibling or playmate who has or has had lead poisoning? All refugees, recent immigrants, and international adoptees on arrival in the United States; repeat screening three to six months later for children six months to six years of age All children who are identified to be at increased risk by the CDC's state or local screening recommendations (i.e., high-risk zip codes) In the absence of recommendations from the CDC, screen all children at one and two years of age, and screen children 36 to 72 months of age who have not been previously screened CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Succimer is preferred because it can be administered orally and is better tolerated. Children treated with chelating agents should be monitored closely during and after treat- ment.3 Further information on dosing, side effects, and monitoring can be found in resources such as The Har- riet Lane Handbook28 or a pharmacopeia.29,30 Additionally, an environmental investigation to identify and remediate the source of the lead should be performed in collabora- ti on with the local health department.3,28 Remediation measures include removing th e child from the source of lead, correcting the source of lead by home renovation or cleaning, and avoiding any sources of lead such as con- ta minated soil or products. Children with levels higher than 70 \u00b5g per dL (3 .38 \u00b5mol per L) should be hospitalized immediately for treatment under direct medical supervision.3 MODERATELEVELS If a child's blood lead level is measured as greater than 20 \u00b5g per dL (0.97 \u00b5mol per L) once, or greater than 15 \u00b5g per dL (0.72 \u00b5mol per L) twice, environmental investigation, including a home inspection, should be conducted.3 Children with levels below 45 \u00b5g per dL who are treated with chelation do not demonstrate measurable differences in neurologic, behavioral, and cognitive developmental outcomes.3,31,32 In addition, succimer chelation may actually be harmful in these children. The Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children trial demonstrated a decrease in the rate of growth in height between children treated with succimer and those who received placebo.33 Thus, chelation is not recommended for this group of children. As in the group with high levels of blood lead, chil- dr en with moderate levels should have confirmatory venous sampling and abdominal radiography to identify lead-containing particles. Additional laboratory test- in g includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, and iron studies. Table 3 outlines e ducation and follow-up measures.3 LOWLEVELS For children with a blood lead level of less than 10 \u00b5g per dL, providing basic nutritional and environmental education to parents may be of benefit, although the true effectiveness is unknown.6 Identifying and treating iron deficiency are important in decreasing a child's vulner- ab ility to lead (see Iron Supplementation). The ultimate goal is to maintain the child's blood lead level as low as possible because of evidence that levels of less than 10 \u00b5g per dL still pose a risk of damage to the child's neuro- lo gic development as mentioned previously.3,26Table 3.Summary ofRecommendations forChildren with Confirmed (Venous) Elevated Blood Lead InterventionBlood lead level (\u00b5g per dL [\u00b5mol per L]) 10 to 14 (0.48 to 0.68) 15 to 19 (0.72 to 0.92) 20 to 44 (0.97 to 2.13) 45 to 69 (2.17 to 3.33) > 70 (3.38) Education Diet, environment Diet, environment Diet, environment Diet, environment Diet, environment Actions and interventionsEducation only Repeat measurement of blood lead levels in three months If repeat levels are still in this range or higher, proceed to actions and interventions for 20 to 44 \u00b5g per dL If repeat levels are less than 15 \u00b5g per dL, perform education only at this timeComplete history and physical examination Laboratory testing (hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron status) Abdominal radiography (if particulate ingestion is suspected) with bowel decontamination (if indicated) Environmental investigation Lead hazard reduction Chelation therapyAll actions and interventions as indicated for 20 to 44 \u00b5g per dLHospitalize immediately and begin chelation therapy All actions and interventions as indicated for 45 to 69 \u00b5g per dL Initial follow-up blood lead monitoring (first two to four tests after first high level)Three months One to three months Two weeks to one month As soon as possible As soon as possible Late follow-up blood lead monitoring (after levels begin to decline)Six to nine months Three to six months One month During/after chelation During/after chelation Additional monitoring \u2014 \u2014 Developmental monitoring Developmental monitoring Developmental monitoring Adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

PRIMARYPREVENTION Primary prevention is defined as interventions that prevent a disease or illness before it occurs. Primary prevention of lead poisoning in children includes strategies such as elimi- na ting lead in gasoline and paint, which have had a positive effect in lowering blood lead levels in U.S. children.34 SECONDARYPREVENTION Because lead is ubiquitous in our environment, second- ar y pr evention focuses on identifying asymptomatic children with high levels of lead in their blood. For children with elevated levels, once the source is identi- fie d, the lead hazard should be evaluated, treated, and monitored by a safe-lead authority (often private firms specialize in this and can be identified by the local health department). Follow-up is important to pre- ve nt the cycle of inadequately treated housing expos- in g additional children who subsequently live in the residence.3Other measures of prevention that have been stud- ie d include parental education, dust control, and soil abatement. Educating parents and caregivers about the prevention of lead exposure does not have a no table effect on reducing already elevated lead levels in chil- dren.35 Dust control is not effective when performed by parents and families.35,36 However, if dust control is done by cleaning professionals, there may be the bene- fic ial effect of lowering both environmental and blood lead levels. It is unknown whether this intervention leads to any clinical behavioral or cognitive improve- ment.37 Soil abatement, which involves removing con- ta minated soil and replacing it with fresh soil, has an unknown effect because of high variation among studies.35 IronSupplementation Several studies published within the past 10 years found an association between low iron levels and elevated blood le ad levels in infants and children.38-40 Recent studies sug- ge st that iron therapy may lower blood lead levels in both anemic and non-anemic children.41,42 Findings of these studies support the theory that a lack of iron may increase a child's susceptibility to lead poisoning.43,44 However, other studies have found that iron supplementation did not decrease lead levels in children without iron defi- ciency.43 The CDC currently recommends testing all chil- dr en with elevated blood lead levels for iron deficiency and correcting the deficiency.3 Based on current evidence, the CDC does not recommend placing all at-risk children on an iron supplementation regimen but does ge nerally recommend an iron-rich diet for all children.3 RoleoftheFamily Physician If a child's screening blood lead level is greater than 10 \u00b5g per dL, the family physician is encouraged to per- fo rm a detailed interview looking for potential sources of lead exposure.3 Physicians who do not feel comfort- ab le taking a detailed lead history or providing the fam- il y with counseling should contact their local health department for assistance. The quest for sources of exposure must include the home, school, day care facil- it y, or any place where the child spends a large amount of time. Additionally, parents and caregivers should be educated ab out the risks of lead exposure.3 For children with moderate to high blood levels, a referral to the local health department to identify a case manager is essen- tial.3 Physicians may be the primary providers of devel- op mental monitoring for children exposed to lead. The AAP and the Commonwealth Fund have published use- fu l tools for developmental monitoring.44,45Table 3.Summary ofRecommendations forChildren with Confirmed (Venous) Elevated Blood Lead InterventionBlood lead level (\u00b5g per dL [\u00b5mol per L]) 10 to 14 (0.48 to 0.68) 15 to 19 (0.72 to 0.92) 20 to 44 (0.97 to 2.13) 45 to 69 (2.17 to 3.33) > 70 (3.38) Education Diet, environment Diet, environment Diet, environment Diet, environment Diet, environment Actions and interventionsEducation only Repeat measurement of blood lead levels in three months If repeat levels are still in this range or higher, proceed to actions and interventions for 20 to 44 \u00b5g per dL If repeat levels are less than 15 \u00b5g per dL, perform education only at this timeComplete history and physical examination Laboratory testing (hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron status) Abdominal radiography (if particulate ingestion is suspected) with bowel decontamination (if indicated) Environmental investigation Lead hazard reduction Chelation therapyAll actions and interventions as indicated for 20 to 44 \u00b5g per dLHospitalize immediately and begin chelation therapy All actions and interventions as indicated for 45 to 69 \u00b5g per dL Initial follow-up blood lead monitoring (first two to four tests after first high level)Three months One to three months Two weeks to one month As soon as possible As soon as possible Late follow-up blood lead monitoring (after levels begin to decline)Six to nine months Three to six months One month During/after chelation During/after chelation Additional monitoring \u2014 \u2014 Developmental monitoring Developmental monitoring Developmental monitoring Adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
