Additionally, for those programs with fully developed EHDI information systems, program will enhance the electronic system capacity to collect data, and exchange data accurately, effectively, securely, and consistently between the EHDI -IS and Electronic Health Record Systems (HER -S). Formula Description: This program has no statutory formula, and no matching or maintenance of effort requirements. Program Supported / Population Served: Since May 2008, the program has been using a web-based, secure online data system (OZ eSP) to track and monitor newborn hearing screening s. Maryland follows the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing protocol of screening by age 1 month, diagnosis by age 3 months, and referral to early intervention services by age 6 months (the 1 -3-6 protocol). All Maryland birth hospitals and birthing centers are required to report births directly into the eSP data system, including demographics, risk factors for later onset hearing loss, and hearing screen results. Audiologists and pediatricians or their staff report hearing screening and diagnostic hearing evaluation test results directly into the system. Early intervention providers use the system to document entry into early intervention services for babies who are diagnosed with a hearing loss. The data system is also used for Critical Congenital Heart Defects and Birth Defects Reporting. This project enhances the existing data system in ways that allow the MD EHDI program to address the challenges to receiving complete, timely and consistent documentation of newborn hearing screening follow -up service s (diagnostic test results and early intervention enrollment). Expected outcomes are the collection of complete, accurate and valid data on follow -up hearing screening, diagnostic testing and early intervention enrollment and outcomes in accordance with the CDC EHDI -IS Functional Standards. This will be accomplished by strengthening data analysis and reporting capabilities, promoting ease of use to reduce the incidence of reluctant users, improvements to the diagnostic page and to expand upon the data rec eived via the State's Health Information Exchange. 93.317 EMERGING INFECTIONS PROGRAM Program Description: The purpose of the Emerging Infections Programs (EIP) is to assist in local, state, and national efforts to prevent, control, and monitor the public health impact of infectious diseases. The EIP cooperative agreement was formed in 1995 as a key component of CDC's national strategy to address and reduce emerging infectious disease (EID) threats. The EIP is a population -based network of state he alth agencies and their collaborators, including (but not limited to) academic institutions, local health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, infection control professionals, and healthcare providers. The network plays a critical role in conducting surveillance and applied epidemiologic and laboratory research, implementing and evaluating prevention and intervention projects, and responding quickly to new infectious disease issues. The unique strength of the EIP lies in the network's abi lity to quickly translate surveillance and research activities into informed policy and public health practice. Formula Description: This program has no statutory formula, and no matching or maintenance of effort requirements. Program Supported / Popul ation Served: Emerging Infections Program : Maryland is one of ten states funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the Emerging Infections Program (EIP). EIP is a national network that conducts enhanced public health surveillance and applied public health research. The Maryland Emerging Infections Program (MD EIP) is a working partnership among MDH , the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the University of Maryland School of Public Health. Maryland became a national EIP network member site in 1997, and over the ensuing twenty years, has developed into a mature partnership capable of performing active, laboratory -based surveillance using defined surveillance populations; conducting applied public health epid emiologic and laboratory activities; and implementing and evaluating pilot prevention and intervention projects. The MD EIP is also capable of rapidly responding to emerging infectious disease threats, as was demonstrated during the 2009 -2010 pandemic inf luenza season. The MD EIP continues its collaboration with CDC, other federal partners, and other EIP sites to assess the public health impact of, and respond to, emerging infections. Specifically, the MD EIP will continue to participate in the Active Ba cterial Core surveillance, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, the Healthcare -Associated Infections - Community Interface projects, the Influenza Surveillance Network, and the Lyme and Other Tickborne Diseases activities. With few exceptio ns, the surveillance area for each of these activities will be the entire State. The MD EIP will continue to enhance its capacity to quickly respond to newly emerging infectious disease issues by continuing to cross -train EIP staff and strengthening relat ionships with other partners (e.g. public health preparedness and response). A variety of training opportunities will also be provided for infection control professionals, laboratory scientists, local health department staff, medical residents, and public health graduate students. 93.323 EPIDEMIOLOGY & LABORATORY CAPACITY FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES (ELC) Program Description: The purpose of this program is to protect the public health and safety of the American people by enhancing the capacity of publi c health agencies to effectively detect, respond, prevent and control known and emerging (or re -emerging) infectious diseases.

Voluntary evidence -based home visiting is the primary strategy to deliver services. A nurse, social worker, parent educator, or other paraprofessional regularly visits an expectant mother or father, new parent, or primary caregiver of a young child from birth to kindergarten entry to support and strengthen the parent -child relationship to improve the health, development and well-being for the child and family. Formula Description: This program has no statutory formula, and no matchin g or maintenance of effort requirements. Statutory Formula - formula funding is determined as follows : i. The number of children under age five in families at or below 100% of the Federal poverty line in each state was obtained by using 2011 U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income Poverty Estimate (SAIPE) data (available at http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/data/statecounty/data/2011.html). ii. The percentage of children under age five in families at or below 100% of the Federal poverty line in the sta te, as compared to the number of such children nationally, was calculated. iii. For each state, the percentage of children under age five in families at or below 100% of the Federal poverty line was multiplied by the total amount of funding available, (exc luding the funding allocated for Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. Because SAIPE data is not available for these jurisdictions, each was allocated a base amount of $1,000,000. iv. This initial distrib ution, based on the percentage of children in poverty, was reviewed and proportionally modified to ensure a floor of the allocation provided in federal FY 2012 (excluding the funding provided for the Supporting Evidence Based Home Visiting Program). This program has MOE requirements, see funding agency for further details (DHHS, Health Resources and Services Administration) . Funds provided to an eligible entity receiving a grant shall supplement, and not supplant, funds from other sources for early childh ood home visitation programs or initiatives (per the Social Security Act, Title V, \u00a7 511(f)). The grantee must agree to maintain non -Federal funding (State General Funds) for grant activities at a level which is not less than expenditures for such activit ies as of the most recently completed fiscal year. For purposes of maintenance of effort/non -supplantation, home visiting is defined as an evidence -based program, implemented in response to findings from a needs assessment, that includes home visiting as a primary service delivery strategy (excluding programs with infrequent or supplemental home visiting), and is offered on a voluntary basis to pregnant women or children birth to age five targeting the participant outcomes in the legislation which include improved maternal and child health, prevention of child injuries, child abuse, or maltreatment, and reduction of emergency department visits, improvement in school readiness and achievement, reduction in crime or domestic violence, improvements in family economic self-sufficiency, and improvements in the coordination and referrals for other community resources and supports. Program Supported / Population Served: The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant project is administered jointly by the MDH Center for Maternal and Child Health and the MDH Office of Genetics and Children with Special Health Care Needs.

Program has maintenance of effort requirements; see funding agency (DHHS, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) for further details. Program Supported / Population Served: This program supports The Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) in collaboration with the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) in optimizing the All Payer Claims Database (APCD) for rate review applications and broader pricing tra nsparency efforts by accelerating data collection and developing standard analytics that will be pre -processed and made readily available for access by MIA actuaries, rate review analysts, and the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange (MHBE) staff. The goal of this program is to design and establish new Data Center capabilities that will enhance rate review processes in Maryland by providing meaningful comparisons to the information submitted by carriers in rate applications. Funding from this grant will be used to develop two discrete activities that, together, will enable Maryland to continue to enhance its rate review processes. First, the grant will fund the establishment of a flexible extract, transform, and load (ETL) platform that will accept, reconci le, and transfer carriers' claims data to the MHCC's APCD warehouse. The ETL process will shorten the current 120 -day cycle time required currently to edit and integrate individual claims data submission into a consistent data base. Second, MHCC will use other grant funds to specify and create metrics that are easily accessible by the MIA, the Exchange, and the public for rate review or for pricing comparison. Metrics used for rate review will be organized in data marts that will be easily and quickly ac cessible to support actuaries' most common analytic inquires and approaches yet provide for additional drilling down in the summarized data. 93.521 THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT: BUILDING EPIDEMIOLOGY, LABORATORY, & HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPACITY IN THE EPIDEMI OLOGY & LABORATORY CAPACITY FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE (ELC) & EMERGING INFECTIONS PROGRAM (EIP) COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS; PPHF (ELC/EIP - Prevention & Public Health Fund & Other Capacity -Building Activities) Program Description: The Prevention and Public Hea lth Fund (Title IV, Section 4002) was established under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) to provide for expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs to improve health and help restrain the rate of gr owth in private and publi c-sector health care costs. The Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases (ELC) and Emerging Infections Program (EIP) cooperative agreements were formed in 1995 as key components of Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention's ( CDC ) national strategy to address and reduce emerging infectious disease (EID) threats. The programs play a critical role in strengthening national infectious disease infrastructure by serving as collaborative platforms for state and loca l health departments, CDC programs, and academic and various other public health partners to improve the ability to detect and respond to EIDs and other public health threats. Specifically, the programs build epidemiology, laboratory, and information syst ems capacity, integrate epidemiology and laboratory practice, implement active surveillance, and conduct targeted research aimed at improving methods and informing national surveillance and response activities. Overall, additional funds from multiple sour ces including PP HF will allow ELC and EIP partner agencies to substantially address gaps in EID epidemiology and laboratory capacity (e.g. number and training level of epi and lab staff, efficient/functional information systems, et cetera ). Formula Descri ption: This program has no statutory formula, and no matching or maintenance of effort requirements. Program Supported / Population Served: Emerging Infections Program cooperative agreement support s State and local health departments' surveillance infra structure through enhancement of the epidemiology and laboratory capacity of the existing EIP network. Over the past 20 years, the EIP network has proved to be a national resource for conducting active, population -based surveillance and special studies fo r invasive bacterial diseases, foodborne pathogens, healthcare associated infections (HAIs), influenza, and many other infectious diseases. The network has been instrumental in measuring the impact of the 7 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, informing and evaluating treatment guidelines for Group B Strep tococcus, estimating the burden of foodborne illness, documenting the emergence of community -associated methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus , and monitoring the safety of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine as part of the influenza safety network. The flexibility of the EIP network is critical so that activities and special studies can adapt to changing priorities for infectious disease emergency response and program areas. These investments in the basic infrastructure support multiple activities at each site and are critical for a comprehensive, efficient, and coordinated approach to general program management from which all activities benefit. EIP sites may conduct up to 65 different surveillance and resear ch activities related to infectious diseases during the course of a year. These activities require investments in personnel time to implement or modify, including building collaborative relationships with local hospitals, laboratories, and healthcare prov iders; submitting applications to multiple institutional review boards for dozens of studies; hiring, supervising and training staff; facilitating information exchange between CDC, local epidemiologists and laboratories; and actively participating in numer ous conference calls, conferences, and meetings with CDC investigators. This cooperative agreement provides funding to enhance support for the basic infrastructure of the EIP network as well as to enhance EIP programmatic activities. Emerging Infections Program - PPHF the purpose of this cooperative agreement is to enhance the epidemiology and laboratory capacity of the existing EIP network. EIP is a national network that conducts enhanced public health surveillance and applied public health research. T he Maryland Emerging Infections Program (MD EIP) is a working partnership among MDH , the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the University of Maryland, College Park. Maryland became a national EIP network member site in 1997, and over the ensuing eighteen years, has developed into a mature partnership capable of performing active, laboratory -based surveillance using defined surveillance populations; conducting applied public health epidemiologic and laboratory activities; and i mplementing and evaluating pilot prevention and intervention projects. The MD EIP is also capable of rapidly responding to emerging infectious disease threats, as was demonstrated during the 2003 -2004 and subsequent influenza seasons. Through this applic ation, the MD EIP is requesting funding to continue to: (1) support collaborative projects with the University of Maryland College Park, School of Public Health, in the areas of foodborne diseases, geospatial analysis, and climate change; (2) provide train ing opportunities for EIP epidemiologists in the areas of database management, the use of statistical analysis software, web site design and use of social media, and geospatial analysis as well as host an annual infectious diseases conference; (3) integrat e electronic data collection methods into existing EIP processes; and (4) expand existing genomic sequencing and bioinformatics capacity to further enhance the characterization of EIP pathogens and integrate these methods into routine case investigations a nd epidemiologic analyses. 93.524 MEDICAID NATIONAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM Program Description: This program allows The Maryland Medicaid Administration's Office of Planning to administers a grant program to demonstrate how state Medicaid agenci es, in collaboration with state health departments, can implement a delivery model for the National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), either alone or as part of a bundled package of chronic disease preventive services, to Medicaid beneficiaries at high ri sk for type 2 diabetes through Managed Care Organizations and/or Accountable Care Organizations (MCOs/ACOs).

Strate gies in Healthiest Maryland include: Nutrition standards in schools, Early Care and Education sites (ECEs), and worksites; Physical activity standards in schools, ECEs and worksites; Reporting of hypertension and diabetes control measures and promotion of team -based care and blood pressure self -monitoring; Hypertension awareness; Pre-diabetes awareness, and Diabetes self -management education utilization. Enhanced component activities build on basic component activities. Selected strategies strengthen envi ronmental approaches to obesity prevention (e.g., Farmers Market access; food procurement guidelines in ECEs, worksites, and communities; nutrition environments in schools; access to places for physical activity; design streets and communities for physical activity; implement physical activity in ECEs and schools; and increase breastfeeding friendly hospitals and worksites). Health systems interventions support quality improvement at the provider and systems level including increased use of team -based care and self -measured blood pressure monitoring. Finally, community -clinical linkages will increase use of diabetes self -management education, therapeutic lifestyle intervention to prevent diabetes, and chronic disease self - management programs; increase use of community health workers and pharmacists as members of the healthcare team; and strengthen school -based healthcare policies. The State and Local Public Health Actions to Prevent Obesity, Diabetes, and Heart Disease and Stroke program implements environ mental strategies to promote health and reinforce healthful behaviors; strategies to build support for lifestyle change, particularly for those at high risk, to support diabetes and heart disease and stroke prevention efforts; health system interventions t o improve the quality of health care delivery to populations with the highest hypertension and pre - diabetes disparities and community -clinical linkage strategies to support heart disease and stroke and diabetes prevention efforts. The Department collabora tes with five local communities (Garrett/Allegany Counties, Washington County, Baltimore City, Caroline/Dorchester Counties, and Wicomico/Somerset/Worcester Counties) to implement the systems and environmental approaches to prevent chronic diseases. These communities were selected using a methodology, which prioritizes chronic disease/risk factor burden, socioeconomic/ access to care characteristics, and reach of the population. This funding provides an unprecedented opportunity to transform public health in local communities in Maryland by building upon the Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control (CCDPC) Healthiest Maryland initiative, which aims to prevent and control the leading causes of death and disability in Maryland, targeting populations experiencing health disparities. Healthiest Maryland is a movement to create a culture of wellness in the communities where Marylanders live, work, and play. Through this initiative, the Department has developed a robust infrastructure through strong pa rtnerships with organizations and agencies committed to preventing obesity, heart disease and stroke, and diabetes. The Department uses the Healthiest Maryland infrastructure and leverages other synergies with complementary programs and grants, such as the State Public Health Actions to Prevent and Control Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity and Associated Risk Factors and Promote School Health (1305) to facilitate collaboration, build statewide networks and engage local partners in the above -mentioned comm unities. This 4 -year grant allows not only the building of chronic disease prevention infrastructure in these high -risk communities, setting a model for sustainable programming throughout the State, establishing community -clinical linkages and driving hig h- risk adults to evidence -based chronic disease programs. The Department provides resources, tools, technical assistance, and evaluation support to aid these communities with reaching long - term outcomes of reducing death/disability due to diabetes, heart disease and stroke by 3% and reducing the prevalence of obesity by 3% in these communities. 93.758 PREVENTIVE HEALTH & HEALTH SERVICES BLOCK GRANT FUNDED SOLELY WITH PREVENTIO N & PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDS (PPHF) Program Description: To provide States with the reso urces to improve the health status of the population of each grantee by: a) conducting activities leading to the accomplishment of the most current Healthy People objectives for the nation; b) rapidly responding to emerging health threats; c) providing eme rgency medical services, excluding most equipment purchases; d) providing services for sex offense victims including prevention activities; and e) coordinating related administration, education, monitoring and evaluation activities. Formula Description: This program has no statutory formula, and no matching or maintenance of effort requirements. Program Supported / Population Served: The Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant (PHHS) addresses public health needs and challenges with innovati ve and community driven methods, including: addressing emerging health issues and gaps, decreasing premature death and disabilities by focusing on the leading preventable risk factors, working to achieve health equity and eliminate health disparities by ad dressing the social determinants of health , supporting local programs to achieve healthy communities, and establishing data and surveillance systems to monitor the health status of targeted populations. PHHS activities align with Healthy People 2020 objec tives and involve: implementing evidence - based methods and interventions; reducing chronic disease risk factors; and establishing policy, systems and environmental changes. Specific areas of focus, in alignment with Healthy People 2020, include: heart dis ease, diabetes, youth obesity, adult physical activity, arthritis, comprehensive epidemiology services, public health improvement, and sexual violence. 93.767 CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM ( CHIP ) Program Description: Provide funds to states to enable them to maintain and expand child health assistance to uninsured, low -income children, and at a state 's option, low -income pregnant women and legal immigrants, primarily by three methods: (1) obtain health insurance coverage to meet requirements in Section 2103 relating to the amount, duration, and scope of benefits; (2) expand eligibility for children under the state's Medicaid program; or (3) a combination of the two. Formula Description: Matching Requirements: For the Cycle III project grants , there ar e no matching requirements. Section 2105(b), Title XXI, provides for an \"enhanced Federal Matching Assistance Percentage (EFMAP)\" for child health assistance provided under Title XXI that is equal to the current FMAP for the federal fiscal year (FFY) in the Medicaid Title XIX program, increased by 30 percent of the difference between 100 and the current FMAP for that fiscal year. For federal fiscal years 2013 and prior, the EFMAP may not exceed 85 percent. As a result of the implementation of the Afford able Care Act (ACA), states shall receive a 23 percentage point increase in their respective EFMAPs for federal fiscal years 2016 -2019 for most CHIP expenditures; however the EFMAP for a state may not exceed 100 percent. In FFY 2009, the CHIPRA implemente d a limitation on matching rates for states that propose to cover children with effective family income that exceeds 300 percent of the poverty line to FMAP rather than EFMAP, unless a waiver or State Plan Amendment or state law was in place to cover this population before the enactment of CHIPRA. Section 2104(a) of the Social Security Act as amended by section 10203 of the ACA provide appropriations through September 30, 2015 for the purpose of providing annual allotments to the states to fund their CHIP programs. Only States with approved State Plans by the end of the fiscal year will be included in the final allotment calculation. In general, in FFY 2010, the states' annual allotments were calculated as the sum of the following four amounts, multiplie d by the applicable growth factor for the year. The FFY 2009 CHIP allotments; FFY 2006 unspent allotments redistributed to and spent by shortfall states in FFY 2009; spending of funds provided to shortfall sates in the first half of FFY 2009; and spendin g of Contingency Fund payments in FFY 2009, although there were no Contingency Fund payments made in FFY 2009. Note: States may also qualify to receive an increase in their FFY 2010, FFY 2012, or FFY 2014 allotments if they meet the criteria described in section 2104(m)(6) and 2107(m)(7) of the Social Security Act (the Act) as previously amended by section 102 of CHIPRA and further amended by sections 2102(a)(1)(B) 10203 of the ACA. For FFY 2011, FFY 2013, and FFY 2015 the allotments will be \"rebased\" on prior year spending. This will be done by multiplying the state's growth factor for the year by the new base, which will be the prior year's federal CHIP spending (including any contingency fund payments or redistribution amounts). For FFY 2012 and FFY 2 014, the allotment for a state will be calculated as the previous fiscal year's allotment amount and any previous fiscal year's contingency fund spending, multiplied by the states growth factor for the year. The ACA extended the availability of the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund which may be available for states that meet the criteria provided in section 2104(n) of the Act through FFY 2015. Program has maintenance of effort requirements, see agency (DHHS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) for further details. Program Supported / Population Served: The Maryland Children's Health Program (MCHP) was implemented in 2001 . It currently serves children up to age 19 in families with incomes between 100 and 300 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL); certain age spans fall within certain FPL levels. For those above 200% FPL, families pay a monthly contribution to participate in the program. 93.777 STATE SURVEY & CERTIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS & SUPPLIERS (TITLE XVIII) MEDICARE Program Description: Provides financial assistance to any state which is able and willing to determine through its state health agency or other appropriate state agency that providers and suppliers of health care services are in compliance with federal re gulatory health and safety standards and conditions of participation. Formula Description: This program has no statutory formula, and no matching or maintenance of effort requirements. Program Supported / Population Served: Under the State Survey and Certification of Health Care Providers and Suppliers, facilities and services are reviewed on a regular basis for compliance with COMAR Regulations, as well as for compliance with federal regulation of those facilities participating in Medicare and Medicai d. 93.778 MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (Medicaid; Title XIX) Program Description: Provides financial assistance to states for payments of medical assistance on behalf of cash assistance recipients, children, pregnant women, and the aged who meet inco me and resource requirements, and other categorically eligible groups. In certain states that elect to provide such coverage, medically needy persons, who, except for income and resources, would be eligible for cash assistance, may be eligible for medical assistance payments under this program. Financial assistance is provided to states to pay for Medicare premiums , co- payments and deductibles of qualified Medicare beneficiaries meeting certain income requirements. More limited financial assistance is av ailable for certain Medicare beneficiaries with higher incomes. Formula Description: Statutory formula. Matching requirements: Federal funds are available to match state expenditures for medical care. Under the Act, t he federal share of medical services may range from 50 to 83%. The statistical factors used for fund allocation are: (1) medical assistance expenditures by state; and (2) per capita income by state based on a 3 -year average (source: \"Personal Income,\" Department of Commerce, Bureau of E conomic Analysis) . Statistical factors for eligibility do not apply to this program. This program has maintenance of effort requirements ; see funding agency (DHHS, C enters for Medicare and Medicaid Services ) for further details . Program Supported / Po pulation Served: The statewide Maryland Medical Assistance Program provides a broad range of medical services to low -income persons and to those with catastrophic illness who are unable to pay for care. There are two primary classifications of needy pers ons: (1) the categorically needy; and (2) the medically needy. The categorically needy classification includes persons who receive Temporary Cash Assistance from the Maryland Department of Human Resources as well as those receiving Supplemental Security I ncome grants from the Social Security Administration. Categorically needy persons are enrolled automatically under the Medical Assistance Program. Several other populations that do not receive public assistance grants are included in the categorically ne edy classification. These include children, pregnant women, elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries with income above the standard Medicaid limit but below certain percentages of the poverty level. The medically needy are those who cannot meet the co st of needed medical care but who are self - supporting in other respects. Medically needy individuals must apply to the local departments of social services for eligibility determination under established criteria for income and assets in relation to need and size of family. 93.789 ALTERNATIVES TO PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES FOR CHILDREN (Demonstration Projects Regarding Home and Community -Based Alternatives to Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities for Children Program Descripti on: Over the last decade, Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (PRTFs) have become the primary provider for youth with serious emotional disturbances requiring an institutional level of care. However, since they are not recognized as hospitals, nursing facilities or intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, many States have been unable to use the 1915(c) waiver authority to provide home and community -based alternatives to care, which would keep the youths in their homes and with thei r families. Sections 6063 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 address this issue by providing up to $218 million to 10 states to develop demonstration programs that provide home and community -based services to youth as alternatives to PRTFs. Formula D escription: This program has no statutory formula, and no matching or maintenance of effort requirements. Program Supported / Population Served: This program provides administrative and programmatic direction for all substance related disorder and menta l health service provider training funded with the Behavioral Health Administration . Functions supervised by this program include planning, design, promotion, implementation and evaluation of agency training efforts. This program collaborates with and pr ovides technical assistance to local health departments, judiciary, attorneys, consumers, treatment providers and public safety and correctional officials to enhance the mandated services. This program includes training on direct services needed to provid e quality mental health and substance related disorder services provider training funded with the Behavioral Health Administration. 93.791 MONEY FOLLOWS THE PERSON REBALANCING DEMONSTRATION (Money Follows the Person Demonstration) Program Descriptio n: For more than a decade, states have been asking for the tools to modernize their Medicaid programs. With the enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, states now have new options to rebalance their long -term support programs to allow their Medic aid programs to be more sustainable while helping individuals achieve independence. The Money Follows the Person (MFP) Rebalancing Demonstration (MFP Demo), created by section 6071 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109 -171), supports state effort s to \"rebalance\" their long -term support systems by offering $1.75 billion over 5 years in competitive grants to states. Specifically, the demonstration will support state efforts to: \"Rebalance their long -term support system so that individuals have a ch oice of where they live and receive services.\" The demonstration provides for enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for 12 months for qualified home and community -based services for each person transitioned from an institution to the commu nity during the demonstration period. Eligibility for transition is dependent upon residence in a qualified institution. The state must continue to provide community -based services after the 12 -month period for as long as the person needs community servi ces and is Medicaid eligible. Maryland received its first award through the MFP demonstration on January 1, 2007 and is eligible for annual supplemental awards. Through Calendar Year 201 5, Maryland has been awarded a cumulative $ 108.2 million in MFP gran t funds. The state will transition older adults, adults with physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, mental illness, and brain injury. Maryland's MFP demonstration will utilize five (5) existing home and community -based services waivers to prov ide long -term supports to participants. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act), Pub. L. No. 111 -148, signed on 3/23/2010, includes on a national scale an extension of the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing (MFP) Demonst ration Program for an additional $2.5 billion over 5 years, through 2016.
