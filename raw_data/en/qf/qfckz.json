The liver works hard to neutralize the toxins that are circulating in your body. The bowel is the main way to get those nasty toxins out of your body. Milk thistle, choline, and inositol are the best nutrients to support the liver during a detox. The herb silymarin or Milk Thistle has been in use for hundreds of years as a remedy for liver problems. Choline and inositol are vitamins that break down fats in the body and also prevent fatty liver disease. They can either be taken as supplements or in the form of soy lecithin, a pleasant tasting powder. Probiotics or 'friendly' bacteria are used to improve conditions in the bowel to help flush toxins from the body. Bifidobacterium and lactobacillus are the best bacterial strains to use in a detox diet. Flushing out the Toxins Magnesium and zinc are the best minerals for flushing toxins from the cells of your body. Magnesium stimulates cell activity so that toxins are released into the blood stream. Zinc is a strong antioxidant that works to destroy 'free radicals' in the body. Zinc also helps in removing heavy metals from the body. Vitamins C and E also help to reduce toxin levels in the liver and body. Vitamin C works as a strong antioxidant and increases levels of glutathione in the liver. Toxins in the liver are neutralized by glutathione. Vitamin E is fat-soluble and fights free radicals found in fat cells. One thing to note when taking Vitamins and minerals is that all work against their opposites, so if you take a lot of one nutrient it reduces the amount of the opposing nutrient. For example, taking lots of zinc reduces your levels of iron and vice versa. Taking a good multivitamin and mineral supplement helps to guard against low levels of a particular nutrient. Designing a Detox for You Each of us has an individual pattern of weaknesses and strengths in our bodies. A detox diet can be tailored to target weak organs and systems, giving support to those areas that need the most help. Please consult a nutritionist or naturopath to discuss your health, symptoms, diet and lifestyle before starting a detox. They can identify your weaknesses and strengths and recommend particular supplements that address your weaker areas. If you are taking prescription medicines, please also check with your doctor before starting a detox or changing your supplements. Read more on [the foods to avoid and the foods to include "}
