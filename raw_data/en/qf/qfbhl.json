This brought back memories of my own match. I studied English and philosophy as an undergraduate with plans to become a playwright. In my senior year at Ham\u00ad ilton College, President Robert Ward McEwen convinced me to consider other options and was instrumental in arrang\u00ad ing an interview at SUNY Upstate Medical University. I was accepted and reluc\u00ad tantly accepted. Arriving to Syracuse in September 1954 with a basic minimum of bioscience classes led to an almost disastrous first year. A forced trip to the Department of Psychiatry was \"advised,\" and that assistance allowed me to continue in medical school, graduating number 35 in a class of 70. When it came time for internship interviews, I had zeroed in on St. Vin\u00ad cent's Hospital in New York City. I was seated on a small stool in the middle of a large conference room with a semicircle of physicians on one end with the center chair elevated. When asked why I picked St. Vincent's, I replied that I planned to be a surgeon and wished to work with Dr. X. The man in the raised seat said, \"Have you met Dr. X? \"No, Sir. I have not,\" I replied. \"May I introduce myself,\" he said in return. When the match list arrived, I re\u00ad ceived a small booklet listing hospitals that did not fill their quota. I noted that Stanford University Hospital in San Fran\u00ad cisco had one opening. They did not fill their quota since the hospital was moving from the city to \"The Farm\" in Palo Alto. I called the Stanford Hospital Chief of Surgery, and after a brief discussion, he said, \"This is highly unusual, but O.K.\" So I loaded up my 1940 Chevrolet and headed across country. After two years at Stanford, a position opened up at Univer\u00ad sity of California Hospital in E.N.T. and the rest is history. A favorite Upstate memory involves Dr. Phillip Armstrong, professor of Anatomy at Upstate, who had the charming habit of taping a penny to the blue book of sup erior test answers. I desperately wanted one of those pennies and on the final written exam I wrote pages and pages. When my blue book was returned I had earned a penny, along with the comment, \"Not for quality but for quantity!\" When I finally write my auto biography, I will call it A Penny for the Doctor. Kedar K. Adour, MD '58 San Francisco, CA I t was great reading \"The Teaching Physical\" by Howard Weinberger, MD '58, in the Spring 2019 issue. It brought back great memories of the Dr. Wein\u00ad berger, who was a great teacher and friend and almost made me a pediatrician, as well as Nurse Reit, who was the surro\u00ad gate mother to all the medical students. I also have fond memories of Dr. Cook, who was also a professor of psychiatry and worked closely with the internal medicine residents in understanding the emotional problems our critical care patients were suffering. In addition, she was our source for \"mental comfort\" during those arduous days. Every issue of the Journal brings back fond memories of my days at Upstate. Phil Altus, MD '71 Tampa, FLAs always, Reunion this year was a real hoot. It was the first time I heard the \"R word\" (retirement!) from fellow class members but we all look young enough and fun enough to remain the relevant, productive, and cutting\u00adedge physicians we trained to be. Thanks to Brian Brun\u00ad dage '89 for arranging the boat cruise. Dinner was excellent at the Century Club. We continue to have the largest turnout of any class, but it is also fun to see the other classes. How about the young class of 2009? Aren't they adorable! And the class of 1969? I was wondering how many of them were at Woodstock. I have no doubt we will rock our 50th reunion when the time comes. Being in the presence of intelligent, funny, and good\u00adhearted people will never get old. The next reunion seems like a long way away, but I have a feeling it will feel like no time has passed when it arrives. Until that time I will try to uphold the mantle of most frequent Alumni Jour- nal contributor with the same dedication and seriousness I paid to note service, but without the Dom cartoons (unless I can find one!). Until then I hope every\u00ad one stays happy, healthy and in touch. Stephen Weinman, MD '89 Highland, New York The Class of 1989 at Reunion 2019 2 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 COURT YARDChin Named Interim College of Medicine Dean NEUROSURGEON LAWRENCE CHIN, MD, has been appointed interim dean of the Upstate College of Medicine. Dr. Chin has served the Upstate community in a variety of roles, most recently as the Robert B. and Molly G. King Endowed Professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery. Chin is the recipient of numer\u00ad ous honors, awards, and visiting pro fessorships and has held a range of lead er ship positions in the American Association of Neuro\u00ad logical Sur geons, the Congress of Neurological Sur geons, and other organizations. He previously served on the faculty of Boston University School of Medicine and the Univer\u00ad sity of Maryland School of Medicine. Upstate Receives $3-million Gift to establish Golisano Center for Special Needs A $3-million gift from Paychex founder and philanthropist Tom Golisano will establish a center for special needs at Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital. The center, which will be named the Golisano Center for Special Needs, will provide comprehen- sive, coordinated and sci- entifically based medical and behavioral care for children and adolescents with many types of intel- lectual and developmental disabilities. The Center will act as an umbrella, creating a framework to increase collaboration resulting in better patient care and will centralize programs and services available to this population. Establishing the Goli- sano Center for Special Needs will significantly increase the number of children with intellectual and developmental disabil- ities Upstate Golisano Chil- dren's Hospital is able to serve, according to Gregory Conners, MD, executive director of the children's hospital and chair of the Department of Pediatrics. \"The center will enable us to increase capacity to 7,600 children per year, which is a 167 percent increase in unique numbers served compared to 2018,\" Conners says. Upstate Golisano Chil- dren's Hospital will con- tinue to provide diag nostic evaluations and treatments currently provided through the Margaret L. Williams Developmental Center. The Golisano Center for Special Needs will allow the chil- dren's hospital to provide an additional 563 evalua- tions per year through this program, which will likely result in more than 200 diagnoses of autism. Lawrence Chin, MD NIH Grant Supports Technology to Help Patients Tolerate Chemotherapy William Kerr, PhD, is the lead investigator on a recently awarded National Institutes of Health grant to study how manipulating a gene could help people better tolerate and recover from chemotherapy. Dr. Kerr, professor of microbiology and immunology, biochemistry and molecular biology, and pediatrics, has spent much of his career studying the SHIP1 enzyme, which can affect how an immune cell detects and kills cancer cells. He is a co-founder of Alterna Therapeutics, a private biotechnology company. Kerr, Alterna Therapeutics, and a Syra- cuse University professor are the recent beneficiaries of the one-year $225,000 NIH grant that will support research conducted at Upstate and at the Central New York Biotech Accelerator. \"This NIH grant at Upstate advances and showcases SUNY's enduring commitment to medical discovery and innovation,\" says SUNY Chancellor Kristina Johnson. \"This research has the potential to impact millions of people whose lives are upended by the devastating effects of chemotherapy. I applaud Dr. Kerr for his leadership on this work.\" Ann Costello, executive director of the Golisano Foundation, announces a $3 million gift from Tom Golisano at the Upstate Foundation's celebration of Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital's 10th birthday. UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 3 COURT YARDUpstate Opens State-of-the-Art Simulation Center Upstate Medical University has opened an $11-million teaching center that simu lates real-time responses to medical emergencies in any setting where health care is delivered, such as the ICU, labor and delivery, or oper- ating room. The goal is to improve patient safety and patient care, as well as build highly-trained multidisciplinary healthcare teams. The Upstate Simulation Center, totaling about 8,600 square feet, will become a hub of teaching and training for students from all areas of the health professions. The center will also be dedicated to improving the competency of health care providers as well as training them in new techniques. \"The Upstate Simulation Center exem- plifies our mission and vision to improve the health of our communities through educa- tion, biomedical research, and health care, and to create a healthier world for all,\" says Interim President Mantosh Dewan, MD. \"This space provides Upstate with the ability to enhance the training of our students and our region's health care professionals by addressing real-life patient-care scenarios through advanced technology, while pro- viding us with the ability to offer immediate feedback on how to best manage patient care scenarios that are faced every day.\" The center, located on the lower level of Weiskotten Hall, features eight high-tech manikins that can be programmed to reflect a seemingly endless range of medical compli- cations. \"These manikins are about as life- like as one can get,\" said Erin Graham, manager of simulation services. \"They allow us to set specific scenarios, while providing for the safest training of learners.\" The physical space includes a general open staging area to greet and host learners, a simulated operating room; six generously sized simulated acute care rooms with headwalls which can be \"flexed\" for additional configura-tions like Intensive Care Units or Outpatient rooms; two 16-person skills and task training rooms that can be de-partitioned to accom- modate up to 32 learners; two debrief rooms which can accommodate a total of 32 learners; a haptics training room; dedicated administra- tive offices and workspaces to support the center; and the required storage area for all equipment and supplies. Additionally, there are four control rooms so that multiple rooms can be used at once or in sequence as well as observational windows. \"Simulation has been used in aviation for many years, and has now been fully embraced in the education of doctors, nurses and many other health care professionals,\" says Lynn Cleary, MD, vice president for academic affairs. \"It is known to improve clinical competence of trainees and has been shown to improve patient care outcomes as well.\" The simulation center will be used by Upstate students in every discipline, faculty, and health professionals from throughout the region.\"Simulation has been used in aviation for many years, and has now been fully embraced in the education of doctors, nurses, and many other health care professionals. It is known to improve clinical competence of trainees and has been shown to improve patient care outcomes as well.\" \u2014Lynn Cleary, MD, vice president for academic affairs 4 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 COURT YARDCardiovascular Group of Syracuse Joins Upstate Faculty The Upstate Depart- ment of Cardiology grew by eight members on September 1 with the addition of the Cardio- vascular Group of Syracuse, a comprehen- sive cardiology practice in Central New York, whose members joined the Upstate faculty from St. Joseph's Hospital and Health Center. \"Welcoming members of the Cardiovascular Group of Syracuse to our faculty enables Upstate to take a major step forward as a multi-faceted heart program that incorporates the best in academic med- icine, including patient care and research,\" said Sri Narsipur, MD, interim chair of the Department of Medicine at Upstate. \"Our work together will provide patients with col- laborative care teams dedicated to providing seamless, exceptional care for our patients.\" The addition of the eight cardiologists to the Upstate medical faculty is a key step in Upstate con- tinuing to build its Heart Institute and increases its number of outpatient car- diology sites to six loca- tions. The Upstate Heart Institute unites the exper- tise and advanced technol- ogies of cardiac surgeons, and cardiovascular and cardiology specialists, set within the resources of the region's only aca- demic medical university. For patients, the addition of the new cardiologists at Upstate will put into place the expanded medical team to create streamlined care, with greater access to other experts and treat- ments as needed. As part of the medical university setting, the addition of the new faculty members will enhance the training programs for medical residency and provide patients with greater access to clinical trials. \"We are very excited about our affiliation with Upstate Medical Univer- sity,\" said Mark Charlamb, MD '91, speaking for the new Upstate cardiologists. \"Joining the faculty pro- vides our cardiologists and our patients access to advancements in care and the availability of experts that only the setting of an academic medical center can provide.\" Upstate's efforts at building a world-class heart program began with its appointment in 2017 of G. Randall Green, MD, JD, MBA, as division chief of cardiac surgery and director of the Upstate Heart Institute. In building the multidisciplinary insti- tute, Green has helped to expand cardiology and cardiac services and has brought new state of the art cardiac inter- vention and surgical modalities to Upstate. Upstate Evaluates Drug to Slow Alzheimer's Disease UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY is participating in a new, national Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical research study evaluating the potential benefits of an investigational medicine for people with mild\u00adto\u00admoderate AD. The Phase 2/3 study, called T2 Protect AD, is evaluating the investigational drug trorilu\u00ad zole (BHV\u00ad4157), which may have the potential to protect against, slow down, and even improve memory and thinking problems that increase as Alzheimer's disease progresses. Troriluzole is a drug that affects the brain chemical glutamate, which is important for healthy brain function. High glutamate levels in the brain can lead to brain cell dysfunction and disease, including Alzheimer's disease. Troriluzole normalizes glutamate levels in the brain. Upstate is one of more than 40 sites in the United States participating in the T2 Protect AD study. The study is sponsored by New Haven\u00adbased Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd., and is coordinated by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), a large clinical research consortium based at the University of California, San Diego. \"This drug, if shown to be effective, will actually slow down the changes in the brain,\" says Sharon Brangman, MD '81, SUNY Distin\u00ad guished Service Professor of Medicine and chair of the Department of Geriatrics. \"Other drugs take care only of the symptoms, so this is a new era in Alzheimer's disease research and we want people in Central New York to have an opportunity to participate in this study.\"Sharon Brangman, MD '81 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 5 COURT YARDFabi Named U.S. National Academy of Medicine Fellow RACHEL FABI, PHD, assistant professor in the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at SUNY Upstate Medical Univer\u00ad sity, has been recognized by the U.S. National Academy of Medicine as one of five fellows in its 2019 class. Fabi was named the Green\u00ad wall Fellow in Bioethics. The fellowship provides scholars with the opportunity to experience and participate in evidence\u00adbased healthcare or public health studies and policy\u00admaking processes that improve the care and access to care of patients in domestic and global health care systems. The Green\u00ad wall Fellows participate actively in the work of the National Academies addressing bioethics issues in clinical care, biomed\u00ad ical research, and public policy. Each fellow will continue in his or her primary academic post while engaging part time over a two\u00adyear period in the National Academies' health and science policy work. In addition to her faculty post, Fabi serves as a member of Upstate University Hospital's ethics consultation service and as a faculty research affiliate of the Lerner Center for Public Health Promotion at Syracuse University. Her research focuses on the ethics of health policies that affect immigrant access to health care and the social deter\u00ad minants of health. Rachel Fabi, PhD Garden Named Assistant Dean for Disability and Inclusion Rebecca Garden, PhD, associate professor of public health and preventive medicine, has been named assistant dean for disability and inclusion. The appoint- ment expands her role as co-chair of the Disability and Inclusion Task Force to align Upstate Medical University with best practices for disability awareness and accessibility. Dr. Garden has a deep history of research, teaching, and advocacy related to disability and deafness in healthcare practice and education, and has published articles on the disparities and dis- crimination that deaf and disabled people face in healthcare, as well as addressing the bias and discrimination that people face due to other identi-ties, such as race and ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, weight, and age. She also organizes and moderates co-curricular Interprofessional-Commu- nity workshops on dis- ability and healthcare involving students and faculty from Upstate Medical University, Syracuse University, and Le Moyne College. Garden's research and teaching are in the field of health humanities, using literature\u2014particu- larly autobiographical nar- ratives\u2014as well as literary and disability studies to address social, cultural, and ethical issues in healthcare and public health. Her most recent research looks at popular and literary narratives of aging and dementia, exploring the social and ethical issues and how dis-ability studies perspec- tives might help to address bias and disparities. Garden serves as executive director of the Consortium for Culture and Medicine (an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional organi- zation for education and research), which brings together students and faculty from different disciplines and professions at Upstate Medical University, Syracuse University, and Le Moyne College.Rebecca Garden, PhD 6 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 Upstate College of Medicine alumni in classes ending in 4 and 9 returned to Syracuse for Reunion Weekend on September 21 and 22.

Burns, MD '64, is a New York City ophthalmologist and the founder and executive director of the Burns Collection and Archive, a historical photography collection of more than one million images, including the largest private collection of early medical photography, and world\u00adclass collections of war, crime, African\u00adAmerican, Judaica, and memorial photography. Using this assemblage of unique images as a resource, Dr. Burns has authored 49 texts, 11 essays, and more than 1,100 articles on related topics. He has curated more than 100 exhibitions and consulted on hundreds of documentaries, television series, and feature films. A native of Brooklyn, Burns attended Brooklyn College, where he excelled in organic chemistry and comparative anatomy. This gave him the confidence that he would be successful in medicine, and he chose to study at SUNY Upstate Medical University. The close\u00adknit and supportive Syracuse medical community encouraged and enabled him to create his unique path in life. Burns regularly photographed his classes and class\u00ad mates, which led him to become photography editor of the 1964 yearbook. His photos of Ernest Becker, Aldous Huxley, Thomas Szasz, and other psychiatric notables would become part of his historic photograph collection. After graduating, Burns completed a general surgical internship at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital in San Francisco, followed by an ophthalmology residency at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital on Staten Island. In 1970, he began his ophthalmology practice as an assistant in two ophthalmology offices. Two years later, he opened his own office. Burns had been an avid collector since his youth. In 1975, after he was shown a daguerreotype of a South American Indian with a tumor of the jaw, he sold off all his unrelated collections and aggressively began purchasing early photographs. In 1978, he held his first exhibition at Adelphi University, \"One Thousand Words...,\" exhibiting more than 1,000 photographs. His collection was lauded by Time/Life's Encyclopedia of Collectables, as one of the top historic photography collections in America. After the exhibition, sponsored by Bristol\u00adMeyers Squibb, he wrote Bristol Gallery of Medical History, a medical historical photography journal from 1981\u00ad1989. He published Early Medical Photography in America in 1983, and in 1987 co\u00adcurated Masterpieces of Medical Photography: Selections from the Burns Archive with artist Joel\u00adPeter Witkin, which won an ICP best photography book award. Burns focused on the cultural phenomena of memorial photography in his 1991 landmark book, Sleeping Beauty: Memorial Photography in America, which was featured on the front page of The New York Times Book Review. Burns has been recognized as one of \"America's Top 100 Collectors\" by Arts and Antiques magazine, one of \"New York's most Passionate Collectors\" by New York Magazine, and named one of the six influencers in photog\u00ad raphy in Aperture's Connoisseurs and Collectors. Burns was the on\u00adset historical, medical and technical advisor on the HBO/Cinemax series \"The Knick\" and PBS's \"Mercy Street,\" and is now a member of the Screen Actors Guild for his role as a surgeon in Martin Scorcese's 2019 film, The Irishman. He holds appointments as research professor of medicine, clinical professor of psychiatry, professor of medical humanities, and adjunct professor of obstetrics/gynecology at New York University Langone Health. When not collecting or seeing patients, Burns spends his time consulting, lecturing, creating exhibits, and writing books on under\u00adappreciated areas of history and photography, and sharing his knowledge and rare and unusual photographs worldwide. Dr. Burns (second from left) receives his award from Interim President Mantosh Dewan, Interim Dean Lawrence Chin, and Dennis Daly, Alumni Foundation president. Stanley B. Burns8 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 OUTSTANDING YOUNG ALUMNUS Scott J. Cameron, MD, '09 Scott J. Cameron, MD '09, a specialist in blood vessel disorders and platelet dysfunction, is associate section head for research in the Department of Cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. His research studies signal transduction pathways in the cardio vas \u00ad cular system as they relate to thrombotic and ischemic diseases, focusing on identifying existing and novel platelet signaling pathways in myocardial ischemia and in peripheral vascular disorders such as advanced peripheral artery disease, chronic venous insufficiency, and aortic aneurysmal disease. An overarching theme of his laboratory is personalized medicine aimed at better defining platelet function in disease states, paying close attention to post\u00adreceptor signal transduction pathways. Dr. Cameron initially trained as a pharmacologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, his home country. He completed postgraduate training in the same discipline at the University of Rochester, then postdoctoral fellowship training in clinical chemistry at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore to gain qualification in chemical pathology as well as intense exposure to biomarker discovery and evalu\u00ad ation, which would later become instrumental in the disease he would dedicate his early career to. He applied for and was offered a faculty position in the Department of Pathology at Stanford University, but at the urging of his wife, applied to medical school instead and enrolled at Upstate Medical University. He completed his internal medicine residency at the New York Presbyterian Hospital\u00adCornell in New York City, followed by a five\u00adyear integrated clinical and research fellowship in cardiology and vascular medicine at the University of Rochester, where he was mentored in platelet biology by Craig Morrell, PhD, a national expert in this discipline. At Rochester, Cameron initiated an innovative vascular assessment referral clinic for local optometrists called Vascular Assessment in Patients for Ocular Reasons. He was also the founding member of the University of Rochester Pulmonary Embolism Response Team. Earlier this year, Cameron moved to the Cleveland Clinic, one of the most active vascular groups in the United States. He currently is principal investigator (PI) on a National Institutes of Health\u00adfunded study on cardiovas\u00ad cular complications that develop after heart attack and co\u00adPI on an American Heart Association study related to the development of new treatments for stroke. He has been PI or co\u00adPI on multiple basic, translational and clinical research studies on heart attack, arterial disease, and aneurysm. Cameron has coauthored more than 50 scientific papers and editorials in peer\u00adreviewed medical journals on platelet disorders and vascular medicine and has been an invited lecturer at numerous international and national medical meetings and conferences. He is a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology and the Society of Vascular Medicine and sits on various counsels of the American Heart Association. Cameron is a peer reviewer for multiple medical journals including the British Medical Journal, the American Journal of Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, Circulation, Circulation Research, and the Journal of Throm- bosis and Thrombolysis. He is also on the editorial board of ATVB, and he is an associate editor of Vascular Medicine.Dr. Cameron receives his award from Interim President Mantosh Dewan, Alumni Foundation President Dennis Daly, and Interim Dean Lawrence Chin. UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 9 Scott J. Cameron10 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 11 HUMANITARIAN AWARD Carl A. Hammerschlag, MD '64 Carl A. Hammerschlag, MD'64, is a leader in the field of psychoneuroimmunology, or mind\u00adbody\u00adspirit medicine, and the belief that how you feel about yourself has a direct correlation to your immune system and healing process. He is founder of the Healing Corps, which conducts clown healing workshops for health \u00ad care professionals, training them how to deeply connect with patients in a short time. A New York City native, Dr. Hammerschlag earned his bachelor's degree from City College of New York, which he followed with medical school at Upstate Medical University. It was the Vietnam era, and after earning his medical degree, he joined the United States Public Health Service, Indian Health Service (IHS) to satisfy his military obligation. Two years later, in 1967, he began his psychiatry residency at Yale University. It was a tumultuous time and provided an extraordinary training ground for someone interested in community psychiatry. In 1970, Hammerschlag returned to the IHS as chief of psychiatry at the Phoenix Indian Hospital, for many years the only psychiatrist for the Indian reservations spread throughout Arizona. He learned to fly a single engine Cessna and traveled weekly to reservations throughout the state, where he taught doctors, nurses, teachers, judges, and probation officers the principles and practice of community mental health. At the same time, he was exposed to traditional healers who gave him valuable insight into Native American culture, where the spirit plays an integral role in wellness and healing. In 1986, Hammerschlag began a private practice and started writing books about what he had learned (The Dancing Healers; The Theft of the Spirit; Healing Ceremonies, and later, children's books). He also began speaking publicly about how people get sick and the many ways they can get well, including practical applications of what we now call the science of psychoneuroimmunology. He co\u00adfounded the Turtle Island Project, which conducts workshops integrating indigenous wisdom with Western science to help doctors and patients to magnify their healing power. In 1991, Hammerschlag met Patch Adams, MD, perhaps the world's most recognized humanitarian clown, and discovered the power of a \"red nose\" to connect with people at a heartfelt level. Over the last 30 years, he's clowned in war zones, disaster areas, refugee camps, hospices, orphanages, mental institutions and prisons. Hammerschlag and his granddaughter traveled to the Peruvian Amazon as humanitarian clowns. There, they began training clowns who were also healthcare professionals to conduct mental health clinics in public settings where clinicians saw patients for 15 to 20 minutes. They did not make diagnoses, prescribe drugs, or focus on the patients' problems, but rather on their strengths and resilience. In these brief encounters, they realized they could establish an intimate connection that had significant impact, on both \"the patient\" and the \"practitioner.\" After five years of conducting clinics in the Amazon, they replicated this model at home in Phoenix, Arizona. The Healing Corps approaches healing through the lens of the clown, training practitioners how to use clown techniques\u2014such as humor, compassion, eye contact, spontaneity and play\u2014to create intimate healing relationships.

Hammerschlag 12 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019Sarcoma is a rare and aggressive cancer that can occur in soft tissue and bone, affecting both children and adults. Sarcomas are classified into several groups, with more than 50 different subtypes. Historically, treatment options have been limited to surgery, with or without radiation, followed by chemo\u00ad therapy. There are only a few drugs currently available for patients with sarcoma; the overall survival for metastatic disease is 11 to 20 months. But the advent of DNA sequencing technologies is opening new frontiers, allowing doctors and scientists to study genetic alterations causing these tumors and develop targeted therapies tailored specifically to their cancer. \"We are now able to do extraordinarily sophis\u00ad ticated analysis at a genetic and molecular level of a patient's tumor sample or blood specimen to find out what is driving that tumor. This is something that I thought of as science fiction as a medical student and now its reality,\" says Mrinal Gounder, MD '04, a medical oncologist specializing in sarcoma and other rare cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Personalized medicine\u2014the use of an indiv\u00ad idual's genetic profile to help guide medical decisions\u2014 has shown great promise in identifying effective treatments for patients with certain types of cancer. In 2000, a type of sarcoma called Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) was the first solid tumor to have targeted therapy based on mutations on a gene for KIT when the drug imatinib, which was also being developed in leukemias, was noted to also inhibit KIT , a driver gene in GIST . Imatinib in GIST became the proof of concept for personalized medicine in solid tumors, and thus, heralded a revolution in oncology. Working with a team of sarcoma experts in medicine, surgery, radiation, pathology, and cancer biology at Memorial Sloan Kettering, Dr. Gounder is attempting to unravel the complexity of each type of sarcoma and develop new drugs in order to move away from the \"one size fits all\" paradigm. \"There are many exciting new gene\u00adtargeting drugs out there-existing drugs that have shown good results for people with other rare cancers, as well as promising new drugs now in clinical trials that might be very beneficial for some sarcoma patients,\" he says. Gounder is an attending physician in Memorial Sloan Kettering's Phase I Clinical Trials program and lead investigator on several clinical trials in his division. His own research focuses on discovering and developing new compounds that are more effective in treating solid tumors while being less toxic for the patient, as well as leading the movement to expand the knowledge base on sarcoma. Science Fiction Comes to Life BY REN\u00c9E GEARHART LEVY UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 13 Using a sophisticated DNA sequencer, Gounder is investigating the genetic mutations driving different types of sarcoma. At the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Conference, Gounder and colleagues presented results from a study investigating the impact of next\u00adgeneration sequencing in discovering diagnostic criteria and therapeutic treatments for both soft\u00adtissue sarcoma and bone sarcoma. Their work identified more than 60,000 mutations, including germline mutations of known and novel genes, results suggesting that next\u00adgeneration sequencing may play a pivotal role in diagnosis and treatment selection. Foremost, the data can be used to match patients to clinical trials that treat cancer based on a specific genetic mutation, regardless of where in the body the cancer originated. Finding the genomic cause of the tumor may give a patient a new frontier to battle cancer when standard therapies are unsuccessful or toxic. \"There are many different mutations and gene signatures associated with sarcoma, and we suspect they play a very important role in understanding a patient's disease,\" says Gounder. \"We are now left with the task of validating these findings in prospective studies. This is the essence of precision medicine.\"The son of an endocrinologist and a scientist, Gounder got hooked on translational research as an undergraduate biochemistry major at SUNY Binghamton. He was a research assistant in an insect lab doing molecular biology and spent two years at Harvard Medical School conducting research on gene therapy of brain tumors. \"I observed physicians who were seeing patients in the morning and then spending the afternoon in the lab on research, trying to move the needle forward,\" he recalls. \"That back and forth was exciting.\" He says he approached his medical studies at Upstate Medical University with an open mind. \"Every time I was in rotation, I was seduced by that field and how individual attendings talked with passion about what they did. I remember spending a summer working with Dr. Mantosh Dewan on schizophrenia, and I was convinced that I was heading into the field of psychiatry\" he says. Ultimately, he felt there was no area with greater potential for impact than oncology. The Human Genome Project was underway. \"There was an explosion of understanding and drug development,\" says Gounder, who says he was influenced by David Duggan, MD '79, Bernard Poiesz, MD, and John Wright, MD. \"By the time I was writing my essay to apply for internal Comes to LifeMedical oncologist Mrinal Gounder, MD '04, targets rare cancers through sequencing and new drug development PROVIDED BY MRINAL GOUNDER, MD '0414 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 medicine residency, it was crystal clear I was heading for oncology,\" he says. During his intern year at Northwestern University, Gounder treated a patient who had large sarcoma in his pelvis resulting in an ampu ta tion. \"He was a young man in his 20s with a young family. He'd lost his leg and the pain management was very difficult. He'd had several rounds of chemotherapy and there was nothing left; basically, he transitioned to hospice,\" Gounder says. \"That kind of haunted me.\" He'd intended to focus on pancreatic cancer during his residency at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, but after making a connection with two attendings that were sarcoma specialists, his direction was sealed. When he joined the faculty of Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2009, Gounder says sarcoma treat\u00ad ment was still \"the wild, wild west.\" \"The standard treatment was surgery\u2014remov ing the tumor if you could, or amputation, possibly radiation, and then chemotherapy,\" he says. The revolution has occurred only in the last seven or eight years, fueled by advances in genetic sequencing that began almost 2 decades ago. \"What was primarily being done in the lab has moved into the clinic. We now routinely offer a patient the option to do tumor genetic sequencing of approximately 500 or more genes in the clinic. Clinic is now the new lab,\" says Gounder, who, given his background in molecular biology and genetics, got involved early on. Sarcomas comprise only one percent of adult cancer diagnoses, making them one of the rarest forms of cancer. Even among this small group, there is broad tumor heterogeneity, making even the diagnosis of sarcoma quite challenging. DNA sequencing has changed that as well. \"We've moved away from using what you see under the microscope to making a diagnosis at a molecular level,\" says Gounder. \"We've gone from one in 10 patients getting the wrong diagnosis to patients getting the most precise diagnosis, which in itself is a huge leap forward.\" One of the challenges of working with rare diseases is the low number of patients to draw comparable information from. Gounder is cur rently working on a paper for Nature Medicine compiling information learned from 8,000 sarcoma patients worldwide who have had genetic sequencing for sarcoma. \"There is truly going to be a paradigm shift in thinking about how to treat a sarcoma patient,\" he says. But sarcoma isn't his sole purview. Gounder is part of Memorial Sloan Kettering's Early Drug Development Center, where he sees cancer patients who have failed standard care and need to move on to an experimental therapy. \"We take very promising new drugs developed in the laboratory and evaluate their safety and efficacy in cancer patients,\" he says. Gounder focuses his efforts on rare cancers, which he views as a huge unmet need. \"Many of them are generally very neglected, are poorly studied from a biological perspective, and are not considered profitable in terms of drug develop ment by pharmaceutical companies because of the low number of patients,\" he says. Despite the challenges, Gounder has seen his efforts pay off. To study desmoid tumors\u2014a locally aggressive sarcoma\u2014Gounder aligned with patient advocacy groups internationally and was able to complete the first Phase 3 randomized, global study, something other experts had said would be impossible. There is no standard of care for desmoid tumors, which can be locally aggressive and painful. In a phase 3 clinical trial, Gounder found that a drug called sorafenib stopped progression of desmoid tumors for two years in 80 percent of patients who completed treatment, a significant increase in progression\u00adfree survival compared with the placebo. The results were published last \"It's bench to bedside and bedside to bench. More and more, the human body has become the lab. Historically, things would happen in the lab and then many years later move to the patient, but now, it happens much faster. We've found that the best thing you can study is that one patient sitting in front of you.\" \u2014MRINAL GOUNDER, MD '04 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 15 year in the New England Journal of Medicine and Gounder hopes will lead to drug approval by the FDA. The study was named as one of the top Advances of the Year for 2018 by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Gounder says there's no division between the various aspects of his work. \"Everything is sort of tied to everything else,\" he says. He sees patients two days a week\u2014one day, patients with non\u00adsarcoma rare cancers, where his focus is on early drug development; the other, sarcoma patients, who receive the gamut of care, depending on the stage of treatment they are in. Many of these patients undergo surgery and chemotherapy. Others need experimental treatment and will undergo genetic sequencing. Sometimes, he will replicate a patient's tumor in mice to test the efficacy of various drugs. \"If something works, we bring it back to the patient,\" he says. Gounder's remaining time is focused on research efforts: writing and managing protocols, talking with pharmaceutical companies, managing his research staff, and collaborating with other lab directors. \"It's bench to bedside and bedside to bench,\" he says. \"More and more, the human body has become the lab. Historically, things would happen in the lab and then many years later move to the patient, but now, it happens much faster. We've found that we can leapfrog our knowledge by just carefully studying that one patient sitting in front of you, something I remember Sara Greithlein, MD, telling me at Upstate.\" Gounder says his primary goal in pursuing oncology was to help cancer patients through the development of new drugs. \"That's what drives me,\" he says, \"to find a cure.\" But it takes a village, from the clinical researchers, to the laboratory scientists, to the patient advocacy groups, the pharmaceutical companies, and most importantly, the patients who agree to participate in clinical trials. Over 10 years, he's led or been part of teams on several drugs that have received FDA approval and gone to market and believes he will see half a dozen more entering the market soon\u2014seeds planted a decade ago that are just now beginning to mature. \"We all want to make a difference,\" says Gounder, \"to improve on the status IMAGESCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2011 MICHAEL BONERT ( HTTPS://COMMONS.WIKIMEDIA.ORG/WIKI/USER:NEPHRON16 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 CODY O'LOUGHLIN Adam Philip Stern, MD '10 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 17 BY JONATHAN SALTZMAN Adam Philip Stern, MD '10, knows the drill. A psych iatrist is supposed to listen, to empa \u00ad thize, to focus on his patients' problems. Revealing his personal life isn't part of the arrange ment. After his son was born, Dr. Stern even hesitated to put a picture of him on his desk. Then the psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center was diagnosed with an incurable form of kidney cancer. He was only 33. Stern might not live to see his son grow up. He struggled to maintain his focus and empathize with patients' less urgent concerns. \"I listened intently, but I felt nothing,\" Stern wrote of his session with a grieving patient, in an extraordinarily candid article in the New England Journal of Medicine, titled \"Doctoring While Sick\u2014 Is Living with Cancer Making Me a Better or Worse Doctor?\" Patients lose jobs or have marital stress, Stern went on, \"but my mental reaction to each one is some variation of the same thought: But you still have your health.\" Therapists have long debated how much to share of their personal lives with patients. Sigmund Freud, who developed psychoanalysis over a century ago, said the analyst should remain an anonymous blank slate upon which patients could project their unconscious fears and desires. But in the nearly two years since he got the devastating diagnosis, Stern has written prolifically and movingly about his ordeal. His boundary\u00adpushing themes have included his fear of dying before his two\u00adyear\u00adold is old enough to remember him, his decision to see a psychotherapist, and his deepening understanding of his patients' rumina\u00ad tions. If patients see his articles and ask about his health, he discusses it with them and explores their reactions. Stern, an assistant professor of psy chiatry at Harvard University, said he finds writing therapeutic and hopes that readers, including perhaps his own patients, will too. \"While psychiatrists and therapists know that they should leave their stuff at the door, most often patients want to know more about their treaters,\" Stern, now 35, said in an interview. \"They want to know more about what their personal lives are like and actually what makes them tick. And so this is actually a win dow for people to get to know me a little bit.\" Since he was diagnosed in January 2018 with stage 3 kidney cancer\u2014a diagnosis revised to stage 4 a year later after doctors found the cancer had spread to his right lung\u2014he has shared his innermost thoughts in a dozen media outlets, including the New York Times, the Boston Globe, STAT , The Forward, WBUR's website, and several medical publications. He's also working on a memoir. Some mental health experts say it can be risky for a psychiatrist to share such musings so publicly. Theodore Fallon Jr., MD, a psycho\u00ad analyst and physician who teaches at the Drexel University College of Medicine, said some patients might read Stern's writings and conclude \"You're so self\u00adabsorbed with your pain that you can't pay attention to me.\" Other patients might try to comfort Stern, Fallon said, undermining the very foundation of the therapeutic relationship. But, Fallon said, a skilled psych iatrist can balance those drawbacks against the benefits of self\u00addisclosure, which in his view include demonstrating that the practitioner is a human being with problems not unlike those of patients. Fallon himself dabbles in fiction and poetry that draw on his experiences, teaches creative writing to medical students, and says people yearn to see that \"we're not alone in the world.\" Stern, a soft\u00adspoken native of Roslyn, N.Y ., comes from a family of physicians\u2014 his father and brother are cardiologists\u2014 but has always liked to write. A graduate of Brown University, he wrote for The Healing Muse, a literary journal published by the Center for Bioethics & Humanities at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse while attending medical school there. He became a psychiatrist, he said, partly because no medical specialty relies more on what patients tell their doctors. But as he got busier in his practice, he cut back on writing to focus on his psychiatric work. Stern oversees the psychiatric program at Beth Israel's Berenson\u00adAllen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The center uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to relieve symptoms of drug\u00ad resistant depression. He also has a private practice at the hospital treating patients in traditional 45\u00adminute sessions.Battling Cancer, a Psychiatrist Gets Personal with His Patients18 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019Stern discovered that he had cancer only 13 months after his son was born. He had lost 25 pounds but largely attributed it to increased activity, including running after his toddler. But after experiencing night sweats and seeing blood in his urine, he visited his primary care doctor. The doctor ordered blood tests and an imaging test of his urinary tract. Anyone who has ever worried while awaiting the results of medical tests will identify with Stern's mounting panic as he struggled to get his results\u2014an ordeal he vividly recounted in articles on the websites of the Kidney Cancer Research Alliance and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. He described repeatedly hitting the refresh icon on the patient portal when trying to get his blood test results. Then, when he began seeing inflammatory markers that were \"elevated off the freaking charts,\" as he wrote, he began searching Google to figure out what they meant \u2014something doctors invariably tell patients not to do. The following day, he obtained a computerized image of the urinary tract scan but struggled to get his primary care physician on the phone to interpret it. \"My right kidney looked com pletely normal to me, while the object that used to be my left kidney was a repulsive, hideous, exploding mass of entropy\u00ad seeking sickness and death,\" he wrote. \"I texted my brother a screenshot. 'I'm officially freaking.' \" Finally, Stern's doctor called. Stern had a 10\u00adcentimeter tumor on his left kidney. Within a week, he had surgery to remove the kidney. Pathology results determined that he had an aggressive form of kidney cancer that usually afflicts people 50 and older. An imaging scan also revealed spots on his lungs but doctors thought those might be nothing. He began an experimental immunotherapy regimen. This past January, a year after his cancer diagnosis, he had a second operation to remove part of his right lung. The spots turned out to be cancer that had spread from his kidney. Soon after Stern's original diagnosis, he began writing prolifically. He said he wanted to make sense of his illness, but also hoped to destigmatize discussions of cancer. In his first piece, he wrote that he read online that he had only slightly better than a 50 percent chance of living five more years. Those odds, he wrote, were similar to the chances that one of his patients with chronic depression will find relief from the magnetic stimulation that his center provides. \"Like roughly half of my patients, I may find out the hard way that I'm on the wrong side of this 50\u00ad50 split,\" he wrote. In another piece, he conceded that he had struggled to understand some patients' irrational obsessions until he found himself avoiding ordinary objects\u2014 plastic foam coffee cups is one, he said\u2014 because he couldn't rule out that it might have triggered his cancer. Stern's article in The New England Journal of Medicine last September was particularly revealing. He had never had difficulty empathizing with patients who had lost loved ones, he wrote, but he struggled to connect with a patient weeping over a recent death: \"I could offer condolences, but my words weren't grounded in emotion.\" Troubled by his own reaction, Stern asked the grieving patient in a follow\u00adup session whether he felt comfortable with him writing about the episode. The man signed a release giving permission, although the article contained no identi\u00ad fying details. Despite his illness, Stern con tinues to work, although he has cut back on the number of patients he sees in his private practice. He looked healthy during a recent interview and is lobbying with other kidney cancer patients to increase funding for research into new potential treatments. In 1912, Freud wrote that the analyst \"should be opaque to his patients and, like a mirror, should show them nothing but what is shown to him.\" But as psycho\u00ad analysis has declined in popularity, and cognitive behavioral therapy and medication have become far more popular, more therapists have publicly shared details of their lives. Among the best\u00adknown is Kay Redfield Jamison, a clinical psychologist who has written books about her struggle with bipolar disorder. Before he began writing articles, Stern said, he consulted colleagues and mentors at Beth Israel, including Pamela Peck, a psychologist and clinical director of psychiatry. The guiding principle, Peck said, was to make sure that Stern considered his patients' potential reactions to whatever he wrote and made their welfare his top priority. \"I would imagine that most patients would feel reassured that the doctor taking care of them has real and authentic feelings,\" she said. \"Anyone who reads it is moved by the humanity of it.\" Stern says he's grateful that the hospital has supported his writing and that he has gotten good feedback from readers, including patients. \"For me, writing about challenging, emotionally difficult situations has always been therapeutic,\" he said. \"I'm not someone that speaks very easily about what's going on in my inner world, but I can write about it.\" n Reprinted with permission from the Boston Globe. \u00a92019 A CT image of Stern's diseased kidney UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 19 Do Something! The Importance of Patient-Advocacy in Healthcare BY ADAM PHILIP STERN, MD '10 Shortly after his first surgery for kidney cancer, Bryan Lewis was told to get his affairs in order. There was too much scattered tumor left behind and few effective treatments available in 2007. He didn't die, though. A talented surgeon named Gennady Bratslavsky, MD, at the National Institutes of Health (now head of urology at SUNY Upstate Medical University) offered a longshot 12\u00adhour marathon operation that, against all odds, led him to a state of being disease free 12 years later. Lewis, an attorney and father of young twins at that time, felt the natural desire to leave his cancer behind. \"I wanted to say I had cancer. It's done. I'm done with it. I'm moving on,\" he says. Over time, though, the decision didn't feel quite right. \"I went on a trip and one of my friends said, 'You know, Bryan, you're not supposed to be here. You've got to give back.' That was the first inkling of the idea that I had to do something,\" Lewis says. He was introduced to a man named Chris Battle who was diagnosed with the same disease, but was still fighting for his life. Lewis saw himself in Battle, and the parallels were too glaring to ignore, particularly after seeing Battle eventually lose his life to the disease. Before he died, Battle had written a blog about his experience that gained a large following. Harnessing the voices of the many patients and doctors who were engaged with the blog, Battle's wife Dena has gone on to raise money and help connect kidney cancer patients with one another through a non\u00adprofit organization called KC Cure. Inspired by that, Lewis began asking himself and others what he could do. \"It became sort of obvious. I lived 10 blocks off the Capitol so I started going over to the House and the Senate and just trying to make appointments with people,\" he says. \"I started just knocking on doors.\" Lewis says he spent his first several months just learning Capitol Hill etiquette. Over time, he was able to link the kidney cancer community with advocacy groups and with D.C. policy makers, such as Rep. Nita Lowey. She was particularly receptive to the problem of underfunding for kidney cancer research and became the community's champion on the Hill. With support from advocacy groups and other politicians, they were able to add a line item for kidney cancer within a Department of Defense program called the Congres\u00ad sionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP). In the years since, dedicated funding for kidney cancer research has increased from $0 to $10 million in fiscal year 2017 and to $20 million in 2018. Finally, dedicated physician\u00adscientists in the field are beginning to have the support they need to achieve breakthroughs. Even having gone through medical school, I never truly understood what it meant that there were popular and unpopular cancers. I couldn't feel the impact of that until I was diagnosed with kidney cancer and noticed the impact of being inadequately funded. As an academic physician, I know first\u00adhand that funding opportunities are the lifeblood of scientific progress. My own scholarly path, looking at neuroplasticity as a biomarker for depression, stemmed in part from foundational support from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. Financial incentives steer the careers of talented individuals toward particular areas of investigation, which leads to progress and new research questions, which draws more interest and additional funding. It can be a cycle where the rich get richer, while the poor hope for break\u00ad throughs by proxy. In kidney cancer, for example, many cutting\u00adedge immunotherapies are first discovered in melanoma, and then tested in kidney cancer patients after the fact. Since diagnosis, I've also discovered that, thankfully, there is an entire community of patients and caregivers dedicated to making whatever difference they can. In addition to Lewis and Battle, I became acquainted with Ralph and Brenda Knapp through an online patient community. Ralph has been living with advanced kidney cancer for five years and has been close to death several times. Only with the compas\u00ad sionate care of Hans Hammers, MD, Gennady Bratslavsky, MD 20 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019his physician at UT Southwestern, has Knapp managed to survive. Like Lewis and Battle, the Knapps felt the call to do everything in their power to help move the needle. \"I'm not wasting my cancer,\" Ralph has said. \"If you wait for the lights to be green to go to town you'll never make it.\" The Knapps had the ability and the will to raise money and asked Hammers what study he needed to do to move the field forward that wouldn't otherwise be funded. Hammers wanted to test the hypo\u00ad thesis that targeted radiation prior to immunotherapy could enhance the efficacy of the treatment. And thus, the RADV AX trial was born. If the results show a promising signal, it could provide game\u00adchanging data that wouldn't have been accumulated without patient\u00adadvocacy. What strikes me about these individuals and many others I have met in the community is the personal will to \"do something.\" The disease eliminates so much of our sense of agency that we thirst for the ability to make any kind of difference, and we are beginning to realize that we may be stronger together. This year, Lewis and the Knapps formally merged their organi\u00ad zations to create Kidney CAN. They brought in a tireless advocate in Susan Poteat, whose husband Gary is also living with the disease. And last month, they all partnered with Toni Choueiri, MD, my own doctor at Dana Farber Cancer Institute. With the participation of field leaders, the group held the first ever Kidney Cancer Research Summit. The meeting was sponsored by the Knapps, organizations such as the American Urological Association, and in part, by pharmaceutical firms in the industry, and was co\u00adchaired by the two physician thought\u00adleaders, Drs. Choueiri and Hammers. The mission was to present and discuss the cutting\u00adedge translational research being fueled by the CDMRP\u2014the very same fund that Lewis had been so instrumental in cultivating. The meeting attracted 140 scientists from academia and industry as well as a select group of patient\u00adadvocates. \"I'm not wasting my cancer. If you wait for the lights to be green to go to town you'll never make it.\" Attendees of the inaugural Kidney Cancer Research Summit held in Washington, DC, in September UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 21 \"When I saw all of those different disciplines represented in one room and talking to one another ... I knew we had something special,\" Lewis said. Choueiri said the conference was \"one of the major excitements I had in my career,\" and \"hopefully the start of something bigger to cure kidney cancer,\" which takes some 15,000 American lives each year. To me, attending the symposium gave me hope. It reminded me of the great heights that driven individuals can reach and made me appreciate the many talented and dedicated people working on the problem that threatens my own life. I'm confident that, while excep\u00ad tional, the kidney cancer commu\u00ad nity's individual\u00admeets\u00adsystem form of advocacy among patients, doctors, government, and industry isn't uncommon across the vast landscape of medical survivorship. I'm only now able to see the extraor\u00ad dinary effort happening because I'm personally impacted by it. And by writing about the work that patient\u00adadvocates of all stripes are doing\u2014quietly but with persistent determination\u2014I hope that I am doing my own part in this group effort that calls for all hands on deck. nDrs.

Major, MD Paul E. Norcross Donald Palmadessa, MD Amy K. Reichert George Rosenthal, MD Elaine Rubenstein Susan B. Stearns, PhD Medical Student Joseph Morra Remembered with \"Renaissance Man\" Memorial Scholarship Thank you to the many donors who gave to Upstate Medical University in memory of Joseph A. Morra, a member of the Class of 2019 who died March 19, two months before his medical school graduation. His classmates established a scholarship in his honor, which as of the end of October, had raised $43,302.86 from 330 donors (medical students, parents, alumni, and others). Because many of the donations were made through Gofundme.com, we are unable to list individual donors by name. However, your generosity in Morra's memory is no less appreciated. Morra planned a career in psychiatry and was described by classmates as a deep thinker and a lover of history, mythology, psychotherapy, and neuro- science. In addition to his intellectual pursuits, he was a tennis player, runner, skateboarder, and snowboarder who earned his black belt in karate, as well as an artist and musician who could make beauty in everything he touched. During his time at Upstate, Morra was a member of Peds Pals, a service group focused on mentoring and tutoring pediatric patients at the Upstate Cancer Center. He also undertook a year-long pilot wellness initiative to bring peer mentoring to third-year medical students. During his fourth year, he was inducted into the Gold Humanism Honor Society, a peer-elected honor given to students who embody humanism in medicine and go above and beyond to serve their patients and fellow students. 38 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 20192018-2019 Report of Gifts ALL GIFTS RECEIVED FROM OCTOBER 1, 2018 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 | *DECEASED Honor, Memorial Gifts Memorial Gifts In Memory of George Batki Steven L.

As a third\u00adyear medical student in her clinical rotations, Natalie Antosh '20 encountered a com mon theme in caring for primary care patients. Many of them suffered from chronic diseases that can be improved or reversed through behavior modification. But other than telling them to \"lose weight,\" she didn't have the formal education to counsel patients. \"We learn that lifestyle, including diet modification, is a first\u00adline treatment for diabetes, obesity, and hypertension,\" she says. \"But what is diet modification? What do you tell a patient in order for them to change their behavior and actually succeed at it?\" Antosh had assumed she'd learn that information in medical school. But across the country, fewer than 20 percent of medical schools have a required course in nutrition. On the other end of the spec\u00ad trum, new programs are cropping up in culinary medicine, a growing evidence\u00ad based field that blends the art of food and cooking with the science of medi\u00ad cine. Antosh made that discovery while researching family medicine residency programs and an idea started to take hold to bring something similar to Upstate. Although the third\u00adyear of medi\u00ad cal school entails long clinical hours and studying for numerous shelf exams, Antosh was not deterred. She surveyed her fellow Upstate medical students on Facebook about their interest in nutri\u00ad tion and received a tremendous response from across all class years. She met with the curriculum office and found faculty advisors in Barbara Feuerstein, MD '84, an endocrinologist and integrative medi\u00ad cine doctor, Elizabeth Nelsen, MD '06, a pediatrician with a nutrition degree, and Susan Levinsohn, MD, who practices family and integrative medicine. Through endless, tireless emails and phone calls, Antosh interviewed the director of the culinary medicine program at Tulane University School of Medicine, and connected with Kay Stearns Bruening, director of the Nutrition Assessment, Consultation, and Education Center at Syracuse University's Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics, which has a teach\u00ad ing kitchen. She secured $900 in funding from Upstate's Wholistic Education Fund, administered by Kaushal Nanavati, MD, to fund a teaching kitchen component to the course, and with her advisors, recruited faculty experts to participate as lecturers, then had them recorded and posted to Blackboard. Thanks to Antosh's efforts, the College of Medicine's Food as Medicine elective was offered for the first time this fall. The course combines online lectures with hands\u00adon learning activities, and an experiential component shadowing a dietitian, or volunteering at the Upstate Community Garden, Food Bank, Brady Faith Center Farm, or the Samaritan Center Soup Kitchen. When course reg\u00ad istration opened, the 20 spots were filled within 24 hours. Dr. Feuerstein, who serves as course director, was delighted by the level of student interest. \"Medical students are pulled in so many directions. The fact that they chose to add this elective to their busy schedules really shows me how much they value learning about nutri\u00ad tion,\" she says. Antosh was not entirely surprised, as she thinks many of her fellow students have an inherent interest in health and STUDENT ROUNDS Neesha Desai '22 and Shiyu Chen '22 with Food as Medicine course director Barbara Feuerstein, MD '84 SUSAN KAHN PHOTOGRAPHY UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 43 wellness. \"Nutrition is an important component to good health and medical students want to feel more comfort\u00ad able talking with our patients about diet modification,\" she says. \"My hope is that this course will provide students with the knowledge and skills to talk with their patients about nutrition as a means to improve their health as well as to make healthy choices for themselves.\" It's midway through the course and the 20 medical students enrolled have gathered at Syracuse University's Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics. This afternoon, the students are par\u00ad ticipating in a \"teaching kitchen,\" led by SU Professor Bruening, and Joseph F. Wetterhahn, MD '87, a primary care doc\u00ad tor in Adams, New York. \"Patients know they need to eat better, but often don't know how,\" says Dr. Wetterhahn. \"Focusing on cooking gives patients more control over the food they take in, how it is prepared, and how much of their budget it will take.\" He knows what he's talking about. As part of his practice, Wetterhahn and his wife Regina, a physician assis\u00ad tant, teach cooking and nutrition classes aimed at improving patient health through diet at the Samaritan Family Health Center in Adams, one of the only medical practices in Central and Northern New York to offer an on\u00adsite teaching kitchen for patients. Wetterhahn received CME training through Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives, a unique collaboration between the Harvard T .H. Chan School of Public Health and the Culinary Institute of America. The program provides training for healthcare professionals on nutri\u00ad tional science and cooking methods, teaching them about food selection, and preparation techniques for creating healthy meals. Two months earlier, Wetterhahn presented the opening lecture for the Food as Medicine elective, an over\u00ad view of what he learned through the Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives course. Today, with the assistance of Chef Bill Collins, he is demonstrating a menu of 10 dishes that include vegetables, nuts, berries, root vegetables, three whole grains, fruits, chicken, legumes, and two desserts with fiber and/or antioxi\u00ad dants. Students are organized into five groups of four, and each group will pre\u00ad pare two of the recipes. \"Americans are growing increas\u00ad ingly conscious of their health, but many people do not know what healthy food looks like or how to prepare it,\" says Feuerstein. One of those is second\u00adyear medical student K yle Plante. \"I'll be the first to admit that I do not know my way around a kitchen,\" says Plante, who plans to shadow a dietician for the course. \"Preparing meals can be daunting to those who aren't very experienced and I'm hoping I can use this opportunity to learn how to prepare healthy foods so that I can pass my own experiences on to my patients.\" This \"cooking class\" is just one tool to help students help their patients. Other sessions included instruction on taking a nutrition history, led by Dr. Nelsen, and another on motivational interviewing led by psychiatrist Zsuzsa Meszaros, MD. For their final proj\u00ad ect, students are tasked with making a healthy dish to feed 10 people small portions with fewer than 10 ingredients for under $10. The students will come together for a potluck meal, where Upstate dietician Terry Podolak will lead a mindful eating exercise. Antosh hopes the course\u2014or some type of nutrition course\u2014will become a required part of the Upstate curricu\u00ad lum. In the meantime, those involved are working to ensure the efficacy of the elective. Second\u00adyear student Brandon Zaffuto is working with Nelsen on a course evaluation. Zaffuto designed a survey, which he administered to course participants at the start to assess their background in nutrition, and will sur\u00ad vey them again at the end to determine how much knowledge they gained from the course as a tool for future improve\u00ad ments. \"Since the elective is a novel idea and medical nutrition is a hot topic, we will ideally publish the results and hope\u00ad fully inspire other schools to create simi\u00ad lar courses,\" he says. Feuerstein says she's wanted to be involved in this kind of education her entire career, but it took Antosh's efforts to make it happen. \"She's a superstar,\" says Feuerstein. n\"We learn that lifestyle, including diet modification, is a first-line treatment for diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. But what is diet modification? What do you tell a patient in order for them to change their behavior and actually succeed at it?\" \u2014 Natalie Antosh '2044 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 CLASS NOTES1950 September 1112, 2020 1954 William H.

Pyatt, Jr.'75 ROBERT BARD, MD '68 Using Imaging to Prevent Suicide The New York City Police Department is experiencing an epidemic of suicide, with 10 officers taking their own lives in 2019 as of mid October. Radiologist Robert Bard, MD '68, who has forged his reputation using cutting- edge imaging technology to diagnose cancer, is now applying that same technology to assess suicide risk as well as the efficacy of depression treatment. Bard is internationally recognized as a leader in the field of 21st-century 3D ultrasonic volumetric Doppler imaging. At his practice, Bard Cancer Diagnostics in Manhattan, Bard uses 3D ultrasound to diagnose cancers includ- ing melanoma, thyroid, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and other tumors through blood flow imaging as an alternative to biopsy, as well as to guide biopsies, target therapies, and provide focused follow-up after treatment. Now, he's using ultrasound to study blood flow in the part of the brain that regulates emotion. According to Bard, an ongoing multi-center National Institutes of Health study has already demonstrated reactions in the brain to pleas- ant or stressful stimuli using fMRI technology. Based on the brain activity, the information can help diagnose specific mental illness as well as a risk for suicide. \"The problem,\" says Bard, \"is that fMRI is extremely expensive and not read- ily available. There are only three places in New York State that have this technology.\" Bard is trying to develop an easier, less expensive screening method using ultrasound. His interest in brain imaging began as a fourth-year medical student at Upstate, observ- ing a patient who had undergone a successful surgery but was experiencing swelling of the brain. \"There was really no good way to mea- sure intercranial pressure of the brain at the time,\" Bard recalls. \"It killed people.\" Since 1980, ultrasound of the optic nerve has been used to detect increased cranial pres- sure. For the last decade, ultrasound has been used to look at blood flow in the developing brains of babies in utero, which have smaller brains and soft skulls. Now, says Bard, \"we've finally calibrated equipment to detect abnormal blood flow in the adult brain.\" Bard says placing the ultrasound probe on the eye shows the blood flow coming to the back of the eye, which is fixed to the frontal part of the brain. Putting the probe on the temple shows the entire brain blood flow. \"You can see if there's a spasm or abnormal flow in the area you're looking at,\" he says. For years, Bard has treated New York City first responders through the 9/11 Cancer Scan Program. In May, Bard became a Trooper Surgeon, working with the New York State Troopers to use Doppler sonography to diag- nose PTSD in troopers. \"You can measure brain thought activity by observing the alterations in capillary blood vessels in the retina located in close proximity to the main emotional center of the front of the brain,\" he says. In October, Bard became a member of the Public Health Division of the Medical Society of the State of New York, the mental health group that works with the NYPD. \"Most recogniz- able patterns with suicide occur in the anterior cingulate cortex of the brain and are vascular - ized by orbital branches of the anterior cerebral artery,\" he says. \"Ultrasound devices can show changes in brain oxygenation linked to suicide as well as MRI without the stress or the cost.\" The first goal is to have an inexpensive, eas- ily accessible screening test available for some- one who feels they may be at risk, says Bard, who is the author or editor of 11 books, most recently Image Guided Dermatologic Treatments (Springer, 2020). The next is to use the technol- ogy to quantifiably measure the effectiveness of anti-depressant treatment in the same way that imaging has been used to study cancer treat - ments. \"By finding the abnormal blood flow in the brain, we should be able to see if a prescribed medication is making it better or worse,\" Bard says. \"I'm trying to usher in a new way of think - ing about brain imaging.\" \u2014Ren\u00e9e Gearhart Levy UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 47 CLASS NOTESRobert Bard, MD '68 9 783030 292348ISBN 978-3-030-29234-8 Th is book showcases the latest digital skin imaging, optical/laser systems and advanced immunologic therapies including topics rang- ing from the basic dermatologic sciences to advanced microscopic and laser optics.

In addition, it assists radiologists determine the appropriate imaging technologies for specifi c clinical dermal disorders. A detailed and up-to-date overview of image-guided treatments is provided. Th e initial chapters on benign and infl ammatory diseases are precursors to advanced chapters on hidradenitis suppurativa and pigmented lesion analysis. A dedicated chapter on melanoma skin cancer and malignant melanoma is followed by updated concepts of melanoma treatment, including genetic markers and PET/CT to monitor therapeutic success. Further chapters address such topics as dermal trauma from foreign bodies and burns, scar imaging, fi llers complications and podiatric imaging. Chapters on optical coherence tomography and refl ectance confocal microscopy complete the coverage. All chapters were written by dermatologists trained in ultrasound diagnosis, interventional radiologists, dermatopathologists and spe- cialists in advanced optical and microscopic dermatologic analysis, providing a reference guide to noninvasive diagnosis techniques and image guided minimally invasive treatment options. As such, Image Guided Dermatologic Treatments will be an invaluable asset for clini- cians in medical and allied fi elds where dermatologic diagnosis using the least invasive option is required.Robert L.

Otolaryngologist Shelley Berson, MD '86, says many of them may suffer from allergies. In a ground- breaking study published in the International Forum of Allergy and Rhinology in 2018, Dr. Berson demonstrated clinical associations between allergic rhinitis and abnormalities during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the dream and restorative phase of sleep. The first-of-its-kind study was a retrospective analysis of ENT patients with primary complaints of upper airway obstruction, suspected allergic inflammation, and/or sleep-disordered breathing. Berson found that 67 percent of her patients with allergies were found to take longer to enter the dream stage of sleep, to have fewer dreams, and often experienced disrupted breathing upon entering the dream state. In conducting the study, Berson used the REM- respiratory disturbance index (REM-RDI), which she says is a more accurate indicator of REM-specific sleep distur - bances associated with allergies than other measures, such as all-night apnea-hypopnea, respiratory-disturbance indices, or REM-specific apnea hypopnea indices. Berson says data provided by the index can help patients with sleep disturbances make more informed decisions about treatment, which might be allergy treatment rather than, or in addition to, sleep apnea devices or surgery. Berson is an ENT in solo private practice in Nyack, New York, the only female ENT in her county. She is also one of fewer than 300 physicians nationwide combining board certification in sleep medicine, otolaryngology, and allergy medicine, merging these three specialties since 1991. \"It's a unique combination to be an ENT surgeon who practices allergy medicine and also understands the medical aspect of what's really going on in the body when people have problems with sleep,\" she says. \"When I look at my patients, I am not only thinking about their anatomy, but how that anatomy is functioning for them,\" says Berson. \"I have the tools to offer medical as well as surgical treatment and often it's a combination of therapies that provide the best solution.\" To conduct her study, Berson sought out a clinical appointment at New York Medical College, which provided the institutional review board, as well as assis- tance from residents at Mount Sinai Hospital and other ENT colleagues who recognized that sleep apnea surgery was not always solving all of patients' sleep problems. First author on the paper, Berson was also assisted by her Upstate classmate Elizabeth Prezio, MD '86, PhD, an endocrinologist now working in epidemiology in Albany, New York. \"We were study buddies at Upstate and I knew she could help me with the data,\" says Berson. That was just the start. In a forthcoming paper, Berson links disturbed sleep to dust mite allergies. \"Dust mites are incredibly common in bedding and if you have a sensitivity, you're exposed for eight hours at night,\" she says. \"The second your nose gets stuffed up, your mouth opens and your sleep gets disturbed. It's incredibly exciting because we have treatments for it.\" After years of private practice, Berson says her research has provided a good reminder that there is not a singular \"medical\" or \"surgical\" fix for each patient. \"The reality is that what works for patients is often a blend; we need to be mindful of that and keep our minds open to a plan for each patient that may very often be more holistic than we were trained to be.\" \u2014Ren\u00e9e Gearhart Levy Dr. Berson is a cellist with the North Jersey Symphony, Bergen Philharmonic, and Rockland Symphony orchestras.52 UPSTATE MEDICAL ALUMNI JOURNAL | WINTER 2019 CLASS NOTES1994 Joseph T.

Dr. Young was a retired pathologist with a storied medical career. As an academic scientist at Case Western, the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, CA, and the University of Rochester, NY, his pioneering research in genetics led to the discovery of a restriction endonuclease, BamH1, which laid the foundation for cloning and the advent of biotechnology, including development of cloning vectors and methods to join different pieces of DNA. Young transitioned from scientist to administrator, holding posts as dean of the School of Medicine and Dentistry and vice president for health affairs at the University of Rochester; commissioner of Food and Drug Administration; deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services; and director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness and the National Disaster Medical System. In 1986, he became the U.S. Representative to the Executive Committee of the World Health Organization. Most recently, Young served as a partner in Essex Woodlands Health Ventures, a healthcare venture capital firm; executive vice president regulatory and medical, at Braeburn Pharmaceuticals; and executive vice president, regulatory affairs, of Tissue Tech. He was also an ordained Presbyterian minister and served as associate pastor at Fourth Presbyterian Church in Bethesda, MD. Young was a graduate of Union College and Upstate Medical University and completed his internship and residency in pathology at the University Hospitals in Cleveland, OH. He earned a PhD in pathology from Case Western Reserve University in 1962. Young was predeceased by his wife, Leanne. He was survived by his children Lorrie Young, Peggy Long and her husband Nathan, Frank Young Jr. and his wife Sharon Payne, Jonathan Young and his wife Nellie Wild, Deborah Rapp and her husband Richard; grandchildren Stephen, Benjamin, Alyssa, Sarah, Jordan, Jonathan, Abigail, Lindsay, Kristen, Jessie, Elizabeth, Anna, Nathaniel, Bella, Katie and Julia; and great grandsons Tristan and Kaiden.
