Weiss, chief medical officer for COVID-19 and chair of the Department of Medicine at the Miller School of Medicine, said during a [town hall meeting](https://news.miami.edu/stories/2021/08/town-halls-focus-on-importance-of-vaccine,-masks.html) last week. \"Vaccination will allow us to once again function in the ways we were used to functioning.\" The University has partnered with Walgreens to offer a vaccine clinic on the Coral Gables Campus. The Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines will be available Aug. 17-20 and Aug. 23-26 from 1 to 5 p.m. at the StormSurge Room at the Hurricane Food Court. The clinic is open to any student or faculty or staff member who wishes to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, employees can schedule a COVID-19 vaccine at the Walgreens in UHealth Tower. Appointments are available Tuesday through Thursday, 9 a.m.-4 p.m., at no charge. Call 305-702-9066 to make an appointment. Consistent with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, face coverings will be required in all indoor public spaces, including classrooms, libraries, and at the Patti and Allan Herbert Wellness Center\u2014regardless of vaccination status. Outdoor masking is strongly encouraged when congregating in large groups. Erin Kobetz, vice provost of research and scholarship, who is also leading the University's testing, tracing, and tracking efforts, said she recognizes that many would prefer relaxed restrictions, but local infection rates as well as keeping students, faculty, and staff safe are driving their strategy now. \"I appreciate everybody's desire to be past this, but unfortunately that's not our reality now, so the best way for us to beat the pandemic is through prevention, which includes masking up and getting vaccinated,\" she said. Here are details about how you can ensure you are in compliance with University testing and vaccination policies.
