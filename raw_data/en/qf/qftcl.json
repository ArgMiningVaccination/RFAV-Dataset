Yet, despite increasing consumer demand, there is an ongoing exclusion of complementary medicines from mainstream healthcare systems. A lack of evidence is often cited as justification. Until recently, high-quality evidence of treatment efficacy was defined as findings from well-conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. In a recent and welcome move by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Practice, however, the N-of-1 trial design has also been elevated to the highest level of evidence for treatment efficacy of an individual, placing this research design on par with the meta-analysis. N-of-1 trial designs are experimental research methods that can be implemented in clinical practice. They incorporate much of the rigor of group clinical trials, but are designed for individual patients. Individualizing treatment interventions and outcomes in research designs is consistent with the movement towards patient-centered care and aligns well with the principles of holism as practiced by naturopaths and many other complementary medicine practitioners. This paper explores whether rigorously designed and conducted N-of-1 trials could become a new 'gold standard' for demonstrating treatment efficacy for complementary medicine interventions in individual patients in clinical practice.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-01-08", "cleaned_text": "Healthcare]( /journal/healthcare/special_issues/N_of_1 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-08-00015)]. This overview only included evidence from systematic reviews. In reality, the majority of complementary medicine interventions have not been evaluated using randomized controlled trial designs and would therefore not be included in a systematic review. Historically, knowledge about complementary medicine interventions, particularly in the Western herbal medicine tradition, was handed down through an oral tradition based on direct observation by practitioners over long periods of time. [2](#B2-healthcare-08-00015)]. Indeed, this principle of holism has historically underpinned and united all the complementary medicine professions [ [3](#B3-healthcare-08-00015)]. [4](#B4-healthcare-08-00015), [5](#B5-healthcare-08-00015)]. 1.1. Evidence-Based Practice in Context [6](#B6-healthcare-08-00015)]. However, there are historic examples of complementary medicine references to diet in the bible (Book of Daniel circa 150 BC) and for the herb ginseng in the Ben Cao Tu Jing (Chinese Atlas of Materia Medica, circa 1061 AD) [ [6](#B6-healthcare-08-00015)]. The modern use of the term EBP was first coined in the early 1990s, and by the mid-1990s, Sacket had, now famously, described evidence-based medicine as follows: [7](#B7-healthcare-08-00015)]. [8](#B8-healthcare-08-00015), [9](#B9-healthcare-08-00015)]. [10](#B10-healthcare-08-00015)], and less than one-third use electronic databases to find relevant scientific evidence to inform practice [ [11](#B11-healthcare-08-00015)]. It is unknown how much of the complementary medicine workforce uses evidence to inform their practice. According to a national workforce survey, only 25% of respondents reported using peer-reviewed journals as a source of clinical information. The main sources of clinical information for complementary medicine practitioners were professional association newsletters, magazines or journals (66%), professional association conferences (63%), academic textbooks (52%) and internet sources (52%) [ [12](#B12-healthcare-08-00015)]. A more recent cross-sectional survey estimated that around 14% of health professionals regularly engaged with EBP across a range of disciplines [ [13](#B13-healthcare-08-00015)]. [14](#B14-healthcare-08-00015)]. 1.2. Origins of the RCT Research Design [15](#B15-healthcare-08-00015)]. This trial was remarkable for its meticulous use of allocation concealment and blinded assessors to enable objective testing of a drug therapy for the condition. [16](#B16-healthcare-08-00015)]. Rapid progress in clinical trial design development was driven by the pressing need to demonstrate safety and efficacy of new pharmaceutical interventions, which typically countered a specific symptom or disease state. 1.3. RCTs and Their Relevance to Clinical Practice [17](#B17-healthcare-08-00015)]. Concerningly, those with multiple comorbidities experience significantly higher barriers to accessing healthcare [ [18](#B18-healthcare-08-00015)]. These issues are compounded in ageing and increasingly overweight populations [ [19](#B19-healthcare-08-00015)]. Such complex chronic conditions are often managed with a number of concomitant pharmaceuticals, known as polypharmacy [ [20](#B20-healthcare-08-00015)]. [21](#B21-healthcare-08-00015)]. Potentially serious adverse events occurred in over 10% of adults and this was strongly associated with the number of drugs dispensed. The report looked at 15 years of prescribing and noted a dramatic increase in rates of polypharmacy since 1995. Observational studies from USA, Canada, Australia and Italy also report high levels of polypharmacy [ [20](#B20-healthcare-08-00015), [22](#B22-healthcare-08-00015)]. Such high levels of polypharmacy raise concerns about the safety of un-trialed combinations of treatments for individual patients [ [23](#B23-healthcare-08-00015), [24](#B24-healthcare-08-00015)]. National regulations aim to ensure that the pharmaceuticals prescribed medications have been tested and found to be safe and effective, but this process relies upon RCT methodologies, with a single drug as the intervention in one condition at a time. 1.4. Single Case Experimental Designs (SCEDs) [25](#B25-healthcare-08-00015)] and to seriously develop an EBP approach [ [26](#B26-healthcare-08-00015)]. The SCEDs family of methodologies could provide a clear scientific methodological framework that could help the complementary medicine professions, through its researchers and practitioners, to overcome many of the barriers that have prevented evidence generation to support complementary medicine practice, including the complex nature of complementary medicine interventions, the extended time spent with patients, limited complementary medicine research expertise and lack of research funding to conduct large scale clinical trials [ [27](#B27-healthcare-08-00015)]. [28](#B28-healthcare-08-00015)]. All the experimental protocols of an RCT can be utilized. For instance, there must be concealment of the randomization sequence and, where possible, masking of the interventions from participants and researchers (double-blinding). Follow-up some months after the trial is also recommended. The aim is to compare different treatment regimens to determine the most effective therapeutic intervention for the individual participant. This methodology is particularly useful for patients who are traditionally excluded from group clinical trials, such as patients with rare diseases, comorbidities and polypharmacy regimens [ [29](#B29-healthcare-08-00015)]. [30](#B30-healthcare-08-00015)]. According to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Practice, Level 1 evidence is a systematic review of randomized trials or n-of-1 trials; Level 2 evidence is a randomized trial or observational study with dramatic effect [ [31](#B31-healthcare-08-00015)]. This elevation of the N-of-1 trial design is a remarkable development in the shift towards the clinical importance of personalized patient care over the statistical significance and population effect sizes given by data derived from mean differences between groups. [29](#B29-healthcare-08-00015)]. This statement will help practitioners evaluate the quality of such trials and will help to standardize reporting of trials. For instance, these trials are also called N = 1, individual-patient and single-patient trials in the literature. The CENT checklist ( [Section 1](#sec1-healthcare-08-00015)) specifies that the term N-of-1 trial is used in the title. Other important features to note are that there should be more than five measurement points in each period and more than two repeated blocks (see design templates below). Standardization of the quality of reporting will also facilitate the later aggregation of multiple N-of-1 trials into a systematic review of N-of-1 trials. Aggregation of multiple trials into a meta-analysis could facilitate the generalizability of the findings by providing population estimates of effect sizes for the treatment. [32](#B32-healthcare-08-00015)]. For example, patients who are taking very expensive supplements may wish to find out whether they are really working better than a placebo, or a patient may wish to know whether they really need the higher dose. 1.5. N-of-1 Trials Versus RCTs for Complementary Medicine [Table 1](#healthcare-08-00015-t001). 1.6. Governance of N-of-1 Trials [33](#B33-healthcare-08-00015)]. Fortunately, many of the issues can be overcome with careful planning of study designs to suit the individual patient holistically and/or complex interventions. For instance, if an intervention is likely to have a curative or long-term sustained effect, such as probiotics for the microbiome, then modifications to the methodology such as the multiple baseline designs (MBD) can be adapted [ [34](#B34-healthcare-08-00015)]. MBDs are better suited to complementary medicine interventions with a long metabolic half-life and avoid long withdrawal/wash-out periods where the patient may not be receiving any treatment at all [ [35](#B35-healthcare-08-00015)]. However, not all patient conditions or interventions will be suited to single case experimental design methodologies. These issues can be best thought through in collaborations between complementary medicine practitioners and researchers with SCEDs methodological expertise. 1.6.1. Research Ethics 1.6.2. Insurance 1.6.3. Oversight [36](#B36-healthcare-08-00015)]. 2. Practice-Based Clinical Scenarios in Complementary Medicine 2.1. Clinical Scenario: Probiotics for Fibromyalgia 2.1.1. Trial Design [Figure 1](#healthcare-08-00015-f001). In N-of-1 trial terminology, a period is the time during which a single treatment (e.g., A or B) is administered. The order of periods within a treatment pair or block is randomized where practicable. A block or pair is a repeated unit of a set number of periods (for example, three repeating blocks/pairs may take the form: AB BA BA). Multiple pairs or blocks (i.e., more than two units) comprise the entire sequence. 2.1.2. Primary Outcome Measurement 2.1.3. Primary Hypothesis 2.1.4. Statistical Analysis [37](#B37-healthcare-08-00015)]. This was augmented with a range of secondary outcomes including the patient perception reports on which condition worked best. 2.1.5. Process Evaluation [29](#B29-healthcare-08-00015)], with washouts, it became a very long trial. This was considered a limitation of the trial. The longer the duration of a trial, the more likely that other potentially confounding variables may influence the outcome. The basic AB BA design can be readily modified for shorter acting interventions by reducing the time periods. Alternatively, other single case experimental and non-experimental study designs have been designed to deal with these issues. Most notably a multiple baseline design (MBD). MBDs are indicated where the intervention may cause a sustained effect, causing long washout periods or confounding in the crossover condition. Many allied health interventions teach new skills that cannot be unlearned (e.g., in occupational therapy), or make changes that are not readily or ethically withdrawn. In these cases, a multiple-baseline design (MBD) may be the design of choice to test the effectiveness of an intervention for an individual [ [38](#B38-healthcare-08-00015)]. 3. Discussion [39](#B39-healthcare-08-00015)]. By focusing on the individual, rather than group means, N-of-1 trial methodology uniquely accommodates the inherently person-centered nature of a holistic approach to health practice. 3.1. Patient-Centred Approach [40](#B40-healthcare-08-00015)] describing patient perceptions of clinical care concluded that complementary medicine consultations provided patients with experiences of empathy, empowerment and patient-centeredness. [41](#B41-healthcare-08-00015)]. Experimenting with different treatment regimens has the potential to save on the costs of ineffective treatments or treatments that are associated with low patient preference, satisfaction or compliance. For instance, an N-of-1 study embedded into an RCT helped to increase compliance with the study protocol and prevented the withdrawal of a participant [ [42](#B42-healthcare-08-00015), [43](#B43-healthcare-08-00015)]. Similarly, a systematic review of N-of-1 trials for depression found evidence relevant for treatment-resistant patients and patients with comorbidities who would normally have been excluded from conventional clinical trials [ [44](#B44-healthcare-08-00015)]. [45](#B45-healthcare-08-00015)] assessed the suitability of N-of-1 trials as method of mitigating the risk of overprescribing by identifying medications that were underperforming for individual patients. They conducted a systematic review and identified six studies published between 1983 and 2005, where the efficacy of an established treatment in older individuals was objectively tested using an N-of-1 design. In four trials, the tested intervention produced non-significant benefits or was poorly tolerated by individual patients and led to discontinuation of the medication, and in two, the treatment was beneficial and patients continued using the medication. One trial lacked a follow-up, significantly limiting the assessment of the decision to de-prescribe and its safety. The authors concluded that the method was appropriate for older patients to discern the effect of de-prescribing medications with short-term outcomes. [46](#B46-healthcare-08-00015)]. In the absence of pharmacokinetic evidence about the medicinal herb involved, the authors experimentally determined appropriate onset and washout characteristics prior to the commencement of the trial. Huang et al. enrolled three individuals with stable bronchiectasis in a 3-cycle, 18-week randomized, triple blind N-of-1 study. Patients were exposed to a standard decoction of TCM herbs designed to reduce general symptoms of bronchiectasis such as sputum production in one condition and a decoction of herbs prescribed to each individual symptom picture according to TCM principles in the second condition. All three patients benefitted from the herbal interventions in both conditions; however, one patient experienced relief of concomitant symptoms only on the individualized herbal decoction and sought to stay on this prescription after the trial was completed. [47](#B47-healthcare-08-00015)]. Forty-three patients were enrolled with 24 completing three random cycles (active and placebo periods). Aggregating individual N-of-1 results from a total of 84 cycles using Bayesian methods provided stable population estimations. The study concluded that the intervention was not effective in the population of advanced cancer patients with fatigue. Interestingly, the trial also allowed for an exploration of individual effects, which is not usually available from RCT trial data. For eight individuals, the intervention did significantly improve fatigue, but for one patient, fatigue was significantly worsened by the intervention. This study illustrates that N-of-1 trials can provide population estimates with small sample sizes, while also allowing important individual responses to be identified and tailoring of appropriate individual treatments. 3.2. Limitations of N-of-1 Trials as a Research Methodology [2](#B2-healthcare-08-00015)], rather than the symptoms. In theory, this was the case with the clinical scenario described above, using probiotics to correct an imbalance in the microbiome. This is an area of some ideological conflict between the N-of-1 trials design and the philosophical approach by complementary medicine professions. The N-of 1 trial design is best suited for treating symptoms, specifically chronically occurring symptoms, not causes of disease. Thus, N-of-1 trial designs seem to be most indicated in chronic, symptomatic, non-fatal conditions, using treatments that have a relatively short-term duration of action [ [48](#B48-healthcare-08-00015)]. [34](#B34-healthcare-08-00015)]. Examples include interventions with learned behaviors, where a new skill (e.g., posture retraining or a communication strategy) cannot be readily unlearned, or where it may not be practical or ethical to withdraw an intervention once given. This may be particularly relevant to those treatments aimed at remedying the underlying causes of a disease, such as a nutritional intervention to correct an underlying nutritional imbalance. In such cases the multiple baseline design can help to overcome the issue of sustained effects that may carry over into subsequent withdrawal periods (that are meant to be wash-outs or a different intervention). However, the MBD comes at a loss to the high-level experimental design, as the sequence is not fully randomized and cannot be fully blinded to those who are aware of the design. If rigorously applied, therefore, MBD designs could produce quality evidence, but caution should be applied to labelling quasi-experimental designs as level 1 evidence. [49](#B49-healthcare-08-00015)]. While there is still a lot of methodological work to be done in this area, there is general agreement that Bayesian methods offer an acceptable level of precision in the estimation of parameter estimates [ [50](#B50-healthcare-08-00015)]. Combining data from multiple N-of-1 trials into secondary meta-analyses to provide generalizable effect sizes could provide a new avenue for a more rapid creation of clinical knowledge than can be gained from long-term clinical trials and subsequent meta-analyses. It remains to be seen whether the estimates are as accurate as those produced in traditional clinical trials, but this is an exciting new source of emerging evidence. [51](#B51-healthcare-08-00015), [52](#B52-healthcare-08-00015)]. It is conceivable that this could become an issue in N-of-1 trial designs, particularly meta-analyses of N-of-1 trials and/or in Bayesian approaches. Given the nature of the communication between practitioner and participating patient in the design and implementation phases of an N-of-1 trial, the effect of high-quality attention provided in the therapeutic relationship may itself be an independent effect that should be investigated and controlled for, experimentally or statistically, where possible. For instance, the addition of another condition where the patient receives neither the placebo nor the intervention may allow assessment of this effect. 4. Conclusions [30](#B30-healthcare-08-00015)]. N-of-1 trial designs have the potential to generate the highest quality of evidence about the effectiveness of complementary medicine treatments in individual patients in clinical practice. The challenge may be forming collaborations between researchers and complementary medicine practitioners to ensure adequate training and rigorous trial design and management with independent monitoring.

Bone Spine [CrossRef](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbspin.2011.06.001)] |RCT||N-of-1 Trials| |Advantages||Experimental design to determine cause effect relationship for the intervention on the outcome in carefully selected sample.||Experimental design to determine best intervention for individual patient.| |Tightly controlled clinical environment, increases internal validity.||Patient-centered research, through shared decision making about the study design (e.g., outcomes and/or interventions may be chosen by patient). For example, patients need not withdraw from their usual care, which can be incorporated into the design as a baseline or placebo condition.| |Bias minimized via random allocation to groups, allocation concealment and ongoing blinding of participants and data collectors.||Bias minimized via random allocation of exposure to treatments, allocation concealment and ongoing blinding of participants and data collectors to condition, where possible.| |Effect size estimated and generalizable to populations.||Determination about whether a particular treatment works for an individual at a given point in time.| |Powerful statistical analysis that enable conclusive determinations based on experimental hypothesis testing in adequately powered study designs, based on number of participants.||Power is derived from number of measurement points rather than number of participants.| |Can be included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs.||Can be included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of N-of-1 trials.| |More concerned with efficacy than effectiveness.||More concerned with effectiveness than efficacy.| |Limitations||Results apply to population means rather than individuals.||Results apply only to the specific individual who was included in the trial.| |Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria means that the sample is not necessarily reflective of clinical usage in a general clinical population (i.e., increasing internal validity reduces the generalizability/external validity of the findings).||Lack of generalizability to estimate effect size in populations in single N-of-1 trials. However, multiple N-of-1 trials can be aggregated as an N-of-1 series or meta-analysis, in order to estimate population effect sizes.| |Expensive and time consuming to run.||Time consuming for practitioner and patient.| |Results often not known for years||Statistical analysis not as powerful as parametric tests are not suited to small number and repeated measures samples (usually violate assumptions of normality and independence); usually uses simple visual descriptive analyses or more complex Bayesian analyses.| \u00a9 2020 by the authors.
