The list of the nutraceutical ingredients below. In addition to those ingredients, we also added 20mg of full spectrum organic hemp distillate, 5mg Delta-8 THC isolate and 5mg of CBG isolate per gummy, for a total of 30mg per gummy. Boswellia The therapeutic properties of Boswellia Serrata are widely recognized by modern science, mainly for the safe and effective treatment of inflammatory conditions. The resinous portion of the Boswellia serrata plant contains potent, anti-inflammatory compounds called boswellic acids. These acids in boswellia resin contribute to the herb's anti-inflammatory properties. Four of these boswellic acids are known to be potent inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme that produces pro-inflammatory leukotriene in the body. Many chronic inflammatory conditions are associated with leukotriene formation. Both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions may benefit from Boswellia. The most notable benefit that Boswellia has over most synthetic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) & corticosteroids, which also work by inhibiting leukotriene synthesis, is that boswellic acids have been found to exhibit no significant side effects or toxicity. Baicalin & Catechins In clinical studies, flavonoids from the plants baicalensis (Chinese skullcap) and Camellia sinensis (green tea ECGC), have been shown to possess a variety of therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects. Extracts containing baicalin derived from Chinese skullcap and catechin from green tea act as inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with a significant inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzyme activity in vitro. In fact, clinical trials have shown that the combination of Chinese skullcap-derived baicalin and catechin from green tea is as effective as a popular OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in managing the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee and it has better upper gastrointestinal, renal, and respiratory safety profile than the NSAID. This combination of plant extracts may therefore provide a potential therapeutic approach to the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions. Turmeric Turmeric is a bright yellow, ancient spice and a traditional remedy that has been used as a medicine, condiment, and flavoring throughout history. Turmeric's medicinal value is known to be due to the curcuminoid content in the root portion of the plant. These curcuminoids have been shown to inhibit the enzymes 5-lipooxygenase (LOX) and cyclo-oxygenase (COX), resulting in a well-established anti-inflammatory action without any significant negative side effects. Compounds in Turmeric Root also demonstrate beneficial antioxidant effects. About Purwell PrWell was founded in 2018 by Nick DiFrancesco who partnered with a farm in Pueblo, CO where our hemp is grown, cultivated, processed and packaged in order to develop the PrWell line of hemp oil products. To achieve this, we created a line of safe and effective CBD products that physicians, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals could trust and feel comfortable recommending to their patients. The response has been overwhelming and the demand continues to grow! We are extremely passionate about what we are doing at PrWell and are excited for what the future holds. "}
