Nestled in between an idyllic stretch of sandy beach along the southern Sri Lankan coastline and a tranquil lagoon within the Rekawa Nature Reserve, we are an eco-conscious, authentic retreat centre, offering a healing and nurturing space for you to deeply rest and be cared for by our warm and dedicated team\" Sam Kankanamge Founder of Sen Wellness Bespoke Retreats Our Bespoke Retreats, available year-round, are uniquely tailored to your unique constitution and personal wellness goals. Offering flexible durations from 3 days to 3 weeks or more, we accommodate your schedule. Each programme begins with an in-depth consultation with our resident Ayurvedic Doctor, who will prescribe a tailored treatment plan including daily Ayurvedic treatments and herbal medicines, yoga and meditation practices, immersive nature experiences and nourishing meals, and powerful group ceremonies and rituals. Signature Retreats A 10-day sacred group experience available seasonally, hosted by Sen Wellness Founder and Medical Director Sam Kankanamge. The Signature Retreats include additional personal treatment sessions with Sam, as well as group ceremonies and rituals. We believe that no group comes together by accident, there is always a deeper purpose and intention. Some of the deepest healing can occur when we allow others to be a mirror of ourselves. The group naturally evolves during the retreat, strong connections are made and lasting friendships are formed.
