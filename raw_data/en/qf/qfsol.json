{"title": "Aviva Romm, MD - So I've been chewing on whether to post this and decided to share what's on my mind today. Did anyone else see a vaccine article called The Great Divide? It was posted on the internet a few days ago; today I saw it posted on the FB page of an integrative doc. The first sentence of the article says \"There's not a mother alive who, once having all the information, would allow anyone to vaccinate her child.\" When I read it I was concerned that moms would either read the article and believe it, or read the article and feel horribly judged if you'd chosen to vaccinate. I try to keep my FB page informative and not get negative about other people's posts, but wow -- this one just really bothered me. Does that mean any mother who vaccinates is uninformed? Or worse, ignorantly harming her child? The Great Divide, insinuates that vaccines have no benefits, no merits, and only cause harm. [Frankly, I don't want to post the link because my sending folks there only increases the views on that page!] It is on a website created by a few anti vaccine docs from various backgrounds. While vaccinations certainly raise questions that need to be effectively and honestly addressed (I have several women patients who experienced neurologic problems after starting their HPV series, for example) and I don't believe that we need a vaccine for everything (chicken pox, being an example), having seen diphtheria first hand -- in a country 90 miles off the shore of the my own, and polio in patients who came to the US from places where it is still endemic -- I am certainly glad that vaccinations exist. Many work quite well, even if imperfectly, and to think otherwise is to either be incredibly paranoid or entirely unfamiliar with the basic history of disease. While yes, many illnesses had begun to decline prior to the advent of vaccinations -- it doesn't mean that many vaccines haven't been very successful. Hib is a perfect example. We'd live in a very differently world with a much higher mortality rate for our kids if everyone believed the kind of rhetoric that says all vaccinations are ineffective and dangerous. Just spend a week in a hospital in Haiti, see what tetanus does, and let's talk... As you all know, I support parent's choice and chose an alternative vaccination model for my own kids. Many docs are very hostile to parents who choose not to vaccinate. Unfortunately, it's this very kind of rhetoric that makes all parents seem a bit crazy to doctors (not to me, but yes, to many medical colleagues I've had in the past decade) when you do ask questions, choose to delay, or defer vaccinations. It's a disservice to all of us on so many levels.
