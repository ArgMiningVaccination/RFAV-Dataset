Nasaline\u00ae Junior Nasal Rinsing System Contents - Nasal Packets USP Grade Sodium Chloride and Sodium Bicarbonate - Storage/Travel Case - Mixing Cup - Child-Friendly Instructions Description Nasaline\u00ae Nasal Rinsing System Patented Nasal Irrigation Device Developed By Swedish ENT Specialists What is Nasaline\u00ae Junior? Nasaline\u00ae Junior Nasal Rinsing System is a unique, patented, drug-free nasal rinsing system designed for children ages 2-12. Today, more than ever, many children suffer from allergies and grow up with severe breathing and nasal problems. Children often have just as much mucus in their nasal cavities as adults do - and suffer to a greater extent as their nasal cavities are smaller and narrower. Nasaline\u00ae Junior, with its patented, latex-free silicone tip, produces a gentle stream that soothes dry nasal passages and gently washes away dust, pollen, and irritants - naturally. Best when used with [Nasaline\u00ae Premixed Saline Packets](https://www.squipusa.com/product/nasaline-50-premixed-saline-packets/). Nasaline\u00ae Junior can be used to cleanse and relieve nasal passages affected by: - Nasal allergies, dryness and hay fever - Sinus pressure and nasal stuffiness - Nasal symptoms from cold, flu, and sinusitis - Post-nasal drip and nasal congestion - Nasal irritation from occupational and house dust, fumes, dander, grass pollen, smoke, etc. - Saline nasal irrigation, moisturization, and daily nasal hygiene - For use after sinus surgery and for sinus symptoms suffered by Cystic Fibrosis patients What makes Nasaline\u00ae Junior Unique? Nasaline\u00ae Junior is a patented nasal rinsing system that consists of a 30cc syringe, a silicone tip, saline, a storage/travel case and a mixing cup. The silicone tip was designed to fit most noses in such a way as to completely seal the nostril opening. The channel inside the tip is formed in the shape of an hourglass, producing a gentle swirl stream when the saline solution enters the nose. Nasaline\u00ae Junior does not contain latex and is safe for direct contact with the skin. The Nasaline\u00ae syringe delivery system has many advantages: - Allows the user to control the flow and pressure for optimum safety, comfort and effectiveness. - Protects against backflow if user slows down or stops during the rinsing process. - Easy to clean to prevent bacterial buildup. - Gentle, comfortable and smooth-flowing saline nasal irrigation. - Excellent for cleansing prior to the use of nasal medications. - Drug-free and preservative-free; non-sedating. - Can be used as a pH balanced and isotonic solution with one packet, or a hypertonic solution with two packets. - Suitable for use during pregnancy; consult your doctor with concerns. - Portable for travel. Who can use Nasaline\u00ae Junior? Nasaline\u00ae Junior can be used from ages 2-12, with parental supervision, unless advised otherwise by your child's doctor. For ages 13 and older, we recommend [Nasaline\u00ae Adult](https://www.squipusa.com/product/nasaline-nasal-rinsing-system/), a larger unit. We suggest the [NeilMed\u00ae Baby N\u00e4saKleen\u00ae Nasal Aspirator](https://www.squipusa.com/product/baby-nasakleen-nasal-aspirator/) for newborns and toddlers. Dosage Use two (2) full syringes twice in each nostril per rinsing session. Rinse once or twice daily or as recommended by your doctor. Cleaning Remove the tip, pull out the plunger from the syringe and flush all 3 parts with warm water. Nasaline\u00ae Junior's silicone tip can be cleaned with a mild dish washing detergent. Dry all 3 parts. Once dry, keep the Nasaline\u00ae Junior unit stored with the plunger inserted into the cylinder. Only logged in customers who have purchased this product may leave a review. Three Easy Steps 1. Empty 1 packet (1/2 teaspoon) of Nasaline salt into the mixing cup. 2. Fill the mixing cup to the 8 oz/240 mL line with distilled, micro-filtered (through 0.2 microns), commercially bottled or previously boiled and cooled down water at lukewarm or body temperature. Stir to properly mix the saline solution. Extract the saline solution completely into the Nasaline\u00ae Junior applicator. 3. Stand (or sit) over a bathroom sink or use in the shower. Put the silicone tip against the nose so that it completely seals the nostril. Breathe normally through the mouth (or say aaaah...) and slowly push the saline solution up into the nostril. Refrain from swallowing; when the saline solution reaches the back of the nasal cavities, the palate closes automatically by reflex. The saline fills the nasal cavities and proceeds to pour out the other nostril. Perform this process twice in each nostril. Use a tissue to blow out any remaining saline in your nose. Some of the saline can remain in the nose and trickle out later. Tilting your head forward and turning side to side immediately after flushing can prevent this. WARNING - For your safety, do not use tap or faucet water for dissolving the mixture unless it has been previously boiled for five minutes or more (and then cooled down) as boiling sterilizes the water. Other choices are distilled, micro-filtered (through 0.2 micron), reverse osmosis filtered, or commercially bottled water.
