Flower essences in their modern form were first developed in the 1930s by an English physician, Dr. Edward Bach. He prepared [38 remedies](https://homeopathicremediesonline.com/bach-flower-remedies/), mostly from English wildflowers. In recent new flower essences have been researched from other plant species. Flower essences are dilute, potentized herbal infusions or decoctions, prepared from wildflowers or pristine garden blossoms. They are made directly in the nature where the four alchemical elements of earth, water, air and fire are found in harmonious balance. To this is added the fifth element of the sensitive awareness and attunement of the preparer. The fresh, dew-filled blossoms are gathered in the early morning of a clear, sunny day. Floating on the surface of a bowl of water, they are irradiated by the warmth and light of the sun for several hours. This process creates an energetic imprint of the etheric energy pattern of the flower in the water, embodying the healing archetype of that plant. This \"mother essence\" is preserved with organic grape alcohol and then further diluted and potentized to form the \"stock\" which is sold in stores and to practitioners.
