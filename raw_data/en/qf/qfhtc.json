This doesn't change with a cancer diagnosis . At HealthPartners, we believe in helping you address your sexual health concerns at whatever point in treatment you may find yourself . Sexuality is a biopsychosocial process . This means that many factors contribute to sexual health concerns, often at the same time . Examples include: Biological contributors, such as medical diagnosis, medications, treatments or therapies, and physical handicaps . Psychological contributors, such as a person's gender identity, self-esteem, emotions toward sex and sexuality, beliefs about sex and one's own body, and behaviors related to sex . Social contributors, such as religion, cultural background, one's ability to communicate about sex with a partner, a partner's expectations of sex and sexuality, being cared for or being a caretaker . Sexual health concerns related to a cancer diagnosis can arise before, during and after treatment . Some of these sexual health concerns include: Lowered or loss of interest in sex or sexual desire Changes to how the body experiences arousal (erectile issues, lack of vulvar or vaginal response to sexual stimulation) Changes in sensitivity and the ability to achieve orgasm or climax12 Experience of pain with sexual stimulation or behaviors Changes to the body that can affect how a person experiences sex and sexuality, such as: \u00bbHormone changes \u00bbChanges in how certain body parts work \u00bbDamage to nerve endings \u00bbFatigue \u00bbNausea \u00bbBowel and bladder problems \u00bbSkin problems and other changes to the overall appearance to the body How a partner experiences and understands their sexual lives with a person living with cancer and undergoing treatment .

How common is the type of cancer I have? What stage is my cancer? What treatments do you recommend for my cancer? Why do you recommend these treatments? How well do these treatments work? What's my prognosis with these treatments? What are the short-term risks and side effects of these treatments? What are the long-term risks or side effects of these treatments? How will the treatment affect my fertility? How should I prepare for these treatments? How often and how many times will I need to come to the clinic for treatment? Is there a special diet I should follow to help my treatment? If yes, what kind of diet? Is it OK to continue working, exercising and doing my regular activities before, during and after my treatment? What support do you offer my family and me? \"Writing down your questions is a great idea. I remember being shocked at the amount of time that was available with my oncologist at my first appointments. There's so much time to talk to the doctor. You can make use of the time if you're prepared. \" \u2014 David, a cancer survivor14Emotions during Your Cancer Experience The feelings cancer brings up are variable . Some people compare the emotional experience of dealing with cancer to a rollercoaster ride . You may feel any of the following: Hope for beating cancer Relief about starting treatment Concern about physical changes Fear of suffering, pain and death Sadness and distress about having to deal with cancer Anxiety about the future and feeling vulnerable Anger about having cancer Finding positive ways to cope with your emotional ups and downs will help you throughout your cancer experience . Think about how you have successfully dealt with difficult situations in the past . Knowing what works best for you, and what doesn't, can help you gain strength and courage and be hopeful as you go through treatment . Depression and anxiety Most people with cancer don't experience major depression or persistent anxiety disorder . However, if you have a history of major depression, bipolar disorder or severe anxiety before cancer, then you're very likely to have another episode of mood or anxiety symptoms either during or after cancer treatment . If you're feeling depressed or suicidal, let your care team know . We can help . Change and loss Cancer can bring about sudden changes in your daily life . Some of these changes are experienced as losses that affect your life . Examples include: Loss of control over your schedule and work routine Loss of the plans you had for your immediate future Change in social relationships Change in physical appearance Feelings of grief often follow a sense of loss or the reality of loss . Anger, sadness, frustration and fear all are expected reactions to the losses associated with cancer . The reality of how your cancer experience is affecting your life can be difficult and painful . For information about the support available to you and your loved ones, see Pages 5 to 12 . For information about classes available to you and your loved ones, see Page 7 .15Sharing Your Diagnosis When you choose to tell others about your cancer diagnosis is up to you . Coming to terms with your own feelings about cancer can be difficult and take time . Deciding with whom to share your diagnosis and when can be tricky . But you needn't feel alone . Sharing your feelings may be helpful and therapeutic, for you and your loved ones . Your instinct may be to protect those close to you from worry . Or you may be concerned their reactions will upset you . However, you may find you need to rely on family and friends more than ever .Taking the time you need Take the time you need before you tell other people about your diagnosis . Consider who should know about your diagnosis and how you want to tell them . Some people you might decide to tell are family members, friends, neighbors and coworkers . You may decide to tell your supervisor or human resources personnel if your work schedule is likely to be disrupted . You can ask and expect they'll keep your news confidential . See Page 88 for information about employment rights . The responses of others When you share your diagnosis, people's reactions may upset, disappoint or surprise you . Usually, people don't mean to be insensitive . Sometimes, people have a personal experience that makes them uncomfortable with the situation . Or they may be shocked about the diagnosis and not know what to say or do . Family and friends may, in fact, have similar feelings of anger, fear and confusion as you do . They may need time to adjust to your diagnosis or need to talk right away . If someone's reaction upsets you, you don't have to respond . You can ask a supportive loved one to help you respond when you're ready .\"I didn't share my diagnosis at first. As I became more comfortable, I was more open. My friends had a lot of questions. I answered what I could because it helps them too. Because of my diagnosis, one of my friends had a mammogram and found breast cancer. \" \u2014 Karen, a cancer survivor16If some family members or friends are unable to be supportive, find other people who can be there for you . Social workers, psychotherapists and spiritual counselors are also available to help .If you have children As a parent with cancer, worrying how your children will react to your diagnosis and treatment can increase your anxiety . Talking openly and honestly about your cancer with your children and having realistic conversations about cancer as a family is important and healthy . Studies show telling children about a cancer diagnosis is better than holding back information, as is telling them sooner rather than later . Children who are old enough to sense something is wrong can be supportive when offered a straightforward explanation of the situation . When children aren't told about a parent's cancer or involved in discussions about a parent's diagnosis and treatment, they may feel sad, afraid and unable to ask about the cancer . Discussing cancer with children helps them understand what's going on and be clear about what isn't happening . \"Telling my son was my biggest concern. The doctors and nurses make you feel like they have all the time in the world for you. My doctor took time to talk to my son, and she did a phenomenal job. I'll be forever grateful for her sensitive but matter-of-fact approach. \" \u2014 Betsy, a cancer survivorTalking about cancer Families and friends often have a difficult time knowing exactly what you need or what to say or do for you . People often feel uncomfortable and awkward as much as sad and scared . These are normal feelings and reactions . The belief that you shouldn't talk about your cancer for fear of upsetting one another is common . However, talking about your cancer with a family member or a close friend can be comforting and healing . Of course, if you don't want to talk about your cancer, that's OK too . What's most important is to be yourself and not be afraid to ask loved ones for help . Be as specific as possible . Consider asking others to run errands, buy groceries, prepare food or take care of your children or an elderly parent\u2014 whatever may make life simpler for you right now . Sometimes, being on the receiving end of help is difficult . But helping one another in need is an important part of a relationship . Do what feels right for you . 17Resources Age-appropriate resources are available to help you explain to your children what cancer is and what your diagnosis means . Talk to your care team for help finding materials . Angel Foundation\u2014Facing Cancer Together mnangel .org 612-627-9000 Offers education and support free of charge to families who have a parent with cancer .

Each type of cancer involves normal cells that become abnormal and grow out of control . To understand different treatment options, knowing how cancer cells develop is helpful . Your body is made of billions of cells . Cells organize together to form glands, muscles, bones and other body parts . Cells look and work differently based on where they are in your body . However, all normal cells follow a pattern of growth, division and death . Some cells follow this pattern faster than other cells do . Every day your body makes new cells to replace those that die . Pattern of cell growth Cancer occurs when normal cells in your body become abnormal and don't follow the normal pattern of growth, division and death . The abnormal cells can grow out of control . The cells no longer do the job they should in your body . When a cancer cell divides, it makes more cells like itself . Cancer cells continue dividing into more cells . Eventually, the cancer cells can crowd and destroy your body's normal, healthy cells and tissues . Type of tumor Abnormal cells can develop into 2 types of tumors: benign and malignant . A benign tumor is an abnormal growth that's not cancer . It can grow large and press on other parts of the body . It stays in one place and doesn't travel to other parts of the body . A malignant tumor is cancerous and can grow very large, press on other parts of the body and travel to other parts of the body . Type of cancer Most cancers are named for the type of cell or the area of the body where the cancer starts . For example, breast cancer is cancer that starts in the breast . Stage of cancer Stage of cancer refers to whether your cancer has spread to other parts of your body . Some cancers travel through your lymphatic system (tissues and organs that help rid your body of toxins and waste materials) or get in your blood and spread to other parts of your body . Metastasis is the spread of cancer cells to other parts of your body . Grade of cancer The grading of cancer refers to how quickly the cancer cells are growing and spreading to other parts of your body . The lower the grade, the slower the cancer cells are growing .22Exploring Your Treatment Options Generally, the goal of treatment may be to: Cure the cancer . Control the cancer from spreading . Make you more comfortable . You and your care team personalize your treatment plan based on: The type, stage and grade of your cancer . Results of physical exams, lab results and other diagnostic tests . Your age and medical history, including other chronic health conditions . Treatment options, including clinical trials, for your type, stage and grade of cancer . Short-term and long-term side effects and benefits of each treatment option . Your treatment goals, including preferences about pain management and quality of life . The rest of this section discusses common treatment options . Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses different medicines to kill fast-growing cancer cells . Chemotherapy is most commonly given intravenously (using an IV in a vein) or orally (using a pill) . The medicines travel through your blood to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells . Often, people receive chemotherapy in cycles . A cycle is alternating treatment periods with rest periods . Rest periods give your body a chance to build healthy new cells and regain strength . The number of chemotherapy cycles you need depends on the type of cancer . You may receive chemotherapy every day, every week or every month . You and your doctor discuss the length of your treatment . See Pages 36 to 38 for more detailed information about chemotherapy . Other medicine therapies Your care team may discuss other medicine therapies you may receive, including: Hormone therapy. Some cancers depend on hormones to grow . Hormone therapy adds, blocks or removes hormones from your body . Targeted therapy. This treatment uses medicine that blocks the spread of cancer cells and may limit damage to normal cells . Different cancers have different targets . Targeted therapy does not work for everyone . Immunotherapy. Biological therapies use your body's natural defenses (the immune system) to fight cancer or decrease the side effects of some cancer treatments . 23Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing and dividing . Because cancer cells grow and divide more rapidly than most normal cells, radiation therapy can successfully treat many kinds of cancer . Usually, you receive external radiation therapy as an outpatient 5 days a week for several weeks . Internal radiation therapy requires a procedure to implant radioactive seeds or a device near a tumor . See Pages 32 to 35 for more detailed information about radiation therapy .Surgery Your doctor may refer you to a surgeon for different reasons . You may need surgery to remove a tumor when the tumor appears to be confined to one area . Tissues around the tumor and nearby lymph nodes also may be removed during surgery . Reconstructive surgery helps restore the appearance or function of an area of your body affected by the cancer . Other surgical procedures include placing ports (see Page 38) or feeding tubes . How are chemotherapy and radiation therapy different? A major difference between chemotherapy and radiation therapy is the focus of the therapy . In chemotherapy, the medicines travel throughout your body through your bloodstream . In radiation therapy, the radiation is targeted directly at a specific part of your body . 24Palliative care Palliative care works to relieve suffering and improve quality of life for people with advanced illness and their families . Designed to care for the mind, body and spirit, palliative care is provided with all other appropriate medical treatments . You don't have to stop life-prolonging medical therapies, such as chemotherapy . Instead, palliative care works along with ongoing medical care, providing an extra layer of support to your care team . Palliative care team members may include palliative care doctors, nurse practitioners, social workers and chaplains . The goal is to make sure you have the best quality of life and receive the support and help you and your family members need . Your doctor may refer you to palliative care .Hospice care Hospice is a philosophy of providing compassionate care to patients and family members . Hospice isn't a specific place, but rather services to provide individualized care where needed . Hospice can take place at home or in an assisted living facility, long-term care facility, residential hospice facility or the hospital . The hospice care team works closely with you, your family members and your care team to create a personalized care plan for the unique medical needs as well as the emotional and spiritual needs often brought about by a life-limiting illness . To receive hospice, you need to: Have a life-limiting illness . Have a life expectancy of weeks or months rather than years . No longer be receiving treatment to cure the illness . Have a referral from your clinician .25Why participate in clinical trials? Cancer affects us all, whether we have it, care about someone who does or worry about getting it in the future . Clinical trials contribute to knowledge and progress against cancer . If a new treatment proves effective in a study, it may become a new standard treatment that can help many patients . Today's most effective standard treatments are based on previous study results . Clinical trials offer the most promising new ways to: Treat cancer . Manage symptoms of cancer or side effects from treatment . Screen and diagnose cancer . Prevent cancer . We at Regions Hospital Cancer Care Center participate in clinical trials because we want to improve the health and quality of life of our patients . All of the cancer medicines that people currently use as part of their treatment came from clinical trials . With the participation of people like you, new medicines can be approved for use . What's a clinical trial? New tests and treatments aren't offered to the public as soon as they're made . They first need to be studied . A clinical trial is a type of research that studies a test or treatment given to people to see how safe and helpful it is . A clinical trial is done only when there's reason to believe a new test or treatment may improve the care of patients . Who can participate in clinical trials? Any time anyone needs treatment for cancer, clinical trials are an option to consider . Trials are not only for people who have advanced cancer that's not responding to treatment . Trials are available for all stages of cancer . To join a clinical trial, you must meet the conditions of the study . Even if you qualify for the study, choosing to join a clinical trial is something only you, those close to you and your care team can decide together . What are the benefits and drawbacks of participating? Like all treatment options, clinical trials have possible benefits and drawbacks . By looking closely at all options, including clinical trials, you're taking an active role in a decision that affects your life . Possible benefits You'll have access to new treatment that's not available to people outside of the trial . The research team will watch you closely . If the treatment being studied is more effective than the standard treatment, you may be among the first to benefit . The trial may help scientists learn more about cancer and help people in the future . Clinical Trials 26Possible drawbacks The new treatment may not be better than\u2014 or even as good as\u2014the standard treatment . New treatments may have side effects that doctors don't expect or that are worse than those of the standard treatment . You may be required to make more visits to the doctor than if you were receiving standard treatment, or you may need to have extra tests . Even if a new treatment has benefits in some patients, it may not work for you . What clinical trials are available? As our patient, you have access to several clinical trials for any type of cancer at any stage . Talk with your doctor about finding clinical trials that may be right for you . If your doctor offers you a trial, here are some questions you may want to ask: What's the purpose of the study? What kinds of tests and treatments does the study involve? What does the treatment do? Has the treatment been used before? Has it been used for other types of cancers? Will I know which treatment I receive? What's likely to happen to me with, or without, this new treatment?

Clinical Trials by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) . nccn .org/patients/resources/clinical_trials/ default .aspx Information from the National Cancer Institute (cancer.gov) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (nccn.org) was used in this section.27Getting test results Usually, test results are available within 2 to 3 days . If you have questions or concerns about your results, call your care team Monday through Friday, 8 a .m . to 4:30 p .m . Some lab results are released automatically to your electronic medical record, available by signing in to your online account at healthpartners.com . Talk to any member of your care team about signing up for an online account . You may see some test results before you talk with your care team . Your care team will help you understand the results and what they mean . Imaging exams Imaging exams help your oncologist: See if the cancer is in more than 1 spot . Decide what treatment is best for you . Measure how well your cancer treatment is working . The table below describes common imaging exams .Medical Tests and Procedures Type of imaging exam What the imaging exam shows Bone scan A bone scan evaluates the structure of your bones . A low-dose radioactive dye is injected into a vein and images are taken . Dye that gathers in a specific area suggests an abnormality . Computerized tomography (CT) scanA CT scan is an exam that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanAn MRI scan diagnoses abnormalities and diseases not seen on X-rays . MRI scans produce high-quality images (pictures) without using radiation . Positron emission tomography (PET) scanA PET scan is an exam in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein . A scanner then makes pictures of your body where the glucose is used . Cancer cells often use more glucose than normal cells . The pictures help find cancer cells . Ultrasound Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to outline a part of the body . An ultrasound can show if a structure is solid or liquid . X-ray X-rays are a form of radiation that can show an image of cancer in your body or bones .28Biopsies A biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small piece of tissue for sampling to check for cancer cells . Biopsies can be done surgically or with a needle . A biopsy helps your oncologist identify your type of cancer . Blood tests Regular blood tests also help your oncologist check your white blood cell count, red blood cell count, platelet count, tumor markers, electrolytes, liver function and kidney function during treatment . Your treatment plan may change based on your blood test results . Some people require blood or platelet transfusions to increase low blood counts . See Page 50 for more information about how your blood test results may affect your chemotherapy . The table below describes common blood tests . Type of blood test What the blood test measures Electrolytes Electrolytes are minerals, such as sodium (Na) and potassium (K+), found in your body . A blood test measures the levels of electrolytes and carbon dioxide in your blood . These levels can be low if you don't have enough fluids . Kidney function A blood test checking creatinine (Cr) levels determines how well your kidneys are working . Liver function A blood test checks how well your liver is working . Platelet count Platelets (Plt), along with other parts of the blood, form clots that stop bleeding . A platelet count is a blood test that counts the number of platelets in your blood . Red blood cell count Red blood cells (RBC) carry oxygen to all parts of the body . A blood test counts the number of red blood cells . Tumor markers Tumor markers are substances produced by a cancerous tumor . These tumor markers help determine if the treatment is working . Not all tumors have tumor markers to measure . White blood cell count White blood cells (WBC) work to fight infections . A blood test counts the number of white blood cells .29Taking medicine can be confusing, especially if you aren't used to taking any or if you need to take several medicines a day . Sometimes, taking a medicine can be difficult if it has side effects . However, taking all your medicines exactly as your doctor instructs is important . Some side effects go away or lessen after a few days . Tips for taking your medicine To help take your medicine safely and effectively, follow these tips: Make sure you understand the following: \u00bbThe names of your medicines \u00bbWhy you're taking each medicine and the expected results \u00bbHow often and when to take the medicine \u00bbHow much medicine to take each time Ask your doctor and pharmacist about side effects and what to do about them . Talk with your doctor and pharmacist before taking any nutritional supplements or over- the-counter medicines, including pain relievers . Some over-the-counter medicines or supplements may negatively affect your prescription medicine and cause side effects . Take all your medicine, even if you feel fine . Do not stop taking a medicine before first talking with your doctor . If you miss a dose or take an incorrect dose of medicine, call your doctor . Tell your doctor and pharmacist right away if you're: \u00bbHaving uncomfortable side effects . \u00bbNot getting enough relief . \u00bbHaving difficulty swallowing a pill or tablet or otherwise taking a medicine . Take your medicine exactly as prescribed . Do not chew, crush or break any capsules or tablets unless your doctor or pharmacist says it's OK . Know which medicines to take with food or on an empty stomach . Some medicines get into your blood better if you have a full stomach and some if you have an empty stomach . Do not drive while taking medicine for pain or to help you sleep . Managing Your Medicine30Refilling prescriptions Submit your refill requests to the pharmacy at least 2 days before you run out of medicine to avoid any missed doses . A bottle marked no refill doesn't mean you should stop taking the medicine . No refill means the pharmacy needs to check with your doctor before refilling the prescription . Call your pharmacy to request a refill of prescription pain medicine . When you need opioid medicine Opioids are powerful medicines that may be used for a short time to relieve pain . Opioid medicines don't cure a health problem and don't get rid of pain . Rather, they help you manage your pain while your body is healing . What to know about opioids Keep the following in mind if your doctor has prescribed opioids for short-term management of your pain: Although opioids may be effective in relieving pain for a short time, they can actually make pain worse over time . Opioids affect your nervous system by increasing your pain sensitivity so you can end up experiencing more intense pain . Opioids can cause nausea, vomiting, depression, constipation, low sex hormones, breathing difficulty and death . The longer you take opioids, the higher the dose you'll need to relieve pain . This can quickly lead to addiction . However, for people with advanced and incurable cancer, opioids may be needed to palliate (ease) symptoms until the end of life . Addiction in those cases is usually of less concern . Talk with your doctor about driving while taking opioids . Opioids can make you sleepy and slow down your reaction time . This can affect your ability to drive safely . Taking too much opioid medicine at one time\u2014an overdose\u2014can cause death . To avoid an overdose: \u00bbDo not break, crush or chew a pill . Do not cut or tear a patch . \u00bbDo not drink alcohol or take illegal drugs while taking opioids . \u00bbDo not take opioid medicine with other sedating medicines such as benzodiazepines (tranquilizers) and sleeping medicines . Examples of these types of medicines include medicine in a safe and secure place away from children and pets, preferably a locked location . \u00bbTake your medicine as prescribed . It's OK if you miss a dose . However, if you miss a dose, don't double your next dose . If your pain is managed without your medicine, you can stop taking it . 31Other medicines to manage pain Pain can often be managed just as well without opioids . Other medicines used for pain management have fewer side effects and risks . Talk with your doctor about these options . Managing pain without medicine Methods other than medicine can also help manage pain . These methods include: Positioning. Adjusting your body into different positions can relieve pressure . Cold therapy. Cold therapy, such as using cold packs or ice, helps reduce swelling and inflammation . Relaxation. Meditation, prayer and yoga help relieve anxiety and muscle tension . Massage. Massage relieves tension in tired, achy parts of the body . Music. Music can help take your mind off the pain . Positive thinking. People who stay positive and hopeful may feel less pain or feel less bothered by pain than people who don't think as positively . Remember to move When you're in pain, you might want to be less active . But when you have pain, being inactive can be harmful . Getting back to regular activities is important in your recovery, even if you experience some discomfort . Being inactive for too long can increase stiffness and pain .32What's Radiation Therapy? Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that can stop cancer cells from spreading and growing . Radiation therapy is also called X-ray therapy or radiotherapy . How radiation therapy works Radiation therapy uses high doses of radiation, similar to an X-ray, to destroy fast-growing cancer cells . When the cancer cells can't divide, they die . Radiation therapy focuses the high- energy X-rays on the specific part of the body that has cancer . Choosing radiation therapy You and your care team will decide if radiation therapy is part of your treatment plan and, if so, how to use radiation therapy to treat your cancer . Radiation therapy may be used as your only treatment to cure or control cancer . Radiation therapy may be used in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy or surgery .Finding out the type, amount and duration of radiation therapy The radiation therapy you receive will be specific to you and your treatment needs . The amount and type of radiation you receive depend on the size and location of the cancer . Your care team will discuss specific additional considerations with you . The type and the duration of your radiation therapy depend on several factors: Type of cancer Stage of cancer Location (organs) of cancer Goals of treatment\u2014cure cancer, control its growth or relieve cancer symptoms, such as painRadiation Therapy33How Can Radiation Therapy Be Used in My Treatment Plan? Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy can be used to: Cure cancer. Radiation therapy can kill cancer cells and stop them from growing back . Control cancer. Radiation therapy can slow the growth of cancer . It can also stop cancer from spreading to other parts of your body . Relieve cancer symptoms. When cancer doesn't have a cure, radiation therapy can ease pain .Neoadjuvant radiation Radiation therapy used before other treatments is called neoadjuvant radiation . For example, radiation therapy can be used to make a tumor smaller before surgery when used with chemotherapy . Adjuvant radiation Radiation therapy used after other treatments is called adjuvant radiation . Radiation therapy can be used to kill cancer cells that stayed in the body or spread, or to help prevent cancer from returning . 34How's Radiation Therapy Given?Radiation TherapyRadiation therapy can be given 2 ways\u2014through an external beam or internally . For some people, the treatment plan may include both . External beam radiation External beam radiation is the most common form of radiation therapy . External beam radiation is given by a large machine that directs the radiation beams to a specific part of your body . The machine moves around your body but doesn't touch you . Preparing to start external beam radiation Before your first radiation therapy session, you'll meet with your care team for a medical exam and an information session . Ask any questions you have about radiation therapy and side effects . You'll also have an appointment to prepare for your treatment . At this appointment, sometimes called a simulation or marking session , your care team will find out where to target the radiation and complete a treatment schedule . The location for radiation may be marked on your body with a small tattoo or colored ink . These marks are how the radiation therapist targets the radiation at the correct place in your body . Sometimes, a mask is made to help prevent your head and neck from moving during treatments, if your head or neck, or both, are being treated . Sometimes, other molds are made to prevent your body from moving during treatment .Frequency of external beam radiation Radiation therapy usually is given 1 time a day, 5 days a week, Monday through Friday . Radiation therapy isn't given on Saturday, Sunday or holidays, except for emergencies . The number of weeks you have radiation therapy depends on your treatment plan . Your course of treatment depends on many factors that your care team will discuss with you . Stereotactic radiation therapy A form of external beam radiation therapy is called stereotactic radiation therapy . This treatment uses focused radiation beams to target a well-defined tumor and deliver the radiation with extreme accuracy . The 2 types of stereotactic radiation are: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). SRS can deliver precisely targeted radiation treatments to the brain in fewer high-dose treatments than traditional radiation therapy . Fewer treatments can help preserve healthy tissue . Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) . In SBRT, the precisely targeted radiation treatments are delivered within the body, except for the brain .35 Radiation TherapyWeekly visits with your doctor At least 1 time a week, you'll meet with your doctor and nurse in an exam room to discuss your treatment . Be sure to ask questions or discuss concerns you may have . Between weekly visits, feel free to talk with us about your treatments or ask questions regarding any side effects . Report any concerns to your radiation therapist or nurse . Lab work Your doctor may order lab work (blood counts) for you as needed . Let your nurse know if you're having your blood drawn at another clinic so we don't repeat the test . Let us know if you have a port or other central line, as we need to schedule your blood draw in the IV therapy area . Internal radiation Internal radiation is a cancer treatment where the source of radiation is placed inside your body . Unlike external beam radiation, internal radiation doesn't use radiation beams, such as X-rays, to direct radiation to the cancer cells . The radiation source is radioactive seeds . Preparing to start internal radiation Before the internal radiation is placed in your body, you'll meet with your care team for a medical exam and an information session . Ask any questions you have about internal radiation therapy, side effects and preparation for the procedure .Placement of internal radiation Internal radiation is placed in your body using a small, soft tube called a catheter or a larger piece of equipment called an applicator . After the catheter or applicator is in your body, the internal radiation source is inserted . Brachytherapy A form of internal radiation is called brachytherapy . In brachytherapy, radioactive material is placed as close as possible to the cancer cells . This limits the dose of radiation to a small part of the body so the radiation harms as few normal cells as possible . The different types of brachytherapy are: High-dose rate (HDR) implants. In HDR brachytherapy, a precise dosage of radiation is delivered through an applicator positioned within your body . After your treatment, the radioactive source is removed . You can do HDR brachytherapy as an outpatient, so you don't have to stay in the hospital overnight . The treatment can be delivered in a few minutes . Usually, side effects and recovery time are minimal . Permanent implants. A permanent implant stays in your body forever . The catheter is removed after the radiation source is in your body . The radiation decreases the longer it's in your body . Eventually, most of the radiation goes away . Your care team will discuss specific precautions to take while the radiation is most active . 36What's Chemotherapy?Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses medicine to kill fast-growing cancer cells . The medicine travels through your blood to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells . Choosing chemotherapy You and your care team will decide whether chemotherapy is part of your treatment plan . Chemotherapy may be given by IV or by pill . Chemotherapy may be used as your only treatment to cure or control cancer . Chemotherapy may be used in combination with other treatments, such as radiation therapy or surgery . Finding out the amount and duration of chemotherapy When your care team selects chemotherapy for your treatment, they also take into consideration your health history, including whether you've had chemotherapy before or have other health issues . The amount and the duration of your chemotherapy depend on several factors: Other medicines you currently take Your type, stage and grade of cancer Goals of treatment\u2014cure cancer, control its growth or relieve cancer symptoms Chemotherapy can be used to: Cure cancer. The medicines can kill the cancer cells and stop cancer from growing back . Control cancer . The medicines can slow the growth of cancer . Relieve cancer symptoms . The medicines help ease symptoms when the cancer can't be cured .37How Can Chemotherapy Be Used in My Treatment Plan? Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses many different medicines to treat cancer . Your treatment plan for chemotherapy might involve one medicine or a combination of medicines . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chemotherapy used before other treatments . For example, chemotherapy may be used to make a tumor smaller before doing surgery to remove the tumor . Adjuvant chemotherapy Adjuvant chemotherapy is chemotherapy used after other treatments . For example, chemotherapy may be used after radiation treatment to kill remaining cancer cells or cancer cells that have spread elsewhere in the body . Adjuvant chemotherapy helps prevent cancer from returning .Taking other medicines during chemotherapy Before and during chemotherapy, be sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist about each medicine you're taking or if you're going to start taking any new medicine, including: Prescriptions Over-the-counter medicines Vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Given? Methods of giving chemotherapy Method Description Port-a-cath (IV) A port is a small, round disc . A port can be made of metal or plastic . The port stays in your body just under the skin . The port connects to a catheter in a large vein, usually in your chest . The port may be used to give IV medicine or to draw blood . A needle is needed to use the port . Central line (IV) A small, soft tube stays in your body throughout your cancer treatment . Medicines can be given through the line, and blood can be drawn . A central line is placed in a large, central vein, usually in your chest or upper arm . IV catheter An IV catheter is a small, soft tube that's placed in your arm . Medicines can be given through the catheter . The catheter is removed after each day of treatment . Pill or liquid Certain chemotherapies are taken by mouth (orally) . Not all chemotherapy medicines can be taken orally . Some chemotherapy, including many targeted therapy medicines, can be given only orally . Your care team will provide you with instructions on how to take your medicine . Injection Medicines are injected with a needle (a shot), either into a muscle (intramuscular) in your arm, thigh or hip, or right under the skin (subcutaneous) in your arm, leg or stomach . Intraperitoneal (IP) Medicines are given directly into a space in your abdomen called the peritoneal cavity by using a catheter or port . Intrathecal (IT) Medicines are injected through a needle into the spinal cord .

Having a treatment that makes you feel worse instead of better can be frustrating and discouraging . But try not to let side effects keep you from following your treatment plan . Talk to your care team about managing your side effects . Side effects and effectiveness of treatment Generally, side effects have no relationship to how well the radiation treatment is working . Your experience with side effects depends on the medicine you take, other cancer treatments, your body's response to treatment and the area of your body being treated . Common side effects Two of the most common side effects are skin changes and fatigue . You may experience these side effects or others . Some people have no side effects or very few . Managing side effects Usually, you can manage short-term side effects with help from your care team . The side effects you may have depend on the area of your body receiving radiation therapy . Your care team will give you a handout with information about the specific side effects you're most likely to have and recommendations for how to manage them . Most side effects are temporary Usually, most side effects end about 2 months after radiation therapy is over . But you may experience long-term side effects . See Pages 103 to 106 for information about long- term side effects, such as infertility or lymphedema . Be sure to talk with your care team about the possible long-term side effects of radiation therapy .Common Side Effects of Radiation TherapyRadiation Therapy45 Radiation TherapyFatigue Many people continue to work and participate in daily activities during external radiation therapy . During your course of treatments, you may experience a mild to moderate loss of energy . Fatigue is more than being tired . Fatigue is a feeling of exhaustion or lack of energy . Rest may not help fully relieve fatigue . Your legs may ache during regular activities . You may not be able to complete some of your regular routines . Fatigue affects everyone differently . What to do Go to bed at night and get up in the morning at the same time every day . Sleep for at least 8 hours a night . Take shorter naps instead of longer naps . Rest as needed during the day but try to avoid sleeping later in the day so you're more likely to sleep through the night . Schedule regular rest periods . Do light physical activity, such as walking, that restores or increases your energy . Eat small, healthy meals and drink lots of water .Skin changes Your skin will begin to change about 2 to 3 weeks after your first radiation treatment . Skin changes occur with all types of external radiation therapy . During radiation therapy, your skin cells are exposed to radiation on a daily basis . The skin cells may die, and they can't grow fast enough between treatments . Radiation therapy can cause your skin to be red, itchy, dry, peeling or swollen . Your skin may also become moist . This happens if the radiation kills skin cells that peel off before other skin can grow . What to do Do not use hot tubs, heating pads, hot water bottles, compresses or ice packs or anything else that's very hot or very cold on your skin . Take a short, cool shower or lukewarm bath instead of a hot, long bath . You can also take a sponge bath . Do not use any lotions, oils, powders, ointments, medicines or bandages in the treatment area until you discuss the treatment with your care team . If your skin becomes irritated, ask your doctor for a recommendation for a moisturizer, cream or lotion for your skin . Do not apply any creams for 4 hours before coming in for your treatment . Your skin must be free of all skin care products when you're treated .46 Do not use a razor in the treatment area . If you need to shave, try an electric shaver . Wear loose-fitting clothes that allow your skin to breathe . Do not wear anything too tight, like tight jeans, tights, pantyhose or other tight clothes . If you're receiving radiation therapy in your pelvic area, you may feel more comfortable wearing only a bathrobe with no underwear when you're at home . \u00bbFor men, wear cotton boxer shorts instead of jockey shorts . \u00bbFor women, wear cotton underwear . Avoid girdles or shapers . Appetite changes Many people lose their appetite during radiation therapy, due to nausea, pain or depression . Getting good nutrition, even when you don't feel like eating, is important so you remain strong and avoid losing weight . Let your care team know if you're having trouble swallowing or eating, weight loss (more than 5 to 10 pounds in a month), pain, nausea or vomiting . What to do Eat small snacks or meals 5 to 6 times a day . Eat foods high in protein and calories, such as: \u00bbSoups (creamy, bean, split pea and lentil) \u00bbMeat, chicken, fish, eggs, peanut butter, nuts and seeds \u00bbYogurt, cottage cheese and cheese \u00bbMuffins, croissants and crackers \u00bbButter, cream cheese, sour cream and gravy \u00bbFruit \u00bbMilkshakes or ice cream \u00bbWhole milk, juice and meal replacement drinks Do physical activity before eating to increase your appetite . Make eating enjoyable . Eat with friends or try a new recipe . If your mouth is dry: \u00bbDrink more water . \u00bbDo not use toothpaste or mouthwash with alcohol . For more about dry mouth, see Page 55 .Radiation Therapy47 Chemotherapy Chemotherapy often causes side effects that interfere with daily life . If you're having side effects from a medicine, talk with your oncologist . Your doctor may be able to give you medicines to manage your side effects or may find a different medicine to try . Chemotherapy targets your body's fast-growing cancer cells . Unfortunately, chemotherapy may also affect other fast-growing healthy cells in your body, such as those that make your hair grow and keep your mouth and intestines healthy . The loss of these healthy cells causes side effects . Side effects and effectiveness of treatment Generally, side effects aren't a sign of how well your chemotherapy treatment is working . Your experience with side effects depends on the medicine you take and your body's response .Most side effects are temporary Most side effects usually end when your chemotherapy ends . However, you may experience long-term side effects . See Pages 103 to 106 for information about long- term side effects, such as infertility or organ damage . Talk with your care team about the possible long-term side effects of your chemotherapy . Possible side effects The most common side effects of chemotherapy vary based on the medicine taken . Some people have no side effects or very few . Talk to your care team about the side effects you may experience . Usually, you and your care team can manage short-term side effects . The following section reviews possible side effects and recommendations for how to manage them .Common Side Effects of Chemotherapy48Home safety during chemotherapy Hugging, kissing and being around your friends, family and children are safe to do during chemotherapy . For 48 hours after a chemotherapy treatment, follow these guidelines to protect yourself and your caregivers: Sit down on the toilet . After using the toilet, close the lid and flush 2 times . Wash your hands well with soap and water . Wear gloves when you or your caregiver clean up spilled waste material, such as urine, stool, vomit, semen or vaginal secretions . Wash hands before and after taking the gloves off . Wash linens separately that have any waste material, such as urine, stool or vomit . Use condoms during oral sex or intercourse .Side effect Page Anemia 49 Appetite changes 49 Bleeding 50 Changes in smell and taste 50 Constipation 51 Diarrhea 52 Fatigue 52 Hair loss 53 Infection 54 Mood changes 55 Mouth and throat sores 55 Nail changes 56 Nausea and vomiting 57 Numbness and tingling 57 Pain 58 Sexual changes 59 Skin changes 60 Sleep problems 60Chemotherapy49 ChemotherapyAnemia Anemia is caused by a low red blood cell count . Red blood cells bring oxygen and nutrients from your lungs to the rest of your body . When you don't have enough red blood cells, your body doesn't have enough oxygen to work as well as it usually does . You may feel tired, dizzy, faint, out of breath or cold . You also may have headaches, a rapid heartbeat and pale skin . Throughout chemotherapy treatment, your care team checks your red blood cell count . Depending on the results of your tests, you may need a blood transfusion (a procedure that transfers blood or blood products into your blood stream) . What to do Call your care team if: \u00bbYou can't catch your breath . \u00bbYou feel dizzy or as if you're going to faint . \u00bbYour heart is pounding or beating very fast . Get enough sleep . Aim for at least 8 hours a night . Rest in between activities or consider skipping some activities . Stop any activity that increases your heart rate significantly (heart feels as if it's pounding) or when you can't catch your breath . Ask for and accept help when people offer . Appetite changes Many people lose their appetite during chemotherapy . Getting good nutrition, even when you don't feel like eating, is important so you remain strong and avoid losing muscle mass and unwanted weight loss . Let your care team know if you have trouble swallowing or eating, weight loss or weight gain (more than 5 to 10 pounds in a month), pain, nausea or vomiting . What to do if appetite decreases Do physical activity before eating to increase your appetite . Eat small snacks or meals 5 to 6 times a day .

Studies show that it can help some people sleep better, feel less anxious and bring their blood pressure down . And it has been shown to help some people live and cope better with certain health problems, such as heart disease, depression, chronic pain or cancer . What does it mean to be mindful? When you're mindful, you pay attention to and accept the thoughts and experiences you're having right now\u2014in the present moment . Some people call it a time for quiet reflection, prayer or meditation . Whatever name you use is fine, because this is your experience\u2014no one else's . To be mindful is to pay attention, to be present and to be accepting . When you're mindful, you do just one thing and you pay close attention to that one thing .For example, you may sit quietly and notice your emotions or how your food tastes and smells . When you're present, you focus on the things that are happening right now . You let go of your thoughts about the past and the future . And to be accepting means not to judge the present moment, but to just accept your thoughts and feelings as they come\u2014without getting caught up in them . When you accept all moments (the good, the bad and the scary ones) they become just that: moments . We live in a world full of demands and changes, but it's possible to find a sense of calmness and peace in the midst of it all . Mindfulness: It may be just the thing you never knew you needed .62Relaxation exercises Practice these exercises to relax before, during and after your treatment .

You may want to repeat each statement 2 to 3 times . 3 . Open your eyes and then slowly move your hands, arms, legs and feet . Gently turn your head from side to side . If it feels good, stretch your arms and legs . Prepare to go on with the rest of your day with a renewed sense of comfort and peace . Guided imagery Guided imagery exercise: Peaceful place Another effective relaxation technique is to imagine yourself in a comfortable and relaxing place . This could be a place that you've been before, or it could be a beautiful place that you create in your imagination . Your place may be found outside in nature, or a cozy and comfortable place inside where you can relax fully . Some examples are:63 Sitting by a lake or ocean . Lying on a beach in the warm sunshine . Going for a walk in the woods . Being at your favorite vacation spot . Sitting by a fireplace or in your favorite chair . Being present in a place of worship or beauty . Once you decide on a place that might feel relaxing for you today, try these steps to let yourself relax and fully settle in to this place: Put on some soft, relaxing music . Some people like to listen to music with nature sounds that fit the place they've selected . Either close your eyes, or keep them open and look at a picture of a place that's similar to the one you've selected . Take some deep breaths, and allow yourself to begin to relax as you imagine yourself in this place . Take time to go through all of the senses to let yourself settle fully in to this place . \u00bbImagine looking around you in this place . What sights, colors, landscape objects do you notice? \u00bbTake a moment to listen to the sounds of this place . Do you hear the breeze, birds, waves, a crackling fire, laughter or some beautiful music? \u00bbTake some more deep breaths . Can you smell the fresh air, flowers, woods or other scents of this place? \u00bbNotice if there are tastes associated with this place: a refreshing drink of water or lemonade, a favorite food . \u00bbAllow your body to relax and notice any sensations . Can you feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, or a gentle breeze blowing across your face? Feel your whole body becoming even more relaxed in this place . You may want to go through a body relaxation as you imagine yourself in this place . See page 62 . \u00bbNotice how it feels to be in this place . You may experience some of these feelings: relaxed, comfortable, peaceful, gratitude, connection or contentment . Perhaps this place may have qualities to help you focus on healing or hope: Is it a place that brings you energy or much needed comfort? Is there a quality in this place that can help you get through the rest of your day? When you're ready, very slowly, take a few more deep breaths, then bring this guided imagery experience to a close . Wiggle your fingers and stretch your arms and legs as you feel your attention returning to the room . Know that you can return to this place in your imagination any time you need a sense of peacefulness, relaxation, healing or hope cancer, diet and physical activity are related . It also explains what a healthy diet is and how to evaluate nutrition information . During different parts of your treatment, you may change what you eat, which is appropriate .

Some of the most widely known nutritional therapies consist of dietary supplements, including antioxidant supplements and phytochemical supplements . Others involve following specific diets or eating patterns . An RDN is specially trained in assessing what eating patterns are most appropriate for you based on your type of cancer and treatment . RDNs use evidence- based information backed by scientific research to help guide you to the most effective and safe nutrition recommendations . Our dietitian is here to answer your questions on dietary patterns, such as: Plant-based eating . Anti-inflammatory eating . Mediterranean Gluten-free diet . Various cancer-specific diets . Dietary supplements Some people believe taking high doses of vitamin, mineral or herbal supplements will destroy cancer cells . However, no evidence exists that any nutritional supplements, even in high doses, can provide the same benefits as a well-balanced, healthy diet . In fact, some vitamins and herbal compounds are harmful at high levels and may increase cancer in some people . Use only moderate doses, if at all, of supplements . A multivitamin and mineral supplement that doesn't exceed the recommended Daily Value (DV) may be helpful if you can't eat enough to obtain these nutrients . Antioxidant supplements People disagree about using antioxidant supplements during treatment . These supplements have special chemicals some people believe can prevent cancer . More research is needed to see whether these supplements are safe to use during treatment . Phytochemical supplements Taking a phytochemical supplement isn't recommended . Eating foods that contain phytochemicals is part of a healthy diet . Scientists have identified hundreds of phytochemicals in foods . Each phytochemical may have a unique role in protecting the body against cancer . However, experts believe various phytochemicals and other food components act together to reduce cancer risk . 71Nutrition claims New claims about nutritional treatments and cures for cancer are everywhere . Learning to evaluate this type of information is important . Keep these points in mind: Understand that \"natural\" doesn't necessarily mean safe . Even natural substances can be harmful at high levels . \u00bbNatural substances may also negatively affect some medicines or other treatments you may be taking . Be aware that the federal government doesn't test dietary supplements for safety or approve them for sale . Evaluate nutrition information only from trusted medical or health-related sources . Have a qualified health professional review any treatment you choose to follow . Watch out for scams about nutrition treatments . Some people claim the medical community is trying to keep their cure from the public . No one committed to finding better ways to treat a disease, however, would knowingly keep people from using an effective treatment . Be cautious about people who claim their treatment has a \"secret formula\" or is a \"quick fix,\" \"miracle cure\" or \"breakthrough .\" Scientists who believe they have developed an effective treatment publish their results in respected medical journals . Remember, if the claim sounds too good to be true, it probably is . For more information, visit www.oncologynutrition.org/on/erfc/healthy- nutrition-now/foods/Exposure to chemicals in food Many people are concerned about their exposure to environmental chemicals, both in our food and in food containers . Scientists don't know whether these chemicals are bad for our health . But many scientists recommend taking a preventive approach and limiting your exposure, when possible . To limit your exposure to food pesticides, try organic products when buying the following: Apples Celery Cherry tomatoes Collard greens Cucumbers Grapes Hot peppers Kale Nectarines Peaches Potatoes Snap peas Spinach Strawberries Sweet bell peppers Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates are common chemicals used in plastic bottles, storage containers, food wrap and food cans . Scientists don't know whether these chemicals affect health . 72Try the following ideas if you choose to limit your exposure to the chemicals found in plastics: Prepare food from scratch whenever possible . Choose minimally processed foods . Store foods in nonplastic containers, such as glass . Avoid heating foods in plastic containers or dishes . Use a glass or porcelain dish to heat food . Don't microwave or heat plastic food wrap . Don't place plastics in the dishwasher . Avoid plastics with the recycling codes 3 (contains phthalates), 6 and 7 (contains BPA) . Avoid canned foods when possible . BPA may be used in can linings . Look for labels on products that say \"phthalate-free\" or \"BPA-free .\" Don't leave plastic water bottles in warm places, such as your car on a hot day .Websites American Cancer Society cancer .org/treatment/ survivorshipduringandaftertreatment/ nutritionforpeoplewithcancer/index Information about nutrition during and after cancer treatment .

Tobacco is the main cause of lung cancer and also plays a role in other types of cancer . If you use tobacco, talk to your doctor about ways to quit . Stop smoking for life You probably already know why you want to stop smoking cigarettes . Maybe you've quit before, only to start again . Did you know it's common to attempt quitting several times before succeeding? Overcoming the chains of nicotine isn't easy . You're battling against the most addictive substance legally available . But with determination and a plan, you can stop smoking for life . Smoking is an addiction . Seconds after you inhale tobacco smoke, nicotine travels to the brain, telling it to release chemicals to make you want to smoke more . Over time, your body gets used to the nicotine . When you try to cut back on the number of cigarettes or quit, the absence of nicotine leads to withdrawal symptoms and cravings . Smoking prevents your body from having withdrawal symptoms .Identifying your triggers Your smoking behavior is as unique as you are . Therefore, your quitting plan should be designed individually for you . Begin by identifying the times and situations that make it difficult for you to avoid smoking . These times and situations are referred to as your triggers . For about a week, smoke as you normally would, doing your usual activities . Be aware of every cigarette . Even if you think you know your triggers already, write them down . The results may surprise you . For every cigarette you have, ask yourself the following questions and write down your answers in a journal . What's the date and time? How did I feel before smoking? Where am I? What am I doing? Who am I with? Why did I smoke? How did I feel after smoking? Be honest . Answers may repeat . When you have enough information to identify your triggers, review what you've written . Form your plan for avoiding the habitual traps in your life . Carefully choose a date at least a week away as your quitting day . Give yourself the best chance for success by picking a day with the fewest triggers .Quitting Smoking and Nicotine75Getting ready Mark your calendar, tell your family and friends . Make your quitting day an official declaration . One week before quitting day, begin lowering your nicotine intake . Go gradually . Journaling about what you're doing may be helpful . By the last day of the week, smoke 7 or fewer cigarettes . Here are some tips for cutting down: Get rid of all the cigarettes you identified in your journal as \"smoked for no reason .\" Smoke only half of the rest . Look for ways to avoid your triggers and find acceptable substitutions for your smoking time . Each day, postpone your first cigarette by 1 hour . Try drinking milk, which many people consider incompatible with smoking . Buy only 1 pack of cigarettes at a time . Empty your ashtrays into 1 large glass container, so you can see the accumulation of butts . Put your lighter and cigarettes out of reach . Focus on the cigarette, not the activity, and think about why you want to quit . Alter habits to make them less pleasurable\u2014 For example, if you like smoking with others, smoke alone instead . Reduce the amount of coffee, tea and other products that contain caffeine in your diet . Caffeine may trigger the urge to smoke .Medical support Research shows that counseling combined with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) increase your chance to overcome nicotine addiction . NRT often helps ease many of the physical symptoms of withdrawal . Your clinician can recommend an NRT, such as nicotine gum, lozenges, or a patch, spray or inhaler . Prescription medicine is another option . Varenicline (Chantix) is a medicine that was developed specifically to decrease the urge to smoke and help people stop smoking . Bupropion SR (Zyban), an antidepressant, also can be helpful for some people . Overcoming withdrawal Symptom Treatment Dry mouth, sore throatSip ice water or fruit juice, and chew gum . Headaches Take a warm bath . Trouble sleeping, irritabilityPractice relaxation techniques, such as listening to soft music . Constipation Eat more fruits and vegetables, and drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day . Fatigue Don't push yourself . Sleep and let your body heal . Coughing Drink herbal tea, and use cough drops and hard candies .76Staying nicotine free You made the commitment to stop smoking and, as with other habits, changing behaviors can take time . If you get urges, pull out your journal and read your story of success . Go for a walk or try another form of exercise . Remember how tough the beginning was . Resolve not to put yourself through that again . Journal each temptation and how you coped with the urge to smoke . Build up coping strategies should the urge to smoke return . Reflect upon the joys of being a nonsmoker: Better health Clearer breathing No hacking cough A refreshingly new sense of smell and taste The high levels of carbon monoxide and nicotine in your body rapidly decline when you stop smoking . You're free from the mess, smelly clothing, dirty ashtrays, expense, inconvenience and dependence caused by cigarettes .E-cigarettes Many people think e-cigarettes are a safe alternative to smoking . But recent studies suggest that using e-cigarettes isn't without risk . The water vapor released can expose both the user and those around the user to harmful chemicals that can cause cancer . Some research has found that using e-cigarettes can affect blood pressure and heart rate as much as smoking cigarettes . Even e-cigarettes without nicotine may not be harmless . Other research has shown that some e-cigarette flavors contain toxic substances . Visit cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_ information/e-cigarettes/index.htm for more information about e-cigarettes .77Resources Everyone in Minnesota has access to free phone support to quit tobacco\u2014either through individual health insurance plans or through other services .

Also, when you're staying in the hospital, ask your care team about safe options for staying active while in the hospital . Signs of doing too much exercise Pay close attention to your body's signals as you exercise . Your body will warn you if you're doing too much, which is called overexertion . Signs and symptoms of overexertion are your body's way of letting you know you're doing more than your body can tolerate .If you experience any of the following signs or symptoms of overexertion during physical activity, slow down to a stop and talk to your care team as soon as possible : Lightheaded or dizzy Nausea or vomiting Shortness of breath and difficulty breathing Cold, clammy sweat Unexplained anxiety, weakness or fatigue Pain or discomfort, pressure, aching, burning, squeezing, tightness, heaviness or fullness in your chest, neck, upper back or arms Change in heart rhythm\u2014rapid or irregular heart rate (palpitations) Call 911 if you experience life-threatening symptoms.Staying Physically Active If you feel too weak for your daily tasks or you want to work with a physical therapist to start an exercise program, talk to your care team about a referral to the cancer rehabilitation services . See Pages 9 to 10 for more information .79Types of physical activity All types of physical activity are beneficial . Since people respond differently to cancer treatments, choose physical activities to fit your situation . Types of physical activity that may work for you are: Endurance activities . Steady, rhythmic and Examples include: \u00bbWeightlifting \u00bbResistance bands Stretching activities . muscles . Examples include: \u00bbYoga \u00bbTai chiStarting an endurance activity program If you're not physically active, begin with low- intensity exercise, such as walking slowly or riding a stationary bike with low resistance . Gradually increase activity over time . Below is an example for slowly increasing your activity time . Walk for the time shown in the table, or try another endurance activity . LevelHow many minutes to walkHow many times a day 1 3 to 5 4 2 7 3 3 10 2 4 15 2 5 20 1 6 25 1 7 30 1 When your effort feels lighter, move to the next level . Staying at the same level for multiple days before moving to the next level is normal . Work your way through all these levels, but listen to your body and advance your duration (how long you walk) as you're able . If you're in treatment, you may need to move down a level based on how you feel . With endurance activities, increase your duration before intensity . After you can do 30 minutes of continuous activity, then start to increase your intensity, such as a higher speed, steeper grade or more resistance .\"When I woke up in the morning, I went walking. I walked for 10 minutes and then built up to longer walks. That little bit was sometimes all I could manage, but I knew I had to walk. \" \u2014 Karen, a cancer survivor80Notes81 ResourcesAdvance Care Planning: Prepare for can help you understand and plan for a time when you're unable to make your own medical decisions . It allows you to make your voice heard so your wishes are followed . Even if you feel close to loved ones, they may not know what you want for future medical care . You can provide clarity and understanding among family members and your doctor and health care team . Advance care planning involves these important steps: Choose a health care agent . This person makes health care decisions for you if you're unable to make decisions for yourself . Engage in conversations . Discuss your values and wishes about future health care with your health care agent, doctor and other important people in your life . Complete a Health Care Directive . This is a written plan for your future medical treatments and to identify someone to communicate your wishes if you're unable to do so .Advance Care Planning: Prepare for Your Future Medical Decisions Start planning now Advance care planning for future health care choices is important to do while you're healthy and able to make your own decisions . We recommend adults 18 and older start the advance care planning process . Review and update your Health Care Directive whenever you want or when you have a significant change in health status or life circumstances . Before creating a Health Care Directive, think about what matters most to you . There are no right or wrong answers . Begin by asking the following: Whom do I trust to make decisions for me if I can no longer make my own health care decisions? What are my values and beliefs about life and death, and quality of life? What do I need my doctor to know about me? If you don't have a written Health Care Directive, you'll still receive medical treatment . Your care team will listen to what people close to you say about your treatment wishes .84The POLST form Provider Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) is a signed medical order that communicates your health care wishes to health care providers during an emergency . How does a POLST differ from a Health Care Directive? A Health Care Directive is a document you sign that communicates your wishes should you be unable to make independent health care decisions . Health Care Directives are recommended for all adults regardless of health status . A POLST translates the wishes documented in a Health Care Directive into medical orders that your doctor reviews and signs . Emergency responders must have medical orders to carry out these specific health care wishes in an emergency . Who should have a POLST form? People with serious health conditions who need to make decisions about life-sustaining treatments in advance of medical emergencies . Even if you have a Health Care Directive, a POLST is important for providing greater detail in an emergency . Where is a POLST form stored? A POLST form is intended to travel with you between care settings, including your home, long-term care facility or hospital . Keep the POLST form where emergency responders can easily find it . Also keep a copy in your electronic medical record .Resources For more information about advance care planning, use the following resources: HealthPartners For forms and information, visit healthpartners .com and type \"health care directive\" in the search box .

Survivorship has 3 stages: 1. Diagnosis and treatment . The 1st stage of survivorship refers to living with cancer . This stage includes receiving your diagnosis and treatment for cancer . 2. Right after treatment . As soon as your treatment ends, you begin living through cancer, the 2nd stage of survivorship . You still see your doctors from your diagnosis and treatment stage, but you transition into seeing them for follow-up care instead of regular treatments . 3. Long-term survivorship . Living beyond cancer is long-term survivorship and usually is measured in years . During this stage, you probably will return to seeing your primary care clinician and will have a long-term plan for your health . We think of a survivor as anyone who's diagnosed and living with cancer, from the time of diagnosis, through treatment and after treatment . What's Survivorship? Some people think survivor is used only if cancer is cured . They may not like to use the term . Your survivorship journey is unique to you . You and your family will move through the journey in your own way . Survivorship issues for all 3 stages include health care concerns, as well as emotional, spiritual, physical and nutritional issues . Cancer survivors may find hope and support in sometimes unexpected areas\u2014a stronger appreciation and recognition of your loved ones and your life priorities . We're here to support you in staying as healthy and as active as possible . Please ask any questions and talk to us about your concerns . Let us know how we can help you, as a cancer survivor, live life to the fullest .100When treatment ends, many people experience the most challenging emotional ups and downs . People often need more support than they thought after their treatment ends . You may also have some unanticipated physical side effects and practical concerns . Completing treatment and having less contact with your care team can also be a source of anxiety . You may find you miss the familiarity of frequently visiting the clinic for treatments . Getting back to your previous responsibilities, while at the same time living with uncertainty and worrying about your health, can be a challenge . For many people, this change leads to 2 to 3 months of emotional ups and downs . Few people expect this phase . Family and friends may be celebrating the end of your treatment and often don't understand the emotional issues with survivorship . They think survivors should feel happy . Delayed reactions Once treatment is completed, you may realize you've been putting all of your energy into getting through it . You may now find yourself focusing that energy on recovering emotionally from your cancer . Feeling a rush of unexpected emotions when your treatment ends is normal . You may feel angry, tense or sad . You also may be trying to find the meaning of this experience in your life and feel excited about the future . For most people, feelings of anger or sadness go away or get better over time . For up to 1 in 4 people, though, these emotions can become severe . If you find feelings of sadness worsening, talk to your doctor . If your doctor finds you suffer from anxiety or depression, your doctor may treat you or refer you to other experts . Emotional Experience after Treatment101When treatment ends Be gentle with yourself . You're enough . Feel whatever you feel . No feelings \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" be felt . Others may have expectations about how you \"should\" be feeling . Stick with what's true for you and find the support you need . What you're scared of may not be true . Fear may go away when it's named . Fear may grow if it's hidden or not talked about . Give yourself time to heal, recover and respond . You've been through a lot . Recovery has more than one right path . Don't judge yourself or your reactions . If you're worried you're depressed or having anxiety, talk to your doctor . Ask for help if you're not sure .Managing uncertainty Worrying about cancer coming back is one of the most common fears people have after completing treatment . You may feel even more anxious as the dates of regular follow-up appointments and tests get closer . Fear is normal, especially during the first year after treatment . Fear that overwhelms you and causes you to feel immobilized or paralyzed isn't normal . Talk about these feelings with your doctor to develop a plan of care . As time passes, many survivors report their fear of cancer coming back decreases . They find themselves thinking about their cancer less often . Try to determine what triggers your anxiety . Talking with friends, support groups and counselors can be helpful in identifying what makes you anxious . Medicines After cancer treatment, you may need to use medicines for sleep, anxiety or depression . Also, people with an episode of major depression at any time before cancer treatment are very likely to have another episode now . We recommend seeing the psychiatrist you worked with before your cancer diagnosis to review your medicines .102A balanced approach Survivors often feel the need to understand what having cancer means to their life now . You may reflect on spirituality, the purpose of life or what you value most . Finding ways to relax, being active and managing what you can often help survivors ease anxiety and uncertainty . The following suggestions might help you cope with emotional distress: Be aware of your feelings and find ways to express unpleasant or difficult feelings in a healthy way . Accept your feelings and be willing to work through your emotions . Get support from others who are willing to listen to and accept you without trying to \"fix\" you . Express a wide range of both positive and negative emotions . Survivors who do this usually adjust well . Write down your thoughts and feelings . Keeping a journal can provide a safe outlet for your emotions and help you sort through your thoughts and feelings .103Understanding the Long-Term Side Effects of Cancer Treatment Most side effects from cancer treatment go away when treatment ends . However, some treatment may result in long-term side effects, such as infertility, organ or nerve damage, or development of a different type of cancer . You may or may not have these side effects . Talk to your care team to understand what long-term side effects you're at risk for and develop a plan to watch for symptoms . Some long-term side effects are more common after chemotherapy or radiation therapy . Fatigue Cancer treatment can cause fatigue after treatment ends . Some people have fatigue for months after chemotherapy . Some ideas on dealing with fatigue include staying physically active, eating healthy and resting when you need to . Brain changes Radiation therapy to the brain may result in fatigue, slowed thinking and loss of short-term memory . These problems often are more noticeable after whole-brain radiation than after targeted radiation . Getting enough sleep, pacing activities, and taking a rest or short nap in the afternoon can help . Also, do one activity at a time rather than multitasking . Avoid loud or overstimulating environments . If these problems continue for more than 1 month after radiation is over, let your care team know . Further evaluation and treatment can help, such as medicine or cognitive rehabilitation (relearning cognitive skills) . Thinking problems Thinking problems, or \"chemo brain,\" affects many people after chemotherapy ends . Chemo brain may affect your thinking, including attention span and memory . Fortunately, chemo brain is usually a mild condition, improves with time and doesn't lead to dementia . Writing notes and to-do lists can help keep you organized . Research shows chemo brain usually lasts only a few months to a few years at most . If your thinking problems get worse over time, chemo brain isn't the cause . Let your care team know . You may need help for other causes of thinking problems, such as depression . 104Organ damage Chemotherapy can cause permanent damage to organs and organ systems, such as your heart or lungs . If the organ damage is diagnosed during treatment, your care team can change medicines . But organ damage may not be diagnosed until after chemotherapy . Your care team will discuss follow-up care and any further screening tests to have . Nerve damage Long-term as well as short-term nerve damage (see \"Numbness and tingling\" Page 57) can result from chemotherapy . Long-term side effects include hearing loss, ringing in your ears, memory loss and neuropathy . Your care team will discuss follow-up care and any further screening tests to have . Infertility Depending on the type of cancer you have and where the cancer is located, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may cause infertility . In women, cancer treatment can affect the ability to become pregnant or menstruate . Cancer treatment can damage ovaries and start early menopause, which leads to infertility . In men, cancer treatment can damage sperm cells, which can lead to infertility .Before starting treatment, talk to your doctor about how treatment may affect fertility and having children . If you want to start a family or plan on having more children, you have several options to consider: Adoption Donor sperm, embryos or eggs Surrogacy Sperm banking\u2014Men can bank their sperm before beginning cancer treatment . For more information, contact: \u00bbFairfax Cryobank 651-489-8000 cryolab .com Ovarian tissue banking or egg and embryo banking\u2014Women can bank their tissue before beginning cancer treatment . The banking process takes 4 to 6 weeks to complete . \u00bbReproductive Medicine and Infertility Associates 651-222-6050 rmia .com In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer\u2014This option involves retrieving an egg (ovum) from the woman, incubating it with sperm for 5 to 26 hours to develop into an embryo, and then transferring the embryo to the uterus for possible implantation . The in vitro process needs to take place before beginning cancer treatment . The following resource provides additional information about cancer treatment fertility: \u00bbThe Oncofertility Consortium\u2014 SaveMyFertility savemyfertility .org105Lymphedema (swelling) Lymphedema, occurs when a clear fluid known as lymphatic fluid builds up in the soft tissues of your body, usually an arm or leg . Your lymphatic system is an important part of your immune and circulatory systems . The lymphatic system consists of lymph vessels and lymph nodes . The system produces, stores and carries the white blood cells that fight infection and other diseases . The lymph vessels carry lymphatic fluid to your lymph nodes . Symptoms of lymphedema The symptoms of swelling in a portion or all of your arm or leg can range from barely noticeable to extreme . You may also experience a heavy, tight feeling in your arms or legs . Clothing or jewelry that normally fits may feel a little tight . Lots of swelling may make using your arm or leg difficult . Lymphedema can occur anytime from shortly after cancer treatment to many years later . Pain typically isn't an indicator of early lymphedema .Lymphedema Treatment Program Our Lymphedema Treatment Program offers multiple options for managing lymphedema . Your personalized care plan may include various treatments, including education, manual lymph drainage (MLD), bandaging, taping, exercise and compression garments . Medicine can't cure lymphedema . Our lymphedema therapists in Rehabilitation Services will work with you to evaluate your lymphedema and develop a plan of care that fits your individual lifestyle . Your therapist will ask about when your symptoms started, what symptoms you're experiencing and what activities are affected . Some ways to manage swelling are: Education. Education about lymphedema includes learning about the lymphatic system, signs of infection to recognize and techniques for doing MLD yourself . You also will learn how to modify activities to help decrease your lymphedema . You're at a higher risk for infection in the arm or leg with lymphedema, and will learn proper techniques to take care of your skin .106 Manual lymph drainage (MLD) . This special massage technique may help move the lymphatic fluid to decrease swelling . Because you have cancer\u2014or if you also have a blood clot, heart failure or a skin infection\u2014your lymphedema therapist may not recommend this option . Kinesio Taping. Kinesio Tape is a special type of tape that stretches with your arm or leg as you move . This tape helps decrease swelling by increasing the flow of lymphatic fluid in underlying muscles and vessels . Compression bandaging . Compression bandaging, which uses bandages with low stretch, helps move fluid out of the affected area . Bandages are worn in preparation for being fitted for a compression garment . Compression garments . Compression garments have long sleeves or stockings that apply pressure to your arm or leg . The compression prevents lymphatic fluid from building up . Some people may need a custom-made compression garment to ensure a proper fit . Your therapist will teach you how to take care of the garment and recommend a wearing time . Exercise . Exercises that involve gently moving your arm or leg help remove lymphatic fluids from the affected area . The exercise program also includes flexibility, strengthening and aerobic activities . Skin care . Keeping your affected arm or leg clean and watching for cuts and scrapes are important to prevent infection that could worsen your lymphedema .107Health and Wellness after Treatment Practicing healthy lifestyle habits will help you feel better every day and is an important step on the road to recovery . Also, healthy habits are important for cancer survivors to help reduce the risk of other health problems . Do not use tobacco or nicotine . Exercise and be active for at least 150 minutes every week . Your oncologist may refer you to cancer rehabilitation services, which includes physical therapy and occupational therapy . See Page 9 .
