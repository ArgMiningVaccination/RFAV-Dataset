Code: BIL Introduction The Department of Biology offers undergraduate programs for students interested in a natural science education that will prepare them for careers in medicine and other health-related fields, biological research, teaching, conservation and environmental management, and other fields that require a broad base of biological knowledge. Educational Objectives The Department of Biology trains students to understand and use the scientific method, and to engage in critical thinking and experimental design. We strongly encourage original laboratory and/or field research under the mentorship of biology faculty. The Bachelor of Science in Biology prepares the student for further training in natural science, such as graduate school in biology, as well as medical, veterinary, dental or other health-care professions. The Bachelor of Arts degree prepares the student for careers that may overlap with the social sciences and humanities, including teaching, science policy and environmental law. Degree Programs Two undergraduate degrees are available in Biology: the Bachelor of Science and the Bachelor of Arts. Both require a major in Biology consisting of 34 credit hours in BIL with a minimum grade of C- in each course and an overall GPA of 2.0. Additional course requirements for each degree are listed under Bachelor of Science and the Bachelor of Arts elsewhere in this Bulletin. Advanced placement, and in certain situations, course credit hours can be earned through the College Entrance Examination Board program, placement examinations, and departmental proficiency examinations. For Graduate programs, consult the Graduate School section of this Bulletin. Variations within the program described here may be permitted by the Department in special cases. Advanced Writing and Communication Requirement Degree candidates in the College of Arts and Sciences must complete at least four writing courses, and at least one such course must be in the student's major discipline. Candidates for the B.S. or B.A. degree in Biology should consult course listings to find writing-intensive courses in BIL. Writing credit on a per case basis may be available in other Biology electives. Interested students should ask the faculty instructor about this possibility. Transfer students may use a maximum of two transfer courses towards the writing requirement. Honors in Biology The Biology Department recognizes students who have achieved excellence in original research and coursework by awarding Honors in Biology. Biology Honors students work closely with faculty members first to design a research project and then conduct it for a minimum of two semesters. The centerpiece of the program is a written thesis that is submitted to the Biology Department, and presentation of the thesis research in a public forum. Students seeking research experience are welcome to contact individual faculty in Biology, or contact the Office of Undergraduate Research for help in finding research mentors. Contact the Director of the Biology Honors Program for more information on the application, the application deadlines, and the program. |Code||Title||Credit Hours| |Select a minimum of one |Complete a senior thesis, of superior quality, on the results of the research.| |Senior Thesis 2| |Select research colloquium:| |Research Colloquium 2| |An overall GPA of at least 3.3 and a biology GPA of at least 3.5.| - 1 Projects in Biology involve a research project carried out under the supervision of a member of the Department of Biology faculty or alternative faculty approved by the Office of Undergraduate Research. - 2 Senior Thesis (BIL 498) and Research Colloquium (BIL 499) are taken in the spring semester of the last year of study.
