It was greatly i mproved by the efforts of reviewers from State and Federal agencies, Don MacLean, the A quatic Nuisance Species Task Force, and the general public. The Mid-Atlantic Pan el on Aquatic Invasive Species importantly helped to inform the development of thi s Plan. 5 MARYLAND AQUATIC NUISANCE SPECIES MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY An aquatic nuisance species (ANS) is a non-native s pecies whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or h arm to human health. While many aquatic species may be introduced to a water body, very few become established, and fewer are regarded as ANS. In the Chesapeake Bay wa tershed, there are 120 introduced and established aquatic species (mostly fishes) lis ted by United States Geological Survey. Eighteen percent of these are regarded as ANS and t hreaten business in the State. Current initiatives to prevent future introductions and con trol the current spread of ANS include: Formation of the Maryland Department of Natural Res ources Invasive Species Matrix Team; Passing of laws and regulations restricting the pos session, use, or sale of nuisance species or gear that could result in the spread of those species; Development of Management Plans for targeted specie s by the Chesapeake Bay Program; Increased education awareness by working with K-12 schools and developing on- line websites; and, Incentives for controlling ANS with invasive specie s state records, raffles and contests by Maryland Department of Natural Resource s. These efforts have been successful, but there is a lack of coordination among agencies within the State to improve upon the effectiveness of these programs. Funding these initiatives and others is also not sufficient. Purpose of Plan Help gain funding from private or State and Federal sources to prevent and control the spread of ANS in the State; Create a collaborative team of State and Federal ag encies and the public to develop, cost-effective ANS population control appr oaches; and Provide tools for managers and the public to assess intentional introductions allowed by government into Maryland and rapidly res pond to unintentional or unauthorized ones. 6 Goal of Plan Fully implement a coordinated strategy that minimiz es risk of establishment by ANS along known pathways by 2020 and when possible, sto p the spread of ANS in Maryland and eradicate or control ANS to a minimal level of impact. Objectives of Plan Prevent new and additional introductions of ANS to Maryland waters; Establish an early detection and rapid response mec hanism to find, contain, and/or eradicate newly introduced species; and Control and slow the spread of existing ANS in Mary land. Actions to Achieve Objectives ( selected ) Develop greater coordination with neighboring state agencies regarding ANS; Review and update lists of prioritized ANS; Conduct risk assessments for prioritized ANS; Rank prioritized ANS according to risk; Use pathway analysis to rank pathways of introducti on; Provide results of risk assessments, pathway analys is and ranks online; Assess existing laws and regulations to determine t heir adequacy for preventing introduction or spread of ANS; Restore ecosystems impacted by ANS using native spe cies, when necessary; Create outreach and teaching materials in appropria te languages for targeted stakeholder groups; Identify, describe, adopt, use and periodically rev iew a reporting database for ANS in Maryland; Develop a social media platform to assist the publi c in reporting new species occurrences to the Department of Natural Resources; Adopt and train individuals to use a Rapid Response Plan for Maryland, the Rapid Response Planning for Aquatic Invasive Species: A T emplate , written and published by Maryland Sea Grant; Conduct and review studies to determine the most ef fective tools for removing ANS; Work with stakeholders to create laws or regulation s, training materials and programs, and control strategies aimed at preventin g the introduction and spread of ANS; and, Identify funding sources to carry out these actions . 7 TABLE OF CONTENTS ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 4 EXCUTIVE SUMMARY 5 TABLE OF CONTENTS 7 GLOSSARY 9 ACRONYMS 12 INTRODUCTION 13 Plan Purpose 13 Geographic Scope of Plan 13 ANS Plans for Neighboring Jurisdictions 14 Gaps and Challenges 15 Figure 1: Map of Maryland 17 PROBLEM DEFINITION 18 HIGH PRIORITY PATHWAYS AND ANS 20 Vectors and Priority Pathways of Introduction 20 Knowledge Gaps and other Challenges Associated with Vector/Pathway Management 29 High Priority and Red Alert ANS 30 MANAGEMENT PLAN 41 Plan Goal 41 Plan Objectives 41 Plan Strategies, Actions and Funding 41 Prevent new and additional ANS introductions in Ma ryland 41 Establish an early detection and rapid response me chanism 45 Control and slow spread of existing ANS 49 IMPLEMENTATION TABLE 51 PRIORITIES FOR ACTION 64 8 PLAN REVIEW 65 LITERATURE CITED 66 APPENDICES 78 Appendix 1.

PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE ANSP 111 9 GLOSSARY 1 Aquaculture: The rearing of aquatic animals or the cultivation of aquatic plants for food. Aquatic Nuisance Species and Invasive Species : Considered synonymous terms for this plan, these are non-native species whose introducti on causes, or is likely to cause, economic or environmental harm or harm to human, an imal, or plant health (Executive Order 13112; Beck et al. 2008). The Nonindigenous A quatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, authorized by United States Co ngress, defines an aquatic nuisance species as a nonindigenous species that threatens t he diversity or abundance of native species or the ecological stability of infested wat ers, or commercial, agricultural, aquacultural, or recreational activities dependent on such waters (ANSTF 1994). The term ANS is often used interchangeably with aquatic invasive species, the preferred term of Federal and State managers. Aquatic Species: A species that is totally or mostly dependent on aq uatic ecosystems for a significant portion of their life cycle (ANSTF 19 94). Ballast: Heavy material, such as water, gravel, sand, iron o r lead, placed low in a vessel to improve its stability. Bilge: The lowest internal compartment on a ship or boat w here water collects from the surrounding environment. Control: The restriction of an activity, tendency, or pheno menon, which includes the spread of aquatic nuisance species. Environmental Harm: Biologically significant decreases in native specie s populations, alterations of plant and animal communities, or cha nges in ecological processes that native species and other desirable plants and anima ls and humans depend on for survival (National Invasive Species Council, Invasive species definition clarification and guidance white paper , 2006). Established: Having been in existence for enough time that the s pecies successfully reproduces to yield viable offspring with continued survival, leading to a population that naturally persists in an environment. Exotic: Originating in or characteristic of a distant forei gn country. May be known as nonindigenous or non-native, with the latter often referencing species originating from a different watershed but within the continental Unit ed States. 1 Unless otherwise referenced, definitions were obta ined from the 2015 Oxford Dictionary, Oxford University Press. 10 High Priority: For the purpose of this Aquatic Nuisance Species Pl an, established species or species groups for which there is a high probability of negative economic and/or ecological impact. Indigenous: Originating or occurring naturally in a particular place; also known as native. Introduction: The intentional or unintentional escape, release, o r placement of a species into an ecosystem as a result of human activity. Low Priority: For the purpose of this Aquatic Nuisance Species Pl an, established aquatic species that occur in Maryland waters for which the re are neutral or beneficial economic and/or ecological impact. Non-native species that a re not established or are not considered likely to become established if introduc ed are also termed low priority. Macroinvertebrate: A macroscopic invertebrate, especially one whose sh ortest dimension is greater than half a millimeter and lar ge enough to be visible to the human eye. Mollusks: An invertebrate of Phylum Mollusca including snails , clams, mussels and squid that have soft, unsegmented bodies, live in a quatic habitats, and typically possess a mantle and a shell. Native: An animal or plant indigenous to a place, such as t hose that occurred pre- colonially or occurs in a particular ecosystem othe r than as a result of introduction. Non-native: Originating in or characteristic of a region other than the one in question. Synonym for nonindigenous or alien, or exotic if or iginating from a foreign country. In Federal executive order 13112, the term alien species is defined as any species, including seeds, eggs, spores, or other biological material c apable of propagating that species, that is not native to that ecosystem. Nuisance Species: A species that causes inconvenience or annoyance, s ynonymous with invasive species and aquatic nuisance species for t he purpose of this Plan. Pathogen: A bacterium, virus, or other microorganism that can cause disease. Pathway: Any means that allows entry or spread of an invasi ve species (Campbell and Kriesch 2003), which may include a single or series of methodological steps that lead to the introduction of a non-native species. Propagule Pressure: The number of introductions per unit time, which ma y include the number of individuals of a species, the number of t axa or genotypes introduced, or number of introduction events (Richardson and Pysek 2011). This encompasses variation in quantity, composition, and rate of supply of non -native organisms to a recipient region. 11 The release of hundreds of individuals periodically over a decade or the release of a few individuals monthly over the same period could yiel d the same propagule pressure. Rapid Response: A systematic effort to identify, eradicate, or cont ain aquatic nuisance species while infestations are still localized (NIS C 2008). Red Alert Species: For the purpose of this Aquatic Nuisance Species P lan, aquatic nuisance species that are not established or do not yet occur in Maryland waters, but may occur in the future because of human introduction o r natural range extensions where it has been introduced. These species have a high prob ability of negative, economic and/or ecological impact and may have risk assessments or management plans for regions of their occurrence. Examples of these species include silver carp and lionfish. Stakeholder: A person or organization with an interest or concer n in something. This can include local, county, regional, state, or fede ral governments, along with non- governmental organizations, businesses who depend o n aquatic resources for income, and the general public. State partners: All partners within Maryland working toward the co mmon goals noted in this Aquatic Nuisance Species Plan; listed partn ers are included in Appendix 2. Taxa : The plural of taxon, which is a taxonomic group o f any rank to classify organisms (e.g., kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus , species). Unknown Priority: For the purpose of this Aquatic Nuisance Species Pl an, aquatic species established in Maryland without any natural history information are considered 'unknown priority' so as to allow for a reasonable determination of low or high priority status. For unknown priority species, it may be pr udent to consider them high priority and aquatic nuisance species until evidence states otherwise. Vector: A type of pathway of introduction (http://www.ansta skforce.gov/ans.php, accessed December 2015), or the physical means that a species is transported into ecosystem. Watershed: An area or ridge of land that is drained by a river , river system, or other body of water. 12 ACRONYMS ANS Aquatic Nuisance Species ANSP Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plan ANSTF Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force CBP Chesapeake Bay Program ICTF Invasive Catfish Task Force ISMT Invasive Species Matrix Team IMO International Maritime Organization MAIPC Mid-Atlantic Invasive Plant Council MAPAIS Mid-Atlantic Panel of Aquatic Invasive Spec ies MDA Maryland Department of Agriculture MDE Maryland Department of the Environment MDDNR Maryland Department of Natural Resources MDSG Maryland SeaGrant NANPCA Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention an d Control Act NAS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species NFWF National Fish and Wildlife Foundation NISA National Invasive Species Act NISC National Invasive Species Council NOAA National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Admini stration UM University of Maryland USCG United States Coast Guard USGS United States Geological Survey USFWS United States Fish and Wildlife Service 13 INTRODUCTION The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and C ontrol Act of 1990 (NANPCA), reauthorized with the passage of the National Invas ive Species Act (NISA) in 1996, defines an aquatic nuisance species (ANS) as a noni ndigenous species that threatens the diversity or abundance of native species or the eco logical stability of infested waters, or commercial, agricultural, aquaculture or recreation al activities dependent on such waters. The term ANS is often used interchangeably with aqu atic invasive species, which is the preferred term of Federal and State governments. Th e United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Maryland Department of Agricult ure (MDA), and cooperating agencies manage many terrestrial species, particula rly those which threaten agriculture. While a comprehensive Maryland State Plan to manage terrestrial nuisance species may be forthcoming, the content of the current Maryland Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plan (ANSP) focuses solely on species th at spend the majority of their life cycle in aquatic habitats. Numerous exotic species have been introduced across the globe, intentionally by government and non-government agencies using fish s tocking or biological control initiatives and unintentionally from the pet trade and ballast water transfer or public release; some of these species are now regarded as ANS. In Maryland, these ANS can include: Hydrilla verticillata , northern snakehead (Appendix 1). Plan Purpose The purpose of the ANSP is to unify stakeholders su ch as agencies, general public, and industries, and to more effectively coordinate acti vities aimed at preventing new introductions and controlling the spread of current ANS. An ANSP for Maryland will help leverage funding from private or State and Fed eral sources to both prevent and control the spread of ANS in Maryland by determinin g the pathways of introduction, identifying ANS among those pathways, and organizin g a collaborative team of State and Federal agencies and the public to develop creative , cost-effective approaches toward ANS population control. It will also provide tools for natural resource managers and the public to objectively assess introductions allowed by government into Maryland and rapidly respond to unintentional ones. The ANSP wil l be routinely evaluated for completion of actions in the implementation table. Geographic Scope of Plan Much of Maryland lies within the Chesapeake Bay wat ershed. The Chesapeake Bay watershed is the largest estuary in the United Stat es (64,000 km 2), and contains major shipping routes in two of the most populous cities in the nation (Baltimore, MD and Washington, D.C.). The watershed is also interconne cted with the Delaware River by the Chesapeake and Delaware (C&D) Canal and receives dr ainage from Washington D.C. and 6 states: Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, West V irginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. 14 Maryland has no natural lakes, but contains several large impounded waterways that are popular tourist destinations for out-of-state visit ors. As a result of its vast drainage area and its interconnections with other watersheds, the Chesapeake Bay watershed may be colonized by ANS that naturally disperse from other state waters or which are directly introduced into Maryland waters. While the Chesapeake Bay watershed is the largest w atershed in Maryland, there are two other watersheds covered by this ANSP: the coastal bays watershed and the Youghiogheny River (Figure 1). The coastal bays wat ershed includes 5 coastal lagoons and tributaries that drain into them. The lagoons a re generally brackish, with natural corridors to the Atlantic Ocean through the Ocean C ity Inlet to the north and Chincoteague Inlet (in Virginia) to the south. The Youghiogheny River drains a portion of western Maryland and is shared by West Virginia and Pennsylvania. It is a non-tidal stream that drains from Maryland into the Ohio Rive r Basin, which drains into Mississippi River drainages. Many of Maryland's water bodies are interconnected by canals that may increase propagule pressure and should be managed in some ca ses (Smith and Tibbles 1980; Daniels 2001). The hydrology of canals and dispersa l corridors could change as climates and land usage change, leading to greater expansion of ANS. Increased precipitation and stream flow is expected to result from climate chan ge in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (Najjar et al. 2010) and will serve to better conne ct otherwise isolated, adjacent drainages and could lead to the spread of ANS among drainages . In addition, annual averages in water temperature are more likely to increase than decrease in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (Wood et al. 2002). Increased water tempe ratures could also lead to natural establishment of ANS. The consideration of climate change in risk assessment is improving among state agencies (EPA 2008), but comp licated because consequences of climate change are complex. The Maryland ANSP addresses pathways and ANS for al l waters in Maryland, including the three watersheds (Youghiogheny, Chesapeake, coa stal bays) and shared waters with neighboring jurisdictions such as Potomac River (Ma ryland, Virginia, West Virginia, the District of Columbia), Nanticoke River (Maryland, D elaware), and Conowingo Reservoir (Maryland, Pennsylvania). The largest watershed tha t is contained by Maryland is Chesapeake Bay watershed. The coastal bays watershe d is the second largest. Currently there are no data that indicate whether a particula r watershed should be prioritized for action items noted within this Plan. ANS Plans for Neighboring Jurisdictions There are existing ANSPs for the states of Virginia , Pennsylvania, and New York. An ANSP for West Virginia was under development - the plan went through preliminary review during the Fall of 2014, but West Virginia h as not yet sought final approval from the ANS Task Force. Currently, the State of Delawa re and Washington D.C. do not have ANSPs. Coordination among agencies and jurisdiction s was accomplished with United 15 States Fish and Wildlife Services' (USFWS) leadersh ip to restrict live possession of Northern Snakehead. However, many other species and pathways have not been jointly and similarly regulated (e.g., blue catfish or mand ating boat cleaning before launch). There are two organizations in which these states p articipate to address invasive species: Mid-Atlantic Invasive Plant Council (MAIPC) and Mid -Atlantic Panel on Aquatic Invasive Species (MAPAIS). During routine meetings of these organizations, coordination of actions related to various state AN SPs is discussed. In addition to ANS plans, Maryland has several individual plans that p ertain to a species or group of species. These specific plans are referenced in HIGH PRIORITY PATHWAYS AND ANS in this ANSP. Action items of those plans are similar to th ose included within this ANSP. Gaps and Challenges While a regional rapid response plan exists (Smits and Moser 2009), a comprehensive statewide plan has not been approved by the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force (ANSTF). A major challenge in implementing a compre hensive statewide plan is in establishing a framework for all authorities who ar e involved in ANS management (Appendix 2) to jointly discuss ANS issues. The MDD NR Invasive Species Matrix Team (ISMT) integrates several authorities, but requires long-term stability and greater participation from other authorities. It does not i nclude, for example, participation from university researchers and would benefit from resou rces provided by academia. These authorities may identify gaps in laws and regulatio n that could prevent ANS introduction. Recent statewide increases in fines were adopted fo r people violating existing ANS regulation and law. Additionally, a recent law in M aryland was passed to fine boaters who launch vessels that are fouled with organic mat erial into public waters (State Lakes Invasive Species Act of 2015, Decontamination of Ve ssels). New regulations and laws may additionally become necessary as new pathways o f introduction are identified. However, even existing laws and regulations to prev ent bait introductions or possession of certain ANS are not easily enforced and require more education and outreach with stakeholders (e.g., bait dealers) to become effecti ve. Apathy regarding introduction of species may stem f rom a general misunderstanding of potential impacts of ANS introduction. There are ga ps in existing knowledge on the impacts of many ANS within Maryland waters. In rece nt years, for example, gaps in understanding the ecological role of northern snake head and blue catfish have led to widespread concern for natural resources that the S tate aims to protect, such as shad and largemouth bass. These gaps in knowledge have also led to a desire of some to manage the species as sport fish. Other ANS such as green crab and zebra mussel have not yet demonstratively impacted Maryland's ecosystems, tho ugh these species have caused problems for other non-indigenous regions where the y thrive. To institute a control program that cost-effectively minimizes negative im pacts from ANS, the negative impacts from ANS must be well-documented. 16 There are larger gaps in assessing risk of the esta blishment and invasiveness of species that are not yet in Maryland waters and some of the se are red alert species. Red alert species include silver carp and some non-native cra yfishes that could enter Maryland waters through existing pathways. One of these path ways includes the sale via the World Wide Web, which is difficult to control. In additi on, some species such as lionfish or water hyacinth may naturally disperse to or thrive in Maryland as water temperatures warm. In both cases there is management uncertainty and an inability to inform the general public on possible consequences. 17 Figure 1 . Map of Maryland with major basins and reservoirs . 18 PROBLEM DEFINITION There are approximately 1051 non-native aquatic ani mal species reported in the United States Geological Survey's Nonindigenous Aquatic Sp ecies database (Fuller and Neilson 2015). Of those, about 72% are fishes (P. Fuller, U .S. Geological Survey, pers. comm.). In the Chesapeake Bay watershed, there were 120 int roduced aquatic animal species listed by USGS (2016). Some species are cryptogenic with an unknown origin, such as a Brown Pelican that was found in Maryland in 1981, e ither resulting from natural range expansion or introduction. Fanwort ( Cabomba caroliniana ) is another cryptogenic species in Maryland. For the purpose of this ANSP, only species that are known to be introduced from outside of Maryland will be priorit ized as ANS. The probability that a non-native, introduced species' population will gro w and expand its distribution depends on both the environment and natural history of the organism (Sakai et al. 2001; Kolar and Lodge 2002; Lapointe et al. 2013). The establishmen t of ANS requires suitable habitat (Shafland and Pestrak 1982) and may be promoted thr ough factors such as high propagule pressure or loss of native biodiversity ( Levine 2000; Duggan et al. 2006), simultaneous introduction of pathogens that affect native species (Reynolds 2013), or climate change (Rahel and Olden 2008). Introduction s are considered the reason for homogenization of North American fish communities ( Rahel 2000) and the primary cause of changes in biodiversity in many aquatic ec osystems (Sala et al. 2000). The intentional introduction of non-native species is an old and worldwide practice dating back at least 1000 years when carp were widely intr oduced throughout Eurasia (Moyle 1986). The stocking of sport fishes throughout Unit ed States in the late 1800's led to the establishment of nationwide fisheries for largemout h bass and have provided a stable source of food for the general public. In Louisiana , 2.5 million Florida bass ( Micropterus salmoides floridanus ) may be introduced to help promote sportfishing (A BA 2014). Unfortunately, very few of these authorized introdu ctions have had formalized risk assessments, which led to unforeseeable problems (e .g., introduction of whirling disease, Modin 1998; escape of aquaculture species, Kumar 20 00; gene introgression and hybridization, Dakin et al. 2015). The unauthorized or unintentional introduction of a species may be observed serendipitously, after popu lations have already established; recent environmental DNA (or eDNA) techniques may h elp identify occurrences without direct observation (Jerde et al. 2011). Not all species that have been introduced to Chesap eake Bay watershed are ANS (Christmas et al. 1998). Many non-native organisms may have beneficial or neutral impacts (Shafland 1996; Gozlan 2008). Those that ar e ANS have potential to cause or have caused negative economic and/or ecologic impac ts. Some major ways ANS impact other species is through competition or predation. Competition and predation with ANS affects at least half of the threatened or endanger ed fishes listed by the Endangered Species Act (Wilcove et al. 1998). Extinction as a result of competition with ANS is much less likely than extinction because of predati on or habitat loss (Davis 2003). 19 The ANS may also: 1) reduce biodiversity and simpli fy aquatic food webs and Saunders 2000; Ricciardi 2005; Vitule et al. 2009); 2) dramatically change primary productivity in aquatic habitats (Nicholls et al. 1 999); 3) affect water clarity; 4) spread disease (Radonski et al. 1984; Hill 2011); 5) destr oy commercial fisheries (e.g., ctenophores in the Black Sea); 6) deteriorate gene pools for fishes (Philipp et al. 1983; Philipp et al. 2002; Laikre et al. 2010); and 7) in crease operating costs (e.g. decontamination, gear replacement) for industry, bo aters and anglers. The negative impacts or costs and positive impacts of species introductions are often considered when reaching a consensus on the urgency to address ANS. For example, Hydrilla is a non-native ANS plant that negatively affects boaters (Pimentel et al. 2005) and waterfront homeowners, but was credited for pro viding habitat for fishes (Kraus and Jones 2011) after an unprecedented decline in nativ e Chesapeake Bay grasses because of storms and poor water clarity (Orth and Moore 1983) . Consequently, the level of control for Hydrilla is debated between anglers and recreational boater s. The release of sport fish or game fish can be similarly contentious because o f the potential to lower genetic fitness of the wild population (Hill 2011), to introduce di sease (Bartholomew and Reno 2002), or to negatively affect the food web (Jackson 2002) . Pimentel et al. (2005) reported revenue of $69 billion per year in the United State s because of introduced sport fish, but a conservative loss of $5.4 billion per year to mitig ate negative effects of ANS. Predictive models have been developed to determine whether a non-native species is likely to become ANS and negatively impact the ecos ystem (Moyle and Light 1996; Kolar and Lodge 2002; Lodge et al. 2006; Hardin and Hill 2012). Quantitative and qualitative risk assessment tools have been develop ed to help predict consequences of introduction (e.g., McCann 1984; Kohler and Stanley 1984; and Hill 2012; Verbrugge et al. 2012). The use of these tools may inform governments and resource agencies on possible negative consequences of introduction from authorized pathwa ys into regional waters (by State or Federal governments). These tools do little to prev ent introduction through unauthorized pathways, such as bait or aquarist releases. Once a n ANS is established, the options for actions are often limited to slowing its spread and controlling its biomass. A growing number of non-native aquatic plant and an imal species could adversely impact the productivity and biodiversity of Maryland's nat ive species and alter a variety of aquatic ecosystems. Thick patches of Hydrilla create patchy stagnancy in tidal freshwater habitats, which can exclude hypoxia intolerant fish es and macroinvertebrates from otherwise valuable habitat refugia. As blue catfish and northern snakehead become more widely established in Chesapeake Bay, it is expecte d that the food webs will be influenced by these important predators. Several in vasive crayfishes have been linked to dramatic declines in native crayfishes in many Mary land watersheds (Kilian et al. 2010). In addition to loss in native biodiversity, ANS hav e the potential to simplify aquatic food webs, alter nutrient cycling, decrease habitat valu e or water quality, impair angler experiences, create increases in safety concerns fo r swimmers or boaters, decrease property values, and negatively impact commercial f isheries and industrial infrastructure (e.g., water intakes) or power generation. 20 HIGH PRIORITY PATHWAYS AND AQUATIC NUISANCE SPECIES Vectors and Priority Pathways of Introduction The following is a list of the vectors and associat ed pathways that are most responsible for non-native species introductions including ANS in Maryland. These pathways are the known, prioritized pathways in Maryland. Other path ways may exist, but these were prioritized by the authors because they are known o r suspected pathways of introduction for aquatic organisms in Maryland waters. Included in the following list is information on th e known species that have been introduced via each vector and a description of the current state of knowledge of the vector, including gaps that currently hinder vector management and ANS prevention. Although this list captures most of the vectors tha t have historically played a role in ANS introductions and will likely continue to do so in the near future, this list is not comprehensive. New vectors and pathways emerge with increasing global trade and human population (Carlton and Ruiz 2005). Maritime Commerce Vector Ballast Water Pathway \u2014 Oceangoing ships utilize water as ballast to prov ide balance and stability from port to port. Prior to a given v oyage, ballast water is pumped into large, onboard holding tanks in the area of a departure po rt. Organisms including algae, pathogens, a variety of invertebrates, and fish can also be pumped into ballast tanks from the surrounding environment during this filling pro cess. Ballast water, and associated aquatic organisms, are often stored in these tanks throughout the entire voyage and then released at the port of call under the authority of the captain. Discharge of ballast water from ships can often int roduce non-native, ANS from distant continents to the receiving waters. However, the po tential spread of ANS via ballast water discharge is not limited to transoceanic ship ping. Intra-oceanic shipping can also lead to the spread of coastal marine organisms espe cially among ports with similar environmental conditions. Ballast water discharge h as been responsible for establishment of over a third of marine ANS worldwide (Hewitt and Campbell 2010) and approximately 70% of ANS to the Great Lakes (Holeck et al. 2004) including zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha ). Suspected ballast water introductions have also occ urred in the Chesapeake Bay. The veined rapa welk ( Rapana venosa ) a predatory snail from Southeast Asia, is a suspe cted ballast water introduction first reported in the Ba y in 1998. It is currently established in Virginia waters, but is not known to occur in Maryl and's portion of the Chesapeake Bay. An oyster disease called MSX is caused by a protozo an ( Haplosporidium nelsoni ) native to Japan and Korea and was likely introduced via th e ballast water pathway, although other pathways may have been involved. In 1959 it w as first documented in the 21 Chesapeake Bay. This ANS has caused high mortality in the eastern oyster ( Crassostrea virginica ) and has been one of several factors hindering oys ter recovery efforts. Ballast water is also the suspected pathway responsible for the introduction of the Chinese mitten crab ( Eriocheir sinensis ), a catadromous ANS from eastern Asia. This specie s has been reported from estuaries along the Mid-Atlantic from Maryland to New York. It was first reported from the Patapsco River in 2005. There hav e been a total of four crabs collected in Maryland waters since 2005, but none reported si nce 2007. It remains unclear if this species is currently established in the state. In recent years, management of the ballast water pa thway has involved the establishment of international and national regulations and stand ards aimed at reducing ANS invasions. In 2004, the International Maritime Organization (I MO) established guidelines for ballast water exchange and a ballast water discharge standa rd. In 2008, the USEPA finalized the Vessel General Permit which required that all vesse ls entering United States waters conduct saltwater exchange or meet acceptable disch arge requirements and that all inter- coastal vessels conduct mandatory ballast water man agement practices. The USCG also regulates ballast water discharge in United States waters under the United States Final Ballast Water Rule adopted in 2012. This rule estab lished specific discharge standards (similar to the international standard set by the I MO) and concentration limits on microorganisms in ships' ballast water. In Maryland 's Chesapeake Bay, the regulatory authority and management of ballast water falls pri marily under the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard. While the ballast water pathway of the Maritime Com merce Vector is regulated, the Port of Baltimore ranks as the 13 th largest port in the United States and third larges t in the Mid-Atlantic behind Norfolk and New York in total t ons of cargo imported and exported annually (MPA 2014). Maritime commerce at the port is likely to increase in coming years, possibly resulting in greater influence of t he ship biofouling pathway. Recent widening of the Panama Canal will now allow Super P ost-Panamax cargo ships to access East Coast ports. Baltimore is currently one of onl y a few such ports that have the cranes and other infrastructure to receive these large shi ps, which had been previously limited by their large size to the Pacific Coast. Ship Biofouling Pathway \u2014The accumulation of algae, plants, microorganisms, barnacles, mollusks, sponges, hydroids, tubeworms, tunicates, and other invertebrates on the superstructure of oceangoing vessels represents a significant pathway of ANS associated with the maritime commerce vector. As is the case with ballast water, biofouling organisms attached to hulls, propellers, and other ship surfaces can be transported from port to port and introduced into r eceiving waters. Biofouling is the likely pathway responsible for 70 % of ANS introductions in the coastal waters of North America (Fofonoff et al. 2003). Bio fouling is the suspected pathway responsible for the initial introduction of the gre en crab ( Carcinus maenas ) on the East Coast of the United States. This ANS is now establi shed in Maryland's Coastal Bay estuaries. 22 The ANS invasions resulting in dramatic changes in the function and integrity of aquatic ecosystems, declines in fisheries, human health con cerns, and economic impacts associated with industry and infrastructure has pro mpted considerable international research on this vector since the 1980s (Davidson a nd Simkanin 2012). Ballast water and biofouling are among the most studied of ANS pathwa ys and there is considerable ongoing research on ballast water treatment and ant ifouling systems. Management of biofouling has focused on anti-fouling paints or hu ll treatments to prevent the attachment of encrusting organisms. Trade of Live Organisms Vector Live Bait Pathway\u2014 The importation or harvest, distribution, use, and release of live bait comprise a significant pathway through which n on-native potential ANS species can be introduced and spread. Live bait introductions m ost often result from the release of unused bait by anglers at the end of a fishing trip . These releases have been reported throughout much of the United States (Fuller et al. 1999) and may be the most important in the mid-Atlantic region (personal communication, P. Fuller, USGS/NAS). Anglers often view the practice of releasing unused bait as humane or beneficial to predatory game fishes (as prey) and the recipient ecosystem ( Litvak and Mandrak 1993; Kilian et al. 2012). Regardless of the intent, releasing bait has been responsible for the introduction and spread of non-native earthworms, many species o f fishes, crayfishes, and other invertebrates (USGS 2016). Concern over introducing pathogens when using nuclear worms to fish inland waters in Maryland led to cons ideration of an import ban (AP 2005). Bait bucket introductions of ANS have been linked t o altered chemical, physical, and biological processes within aquatic ecosystems and to declines and extirpations of native species (Moyle 1976; Hobbs et al. 1989; Goodchild 2 000). The threat posed by this pathway is not limited to the bait species alone. H itchhiking species including snails, worms, algae, and other invertebrates can also be i ntroduced via the dumping of unused bait and its associated packing material (Haska et al. 2012). Hitchhiking parasites and pathogens, such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia, a disease that has caused large fish kills in the Great Lakes region, can also be harbored on or in contaminated bait. Release of bait by anglers is the likely pathway re sponsible for introductions of four non- native crayfishes ) in some areas of the state (Kilian et al. 2012). Red swamp crawfish was also introduced via aquaculture (see below). Bait introductions have also led to establi shed populations of at least seven non- native fishes and this pathway is one of several so urces of non-native earthworm species to Maryland (Kilian et al. 2012). To date, management of this pathway has focused mos tly on the angler. It is illegal to release live bait into Maryland waters. There are also regulations that prohibit the use of certain bait types to reduce the spread of ANS. For example, anglers are prohibited from the use of live crayfish as bait in the lower Susqu ehanna River, Middle Potomac River, Monocacy River, and upper Potomac River. Regulation s targeting wholesale and retail distributors prohibit the import, sale, and possess ion of certain ANS common in the live 23 bait trade. The packing materials for ANS is possib ly not regulated and hitchhiker species could also be introduced. Packing material for bait worms shipped from Maine, for example, is commonly brown algae, which may also ha ve other ANS such as green crab (Carcinus maenas ) associated with it. Aquarium/Pet Pathway\u2014 The live trade in aquatic organisms for aquarium ho bbyists and pet owners is a 25 billion dollar-per-year and growing industry (Padilla and Williams 2004) that is responsible for the movement of thous ands of species of animals and plants from around the world, many of which are exotic and some are potential ANS (Strecker et al. 2011). Introductions of non-native species i ncluding ANS associated with the aquarium/pet pathway occur primarily through the in tentional release of unwanted organisms by pet owners and aquarists. The organism s can be purchased from on-line sources (e.g., craigslist, www.craigslist.com), com mercial suppliers (e.g., PetSmart), or other aquarium hobbyists. This pathway is responsib le for hundreds of introductions nationwide and is considered an important pathway r esponsible for ANS introductions (Ruiz et al. 1997). A third of the world's worst AN S (as designated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature) were introduc ed via the aquarium/pet pathway (Padilla and Williams 2004). As with the live bait pathway, hitchhiking organisms including pathogens and parasites also pose a threa t to recipient ecosystems when released with their associated pet species. Introductions of aquatic pets have been routinely d iscovered in Maryland waters and include: These tropical species have low potential for establishing populations in Maryland. Other released species have become established and include: Chinese mystery snail ( Bellamya chinensis ). There are hundreds of places to buy aquatic pets in Maryland. Efforts to prevent ANS introductions via this pathw ay have focused on regulations restricting the import and sale of certain ANS (e.g ., marbled crayfish) and on education/outreach to pet owners. Water Gardening Pathway\u2014 Import and sale of live aquatic organisms for stock ing outdoor water gardens is popular among hobbyists an d a growing potential pathway of ANS. Introductions associated with water gardening usually occur through escape during floods or by wind and wildlife, or by improper disp osal of ANS-contaminated material or water. This pathway is a significant source of know n ANS as well as hitchhiking species of fungi, algae, snails, and other invertebrates (M aki and Galatowitsch 2004). The water gardening industry is the suspected route by which Hydrilla verticillata was first brought to Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic regi on. The original introduction of this ANS plant in the Potomac River occurred after an in tentional planting of what was supposed to be Elodea (Anacharis ), but was actually Hydrilla (Fincham 2009) by National Park Service as a possible substitute for native grasses that had largely died in 24 the Potomac River. Hydrilla became abundant in the 1980's. Water gardening is also the likely pathway responsible for the introduction of water lettuce ( Pistia stratiotes ) to Mattawoman Creek in 2007. There were 5 Maryland wat er gardening businesses identified in Maryland in a Google search in Decemb er 2015, but many more likely occur throughout the State. As with the aquarium/pet pathway, efforts to preven t ANS introductions via this pathway have focused on regulations restricting the import and sale of certain ANS and on education/outreach. Live Seafood Pathway\u2014 The global seafood trade involves the importation a nd distribution of live aquatic species originating fr om distant locations and is a pathway for ANS (Chapman et al. 2003). The mechanisms of introd uction associated with this pathway include the purchase of a species from a li ve seafood market or other vendor and the intentional release of fish and other organisms by consumers. The asiatic clam (Corbicula fluminea ) was believed to have been introduced as a food spec ies by immigrants a Century ago. It has now expanded its r ange throughout North America. Intentional introductions of live fishes, crabs, cr ayfish, and other seafood species may also result in the spread of associated hitchhiking species, parasites, and pathogens into recipient waters. In Maryland, the import and release of live seafood is the likely source of Asian swamp eel ( Monopterus albus ) in Lake Needwood in the Rockville, MD. Although m ultiple individuals have been captured in recent years, it remains unclear if Asian swamp eel is established. This pathway may have also been the so urce of introductions of northern snakehead ( Channa argus ) into Potomac River and Chinese mitten crab ( Eriocheir sinesis ) in Maryland. The live seafood pathway is not as widely recognized an important pathway as others (Miller et al. 2001), but was one of two suspected pathways for Chinese mitten crab into California (Cohen and Carl ton 1997). There are federal and Maryland regulations that pro hibit the live import or possession of some food species, such as snakeheads. Regulations in Maryland also prohibit import, transport, purchase, live possession, propagation, sale or release of Asian swamp eel. Biological Supply Pathway\u2014 Biological supply companies offer a variety of live organisms marketed for educational purposes. Many n on-native aquatic plants, fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, and other invertebrates can be purchased from the World Wide Web. Online biological supply companies are a commo n source of live organisms used as teaching tools by science teachers. Introductions a ssociated with this pathway usually occur because teachers and/or students release the organisms at the completion of their science lesson. A survey of teachers in the United States and Canada by Chan et al. (2012) found that one in four science teachers who used live organisms in their classrooms also released them into the wild. The bi ological supply pathway has been implicated in the introductions of three crayfishes that are ANS in the Pacific Northwest (Larson and Olden 2008, 2011). 25 The MDDNR has received numerous anecdotal reports o f teachers releasing live aquatic species purchased from online vendors into Maryland waters. In response, MDDNR has focused education/outreach to inform teachers and s chool science departments to discontinue this practice. Water Recreation Vector Boating Gear Pathway\u2014 The use of small motor boats, sailboats, pontoons, jet skis, canoes, kayaks, and other watercraft is an increasi ngly common pathway associated with the spread of ANS in inland waters. Introductions a ssociated with this pathway arise when non-native, potential ANS are inadvertently ca rried between water bodies in bilge water, engine cooling systems, live wells, or attac hed/ entangled to hulls, trailers, or other surfaces. Because recreational boats and associated gear can be transported by trailers over great distances, the use of contaminated water craft can be a source of new ANS to Maryland. Recreational boating can also serve as a secondary pathway through which ANS originally introduced via other vectors are tra nsferred between nearby water bodies (Kerr et al. 2005). This pathway is believed to be responsible for the spread of problematic plants (e.g., Eurasian watermilfoil, ). It is the most important pathway responsible for the spread of zebra mussels from th e Great Lakes throughout the United States. Maryland's coastal estuaries, Chesapeake Bay, and m any large inland reservoirs are popular tourist destinations among recreational boa ters, fishers, kayakers, and canoeists. Many boaters using these waters come from adjacent states. Some boaters on Maryland waters trailer their watercraft from as far west as Utah (MDDNR, Mark Lewandowski, Deep Creek Boat Inspection, 2014), which emphasizes the large geographic scope of this potential pathway. Recreational boating is the like ly pathway responsible for the introduction of Hydrilla and Eurasian watermilfoil in Deep Creek Lake. This pathway is regulated in Maryland by House Bill 860 that stipulates boaters must remove organic material from boats before launching in state owned impounded waters. Education/outreach efforts have also encouraged boa ters to follow best management practices to minimize the spread of ANS via boating . Angling Gear Pathway\u2014 Anglers can inadvertently transport and introduce A NS that become attached to or contained within unclean equi pment including fishing rods, tackle, waders, wading boots, and other angling gear. This is one of the suspected pathways responsible for introductions of New Zealand mud sn ail ( Potamopyrgus antipodarum ) and spiny waterflea in many United States waters. I t is also the suspected pathway by which the invasive alga didymo ( Didymosphenia geminata ) was introduced streams in many countries and throu ghout much of the United States, including Maryland (Bothwell et al. 2009). Pathogen s such as whirling disease can also be transported between water bodies on contaminated fishing gear. 26 In response to the introduction of didymo, the MDDN R banned the use of felt sole waders or wading boots in Maryland waters to minimi ze the potential transport of this and other ANS (COMAR 08.02.19.07) . The MDDNR and partners also established wader washing stations at many popular fishing loca tions. SCUBA Gear pathway\u2014 Regulators, buoyancy control devices, weight belts, wetsuits, and other gear used by recreational and commercial divers can, when not properly dried or decontaminated, serve as vectors on which ANS ca n be transported between water bodies. This is the suspected pathway responsible f or the introduction of zebra mussels in Millbrook Quarry (VA), which is an abandoned stone quarry used for dive training (Fernald and Watson 2005). This recreational activi ty is common in Chesapeake Bay watershed and on Maryland's Atlantic Coast. Stocking Vector Authorized Stocking Pathway\u2014 Authorized fish stocking by government agencies has long been a means by which species have been introd uced outside of their native ranges to create fisheries for anglers. Fish stocking has been largely successful in enhancing the variety and numbers of game fishes available to ang lers throughout the United States. There are many examples, however, where authorized introductions have also led to negative ecological impacts (Fuller 2003). For exam ple, blue catfish ( Ictalurus furcatus ) was introduced for sport fishing in tidal rivers of Chesapeake Bay watershed Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. Largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) was intentionally introduced to Maryland shortly af ter the Civil War to provide local people a year-round food source. Common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) was also introduced as a food species throughout much of North America (Fu ller 2003) and is now widespread in Maryland waters. Authorized stocking of species to support a prey base for sport or game fishes is also a pathway that has been respons ible for the introductions of several non-native stocking for the purpose of biocontrol is also a common source of non-native, potential ANS. Grass carp are ANS that have been stocked in many United States waters for control of aquatic ve getation and mosquitoes, respectively. Risk assessment methods and internal review of prop osed stockings should prevent future introductions of ANS associated with the authorized stocking pathway. Unauthorized Stocking Pathway\u2014 Unauthorized stocking for the purposes of developing a sport fishery, forage base, harvest fi shery or biocontrol can result in introductions and spread of ANS and non-target, hit chhiking organisms and pathogens. Unauthorized movement and release of blue catfish b y the general public has likely hastened the spread of this species throughout Ches apeake Bay watershed. This practice has also led to introduction of Northern Snakehead to ponds in Crofton (MD), the Potomac River and the Nanticoke River. 27 The MDDNR Fisheries Service has regulatory authorit y over fish stocking in Maryland waters. Authorized stocking of private ponds requir es a permit issued by MDDNR. This process involves the review of the species and sour ces of those species planned for stocking. However, not all members of the general p ublic seek a permit and unauthorized introductions occur. Management of unauthorized stocking includes a comb ination of regulation and education. Research is needed to better understand motives behind illegal transport and introduction of game species (e.g., blue catfish, n orthern snakehead) and to identify communication and outreach techniques that both hig hlight existing laws and convince the general public to avoid releasing species witho ut first obtaining a permit. Religious Release of Wildlife Pathway\u2014 Ceremonial animal release, a traditional ritual in Buddhism and other Asian religions, is the pract ice of releasing captive wildlife including turtles, frogs, and fishes for religious purposes (Shiu and Stokes 2009; Liu et al. 2013). This ritual, practiced among religious group s in the United States and Canada, has been linked to the spread of ANS (Shiu and Stokes 2 009). This practice can involve the release of large numbers of organisms in a single e vent, and can be performed frequently among some Buddhist groups (Shiu and Stokes 2009). This vector is a possible pathway by which northern snakehead ( Channa argus ) was first introduced to the Potomac River drainage near Washington, DC. Aquaculture Vector Aquaculture Pathway\u2014 The importation of aquatic organisms for the purpos e of aquaculture is a major vector responsible for intro ductions of ANS (Naylor et al. 2001) because of escape of cultured organisms from aquacu lture facilities through outflow pipes or during flooding events. Bighead carp ( Hypophthalmichthys nobilis ), ( Mylopharyngodon piceus ), three ANS native to Asia were originally imported to the United States for aquacu lture. These species subsequently escaped aquaculture facilities and are now establis hed throughout much of the Greater Mississippi River drainage (Fuller 2003). This vector has played a significant role in the in troduction of ANS in Maryland. Aquaculture is the known vector for the introductio n of two non-native crayfishes including the southern white river crawfish ( P. zonangulus ) and the red swamp crawfish. These species, originally introduced to outdoor far m ponds for culture as food, subsequently invaded nearby streams and rivers and are firmly established in many Maryland watersheds (Kilian et al. 2009). Introduct ions arising from aquaculture escapes have resulted in significant biological impacts (Gr osholz et al. 2015). The MDDNR Fisheries Service issues permits to aquac ulture facilities in Maryland. As part of the permitting process, species proposed fo r aquaculture undergo review by MDDNR biologists to assess potential ecological ris k and invasion potential. Even with this oversight, there is still considerable potenti al for the introduction of ANS as a result of contaminated source stocks and misidentification s of species used in aquaculture. 28 Canals/Dam Removal Vector Canals/Dam Removal Pathway\u2014 The construction of canals in the late 1800's and e arly 1900's connected many river drainages which allowed for the free movement of aquatic organisms between systems that were previously sepa rated by bio-geographical barriers (Fuller 2003). The construction of canals played a large role in the spread of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus ) in the Great Lakes. Similarly, the Chicago Shippi ng and Sanitary Canal provided the corridor through which the round goby spread from the Great Lakes to the Upper Mississippi River drainage (Fuller 200 3). The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal parallels the Potomac River and can intermittently provide a low-gradient, slow water habitat through which ANS could traverse natural dispersal barriers like Great Falls on Potomac Rive r. Several fishes, crayfishes, and amphibians native to the coastal plain of Maryland have utilized the C&O canal to expand their distributions westward across the Fall Line (Stranko et al. 2003; Kilian et al. 2010). This same corridor has also provided access to the non-tidal Potomac River by northern snakehead. The removal of dams and the construction of fish la dders are common practices used in the restoration of diadromous fishes and riverine h abitats. By restoring riverine connectivity, these techniques are often successful at providing access of migratory fishes to previously inaccessible historic habitats for sp awning. However, dam removal and fish ladders can also provide free movement of ANS. The extensive permitting procedure associated with development of canals or removal of dams should minimize the potential for ANS introduc tions and spread. Construction of canals, dam removal, and construction of fish ladde rs are authorized via Maryland Department of Environment, Army Corps of Engineers, other agencies, and reviewed by MDDNR Environmental Review Unit. The MDDNR, USFWS, and other organizations involved in dam removal and fish passage programs c onsider the potential dispersal of ANS when evaluating proposed dam removal and fish p assage projects. The scrutiny associated with review of such stream altering proj ects incorporates consideration of range expansion by ANS. To minimize the movement of ANS through the existing or new canals in Maryland, monitoring of distribution and on-the-ground population control efforts are necessary. Research and Monitoring Vector Research and Monitoring Pathway\u2014 Aquatic research and monitoring involves various activities (e.g., bio-assessments, fish kill invest igations, restoration projects, water quality assessment, and population/status surveys) that pos e a risk of transporting and introducing ANS. Many of these activities entail th e use of equipment such as boats and trailers, and other gear (e.g., waders, nets) on mu ltiple water bodies in a given day and there is a high potential for ANS to hitchhike betw een waters while attached to or contained within equipment and gear. Only a fifth o f surveyed fisheries programs at colleges and universities reported having a protoco l in place for preventing the spread of 29 ANS (Westhoff and Kobermann 2015). Aquatic research can also involve in situ experimentation where ANS could be inadvertently in troduced. In 1980, National Park Service scientists conducting research to restore a quatic vegetation to the Potomac River used in situ experimentation in Dyke Marsh near Washington, D.C . with what they believed to be a type of Elodea. Their experiment l ed to the first reported invasion of Hydrilla in the Mid-Atlantic region (Fincham 2009). Similar ly, experimental introductions of the Asian oyster ( Crassostrea gigas ) by scientists working on oyster restoration is one of two suspected vectors respons ible for the introduction of the disease MSX in Chesapeake Bay (Burreson et al. 2000). Resea rch collection activities by non- MDDNR personnel are permitted by MDDNR, which provi des the opportunity to encourage cleaning of equipment. Knowledge Gaps and other Challenges Associated with Vector/Pathway Management The pathways of the Trade of Live Organism Vector a re challenging without adequate regulation and education. In Maryland, retail bait shops frequently sell known and potential ANS and most bait sold in these shops is imported from wholesalers and sources outside of Maryland or the Mid-Atlantic reg ion (Kilian et al. 2012). Unused bait (live fishes and crayfishes) was released by the ma jority of anglers in a survey of Marylanders (Kilian et al. 2012). Likewise, the lar ge numbers of non-native aquatic species in the aquarium/pet trade and their subsequ ent introductions indicate that this pathway is an active route of potential ANS in Mary land. Identifying the species of highest concern within this vector may be complicat ed because of inconsistencies in the use of common and scientific names, misidentificati on and/or mislabeling of species in trade, and contamination of traded species with non -target hitchhikers (Maki and Galatowitsch 2004; Keller and Lodge 2007) The pathways of the Water Recreation Vector require change because of behaviors of the tens of thousands of stakeholders (i.e., boaters, a nglers, divers) involved in water recreation throughout the state. Encouraging stakeh olders to actively and consistently decontaminate and/or dry their boats will require l arge scale outreach efforts and cooperation among and within Maryland state agencie s. Of the remaining vectors, stocking of animals as pa rt of the Religious Release of Wildlife pathway may be problematic in the future. The exten t and frequency to which ceremonial release occurs in Maryland is not well understood. Management of this vector will require a better understanding of the ethical viewp oints of the stakeholders (Liu et al. 2013). Because releasing fish species to private po nds and other waterways in Maryland usually requires a stocking permit, communication w ith interfaith organizations is needed to ensure such permits have been obtained. 30 High Priority and Red Alert Aquatic Nuisance Specie s The following sections provide ranks of high priori ty or red alert species for those that are considered ANS in Maryland. This list was devel oped by the Maryland Invasive Species Matrix Team (ISMT) based upon current conce rn or work with aquatic nuisance species (ANS) in Maryland, management plans for the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and information provided by Maryland Department of Natu ral Resources, Maryland Sea Grant, and Smithsonian Environmental Research Cente r (Appendix 1). High priority ranks were assigned to established species or speci es groups for which there is a high probability of negative economic and/or ecological impact. Red alert ranks were assigned for species that are not established, have a high p otential for introduction to Maryland either by natural range expansion or unauthorized i ntroductions, and have a high probability of negative economic and/or ecological impact. High probability of negative economic and/or ecological impact was primarily det ermined by experiences within the Maryland ISMT as well as whether the species was li sted as injurious by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, whether there was a State or Federal adopted management plan for the species, or whether negativ e impacts were indicated by a preponderance of studies in Maryland or other juris dictions. A rank of unknown was assigned to taxa that had little information allowi ng for a reasonable determination of potential economic or ecological impact. Some aqua tic species that have been introduced in Maryland waters do not constitute ANS and are ra nked low priority or remain unranked (Appendix 1). High Priority Freshwater Animals Northern snakehead (Channa argus )\u2014This species is native to Asia, yet has several populations in United States' waters, including Mar yland, Virginia, Delaware, and Washington, D.C. The species has been listed as inj urious wildlife under the Lacey Act (USFWS 2002: 67 Federal Register 62193, October 4, 2002). Since that time, it has become illegal to possess a live snakehead in Maryl and, Delaware, Virginia, and Washington, DC. Thus there are federal and Maryland regulations that prohibit the live import or possession of snakeheads. While laws have likely helped reduce illegal introductions, the species has naturally spread bey ond Potomac River and Nanticoke River, where it had been introduced. The species po ses a threat to native fishes and crustaceans and competes with other top predators, such as largemouth bass (Saylor et al. 2012; Love and Newhard 2012). Extirpation of specie s has not been documented in areas invaded by snakeheads. Control efforts to prevent t he spread of northern snakehead include the aforementioned ban, encouraging harvest and engaging the public in a broader dialogue to reduce propagule pressure and t he release of ANS. An ANSTF approved plan for control of snakeheads nationwide is available at: http://www.anstaskforce.gov/control.php Blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus )\u2014Native to some parts of North America, blue catfi sh were intentionally introduced into tidal waters of Virginia in the early 1970's as a sport fish. Since then, the species has spread to tidal P otomac River and throughout Maryland's 31 waterways through unauthorized introductions and na turally. The species is tolerant of brackish water (up to 17 ppt) and are utilizing hab itats in tidal estuarine portions of the Chesapeake Bay. Competition with native catfishes, and possibly predation by blue catfish on native catfishes, could lead to extirpat ion of native catfishes such as white catus ) and bullheads ( Amerius spp.). Blue catfish can grow to over 100 pounds and constitute a formidable predator capable of hig h levels of reproduction. Maryland currently has regulations to prevent release of liv e blue catfish from a different waterway than it was caught. There are also marketing campai gns aimed at reducing biomass of the species using harvest for human consumption and pro motion of non-consumptive uses such as fertilizers. A review of the final report o f the Sustainable Fisheries Goal Implementation Team Invasive Catfish Task Force (IC TF) can be accessed at: http://www.chesapeake.org/pubs/329_Bilkovic2014.pdf Flathead catfish (Pylodictus olivaris )\u2014Native to the Mississippi River drainage of North America, this species is now found in the Pot omac River, the upper Chesapeake Bay, and the Susquehanna, Elk and Sassafras Rivers. It was introduced to Occoquan Reservoir, Virginia, then spread to the Occoquan Ri ver, which is part of the Potomac River. There are individuals in the upper Potomac R iver, but origin of this fish introduction is unknown. The species also spread fr om the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania, where it was introduced, and into the upper Chesapeake Bay of Maryland. In suitable habitats, the species can quickly estab lish itself and amass large sizes (up to 1.4 m in length). The principal way the fish negati vely impacts aquatic ecosystems is through predation. The species eats primarily fish and crustaceans. Because of predation, it can quickly decimate native catfish populations and possibly sport fish, such as sunfish (Thomas 1993). The ICTF also consider flathead catf ish a potential problem and have reported on its natural history and recommendations for management at: http://www.chesapeake.org/pubs/329_Bilkovic2014.pdf Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha )\u2014Introduced with ship ballast to North America in the 1980s, the zebra mussel has caused s ignificant negative economic and ecological impacts to the Great Lakes region and ot her parts of the United States (Vitousek et al. 1996). It is a filter-feeding, sma ll bivalve that can inhabit fresh and slightly brackish waters. The species was first doc umented in Maryland in November 2008 at Conowingo Dam on the lower Susquehanna Rive r when a single dead adult was found in an American shad collection basket on the upstream side of the dam. Since then, additional zebra mussels have been collected on boa t hulls and other substrates in the surrounding area as well as on intake structures at two drinking water facilities. There is currently an established population in the lower Su squehanna River, both upstream and downstream of Conowingo Dam. As of 2014, zebra muss els have been collected in the upper Chesapeake Bay: Northeast River near Elk Neck , in the Sassafras River, and in Middle River. Because of the impacts documented in the Great Lakes and other invaded areas, its recent appearance in Maryland and possib le spread to other water bodies warrant concern. In 2002, a workshop was held to de velop species management strategies for some ANS, such as zebra mussel that had not bee n found in Maryland at the time 32 (Moser 2002). One of the major strategies included outreach, but additional strategies may be necessary now that the species is establishe d. A reporting system and more information on zebra mussel can be found at: clarkii ). All three of these species have been linked to declines of nativ e crayfishes in other regions where they have been introduced. These species currently represent the greatest threat to Maryland's native crayfish diversity. Virile crayfi sh, the most abundant and widespread ANS crayfish in Maryland, was first reported in the late 1950's from the Patapsco River. It is now found in 44 watersheds in Central and Wes tern Maryland. Its spread has been followed by the concomitant, precipitous decline of the native spinycheek crayfish ( in the region. These native crayfishes are now extirpated from many watersheds where virile cr ayfish is currently abundant. From extensive studies in other regions, these three ANS also have the capacity to adversely affect stream insects, mussels, snails, amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and sport fisheries and alter community structure and function (Hanson et a l. 1990; Olsen et al. 1991; Dorn and Mittelbach 2004). Aside from observed declines to n ative crayfishes, the impacts of these ANS on other aspects of Maryland's aquatic ecosyste ms are not well understood at this time but deserve further study. Although several ve ctors and pathways including the pet trade, biological supply trade, and aquaculture hav e played a role in the introduction of crayfishes in Maryland, bait bucket introductions b y anglers have been most responsible for the introduction and spread of these problemati c species. Based on a survey of Maryland's freshwater anglers conducted by MDDNR in 2008, the release of live, unused bait is a common practice among Maryland anglers - especially among anglers who use live crayfish. Of those anglers who used live crayf ish as bait, 69% reported releasing unused crayfish into Maryland waters (Kilian et al. 2012). Whirling disease\u2014 This disease is caused by a freshwater myxozoan ( Myxobolus cerebralis ) trout ( Oncorhyncus mykiss ) in Europe (Bartholomew and Reno 2002). It was subsequently i ntroduced to North America in the 1950's and Maryland in the 1990's. Whirling disease may have been introduced by anglers or by the introduction of an intermediate h ost into the North Branch of the Potomac River, from where the disease was introduce d to an open water hatchery that grew trout. Myxobolus cerebralis has a complicated life cycle and requires an intermediate host; a tubicifid oliogochaete. Interm ediate stage parasites released from these worms seek out very young trout. The parasite destroys cartilage in the head and spine. Whirling disease is often fatal to juvenile fish by causing neurological damage or skeletal abnormalities. This damage causes the youn g trout to swim in circles, or \"chase their tails\", and may cause the tail to blacken as the spine is damaged. Once the damage is done, the parasite enters a final, resistant spo re stage that is released once the fish dies and decomposes. The North Branch of Potomac River h as two streams that continue to carry the parasite. Whirling disease is tested for, monitored and is currently under control by MDDNR. 33 Mute swan (Cygnus olor )\u2014This ANS of the Chesapeake Bay watershed was intr oduced from Europe to the Atlantic coast in the late 1800' s. In Maryland, the species was first observed near Ocean City in 1954. While the populat ion was small for numerous years, after the 1980's population growth dramatically inc reased and resulted in a sizeable increase in range. The population increased dramati cally between 1986 and 1999 because control methods were not initiated. When control me thods were initiated (e.g., egg addling, removal of adult swans), the population de clined quickly to at least 1% of its reference size. Negative impacts from mute swan hav e included foraging impacts by lowering the biomass of submerged aquatic vegetatio n; and displacing state-threatened colonial water birds (e.g., terns). Mute swans have killed wetland birds and can be aggressive to humans. To date, efforts to reduce mu te swan populations in Maryland have been largely successful. Actions to maintain low bi omass of mute swan remain a high priority. A management plan to control the biomass of mute swan has been developed by the MDDNR appointed Mute Swan Task Force: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/irc/docs/00014261.pdf Nutria (Myocaster coypus )\u2014This prolific, aquatic rodent native to South Ame rica was introduced into the United States in the early 20 th century for fur farming and weed control. Individuals escaped or were intentionally released into Dorchester County in 1943, after which the population size increased to approximately 50,000 by the early 1990's. The species excavates plant roots, which le ads to marsh erosion and wetland destruction. In 2002, eradication of the species fr om the eastern shore of Maryland began at an expense of $20 million over 5 years. The proj ect has removed over 13,000 nutria from 150,000 acres in 5 eastern shore counties. As a result of the removals, the damaged marsh is recovering. Resulting actions from this pl an have greatly reduced nutria numbers on the eastern shore of Maryland, yet the s pecies still remains a threat. An interagency management plan by the Chesapeake Bay N utria Working Group was developed in 2003: http://www.fws.gov/chesapeakenutriaproject/PDFs/CNE P_strategic%20plan_3_2012.pdf Red Freshwater Animals bighead carp (H. nobilis )\u2014This freshwater fish from Asia was introduced to the Mis sissippi River basin in the 1970's to control algal growth in aquaculture. Carp escaped f rom those facilities shortly after they were brought from Asia. The species have widely spr ead throughout the Mississippi River and Ohio River basins in only 30 years. While the species has not yet been detected in Maryland, it is possible that it will arrive in Maryland from the Ohio River Basin by overland transport. Dams have slowed their expansio n on Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains are barriers to dispersal to Maryland. The species causes a hazard to navigation because of their tendency to l eap out of the water when startled. As silver carp leap from the water, boaters, jet skier s, and water skiers may be injured. The species may also negatively impact ecosystems by lo wering abundance of native mussels, invertebrates, and fishes. Foraging by silver carp ( Hypophthalmichthys molitrix ), an ANS 34 in the Mississippi River and Laurentian drainages ( Chen et al. 2007) will severely deplete plankton resources in otherwise plankton-rich areas (Spataru and Gophen 1985; Cooke and Hill 2010). Control programs include hydrologic separation and electric barriers to prevent spread of the species, as well as rotenone application to kill carp in some areas. Recently, control programs to market the species co mmercially as food have been recently attempted, though it is not clear whether these markets will lower biomass of these species. Asian swamp eel (Monopterus albus )\u2014This fish from Asia has been introduced through the commercial food fish trade or aquarium trade to Florida, Georgia, and Hawaii. In 2008 and 2012, the species was caught in Silver Lak e (Gibbsboro, NJ) and the population is considered established. Because the species was collected incidentally from Lake Needwood in 2013 (MD) and because of the likelihood of establishment in Maryland if introduced, this species poses a threat to Maryland waters. The species is an opportunistic forager, but ecological impacts in North America ar e relatively unknown. The species spread slowly in the Everglades, consuming small fi shes, crayfish and insects (Shafland et al. 2009). Control measures have been implemente d in the Florida Everglades, including a combination of electrical barriers, veg etation removal, and trapping. In Maryland, it is illegal to import, transport, purch ase, possess, propagate, sell or release a live Asian swamp eel. Round goby (Neogobius melanostomus )\u2014This euryhaline species is native to Europe and has become established in the Great Lakes (Char lebois et al. 2001). It was introduced by ballast water into the Great Lakes. The species has not been collected in Maryland. It consumes benthic organisms, such as worms and zebra mussels. It is considered an aggressive competitor that may outcompete native be nthic fishes for prey or nesting habitats. Because it also consumes zebra mussel, th e species may benefit the Great Lakes region by helping to lower abundances of zebra muss el. New Zealand Mud Snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum )\u2014This species is a small euryhaline (< 15 ppt) mollusk with an elongated she ll (Costil et al. 2001; G\u00e9rard et al. 2003). The species is native to lakes of New Zealan d and was first discovered in Snake River (Idaho) in 1987, but was introduced to the Gr eat Lakes of North America through ballast water releases and also to several waterway s of western United States through contaminated waters shipped with game fish. The spe cies has not yet been collected in Maryland. The animal grazes on plant and animal det ritus as well as periphytic algae. It is also ovivivparous and parthenogenic, which likely c ontributed to its rapid range expansion once introduced. Its range expansion may also be due to transport by fishes that ingest the snail and pass it live through its digestive tract or by anglers and boaters on contaminated gear. The species may alter primary pr oduction of streams and spread rapidly (EPA 2008). Control methods have included c hemical treatment of water bodies and introduction of parasites from New Zealand. Pre venting introduction has included boat and equipment decontamination. 35 High Priority Freshwater is a that uses sta lks to attach to streambed material. Native to Canadian cool water streams, didymo has been reported in the United States for over 100 years; h owever, blooms are occurring now with increasing frequency and intensity, and in 2008 did ymo was first discovered in Maryland tributaries of Gunpowder River. Subsequently, the d iatom was discovered in other Maryland rivers including the Savage River in 2009, the North Branch of Potomac River in 2011, and Big Hunting Creek in 2012. Didymo can form massive blooms that smother streambeds and adversely affect freshwater fish, pl ant, and invertebrate species by depriving them of habitat (Root and O'Reilly 2012, and references therein). Blooms may also impact recreational opportunities and several methods of decontamination have been investigated (Root and O'Reilly 2012). This species forms blooms in fast-flowing, cold, nutrient-limited waters. After its discovery, MDDNR took action to educate the public and to prevent spread by installing wader wash stat ions to encourage anglers to clean their waders free of didymo. In 2011, MDDNR impleme nted a policy to ban felt-soled waders spread of didymo. Brazilian elodea (Egeria densa )\u2014This species was likely released from the aquariu m trade. The species is native to South America, was originally imported to the United States for the aquarium trade, and has a high capac ity of growth (Pistori et al. 2004). It may have spread in Maryland by boaters or naturally through fragmentation. The species can form thick and dense mats of vegetation that ou tcompete native aquatic plants. The mats often interfere with swimming, boating, fishin g, or other recreational uses of waterbodies. Control of Brazilian elodea has been p erformed by mechanical and chemical means as well as biological control by triploid gra ss carp. Hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata )\u2014This species is a waterweed that is native to Asi a, Europe, Africa, and Australia. A common aquarium pl ant, it was first introduced to Florida in 1960s and is established in many areas o f the United States. It is possible that Hydrilla was introduced to Maryland from the aquarium trade . It became abundant in the tidal Potomac River in the 1980s following massive losses of submerged vegetation (Rybicki and Landwehr 2007). Stems grow up to 1 - 2 m and leaves are arranged in whorls. The species has a high tolerance to salinit y and reproduces by fragmentation and rhizomes. The density of Hydrilla causes problems for boat traffic and for recreatio nal angling. Control of the plant using herbicides in D eep Creek Lake cost Maryland approximately $205,000 in 2014. Herbicides are most commonly used by MDDNR to control the biomass of the species in impoundments and ponds. In tidal rivers and impoundments, mechanical harvesters have been used; but this technique has been discontinued as it is expensive and labor intensive . Yellow iris (Iris pseudacorus )\u2014 Native to Europe, Asia and Africa, this flowering perennial has been cultivated as an ornamental plan t and has become established as an invasive species in some regions. The species is c apable of outcompeting native iris species depending on habitat conditions (Pathikonda et al. 2009). The species creates dense, monotypic stands in waters up to a foot deep . It rapidly spreads in freshwater 36 wetlands and riparian areas, encroaching into habit ats occupied by several Maryland threatened and endangered plants including beaked rhizomes and water- dispersed seeds. The rhizomes are toxic to livesto ck, and may be to people. It is widespread in the continental United States and sta nds outside cultivation have been documented in Maryland. In Maryland, the species wa s listed as a Tier 1 species by Maryland's Invasive Plant Advisory Committee--as of 4/11/2016. It is illegal to propagate, import, transfer, sell, purchase, transp ort, or introduce any living part of this species; possession is still allowed. Purple loosestrife (Lythum salicaria )\u2014This species is a wetland plant from Europe and Asia. It was transported into North America in the 1800's as seeds and plant parts by ballast water of sailing ships (Allen and Strain 20 13). After its initial introduction, the plant spread naturally among canals and ditches as well as intentionally as European colonists transplanted the species believing it cou ld be used for medicinal healing. The species competes with many native wetland plants an d forms dense stands that reduce food and nesting sites for native species. The MDDN R began a biological and chemical control program in 2007 with State Highway Administ ration (SHA) and Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) to eradicate purple loosestrife. Using citizens as scouts for locations of the plants, MDA raised and released beetles as biocontrol agents. Biological controls have been used in addition to h and-pulling and chemical treatments. Of these, chemical treatment was considered highly effective. Currently, Maryland has only a few stands of purple loosestrife. People can report purple tropical parts of Asia, marsh dayflower was accidentally introduced into th e United States in South Carolina around 1935. It is an annual, emergent plant that i nvades wetlands and forms dense mats that out-compete native vegetation. It was first r eported in Maryland in 1949 from Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge (Riefner and Hill 1983) and has since become well- established in coastal areas. It is found in freshw ater marshes, pond edges, ditches, streams and will likely spread into every county in Maryland over time (pers. comm. Wesley Knapp, MDDNR). Control includes hand pulling and root removal to ensure depletion of the seed source. The species readily reproduces from vegetative fragments and can spread with mechanical removal. Parrot feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum )\u2014Native to South America, it is a popular plant for aquatic gardens in the United States beca use of its attractiveness. It was first found in Maryland in 1948 at the C&O Canal Angler's Club based on an herbarium specimen located at the Natural Museum of Natural H istory (#2231415). Once introduced, the species aggressively colonizes and dominates lakes, ponds, and ditches because of its ability to spread readily through fr agmentation and tolerate different water levels (Hussner et al. 2009). In water bodies where the species dominates, the plant can entirely cover the surface and make it difficult fo r boaters, swimmers, or anglers to utilize the waterway. Control methods are often expensive a nd include mechanical removal. 37 Eurasian milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum )\u2014Native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa, this species was commonly sold as an aquarium plant in the United States. It is now found throughout much of the Nation and has been es tablished in several eastern states since at least the 1890's based upon an herbarium s pecimen collected in 1895 from Carroll Island, Haw Cove. It is abundant in many Ma ryland waterbodies (Rybicki and Landwehr 2007) and continues to spread by boat trai lers and human transport. The species forms dense mats that can shade out other p lans and its thick mats can negatively affect recreation such as swimming and fishing. Clo gging caused by the mats may also interfere with power generation and irrigation. Mil foil reproduces quickly through seeds and fragmentation and can infest an entire lake wit hin two years of introduction. Once established, the species is difficult or impossible to eradicate. Control methods have included herbicides, underwater rototilling, hand p ulling and triploid grass carp. Common reed (Phragmites australis )\u2014This species is a wetland plant found throughout the United States and Maryland's wetland habitats. Both native and introduced genotypes of this species currently exist in North America. T he origin of the species is unclear and it natively occurs in many areas of North America. The non-native genotypes may have been introduced in ballast material in late 1700's or early 1800's from Europe. The species is long-lived and can grow up to 6 m high. It can reproduce by seed, but more often reproduces asexually by rhizomes. The species forms dense, monotypic stands that exclude other plant species. Control methods have i ncluded herbicide, hand-pulling, and burning. A draft management plan was developed for common reed (Moser 2002). More information on controlling Phragmites life/Phragmites.aspx water chestnut was first observ ed near Concord, Massachusetts in 1879 (Hummel and Kiv iat 2004). This species has since become established in many states, including Maryla nd. It was first discovered in Maryland in the Potomac River in 1923 (Gwathmey 194 5). Removal of water chestnut from Potomac River cost millions of dollars in 1965 . It was later discovered and removed in 2014 from Potomac River by Virginia Department o f Game and Inland Fisheries. In the 1990's it was also found in Bird River (near Ba ltimore, MD) and Sassafras River (upper Chesapeake Bay)--removal costs totaled $80,0 00 over a 10-year period (Moser 2002). The pathway of introduction is unknown. It i s prohibited from sale in most southern states. Once established, the species form s dense floating mats that limit light and reduce dissolved oxygen levels. Its fruits have sharp spines that can cause painful puncture wounds when stepped on, even penetrating s hoe leather. Manual removals by certified individuals and chemical treatments are u sed to remove the plants; eradication is difficult because seeds lay dormant for up to 12 ye ars. The management plan is at: http://www.anstaskforce.gov/Species%20plans/Water%2 0Chestnut%20Mgt%20Plan.pdf 38 )\u2014A small carnivorous plant native to Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, waterwheel has whorls o f small leaves that help trap small arthropods and insect larvae. The species has gone extinct throughout much of its native range and only 50 known locations still have viable populations (Cross 2012). It is cultivated for sale on the World Wide Web and may b e available in the aquarium or aquatic garden trade. It has been found in New Jers ey, New York, coastal Virginia and Maryland. In Maryland the species has been found in Prince Georges County, but it is not common. The species can be spread by movement of wa terfowl and plants sticking to the feet of birds. It can also be spread by water flow and flooding. Common water-hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes )\u2014This species is native to South America, yet it has been widely introduced to North America. In 1884 the plants were given away as gifts at an expo in New Orleans (Gett ys 2014). The plants rapidly became a problem because of overgrowth in rivers that led to fish death and shipping hazards. The species has been controlled with chemicals, mec hanical removal, and biological control agents. The species was found in 1998 in Fr esh Pond (near mouth of Potomac River; Scotland, Maryland), and in three counties i n 2007, but apparently did not survive the winter. It was documented as overwintering in D orchester County in 2015. English water grass (Glyceria maxima )\u2014This species is a perennial, riverbank and pond oriented grass that is native to Europe and Asia. As a flood tolerant species capable of exchanging gasses using air-filled cavities within roots (Rees and Wilson 1984), it competes with native grasses and is a noxious weed outside of its native range. The species reproduces primarily by means of rhizomes. It was first introduced into North America in 1940 at the edge of Lake Ontario. Since then the species spread to New England. It has not yet been reported in Maryland. European frog-bit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae )\u2014Native to Europe, Asia and Africa, the species was introduced to Ottawa (Canada) as an orn amental plant in 1932. It spread to several rivers and Great Lakes shortly thereafter ( O'Neill 2007). The species grows rapidly, forming dense floating mats in slow-moving waters or ponds and lakes. As it can grow quickly, large die-offs in fall leads to h igh levels of decomposition and reduced oxygen in the water. The species crowds native pla nts, hinders swimmers and boaters, clogs canals and streams, and can negatively affect fishes and other aquatic life. It has been found in New York and Vermont, but not yet Mar yland. East Indian hygrophilia (Hygrophila polysperma )\u2014An herbaceous perennial from Asia, the species was introduced via the aquarium i ndustry to Florida in the 1950's and then to Richmond (VA). It grows in waters up to 10 feet deep, along stream and lake edges, forming dense stands of stems that can shade native submersed species and clog drainage channels and pipes. It is controlled in ar eas where it has been introduced (Cuda and Sutton 2009). It has a minimum temperature tole rance of 39 \u00b0F, optimal growth at 71-82\u00b0 F, and may not overwinter in Maryland. It i s listed as a Federal Noxious Weed and has not yet been reported in Maryland. 39 Yellow floating heart (Nymphoides peltata )\u2014A rooted perennial, waterlily-like plant native to Eastern Asia and the Mediterranean, the s pecies grows in ponds, channels and slow-moving water. It broadly carpets water surface s with long-stalked heart-shaped leaves, negatively affecting recreational activitie s, native plants and creating stagnant areas with low dissolved oxygen below the dense mat s of leaves. It can reproduce through fragmentation as well as seed. It is widely sold as a water garden ornamental, yellow floating hear has been purposefully and acci dentally released outside cultivation (Countryman 1970). USGS has documented non-indigeno us populations in Washington, D.C., and 29 states, but not yet in Maryland. Giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta )\u2014A floating fern from southern Brazil, this specie s was probably introduced to the United States through th e aquarium and garden-pond trade. It can also be spread by boaters. It is one of the wor ld's worst aquatic weeds (Thomas and Room 1986). A rapidly growing plant that can double its numbers in 2 - 10 days, it completely covers waterways and shades out native a quatic plants. As it dies, decomposition of plant tissues can cause hypoxia. I t does not survive below 24\u00b0 F or in water that freezes during winter. Eradication is pr actically impossible by hand. Small infestations can be controlled by hand, however, an d should be done immediately. A weevil ( Cyrtobagous salviniae ) has been introduced into 13 countries for biocont rol. While it does not currently occur in Maryland, its impacts elsewhere and difficultness to control warrant its red alert classification. High Priority Marine Animals and Plants European green crab (Carcinus maenas )\u2014This species is native to the Atlantic coasts of Europe and Africa. The European green crab was i ntroduced to Massachusetts in the mid-1800's, probably through ballast water. In Mary land, the species was discovered in the coastal bays near Ocean City Inlet around 1996. It is currently found in Isle of Wight Bay. The species commonly occupies rocky jetties, b ulkheads, and other structures and forages over open flats and tidal marshes. Growing to a maximum size of 3 inches, green crabs can survive in a wide range of salinity and t emperatures, but has poor reproduction below 20 ppt and 10\u00b0 C (Hines et al., 2004). Green crabs are legally sold as bait in Maryland, yet the state recommends that unused bait be discarded on shore and not returned to the water. The escape of live bait is c urrently not monitored. Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinesis )\u2014This species is native to Asia. It has been reported from Chesapeake Bay. It is a small, brown crab with distinct \"hairy\" white- tipped claws. Only a small number of Chinese mitten crabs have been collected from Chesapeake Bay since it was confirmed in 2006 at th e mouth of Patapsco River. It is tolerant of variable habitat conditions and salinit ies, and can spread fast once established. None have been confirmed from upstream freshwater h abitats where they spend most of their lives. If a Chinese mitten crab is caught, it is encouraged that the crab be kept on ice and reported to Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. A Chinese Mitten Crab Watch has been developed to help the general public report occurrences of mitten crab: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/dnrnews/infocus/mitten_c rab.asp . 40 Japanese shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus )\u2014This species is native to the western North Pacific. Japanese shore crabs have been found from Massachusetts to North Carolina in the mid to upper rocky intertidal zones (McDermott 1997). In Maryland, the species has been collected in coastal lagoons, Isle of Wight, Sinepuxent Bay and Chincoteague Bay. It was presumably released during bait discards. The small species (shell width < 50 mm) has light and dark bands on t heir legs and red spots on the claws. The species lives in shallow waters and oyster reef s, but impacts of the species are still unknown. Red Alert Marine Animals and Plants Lionfish (Pterois volitans and P. miles )\u2014This species was introduced to the South Atlantic Bight from Florida in the 1980's or 1990's either because Hurricane Andrew destroyed an aquarium or because of intentional, il legal introductions prior to the hurricane (Schofield 2009). The species is native t o the Indo-Pacific. It has quickly colonized reefs of the South Atlantic Bight and has spread to the Caribbean. In rare cases, young lionfish have traveled along the Gulf Stream and northward to the Long Island Sound (Fire Island, New York). Currently, the speci es is continuously distributed from Miami, Florida to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Wh ile the species has not been collected in Maryland waters, it is possible that c hanges in the direction of the Gulf Stream or warming waters will result in lionfish co lonizing reefs offshore and near Assateague Island or Ocean City, Maryland. The spec ies can negatively impact reef communities through predation (Albins and Hixon 200 8) and poses a human health risk because of its venomous spines. Asian horseshoe crab (Tachypleus spp.)\u2014There are three species that have been considered for import, T. gigas , T. tridentatus , and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda . Asian horseshoe crabs were imported by the bait industry and if introduced, they could also introduce non-native parasites and pathogens that t hreaten native horseshoe crab (or other species). These parasites and pathogens could also cause human health risks from neurotoxins (tetrodotoxin) that are found in C. rotundicauda (Kanchanapongkul 2008). For these reasons, Maryland banned the import of As ian horseshoe crabs in 2013 (Classification of Non-native Aquatic Organisms. An notated Code of Maryland \u00a7 08.02.19.04). 41 MANAGEMENT PLAN Plan Goal The goal of the Maryland ANSP is to fully implement a coordinated strategy that minimizes risk of establishment by ANS along known pathways by 2020 and when possible, stop the spread of ANS in Maryland and er adicate or control ANS to a minimal level of impact. Plan Objectives 1) Prevent new and additional introductions of ANS to Marylan d waters; 2) Establish an early detection and rapid response mechanism to find, contain, and/or eradicate newly introduced species; 3) Control and slow the spread of existing ANS in Maryland. Plan Strategies, Actions and Funding 1. Prevent new and additional ANS introductions to Mar yland waters 1.1 Strategy Assess relative risk of new aquatic species introdu ctions 1.1.1 Action Develop greater coordination with MAPAIS, ANSTF, ne ighboring state agencies and among Maryland universities, agencies and organizat ions involved with invasive species management. Use existing ANS Management Plans from neighboring states to identify lead agencies and contact information of individual s responsible for ANS management. For states without ANS Management Plans, biologists working in relevant aquatic ecosystems will be identified from collegiate conta ct lists and participant lists from conferences such as Northeast Association of Fish a nd Wildlife Agencies. Ensure representation of neighboring jurisdictions, academ ia, and Maryland agencies at MDDNR ISMT meetings. 1.1.2 Action Review and update lists of red alert and high prior ity species listed in Appendix 1. The list can be reviewed and modified at annual meeting s of MDDNR ISMT, as appropriate. 42 1.1.3 Action Review and recommend use of an appropriate risk ass essment when new aquatic species are detected, and for red alert and high priority s pecies listed in Appendix 1. Risk assessments include aquatic animal risk assessment, pathogen risk assessments, Science- Based Tools for Assessing Invasion Risk (STAIR), an d Fish Invasiveness Scoring Kit (FISK) (see Implementation Table). Reviews may be p erformed during annual MDDNR ISMT meetings, with recommendations provided by the Chair. 1.1.4 Action Rank red alert and high priority species listed in Appendix 1 according to risk and generate species-specific actions for prevention or control for species with high levels of risk. Of listed red alert and high priority species in Maryland, the percentage of species with existing risk assessments (www.fws.gov/fisheri es/ANS/species_erss_reports.html; or elsewhere in literature) will be calculated and tracked across years. Risk assessments for some ANS may need to be conducted. Assessments will be provided on-line to the general public, Wetland, Fishing, Waterways, Aquacu lture permitting and licensing authorities or other parties with interest within M DDNR or other cooperating agencies, when needed. 1.1.5 Action Develop a distribution list of State partners with ANS information websites. Provide webmasters with risk assessments and rankings of sp ecies for on-line distribution. 1.2 Strategy Analyze and assess risk of vector pathways of int roduction 1.2.1 Action Use NISC/ANSTF pathway analysis and ranking system to rank and determine the relative risk of ANS introduction through known vec tor pathways (Orr et al. 2005). The ISMT will coordinate the use of or use procedures d eveloped by NISC and ANSTF to rank pathways. 1.2.2 Action As new information becomes available review and upd ate pathway rankings. With annual meetings of ISMT and as the ANSP is reviewed (see P lan Review), the rankings of pathways may be updated based upon information lear ned from the NISC/ANSTF pathway analysis and ranking system. 1.2.3 Action Develop a distribution list of State partners with ANS information websites and distribute vector pathway list and rankings to webmasters. 43 1.2.4 Action Support research to identify critical control point s for each known vector pathway (Whitehead and Orriss 2015) by identifying: 1) stak eholders, including a list of wholesale and retail distributors of live animals; 2) socioec onomic and cultural barriers to interruption of vector pathways; and 3) species of greatest risk or concern. The number of pathways identified in the ANS Management Plan with the necessary details (e.g., critical points) will be tallied to improve that number over time by ISMT. 1.3 Strategy Take actions to remove or minimize risk of new sp ecies introductions or within pathways of introductio n 1.3.1 Action For some impounded waters such as Deep Creek Lake, create a watercraft inspection process that includes visual inspection, vessel mov ement and docking history, boat washing stations, and/or penalties for launching ve ssels that carry potential ANS. The creation of the watercraft inspection process will be available on-line and accompanied with education and outreach material to encourage u se of the process. 1.3.2 Action Assess existing laws and regulations to determine t heir adequacy for preventing introduction or spread of ANS, especially for invas ive catfish, in order to provide consistent policies Bay-wide. A committee will be e stablished to work with Maryland Sea Grant Law Clinic and University of Maryland Env ironmental Law Clinic and/or an intern will be hired to review proposed laws or reg ulation that relate to ANS and describe laws or regulation in future revisions. Meet with N atural Resources Police to ensure that existing legislation and regulation is enforceable and understandable. 1.3.3 Action Hold stakeholder meetings to develop legislation or regulation to reduce, minimize or eliminate ANS introductions. Meet with Natural Res ources Police to ensure that developing legislation and regulation is enforceabl e and understandable. 44 1.4 Strategy Identify and use existing outreach and education tools, and design and disseminate additional outreach and educational tools, as needed, to raise awareness of the con sequences of ANS introduction. 1.4.1 Action Identify or develop (when needed) education program s aimed at preventing introduction of new species using on-line materials, materials f or zoos and aquariums, and guest lecturers or materials for K-12, community colleges , or 4-year universities. Where possible, the type and number of education programs identified and developed to slow spread of ANS will be determined for State partners , including programs regarding watercraft inspection. These education programs may be referenced on-line with the MDDNR ISMT website. Build relationships between MDD NR and non-profit organizations to facilitate the transfer of educati on or outreach materials regarding ANS. 1.4.2 Action Create outreach and teaching materials, as necessar y, in appropriate languages for targeted stakeholder groups, including fishing orga nizations, applicants for boating registration and fishing licenses, outdoor clubs, a nd corporate groups. The availability of such materials for various audiences, such as trave ling exhibits, will be determined during annual MDDNR ISMT meetings to identify gaps in outreach. The distribution of these materials in the State and mid-Atlantic Regio n will be monitored to expand the number and distribution over time 1.4.3 Action Develop and disseminate outreach materials for reli gious groups who routinely engage in \"mercy releases\" to educate them about the ecologic al and economic consequences of new species introductions and provide native altern atives. The number and diversity of products for different cultures and faith based org anizations will be determined to identify existing gaps in outreach offerings. 1.5 Funding The cost of the accomplishing all proposed solution s for regulating pathways and assessing risk of introductions is estimated at $33 0,000/yr. Approximately 68% of these costs are associated with purchasing supplies and m aterials for outreach and education aimed at awareness and prevention. These supply cos ts could include traveling or on-loan exhibits to k-12, community colleges and 4-year uni versities. A smaller fraction (~ 32%) of this money is expected to be spent on staff time to implement watercraft inspection procedures, conduct research, and help establish cr itical control points. Most of this funding is not continuous funding, with the excepti on of salary for watercraft inspection personnel. There is in-kind support from the MDDNR ISMT (salary of biologists, printing costs for reports). Funding sources includ e the State of Maryland and ANSTF. 45 2. Establish an early detection and rapid response mechanism to find, contain, and/or eradicate newly introduced species. 2.1 Strategy Compare existing databases and reporting systems to adopt a statewide database for newly introduced speci es. 2.1.1 Action Identify and describe available reporting databases . At a minimum, the following databases will be reviewed by ISMT for their curre nt and potential use: iMapInvasives (www.impainvasives.org); National Exotic Marine and Estuarine Species Information System (NEMESIS)(invasions.si.edu/nemesis); USGS No nindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) Database (nas.er.usgs.gov). 2.1.2 Action Adopt and use a reporting database that is a search able repository for observations of new species introductions. An on-line service will be i dentified to support statewide needs. Participation in the service will be measured as in formation acquired. Metrics could include number of site visits per year and number o f requests (data additions, data requests) made per year. 2.1.3 Action Periodically assess availability of new reporting d atabases to improve simplicity and efficacy of reporting. During review of the ANSP ( see Plan Review), the availability of new reporting databases will be identified and disc ussed for inclusion as part of the review process. 2.1.4 Action Develop list of taxonomic experts who will assist i dentification and verification of newly discovered species, when necessary. Individuals may be added to the national ANSTF experts database. 46 2.2 Strategy Engage Maryland public by establishing a citizen-sc ience, newly introduced species detection program for t argeted watersheds. 2.2.1 Action Develop a social media platform that adheres to a h igh standard of professionalism to assist the public in reporting new species occurren ces, responding to the public in a timely manner, and incorporating that information i nto national reporting databases. A social media platform such as Maryland DNR's Angler s' Log can be used to report and provide pictures of ANS (fishingreports.dnr@marylan d.gov). The number of Maryland ANS reported using the social media platform can be quantified to help assess its value. 2.2.2 Action Advertise the citizen-science program and train ste wards to identify native or existing species correctly. Citizen-science programs such a s the Maryland Naturalist program and Maryland's Envirothon may infuse both native specie s and ANS identification. Some information is available on-line via fact sheets pr ovided on the MDDNR website. Additionally, participation in Maryland's State Fai r can also promote awareness and identification of native species and ANS. 2.3 Strategy Establish monitoring capabilities or program within Maryland waters. 2.3.1 Action Assess feasibility and statistical reliability of u sing and eDNA detection system in Maryland waters for red alert species. The eDNA sy stem will be assessed using a summary of literature reviews and results from on-g oing research by University of Notre Dame. 2.3.2 Action Develop fishery independent programs, when possible , to monitor for high priority or red alert species using aquatic surveys for plants, ben thic organisms, or fishes. 47 2.4 Strategy Establish a Rapid Response Plan for newly introdu ced species, utilizing the Incident Command System s tructure. 2.4.1 Action Identify relevant federal, state, regional and priv ate organizations for an Incident Command System (see Appendix 2). The ISMT will use Appendices herein to develop a table of such organizations and the pathways for wh ich they have responsibility. This table will be added to the ANSP. 2.4.2 Action Develop and/or adopt a Rapid Response Plan for Mary land using Smits and Moser (2009), which encourages an appropriate coordinatin g agency and establishes an Incident Command System team when implementing the rapid res ponse. Several plans may be identified to consider responses towards specific s pecies, habitats, or jurisdictions where the response will occur. The number of incidents wi thin a year will be monitored over time and will be noted in future revisions of this ANSP. 2.4.3 Action Identify funding sources for supporting rapid respo nse activities. A list of funding sources are identified within this ANSP, but more m ay be identified during annual ISMT meetings. These funding sources will be amended to the Implementation Table in the ANSP along with the action that may be addressed wi th the money as the ANSP is reviewed. 2.4.4 Action Routinely train Incident Command Team members for a rapid response (see http://training/fema.gov/IS/ ). Positions will be identified for the rapid respo nse plan, once adopted, by ISMT and State partners, when needed. T he number of filled positions and the training of those positions will be tracked as a measure of success. 2.4.5 Action Identify laws that require notification of ANS dete ction to the public, to law enforcement, and to federal authorities. A committee will be est ablished to review proposed laws or regulations that relate to ANS, when needed. 48 2.5 Funding The estimated cost for achieving these actions is $ 150,000/yr. Approximately 67% of this will be spent in salary. There is in-kind sup port by MDDNR for development of a social media platform that can be utilized by an in formed public to report exotic species. This notification system could depend upon the publ ic's knowledge of ANS, which could require funding for signs and education, or simply on the public's willingness to report an unknown species. Approximately 33% of requested fun ding will be spent on materials to conduct additional surveys in Maryland to monitor f or high priority and red alert species. There are also numerous state and university fish/b enthic surveys that may lead to detection of exotic species. Some surveys have a lo ng history in Maryland, including: the Striped Bass Seine Survey, the Tidal Bass Survey, M aryland Biological Stream Survey, The Hart-Miller Island Exterior Monitoring Program, and Coastal Bay Program's surveys. Faculty of Maryland universities report ca tch results of their aquatic surveys as a condition of their scientific collection permit iss ued by MDDNR. There is in-kind support to initiate a Rapid Response Plan, but no f unding to foster collaboration among inter-agency officials and no funding for training individuals who participate with the Incident Command Team. Potential funding sources in clude the State of Maryland, MAPAIS, and ANSTF. 49 3. Control and slow spread of existing ANS species 3.1 Strategy For high priority ANS, determine if harvest and bio mass removal are effective tools to control and slow the spread of ANS. 3.1.1 Action Conduct studies and review studies for high priorit y species to determine the most effective tools for removing ANS. These projects, w hen funded, will be evaluated by analyzing data and determining if the specific obje ctives of the project are met. For example, an objective may be to reduce annual bioma ss and the level of reduction can be determined by comparing annual estimates of biomass . 3.2 Strategy Enact statutes and regulations that criminalize, stigmatize and exact penalties for human-mediated spread o f ANS. 3.2.1 Action Implement laws that interrupt pathways of introduct ion that cause ANS range expansions. The Natural Resources Police report violations of l aws and these violations may be categorized into those that interrupt pathways. Pat hways with numerous violations may be prioritized (see also Strategy 1.2). 3.2.2 Action Examine existing laws for considering new or revise d regulations that improve control or slow spread of existing ANS by using methods employ ed by Environmental Law Institute and the National Sea Grant Law Clinic. A list of e xisting laws aimed at controlling and slowing spread of existing ANS will be created by I SMT and provided online via the MDDNR Invasive Species website. 3.2.3 Action Develop training materials or programs for training Natural Resource Police officers in ANS identification and law. Routine engagements wi th law enforcement will provide current information on status of ANS. Some training information is available as fact sheets and on-line via the MDDNR Invasive Species w ebsite. These engagements will be made annually or as needed to improve training of o fficers. Training will be provided by appropriate staff, such as members of ISMT. 50 3.3 Strategy Implement removal or containment actions to contr ol biomass or prevent natural spread 3.3.1 Action Identify high priority ANS that can be routinely, c ost-effectively, and practically controlled for biomass and implement strategies tha t engage the public or partners in those control efforts. This ANSP provides a listing of high priority ANS and potential control methods for those species. Strategies that can be additionally used include cooperative messaging on packaging on live seafood, in pet stores, incentives such as a bait buy-back program, or harvest incentives. The u se of these strategies depends on available funding and cooperation among stakeholder s. 3.3.2 Action Restore ecosystems impacted by ANS using native spe cies, when necessary, to help produce natural communities and reduce long-term ma intenance costs. Restoration with non-ANS species may be necessary to control the imp act by ANS. A review of the level to which habitats can be restored from ANS impacts should be conducted to establish management targets or expectations from restoration . Research projects aimed at restoration may then be conducted with specific obj ectives achieved for each study. 3.3.3 Action Report level of biomass removed to stakeholders, al ong with costs. Level of biomass harvested for selected high priority ANS can be rep orted each year on-line or in technical reports. The MDDNR Invasive Species website provide s a framework for reporting actions taken to control high priority ANS. 3.4 Funding Requested funding for accomplishing these actions i s $175,000 and this funding is requested on a continuous basis to fund staffing an d control mechanisms. Approximately 43% of that is requested for salary, with $50,000 r equested each year. There is no dedicated financial support for biologists to slow the spread or control biomass of aquatic nuisance and well-established species. The remainin g 57% of the funding is requested for supplies and material costs. However, the cost of implementing control strategies could be in the millions, depending on the species or wat erway. Funding sources may include those from ANSTF, CBP, NOAA, MDSG, MAPAIS, USFWS, N ational Fish and Wildlife Foundation, or State of Maryland. 51 Implementation Table .

The breadth and experience of MDDNR in partnership with existing au thorities given in Appendix 2 will identify progress toward actions identified in the implementation table. Progress toward actions is measurable and described in the Program Evaluation section of the Implementation Table. Implementing this ANSP by 202 0 will require progress toward all actions, though not all actions will have measurabl e or successful outcomes. In most cases the implementation of actions depends on available funding and staffing. Funding from State and Federal sources depends on b udgets created by legislatures whose priorities may be different than those expres sed in this ANSP. In cases when additional cost is listed as $0, the implementation of the action can depend on priorities of the lead organization. While additional money may n ot be needed to implement the action, priorities for staff time may be different than those expressed in this ANSP. When funding and staffing is sufficiently available , the success of projects aimed at controlling biomass or impacts by ANS also depends on the habitat or environmental factors. The ability to remove biomass of ANS or to minimize impacts and spread of ANS can depend on weather, flooding, water temperat ures, and access to areas by humans. While successful implementation of action i tems is challenging, progress over time will be noted within the framework of the ANSP review, which is a transparent evolution of work toward achieving objectives and m aximizing success of reaching goals set herein. Measurable output from Program Evaluation will be i ncluded in future reviews of the ANSP. Significant revisions will be added to the co urse of plan development in Appendix 3. If required, public comments regarding actions o r revisions will be appended to Appendix 4. Considerations for review and revision will address: Updating the Implementation Table with achieved or partially achieved actions within objective. Noting new vector pathways Noting new efforts to prevent introductions using d econtamination or other methods Noting the number of new introductions Updating the list of known ANS in Maryland (see App endix 3) with total acreage of habitat occupied by the ANS in Maryland (or a specified subwatershed); and/or the relative abundance index or abundance or ranked abundance of the ANS in Maryland (or a speci fied subwatershed) Noting whether or not ANS has led to a listing of n ative species as a Federal and/or State species in need of conservatio n. Noting whether natural, climatic ecosystem changes have reduced effectiveness of management actions.

Ranking Aquatic Species as ANS Non-native species that may be or are currently dis tributed in Maryland because of direct or indirect introductions by humans. This list was developed by the Maryland Invasive Species Matrix Team based upon current concern or w ork with aquatic nuisance species (ANS) in Maryland, management plans for the Chesape ake Bay watershed, and information provided by Maryland Department of Natu ral Resources, Maryland Sea Grant, and Smithsonian Environmental Research Cente r. This is an incomplete list and will be updated with new information as it becomes available. A rank prioritizes each species for its level of concern: Red Alert (RED), High (HIGH), Low (LOW), Unknown (UNK). Species ranked as high priority or red alert are considered ANS. i = introduction, not established; e = established population; nr = n ot reported in Maryland.

Additional Introduced Species (NEMESIS) Invertebrate species tabled here are in addition to those of Table 1 and are established introduced species in Chesapeake Bay watershed, as listed in the National Exotic Marine and Estuarine Species Information System (NEMESIS). The database NEMESIS was developed by Smithsonian Environmental Research Cen ter (SERC) as a national database of marine and estuarine invasions of the continenta l United States and Alaska. These invertebrates are not currently ranked as ANS in Ma ryland in Table 1 because more research is needed to reach consensus regarding the ir threat to aquatic resources in Maryland. In time as research is conducted and con sensus reached regarding their threat in Maryland, these species may be ranked on the lis t of ANS in Maryland. Vectors are: A (Accidental, fisheries); B (Ballast, water or dry ); C (Canal); D (Discard bait); I (Intentional, fisheries); N (Natural dispersal); S (Ship cargo or fouling); T (Trade, packing or plant shipments or pet releases).

EXISTING AUTHORITIES AND PROGRAMS 87 Maryland waters include streams and non-natural lak es and impoundments. These waterways are shared jurisdictionally with several mid-Atlantic states (Virginia, District of Columbia, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey). Because of the importance of Maryland's waterways to severa l states, there are numerous federal, regional, and statewide agencies that govern use, a ccess, and management of the waterways. The following summarizes the role of age ncies, programs, and regulations. Federal Authorities Federal Executive Order 13112 enacted February 13, 1999, by the President of the United States, directs all federal government agencies to prevent the introduction of invasive species, to provide for their control and to minimi ze the economic, ecological, and human health impacts that invasive species cause. The Nat ional Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to consider the en vironmental impacts of their proposed actions and reasonable alternatives to tho se actions. Rapid response efforts for aquatic invasive species may require completion of the NEPA process if those efforts significantly impact the environment. The process c onsists of an evaluation of the environmental effects of a federal undertaking incl uding its alternatives. There are three levels of analysis depending on whether or not an u ndertaking could significantly affect the environment. These three levels include: catego rical exclusion determination; preparation of an Environmental Assessment/Finding of No Significant Impact (EA/FONSI); and preparation of an Environmental Imp act Statement (EIS) (EPA 2007). United States Coast Guard (USCG)\u2014 The USCG enforces federal law relating to invasive species and its maritime jurisdiction (i.e . Ballast Water Management, CFR, Title 46, Subpart 162, 16 U.S.C. 4711). The Marine Envir onmental Protection program develops and enforces regulations to avert the intr oduction of invasive species into the maritime environment. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administrati on (NOAA)\u2014 The NOAA operates under most of the same invasive species Ac ts as USFWS (DOI). Under the Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act (NANPCA ) of 1990 (reauthorized in 1996 by the National Invasive Species Act (NISA)), the N ational Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has responsibility for preven tion, monitoring, control, education, and research to prevent future introductions and th e spread of aquatic invasive species. Examples include: \u0001 Support invasive species research in response to local, state, and regional issues that are determined by their own l ocal and regional stakeholders through regular strategic planning. \u0001 Provide training and technical assistance to assi st natural resource managers respond to current invasions or prevent f uture invasions in a cost-effective way \u0001 Provide management support through Endangered Spe cies Act (ESA) consultations, permit reviews/evaluations, and pol icy development. 88 \u0001 Address invasive species threats to the persisten ce of trust resources such as threatened and endangered species, marine mammals, and fisheries. \u0001 Support and provide technical expertise for habit at restoration projects across the nation that remove and control of invas ive species. \u0001 Sea Grant base funding supports research, outreac h and education to prevent and control aquatic invasive species, incl uding invasive tunicates on the NE and NW coasts, Asian carp thre ats to the Great Lakes, ballast water technology development, and z ebra/quagga mussels. \u0001 National Marine Sanctuaries perform inspections o f inbound vessels and conduct monitoring and removal efforts. NOAA provides staff support for engagement and acti vities related to its leadership role as the co-chair of both the National Invasive Speci es Council (representing Department of Commerce) and the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, two interagency organizations that coordinate and ensure complement ary, cost-efficient and effective Federal activities regarding invasive species. United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)\u2014 The Clean Water Act Section 404 establishes a program to regulate the discharge of dredge and fill material into United States waters, including wetlands (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 ). Responsibility for administering and enforcing Section 404 is shared by the USACE an d Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is possible that some mechanical o r physical ANS rapid response control methods, such as the mechanized clearing of riparian areas to remove ANS, or dumping of fill material to smother ANS, might requ ire Federal or state Section 404 permits (only New Jersey and Michigan have state 40 4 permits). The EPA and USACE regard the use of mechanized earth-moving equipment to conduct activities in United States waters (e.g., land clearing, ditching, chann elization, and in-stream mining) as regulated discharge of dredged or fill material und er Section 404 unless project-specific evidence shows otherwise. Natural resource managers should consult the appropriate USACE District office when planning ANS rapid respo nse or control action to determine if these actions require a Federal Section 404 perm it. United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)\u2014 The mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is to work with others to conserve , protect and enhance fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats for the continuing be nefit of the American people. Because of their responsibilities, the Service is very conc erned about the impacts that invasive species are having across the Nation. The U.S. Fis h and Wildlife Service addresses invasive species issues through a variety of progra ms and partnerships. The Service's Invasive Species efforts take proactive approaches to address intentional and unintentional introductions, combat the spread of e xisting invaders on and off Service lands, and maintain the Service as a leader in inva sive species prevention and control. 89 Fisheries and Aquatic Conservation The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Aquatic Invasi ve Species Program is housed within the Fisheries and Habitat Conservation Program's Di vision of Fisheries and Aquatic Conservation. The Branch of Aquatic Invasive Speci es essentially houses three functions: The FWS Aquatic Invasive Species Program - The AIS Program seeks to prevent the introduction and spread of AIS, rapidly respond to new invasions, monitor the distribution of and control established invaders, and foster res ponsible conservation behaviors through its national public awareness campaigns (Stop Aquat ic Hitchhikers and Habitattitude). Administration of Aquatic Nuisance Species Task For ce - The Branch of AIS builds capacity, coordinates, and implements AIS preventio n and control activities authorized under the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (NANPCA, as amended by the National Invasive Specie s Act (NISA) of 1996), including: co-chairing and administering the ANSTF, supporting Regional Panels, providing grants for State/Interstate ANS Managemen t Plans, and implementing a National AIS program. Injurious Wildlife Evaluations and Listing s - The AIS Program supports the Injurious Wildlife Provisions of the Lacey Act through an ong oing process of evaluating species and possibly listing them as injurious through the rulemaking process. The AIS Program has worked to prevent populations o f invasive species from entering or spreading into the United States. Priority contain ment (boat inspection and decontamination), early detection and rapid response (snakehead eradi cation and planni ng (Quagga/Zebra Mussel Action Plan and 100th Meridian), and regulatory (injurious wildlife listing of black and silver Asian carp) and non-regulatory actions (Stop Aquatic Hitchhikers!) have occurred across many jurisdictions. Through the actions of the AIS program, a national AIS network has been built - including 42 State ANS Management Plans, 6 Regional panels, over 1,000 participants in two national public awareness campaigns and many other partners - that has planned, directed and accomplished significant regional and landscape lev el invasive species prevention and management resource outcomes. The AIS Program serv es as the nation's front line for prevention of new aquatic invasive species by regul ating imports of injurious wildlife, facilitating behavioral change and managing pathway s to limit the introduction and spread of invasives (awareness campaigns and ballast water), and developing monitoring programs for invasion hotspots to facilitate early detection and rapid response. The Service's Fisheries and Aquatic Conservation Pr ogram maintains one office in Maryland, the Maryland Fishery Resources Office, in Annapolis , MD. National Wildlife Refuge System The Fish and Wildlife Service also manages more tha n 561 refuges, encompassing more than 150 million acres of wildlife habitat, within its National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). According to 2013 data, more than 2.4 mill ion acres of the Refuge System are impacted by invasive plants. In addition, there ar e approximately 1,715 invasive animal populations residing on refuge lands. 90 There are five National Wildlife Refuges in Marylan d including: Blackwater, Eastern Neck, Glenn Martin, Susquehanna, and Patuxent Natio nal Wildlife Refuges. Endangered Species The ultimate goal of the Endangered Species Act (ES A - (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 et seq.)) is the recovery (and long-term sustainability) of enda ngered and threatened species and the ecosystems on which they depend. Recovery is the pr ocess by which the decline of an endangered or threatened species is arrested or rev ersed, and threats removed or reduced so that the species' survival in the wild can be en sured. The goal of the ESA is the recovery of listed species to levels where protecti on under the ESA is no longer necessary. In many instances these threats may be caused by in vasive species. They may either directly harm the species by causing mortality or m ay threaten a species by modifying or destroying the habitat or food source on which that species depends. A variety of methods and procedures are used to recover listed s pecies, such as reduction of threats (including invasive species), protective measures t o prevent extinction or further decline, consultation to avoid adverse impacts of Federal ac tivities, habitat acquisition and restoration, and other on-the ground activities for managing and monitoring endangered and threatened species. United States Geological Survey (USGS)\u2014 The USGS maintains the Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) information resource, which i s a central repository for spatially referenced biogeographical accounts of introduced s pecies in the United States. The program provides scientific reports, online/realtim e queries, spatial data sets, distribution maps, and general information. The data are made a vailable for use by biologists, interagency groups, and the general public. The USG S operates under most of the same invasive species Acts as USFWS (DOI). United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u2014 Federal Noxious Weed Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2801-2814) defines a noxious weed as any living stage (including seeds and reproductive parts) of a parasitic or other plant o f a kind which is of foreign origin, is new to or not widely prevalent in the United States, an d can directly or indirectly injure crops, other useful plants, livestock, poultry or other in terests of agriculture, including irrigation, navigation, fish and wildlife resources , or the public health. Under the Act, the Secretary of Agriculture for USDA has the authority to prohibit the importation and interstate transportation and sale of species that the Secretary has deemed noxious through actions such as inspection and quarantine. The Secretary is allowed to seize, treat, destroy and dispose of items that have been contaminated with a noxious weed. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\u2014 The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) is the principal law that a uthorizes EPA to regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale, and use of pestici des in the United States. The FIFRA Section 18 authorizes EPA to allow states to use a pesticide for an unregistered use for a limited time if EPA determines that emergency condi tions exist. (For more information about FIFRA Section 18 emergency exemptions, see www.epa.gov/opprd001/section18 . 91 For the text of Federal regulations regarding emerg ency exemptions, see 40 CFR Part 166 www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_04/40cfr166_04. html . See http://www.epa.gov/owow/invasive_species/invasives_ management/fifra18.html for more information on the FIFRA Section 18 exemption and Maryland's use of the statute in its response to snakeheads in ponds of Crofton, Maryland. FIFRA Section 24(c) authorizes states to register a n additional use of a federally- registered pesticide product or a new end-use produ ct to meet a special local need, such as a rapid response or control action. For EPA guid ance on FIFRA Section 24(c) registrations, see www.epa.gov/opprd001/24c . Clean Water Act Section 402 establishes the Nationa l Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program to regulate point sou rce discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States. The EPA has authorized the Mid-Atlantic States to assume many of the permitting, administrative, and enforce ment responsibilities of the NPDES permit program. A statement issued by EPA in Januar y 2005 states that the application of a pesticide to waters of the United States consiste nt with all relevant requirements under the FIFRA does not require a Federal NPDES permit i n the following two circumstances: 1) the application of pesticides directly to waters of the United States to control pests; or 2) the application of pesticides to control pests t hat are present over waters of the United States, including near such waters; that results in a portion of the pesticides being deposited to those waters. Clean Water Act Section 404 establishes a program t o regulate the discharge of dredge and fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands. Responsibility for administering and enforcing Section 404 is shared b y the US. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and EPA. It is possible that some mechanica l/physical ANS rapid response control methods, such as the mechanized clearing of riparian areas to remove ANS, or dumping of fill material to smother ANS, might requ ire Federal or state Section 404 permits (only New Jersey and Michigan have state 40 4 permits). EPA and USACE regard the use of mechanized earth-moving equipment to con duct activities in waters of the United States (e.g., land clearing, ditching, chann elization, and in-stream mining) as regulated discharge of dredged or fill material und er Section 404 unless project-specific evidence shows otherwise. Natural resource managers should consult the appropriate USACE District office when planning ANS rapid respo nse or control action to determine if these actions require a Federal Section 404 perm it. Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force (ANSTF)\u2014 The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act (NANPCA), reaut horized as the National Invasive Species Act (NISA) in 1996, was primarily created i n response to the zebra mussel invasion of the Great Lakes, where ballast water in troduction had caused serious ecological and socio-economic impacts. Although th e zebra mussel invasion of the Great Lakes has played a central role in prompting passag e of the federal legislation, NANPCA has been established to prevent the occurrence of a ll new ANS introductions and to limit the dispersal of all ANS already in U.S. waters. 92 The act, established for the prevention and control of the unintentional introduction of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species, is based on the following five objectives as listed in Section 1002 of NANPCA: To prevent further unintentional introductions o f nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species; To coordinate federally funded research, control efforts and information dissemination; To develop and carry out environmentally sound c ontrol methods to prevent, monitor and control unintentional introductions; To understand and minimize economic and ecologic al damage; and To establish a program of research and technology development to assist state governments. The primary components of the Act: Required vessels entering ports on the Great Lak es to exchange ballast water and meet other requirements, with voluntary guidelines for similar actions on other waters of the U.S. Authorized a number of studies and monitoring pro grams to assess the spread of AIS and develop methods for controlling them. Required the development of Armed Services balla st water programs as well as the establishment of the Ballast water Management Demonstration Program. Authorized the establishment of the Aquatic Nuis ance Species Task Force Established a mechanism for regional collaborati on and coordination through the establishment of the ANSTF Regional Panels Authorized the development of an AIS Program to be housed within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and Established the State\\Interstate ANS Management Plan Grant program managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, through whi ch States can develop and implement a comprehensive state management plan fo r the prevention and control of aquatic nuisance species. 93 NISA amended NANPCA \"To provide for ballast water m anagement to prevent the introduction and spread of nonindigenous species in to the waters of the United States, and for other purposes.\" NISA authorized: The production of guidelines for how to guard ag ainst the introduction and dispersal of invasive species Regulations for vessel operations and crew safety , and education and training programs to promote compliance. Funding for research on environmentally sound me thods to control the spread of invasive species, Ecological surveys for certain environmentally s ensitive regions of the country; and, The establishment of the National Ballast Informa tion Clearinghouse to provide data about ballasting practices and compliance wit h guidelines. State Authorities Maryland's aquatic invasive species laws are implem ented primarily through the Department of Natural Resources (MDDNR). The MDDNR has unified authority to address all invasion pathways and all types of orga nisms, with the exception of the horticulture industry, which is regulated by the Ma ryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) under the state noxious weed law. The MDA may list banned species to address noxious weeds but has not listed any aquatic plants to date. The MDDNR has created lists of banned and approved wildlife and fish and limits the uses of listed species according to their threats to the environment or public health a nd safety. Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA)\u2014 The MDA has the authority to regulate the plant nursery trade. Until recently the agency worked with MDDNR to treat Phragmites . That work will now be the responsibility of count ies. The ANS that MDA continues to maintain an active interest include: parrot feather, Elodea , common , Hydrilla , and giant salvinia. Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE)\u2014 The MDE has the authority under the Federal Clean Water Act to list waters that are not meeting their designated uses as impaired. This can include waters where ANS interf ere with designated uses. Maryland Department of Transportation Port Administ ration (MPA)\u2014 The mission of the Maryland Port Administration is to stimulate the flow of waterborne commerce through Maryland in a manner that provides economic benefit to the citizens of the State, and is dedicated to doing so in a manner that is pr otective of the environment by our commitment to environmental compliance, continuous improvement of environmental performance, pollution preventions, and effective i nteraction/outreach. The MPA monitors for ANS at their terminals and dredged mat erial containment facilities and assists in the efforts to establish Maryland's nati ve aquatic populations through invasive species control, funding other state or federal age ncies, and conducting monitoring programs defined to support the health of the Chesa peake Bay. In addition, the MPA, 94 along with other stakeholders provide support to th e Maryland Environmental Resources Center (MERC) that was created in 2008. Their missi on is to test the efficacy of proposed ballast water treatment systems to prevent the tran sport and introduction of invasive species by maritime shipping vessels into bodies of water such as the Chesapeake Bay and explore the tolerance of fouling organisms to c onditions found during common ocean voyages to identify high risk species and develop m ethods for surveying vessels for biofouling and quantify the effectiveness of ship b iofouling management guidelines. Maryland Sea Grant\u2014 Maryland Sea Grant has produced several fact sheets for ANS in Maryland as well as conducted a workshop in 2002 to develop regional invasive species management strategies (http://www.mdsg.umd.edu/topi cs/aquatic-invasive- species/aquatic-invasive-species). With the Mid-At lantic Panel on Aquatic Invasive Species, Maryland Sea Grant developed a rapid respo nse plan for agencies and jurisdictions within the Mid-Atlantic region. The template response plan is referenced within action items of this ANSP. Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MDDNR)\u2014 The MDDNR manages and regulates land and resources. The Secretary of MDDN R was granted wide authority to implement invasive species measures in 2003, as des cribed in Maryland Annotated Subsection 4-205.1. Invasive species activities ar e performed by MDDNR biologists and resource managers from appropriate units within the organization. Coordination is provided through the interdisciplinary Invasive Spe cies Matrix Team (ISMT) which has no dedicated staff but functions as a professional clearing house. The ISMT also performs tasks on an ad-hoc basis including addressing speci fic management actions, regulatory changes, and addressing research needs. As manager of over 480,000 acres of public lands, M DDNR is involved in the control and prevention of invasive species on a daily basis . MDDNR has implemented species plans for nutria, common reed ( Phragmites ), didymo, and purple lo osestrife. Most MDDNR land managers engage with invasive species on a regular basis, primarily terrestrial plants. Because of its broad role in managing fish, wildlif e, land, and water in the state MDDNR is the usual recipient of unusual or exotic species discovered in the wild. In this capacity, the agency is able to monitor the status and rate o f discovery of incidental aquatic invasive species that are regularly captured on Mar yland waters. There is currently no formal record of these captures, discoveries, and s eizures, but that function has been considered as a possible future role for the MDDNR ISMT if and when additional resources become available. The MDDNR Fisheries Service regulates the aquacultu re industry and numerous proposals for the use of exotic species in containe d systems or for rerelease into the wild have been brought forward for consideration by the agency. The most notable of these proposals was the potential introduction of the Asi an oyster ( Crassostrea ariakensis ), a species that was ultimately rejected after years of scientific and legislative debate. 95 The MDDNR Chesapeake and Coastal Services guide res toration of ecosystems that are impacted by aquatic nuisance species. They encourag e development of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans for all fe derally funded or authorized restoration projects. The MDDNR has limited authority over the pet trade. In general, authority is restricted to invasive species prohibited under specific regulati on, native species protected by wildlife laws, and prohibitions on harmful (dangerous/venomo us) species. Maryland's aquatic invasive species laws are implem ented primarily through the MDDNR. The MDDNR has unified authority to address all invasion pathways and all types of organisms, with the exception of the horti culture industry, which is regulated by the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) under the state noxious weed law. The MDA may list banned species to address noxious weed s but has not listed any aquatic plants to date. The MDDNR has created lists of bann ed and approved wildlife and fish and limits the uses of listed species according to their threats to the environment or public health and safety. As part of its authority over most aquatic and some terrestrial exotic (non-native) species, MDDNR regulates captive wildlife \u2014 that is, mammals , birds, reptiles, and amphibians \u2014 to prevent the introduction of pests that could h arm or compete with native species (Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. \u00a7\u00a7 10-901, 10-903). It is illegal to import, possess, breed, sell, or release any non-native wildlife species without a permit from MDDNR (MD. Regs. Code tit. 8, \u00a7 08.03.09.04). Permits are available only if the animal to be imported is both free of disease and will not be \"inimical\" to nativ e species. The legislature has also mandated specific requirem ents for nutria (requiring eradication plan pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. \u00a7 10-202. 1), mute swans (requiring population management pursuant to MD. Code Ann., Nat. Res. \u00a7 1 0-211), and non-native reptiles and amphibians (prohibiting release only pursuant t o Md. Regs. Code tit. 8, \u00a7 08.03.11.10). In addition to wildlife, MDDNR also regulates \"aqua tic organisms,\" including fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants (Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. \u00a7 4-202, 4-205.1). State law gives the Department authority to ban the importation, po ssession, or introduction of non- native aquatic species into state waters (Md. Code Ann., Nat. Res. \u00a7 4-205.1). Maryland was the first state in the nation to prohi bit the use of felt-soled waders in fishing because of their capacity to transport aqua tic invasive species (COMAR 08.02.19.07 ). The MDDNR regulations also contain unique provis ions to further guard against the accidental transport and release of ANS . Specifically, the use of watercraft containing prohibited species is not allowed in sta te waters, and water from ANS-infected locations may not be diverted or transported (Md. R egs. Code tit. 8, \u00a708.02.19.05). 96 Regional Authorities The Chesapeake Bay watershed is shared by 6 state j urisdictions and the District of Columbia. The tidal basin of the Potomac River is s hared by Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The tidal basin of the Nantic oke River is shared by Delaware and Maryland. Stretches of the non-tidal Potomac River in western Maryland are shared with West Virginia. Conowingo Reservoir is shared betwee n Maryland and Pennsylvania. State partnerships have been developed in some case s to share management of the resources in the shared waterbodies. While Virginia , West Virginia, and Pennsylvania have or are developing statewide ANS Plans, jurisdi ctions do not have joint plans for the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Mid-Atlantic Panel\u2014 Formed in 2003 through the efforts of the Chesapeak e Bay Program's Invasive Species Workgroup, the Mid-Atlan tic Panel on Aquatic Invasive Species (MAPAIS) works to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species through science and management, policy, and education and outreach activities and initiatives. The MAPAIS helps state, federal, a nd local agencies, non-profits, and private landowners in the Mid-Atlantic states tackl e ANS issues by identifying and prioritizing regional issues, coordinating local AN S programs, and assisting the ANSTF in coordinating federal programs that promote effec tive methods of preventing and managing ANS introductions. In addition, MAPAIS als o produced a Rapid Response Plan to foster a timely, thorough response to unaut horized, intentional or unintentional introductions of aquatic nuisance species (Smits an d Moser 2009). Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP)\u2014 The CBP adopted the \"Chesapeake Bay Policy for the Introduction of Non-Indigenous Aquatic Species\" in 1993. This Policy requires jurisdictions to notify the CBP if they are plannin g to introduce a non-native, aquatic species to the Chesapeake Bay. A panel to evaluate the introduction is convened by CBP and to make voluntary recommendations to the ju risdiction. The Policy develops guidelines for assessing risk of introduction and f or education and control or eradication of ANS. In the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, the CPB i dentified two primary goals regarding ANS: 1) identify and rank non-native, aqu atic and terrestrial species that cause or potentially cause negative impact to the B ay's aquatic ecosystem by 2001; and 2) develop and implement management plans for probl ematic species by 2003. Potomac River Fisheries Commission (PRFC)\u2014 The PRFC is the Maryland-Virginia bi-state regulatory authority for fishery matters i n the mainstem tidal Potomac River from Washington, D.C. to the Chesapeake Bay. The Commis sion is comprised of eight members, four appointed by Governor of Maryland and four appointed by Governor of Virginia. The PRFC adopts rules, regulations and l icenses for recreational and commercial fishing, catching or attempting to catch fish, crabs, oysters and clams. The regulations carry the full force and effect of law and are jointly enforced by Maryland and Virginia. 97 Appendix 3. HISTORY OF ANSP DEVELOPMENT 98 History of Plan Development This plan was initially prepared in 2014 and 2015 b y a subcommittee of the MDDNR Invasive Species Matrix Team (with *) and later rev iewed with comment by other members. In addition to the Team members listed bel ow, an initial draft was also reviewed by Clarence Fullard (NOAA) and Susan Pasko (NOAA). Matt joseph.love@maryland.gov Phone: Matrix Te am, Chair; Associate Director of Wildlife and Heritage Service)* Email: 99 Once ISMT had produced a draft, it was sent out to the following Unit Directors for dissemination and internal review: Christine Conn (Integrated Policy and Review) Christine Conn -DNR- Oct 20 2015 Thanks Mike and Roland. I have copied Joe Love on t his to ensure that your review comments go directly to him. Christine Roland and I met this morning and talked through th e MD ANS Management Plan. We both think the document is tho rough and thoughtful with a good mix of specific suggestions and overviews of the issues. Very well cited too, its obvious a lot of work went into it as is reflected in our lack of suggestions for additional work. We only have a few relatively minor comments . The document should detail how other agencies like MDE and MHT will be involved up front for rapid response. Without the help of other agencies this document will have limi ted usefulness as permit issues may preclude work. The terms ANS and AIS are used irregularly thoughou t. We suggest picking one acronym and sticking with it th rough the whole document. An experienced editor should be used before this do cument moves forward. Capitalization and punctuation are errati c throughout, with major section headings not capitalized, some w ords capitalized inconsistently, a mixture of italicized and bold words distracting and making the transitions between sect ions confusing. Suggest moving the Executive Summary towards the fr ont of the document, rather than having the first meaningful t ext not begin until page 11. That's it, thanks for the opportunity to review. Mike Charles C. Deegan (Critical Area Commission) - NO C OMMENT Matt Fleming (Chesapeake and Coastal Service) - 100 Claudia Donegan -DNR- I left you a voice mail regarding the ANSP for MD - - and I am coordinator any comments from the Chesapeake and Coastal Service -- I would like to hear from our CBNEER fol ks - but they are all out at a week long conference. In addition this goal of the ANSP task force maybe be quite pertinent to our wor k here in Habitat Restoration and Conservation in CCS - so we may have a few comments on this goal -- not sure its in the MD plan -- but will look closer Goal 5: Restoration - Protect and rehabilitate nati ve species and ecosystems by conducting habitat restoration effort s on multiple scales Habitat restoration is an essential part of the control and management efforts used to guard against future inv asions or to minimize harm to native ecological communities and other public interests. Restoration of the natural habitat shoul d be addressed whenever the control or eradication of ANS is plann ed since habitat rehabilitation is often necessary to avoid the replacement of one invasive species with another, control flood ing, or avoid other problems associated with the absence of biolo gical organisms. Restoration activities may also include planting or stocking organisms or improving predator-prey relat ionships to attain food webs more similar to pre-invasion condi tions. ANS can be transported by materials, equipment, vehicles, o r personnel used to conduct restoration activities; accordingly all habitat restorations, even those not focused on ANS control , should call attention to actions that prevent establishment of invaders not yet present within the project site. Restoration effort s should make use of plant and animal species that are native to the particular habitat. One of the benefits of using native specie s includes their ability to thrive under the local conditions while being less likely to invade new habitats. Consequently, native species r educe maintenance costs and produce healthy natural commu nities, thus providing a practical and ecologically valuable opt ion for restoration projects. The actions suggested below f ocus on ANS concerns during habitat restoration efforts by targ eting consideration of potential ANS during planning and implementation of restoration activities and encour aging post- restoration monitoring to ensure that any ANS intro duced as a result of restoration are responded to in a rapid a nd efficient manner. Objective 5.1: Restore impacted ecosystems a. Identify and support agencies or programs that can assist in restoring areas impacted by ANS b. Provide technical assistan ce on the species and methods to use in restoring native spec ies, including 101 means to enhance resilience against re-invasion, cl imate change, and other drivers of change c. Compile, highlight, and share lessons learned for both restoration successes and failures within the United States Objective 5.2: Address and provid e technical assistance for invasive species management before, during, and after habitat restoration projects a. Ensure that F ederal land and water management field and guidance manuals conside r ANS issues during the planning and development of habit at restoration projects b. Review and make accessible existing res toration project standards to mitigate impacts of ANS during restora tion activities. Develop new guidelines when warranted c. Encourage application of adaptive management principles and assessment of treatment regimes to improve and sustain restoration efforts over time d. Encourage the development of Hazard Analysis and Cr itical Control Point (HACCP) plans for all federally funde d or authorized restoration projects e. Support the deve lopment and expansion of markets that supply native plants and certified weed- free materials; encourage use of these materials by agencies and other organizations Encourage post-restoration moni toring for ANS by agencies and other organizations conducting habitat restoration or landscaping projects. Encourage rest oration of areas following ANS eradication or control efforts Adding something similar for Action Item in Impleme ntation Table http://dnr2.maryland.gov/ccs/Pages/InvasivePlantCon trol.aspx Among several editorial changes, add Marsh Dayflowe r to list (Chris Snow, CB NEER), give Figure 1 its own page o r orient differently.

The ANSP was then preliminarily review ed by Don MacClean. Donald MacLean (Branch of Aquatic Invasive Species, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Acting Executive Secretary of the ANS Task Force). General Comments provided: I think the draft MD ANS Plan (MDANSP) is off to a great start. It has most of the components required in the State Pl an Guidance and is a fine foundation for Maryland to start to m ore formally address its aquatic invasive species issues. I esp ecially like the section on High Priority Pathways and Aquatic Nuisa nce Species. You have done a good job of keeping the topics succ inct while still giving a decent overview and including pertinent in formation from Maryland (which many states fail to do well). I do, however, have some comments that I feel will improve the MDANSP. My comments are organized as follows: 1) First I outline one specific concern I have with th e MDANSP, 2) Then I go through the MDANSP section by section, ou tlining missing content, and providing other comments where necessary, 3) Then I provide a suggestion for one section that se ems to be completely missing (Priorities for Action); 4) And finally I provide some alternative text for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service summary (breaking it out into an F WS section and an ANSTF section). In addition, I have also provided some specific com ments on various parts of the document in track changes with in your original Word document as well). Important Notes: The comments below are based on the ANSTF Guidance for State and Interstate Aquatic Nuisance Species Management Plans , which is available on the ANSTF web site (http://www.anstaskforce.gov/State%20Plans/Guidance _for_State_ %20Interstate_ANS_Plans_2005.pdf). In the comments below, the term \"Guidance\" refers to this document. Where I indicate that some content is missing, I am NOT looking for huge volumes of information - just one or sever al paragraphs to address the topic is all that is needed in most cases. RESPONSE: All edits suggested were included in the ANSP. Notable changes included: 1) a rewording of the Plan Goal; 2) Objectives were clarified and re-organized as suggested, and matched between Executive Summary an d within the text of the document; 104 3) the Plan Purpose was clarified and a Justificati on was included; 4) Action material from the Implementation Table was added to the bull eted outline; 5) funding sources and amounts were edited in the Implementation Table for consistency with the text; 6) additional context for action items were added to t he text with a detail similar to that of the Lake Tahoe plan; 7) definitions were cited and re-written (when appropriate) from the Oxford Dictionary; 8) specific Maryland plans f or managing aquatic nuisance species were cited with hyperlinks in the species d escription section; 9) a new paragraph on geographic scope of the plan was written; 10) th e map was replaced as suggested; 11) cryptogenic species included several plants and Bro wn Pelican - a sentence addressing these species was added but these are not prioritiz ed within the ANS (to our knowledge, there are no cryptogenic species of concern); 12) a table legend for program evaluation was added in the Implementation table; 13) acronyms were used in the funding source column for the Implementation Table and those acron yms are referenced in the ANSP; 14) additional columns added to the Implementation Table included, \"Lead Organization\" and \"Cooperating Organization;\" 15) a paragraph was added in the Plan Review section to address why factors that may inhi bit implementation of the plan; 16) a Priorities for Action section was added and the New York Plan was used as a template, with a prioritization of the least costly and most important actions over the next 5 years; and 17) replacement sections for Appendix 2 were ad ded, as suggested. 105 The ANSP was then submitted for public comment and to external reviewers listed below. External reviewers were given 30 days and a dditionally asked to complete relevant sections of Appendix 2, Existing Authoriti es and Programs. Final comments were received by 2/22/2016. Reviewers were asked t o address how ANS will or are being addressed and where their role is within the ANSP. The documented was linked to the webpage for ISMT for a period of 30 days and co mments were sent directly to ISMT (see Appendix 4). The announcement of its posting was advertised to Sport Fish Commissioners and Tidal Fish Commissioners, Office of Communications, and via Fisheries Services' Constant Contact or email list serve. Carol Holko (Maryland Department of Agriculture) - Hi Joe, Yes three of us here are at PPWM were able to revie w your plan, they included Gaye Williams, Entomologist/Taxonomis t ; Bob Trumbule, Nursery Inspection Supervisor and myself. We all agree that from our program perspective we don't think th e species listed will be of any consequence to the the industries we work with/regulate ; mainly the nursery trade. There are a few exceptions that our nursery inspector supervisor me ntioned and they include, Parrot feather, Elodea (not spp. dens a, generally), Common water hyacinth, Water Lettuce and purple loo sestrife that are sometimes sold in the aquatic/nursery trade. I ris pseudacorus (yellow iris) has been listed as a Tier 1 plant in the new Invasive Plant Regulations, which are scheduled to be put in to regulation this year. As a Tier 1 plant, it will prevent the n ursery trade from selling this plant. MDA is also concerned about Hydrilla and giant salv inia. MDA Weed Control works with DNR to treat phragmites, ho wever the recent cut of this program in the FY17 budget will move all weed treatments to the counties. Again we appreciate you giving us the time to revie w and comment on this document. We look forward to seeing the fin al product. Regards, Kim Kimberly A. Rice, Program Manager, Plant Protection & Weed Management Maryland Department of Agriculture, 50 Harry S. Tru man Parkway, response to some of these comments, th e role of MDA in regulating plant nursery trade and their interest in specific specie s was noted in Appendix 2. Charlie Poukish (Maryland Department of Environment ) - RESPONSE: Reviewed plan and provided edits . Significant edits included: 1) adding a bullet to the list of current initiatives in the Ex ecutive Summary (Passing of laws and regulations restricting the possession, use, or sal e of nuisance species or gear that could result in the spread of those species) ; 2) inclusion of agencies to include in disseminatio n of risk assessments; 3) addition of new action 2.1. 4 to identify taxonomic experts; 4) addition of funding source, Hart-Miller Island Exte rior Monitoring Program; 5) downgrading of common water-hyacinth from High Prio rity to Low Priority because of its poor tolerance to winter temperatures; and 6) d escription of the role of MDE in invasive species management. Other edits to the te xt were also noted on the draft and incorporated into the ANSP. It was suggested to co nsider inclusion of rainbow darter in Appendix 1. This species was not added to Appendix 1 because according to the Atlas of North American Freshwater Fishes, rainbow darter wa s collected from the Atlantic Slope in the upper Potomac River. It is not common in Mar yland. Dr. Fredrika Moser (Maryland Sea Grant) - RESPONSE: Reviewed plan and provided numerous edits . Most editorial edits were made to improve clarity. Significant edits included : 1) definitions were clarified as suggested and example species were deleted from low priority and high priority definitions; 2) the introduction of species in pack ing material in the bait trade was added in the Live Bait vector discussion, with reference to transit from Maine; 3) the evidence to support seafood trade as a vector is not extensi ve, but Miller et al. was cited along with Carlton and Cohen's work - this pathway is not as widely recognized for importance as others and that point was noted; 4) the statemen t regarding negative impacts from authorized stocking was deleted rather than referen ced because the impacts from ANS are well-described elsewhere in the plan; 5) the AN STF and MAPAIS were added to Action 1.1.1, as suggested, to specify the need to coordinate with those groups as well as neighboring states; 6) Sea Grant Law Clinic and Env ironmental Law Clinic were added to the program evaluation in Action 1.3.2, with spe cific reference to cooperating agency MDSG; 7) MAPAIS was identified as a cooperating age ncy for Action 1.4.2, as suggested; 8) National Sea Grant Law Clinic was add ed to Action 3.2.2 as suggested; and 9) the suggested funding sources were added to Implementation Table. Bruce Vogt (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) and Nicholas DiPasquale (Environmental Protection Agenc y, Chesapeake Bay Program) - DiPasquale, Nicholas <dipasquale.nicholas@epa.gov> Thu, Jan 21, 2016 at 1:13 PM filiate <kara.skipper@noaa.gov> Joe, thanks for reaching out to me for comments on Maryland's draft ANS plan. Per your request, please find attac hed comments from the Chesapeake Bay Program's Sustainable Fishe ries and Vital Habitats Goal Teams. I applaud Maryland's com mitment to addressing ANS issues and competing for national fu nding to support it. The Chesapeake Bay Program shares Maryl and's concern regarding the serious regional impacts ANS have on both economies and ecosystems. Back in 2003, the partner ship's Invasive Species Workgroup helped form the Mid-Atla ntic Panel on Aquatic Invasive Species (MAPAIS) under ANSTF (r eferenced on page 86 of the draft). Since then, the Chesapeak e Bay Program has provided support for MAPAIS in the form of staf f time through the Habitat Goal Implementation Team. We look forwa rd to continuing this mutually supportive relationship be tween the CBP partnership and the regional panel in terms of comm unication on emerging issues and working with all of the jurisdi ctions to combat ANS most efficiently across the watershed. Thanks again for allowing CBP the opportunity to re view and comment on this draft. Best, Nick Attached Comments on Behalf of Vital Habitat and Su stainable Fisheries Goal Implementation Teams modified the ANSP as: 1) a lin k to the final report of the Sustainable Fisheries Goal Implementation Team Inva sive Catfish Task Force was added to species descriptions for both blue catfish and f lathead catfish; 2) it was noted that not all resident populations of Canada Goose require ma nagement, just large ones that adversely impact the environment; 3) an action to i mprove monitoring was added by editing Strategy 2.3 and have it broadly address mo nitoring - Action 2.3.2 was added to specifically identify the need for monitoring for h igh priority and red alert species; 4) edits to the description of MAPAIS were made as req uested; 5) the description of blue catfish was edited to include its salinity toleranc e; and 6) the program evaluation for Action 3.1.1 was edited to stress a need for basic biological and ecological studies that elucidate recruitment, mortality, and population gr owth, as well as ecological factors that influence natural spread of the species.

Love - DNR- <joseph.love@maryland.gov > Thu, Feb 11, 2016 at 3:55 PM I didn't have a chance to talk to you after the sna kehead meeting since I had another meeting to go to. I did read th e management plan. It is well written. My only comment is on kno wledge gaps and challenges on page 28. It may be worth noting that invasive species can be purchased on the internet pretty eas ily making that a potentially dangerous vector. RESPONSE: The World Wide Web as a dangerous vector was added to Gaps and Challenges as well as in the pathway section.

Here is a suggested paragraph for the MPA p ortion of Appendix 2 (page 84)...In reviewing the action plan s, I feel that MPA could become a cooperating agency in some of th e outreach aspects,distributing the ANS plans to our citizens groups or other Dredged Material Management Program committees as s ome of the watermen and other stakeholders may be interest ed in this topic. We could also assist in web based outreach t hrough the Healthy Harbors and Greenports websites posting the links to ANS information and the importance of notifying MDDNR o f ANS sightings, etc. We could also provide more informat ion to the ANSTF and/ or the ISMT on the MERC efforts as both ballast water and biofouling are identified as pathways. Lo cations for listing MPA as a potential CO pg.50 3.3.2, and 3.3.3. We feel that the issues of ANS is very important an d are interested in how the goals of the plan are achieved, and woul d like the opportunity to be part of the continued discussions . Please let me know if you have any questions or need any addition al information. Again, I sincerely apologize for the d elayed response on the plan. Thanks, Holly L. Miller Maryland Port Administration World Trade Center 401 E. Pratt Street Suite 1900 Baltimore, MD 21202 Phone: 4103854748 EMail: hmiller2@marylandports.com RESPONSE: The suggested paragraph was added to App endix 2. Maryland Port Administration was added as a coopera ting organization for the identified actions. Marty Gary (Potomac River Fisheries Commission) - N O COMMENT 110 The ANSP then underwent a preliminary review by the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force. Reviews were received from Don MacLean (U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service), Susan Pasko (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), Dr. I an Davidson (Smithsonian Environmental Research Center), and Dr. Alexis Rudd (NOAA Fisheries Office of Policy). These edits and comments were included in to the draft of the ANSP. Significant edits included a suggestion by SERC to add several lower trophic level aquatic nuisance species that should be researched to address whether they are or will become problematic. These species were added as a new table to Appendix 1 and will be considered in the future as potential aquatic nuisa nce species. The budget was also better clarified to specifically address possible funding for salary and for materials or supplies. 111 Appendix 4 . PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE ANSP 112 Public comments were received on the ANSP during wi nter and spring of 2016. It was opened on 12/24/2015. A notice was sent out using C onstant Contact to the general public who had signed up to receive notices from Ma ryland Department of Natural Resources. It was also posted on the Department's I nvasive Species Matrix Page. A copy was supplied to commissioners of the Sport Fish Adv isory Commission and the Tidal Fish Advisory Commission, which represent commercia l and recreational angler interests in Maryland. The date and initials of commenter are provided along with the unaltered comment. 12/28/2015 I'm a Maryland recreational angler. I'm retired, b ut during my working life, I acquired an environmental background. Very good plan. Well do ne. My comments are below. Comments on Maryland Aquatic Nuisance Species Manag ement Plan - draft dated December 2015 Page 5. In the Executive Summary, consider qualify ing or in some way quantifying the term \"Chesapeake Bay watershed\" so that it better d efines the scope of the plan, otherwise begin the sentence with, \"For example, in the Chesapeake Bay watershed . . . .\" To the casual reader or layperson quickly reading the executive summary, it seems that the plan may only be addressing the Bay and nearby waters/adjacent tributaries. Page 6. The Objectives, and the Actions to Achieve Objections are very good. They appear to be both comprehensive and executable. Page 10. In the Glossary, consider adding the term , \"Non-native non-nuisance\" or Non- indigenous non-nuisance in order to define those sp ecies that although not native to the state, have been long established, are naturally re producing in such a way that wild populations of the species exist, and have become i n many ways a beneficial part of the current ecosystem. Page 12. In the Acronyms, you may want to include NOAA. Page 19, second paragraph. The period needs to be removed at the end of the sentence that reads, \"The USCG also regulates ballast water discharge in United States waters under the United States.\", or the following needs t o be added, \". . . Code of Federal Regulations, Title 46, Shipping.\" or something to that effect. Page 24, Angler Gear Pathway. I would like to comm ent, and it may be noteworthy to add that the ban on the use of felt soled wading bo ots in Maryland waters comes at an increased fall risk to the angler. Pennsylvania ha s not yet instituted this ban, at least not to my knowledge. It may be worthwhile to find out how their plan addresses the angler gear pathway with respect to wading boots, and if a dequate, adopt it for Maryland waters? 113 Page 46. General comment related to Plan Strategie s 3. I am in favor of the plan, as long as an attempt is not made to eradicate \"non-native non-nuisance\" species in order to better establish or re-establish \"genetically pure\" native species. As explained in the plan, many non-native species were introduced with good intention, only to discover their negative impacts after the fact. I know it's unlik ely to happen given current requirements to conduct environmental assessments prior to takin g action, but please avoid the pitfall of committing two wrongs in order to make a right e specially at taxpayer expense. Good luck to the working group/committee, keep up t he good work, and thank you for the opportunity to comment. RESPONSE: Edits to references of pages 5, 12 and 1 9 were included in the re-draft of the plan. 12/26/2015 1) The statement on page 25 that \"...Blue Catfis h and Flathead Catfish were introduced for sport fishing in the Potomac River i n the 1960s by VDGIF\" is false and should be removed or edited. VDGIF has NEVER stock ed blue catfish in the Potomac River for any purpose. We stocked several Virginia rivers in the 1970s, and as I think you know; the origin of BCF in the tidal Potomac is unknown. To deliberately indict VDGIF for this introduction is grossly misleading a nd disingenuous. Flatheads were stocked in the Occoquan in the 1960s. This misrepr esentation is repeated on page 29 and should be changed. 2) I am uncertain how you (or others) determin ed that Northern Snakehead have a \"high probability of negative economic and/or ecolo gical impacts\". As I thought you knew, there are no published accounts of anything o f the sort. The two studies cited in the draft merely show dietary overlap (not competit ion as claimed) and the fact that snakeheads will eat bass fingerlings when starved i n hatchery raceways. I think one could actually argue that at this point there have been economic benefits of this fish, although I would not advertise it. 3) The Flathead Catfish section appears to sug gest these fish colonized the Susquehanna system by dispersing from the Occoquan. This should be revised to reflect reality including the very low abundance of this fi sh in the tidal Potomac system and the near impossibility that they seeded other bay popul ations. That this fish was such a nuisance, DNR requested to sample Virginia waters ( unsuccessfully) just to find one to display at the state fair. Don't really see that p roblem... RESPONSE: All suggested edits were made to the cat fish descriptions. Additionally, the reference to \"snakeheads having a high probability of negative economic and/or ecological impacts\" was re-written completely and r e-stated as, \"could impact.\" 114 1/29/2016 Mr. Love, I would like to provide feedback on Maryland's draf t Aquatic Nuisance Species Plan. Kindly send me an email acknowledging that y ou have read my comments and confirming that they will be factored into the Stat e's decision-making processes going forward. I proudly lead a growing group of concerned catfish anglers known as Bay Catfish Advocates (BCA). Over 1,400 individuals have formal ly supported BCA (see our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/baycatfish ), as have many groups. Our supporters are located not only in Maryland, Virgin ia, and Pennsylvania - but throughout North America. Below are several relevant excerpts from our BCA st atement of objective/purpose: BCA seeks \"game fish\" status for both trophy blue a nd trophy flathead catfish. The game fish status that we desire should be foste red through the implementation of a realistic, balanced management approach that supports the current and future needs of the nascent commerc ial blue catfish fishery, through the harvesting of appropriate numbers of sm aller fish, while at the same time preserving ample numbers of larger blue a nd flathead catfish for current and future recreational anglers. BCA also advocates existing and future regulations that prohibit the transportation/subsequent introduction of live trop hy blue and flathead catfish from the Chesapeake Bay watershed to waters other t han where they were originally caught. Chesapeake Bay Catfish Advocates also request that policy makers recognize the fact that a significant number of advocates have - for many years prior to these fish being labeled \"invasive\" - invested considerab le resources in the recreational pursuit of their preferred quarry. Referencing page 15 of the State's draft plan, then , BCA strongly believes that both trophy blue and trophy flathead catfish are, in fac t, \"important gamefish.\" Like shad and largemouth bass, which the State clearly values, tr ophy blue and trophy flathead catfish belong on the list of \"natural resources that the S tate aims to protect.\" I have developed very good working relationships wi th key individuals within the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the Potom ac River Fisheries Commission, and the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fish eries. I am willing to work with any individual or organization to change what I per ceive to be a stigma (fueled more by over-sensationalism, I believe, than credible scien tific evidence) associated with blue and flathead catfish. BCA would like for trophy blue a nd trophy flathead catfish to be formally recognized as important game fish, a statu s that we believe they have rightfully earned. 115 P.S. - Be sure to read the passionate comments of B CA supporters on our website: http://baycatfish.com/comments.html RESPONSE: The inclusion of statements regarding th e importance of blue catfish and flathead catfish to the angling community as both f ood and recreation was included in the descriptions of these two species. 2/9/16 Tue, Feb 9, 2016 at 8:44 AM To: joseph.love@maryland.gov Mr. Love, I do not have time to thoroughly read ANS (Aquatic Nuisance Species) Management Plan. I do notice that in the executive summary, i t is stated that you intend to create \"increased educational awareness by working with K- 12 schools.\" I served as an educator in the Baltimore City Publi c School System for 16 years. During my career, I obtained grants from the Chesap eake Bay Foundation, supervised the growing of underwater grasses in science classe s, and led field trips for their planting by the children. I highly recommend that any such programs that you create do not rely too heavily on the internet. Rather th ey should involve hands-on and direct visual experiences as far as possible. I would rec ommend the creation of a traveling aquarium(s) that could be meshed with Maryland's sc ience curriculum for the various grades, and then be available to travel from school to school upon request. In the best of all possible worlds, some of the tanks (or other exhibits) would have objects that children could touch or handle. As a veteran of nu merous trips to the National Aquarium, I assure you that children find live fish absolutely fascinating. In a conservation effort such as this, an educated public is your greatest asset. Lessons brought home in school by real life experience (i.e ., not just book/blackboard/internet learning) last a lifetime. If you can get into Mar yland's classrooms, ANS will cease as a problem at some point in the future. RESPONSE: The concept of a traveling aquarium was specifically included as an outreach tool in "}
