Acupuncture Acupuncture is a form of treatment from traditional Chinese medicine. It's performed by a licensed acupuncturist (a person with special training in acupuncture). During your treatment, you will lie on a padded table while your acupuncturist places thin needles into your skin. The placement of the needles depends on the problem being treated. Most people feel little or no pain. Once the needles are in place, you will rest for about 30 minutes. Your acupuncturist will remove the needles at the end of your session and throw them away. Research studies show that acupuncture can reduce some side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, including: - Nausea (feeling like you're going to throw up). - Pain. - Hot flashes. - Dry mouth. - Digestive problems (problems breaking down food). - Anxiety (strong feelings of worry or fear). - Insomnia (trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early). Acupuncture treatments are offered at MSK. Outpatients (patients not staying in the hospital) and members of the community can get acupuncture in private sessions or small group sessions. Some insurance plans may cover acupuncture treatments under certain conditions. Call your insurance provider for more information. To schedule an acupuncture appointment, call [646-449-1010](tel:+1-646-449-1010). Acupressure Acupressure is based on acupuncture. With acupressure, your healthcare provider puts pressure on specific places on your body. These places are called acupoints. Pressing these points can help your muscles relax and improve how your blood circulates. You can learn how to perform acupressure on yourself to manage problems like nausea, anxiety, and headaches.

There are many different types of meditation. Mindfulness meditation is when you sit quietly as you pay attention to your thoughts and feelings without judging them. Practicing meditation You can learn to practice meditation. This exercise will help you stay present in the moment and relax. - Start by closing your eyes and imagining yourself in a peaceful place. Breathe deeply and slowly. - Focus on your breathing. Feel the air going in and out of your nose and lungs. - Notice how your body feels. Start from the top of your head and move down slowly to the tip of your toes. - Relax each part of your body, one part at a time.
