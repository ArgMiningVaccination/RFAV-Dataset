He believes that the combination of the three virus strains may overload the body's immune system and cause the bowel disorder to develop. Vaccines 'should be given separately' Other members of the team have questioned the connection, but Dr Wakefield claims that until further research is done to determine whether there is a link between the disease and the MMR vaccine, the jab should be given in three separate doses spaced by at least one year. Dr Wakefield, a reader in experimental gastroenterology, said: \"This is a genuinely new syndrome and urgent further research is needed to determine whether MMR may give rise to this complication in a small number of people. \"For the vast majority of children the MMR vaccine is fine, but I believe there are sufficient anxieties for a case to be made to administer the three vacations separately. Trials 'insufficient' His colleague Professor Roy Pounder, who admitted the study was controversial, added: \"In hindsight it may be a better solution to give the vaccinations separately, although administratively it is a wonderful idea. \"When the vaccinations were given individually there was no problem.\" Research to determine the link between the syndrome and the MMR vaccine is currently under way. The team will meet the chief medical officer, who has already called for an independent review, at the end of March to discuss the vaccination. Parents told to be wary of findings The Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association urged parents to treat the research with extreme caution. The Association's Professional Officer, Sue Botes, said: \"These studies must be looked at in a wide context. \"The research is partly based on studies of a small sample of sick children suffering from specific diseases which may or may not be linked to the vaccines. \"We should concentrate on the benefits of the eradication of life-threatening diseases.\" He believes that the combination of the three virus strains may overload the body's immune system and cause the bowel disorder to develop.
