Before confirming the selection of the 127 workgroup chairpersons and members, the JTFPP discusses and resolves all relevant potential 128 conflicts of interest (COI) of each potential workgroup member. The JTFPP recognizes that 129 experts in a field are likely to have interests that could come into conflict with the development 130 of a completely unbiased and objective guideline. Therefore, a process has been developed to 131 acknowledge potential COI when making specific recommendations. To preserve the greatest 132 transparency regarding potential COI, all members of the JTFPP and workgroup complete a C OI 133 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 4 disclosure form prior to beginning work on practice parameter and again prior to the guideline 134 submission for publication. These disclosure forms are published on the JTFPP website. 135 136 During the review process there are additional measures to avoid bias. At the workgroup level, 137 all the recommendations and discussion sections are reviewed by all workgroup members to 138 ensure that content is appropriate and without apparent bias. If any recommendation or 139 section is deemed to have apparent bias, it is appropri ately revised, without the section 140 author's involvement, in an attempt to remove potential bias. In addition, the entire document 141 is also reviewed by the JTFPP and any apparent bias is acknowledged and removed at that level. 142 For each and every recommendat ion, a vote is required by the workgroup and JTFPP, and any 143 member with any perceived COI is recused from that vote (and so explained in the document). 144 Any dissenting votes that cannot be resolved are described and explained in the document. 145 146 In a final st age of review, the practice parameter is sent to invited expert reviewers, selected by 147 the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College 148 of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI). The document is also posted on the A AAAI and 149 ACAAI websites for general membership and the public -at-large to review and offer comment. 150 All reviewers must provide statements of potential COI. Although the JTFPP has the final 151 responsibility for the content of the documents submitted for publi cation, each reviewer's 152 comments will be discussed and reviewers will receive written responses to comments when 153 appropriate. 154 155 The JTFPP members and workgroup members' conflict of interest disclosure forms can be found 156 at www.allergyparameters.org. 157 158 Discl aimer: The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and the American 159 College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology have jointly accepted responsibility for developing 160 the Drug Allergy 2022: A Practice Parameter Update. The medical environment is ra pidly 161 changing, and not all recommendations will be appropriate or applicable to all patients and may 162 change over time. Because this document incorporates the efforts of many participants, no 163 single individual, including members serving on the JTFPP, is au thorized to provide an official 164 AAAAI or ACAAI interpretation of this practice parameter . Any request for information or 165 interpretation of this practice parameter by the AAAAI or ACAAI should be directed to the 166 executive offices of the AAAAI and the ACAAI. Practice parameters and guidelines are not 167 designed for use by the pharmaceutical industry in drug development or promotion. The JTFPP 168 understands that the cost of diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions is an important 169 concern that may appropriate ly influence the evaluation and treatment selected for a given 170 patient. The JTFPP recognizes that the emphasis of our primary recommendations regarding a 171 medication may vary, for example, depending on third -party payer issues and product patent 172 expiration dates. However, because a given test or a therapeutic intervention's cost is so widely 173 variable, and there is a relative paucity of pharmacoeconomic data, the JTFPP is not always able 174 to consider cost when formulating recommendations. In extraordinary circ umstances, when the 175 cost benefit of an intervention is prohibitive as supported by pharmacoeconomic data, 176 commentary may be provided. 177 178 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 5 179 180 Table of Contents 181 182 Drug Allergy: A 2022 Practice ................................ 10 187 Executive Summary ................................ ................................

Evidence has evolved since the previous drug allergy practice 289 parameter1 and currently supports the ability to risk stratify most patient s based upon reaction 290 phenotype. Evaluation of suspected drug allergy focuses on preferential utilization of drug 291 challenges as opposed to skin testing in many circumstances. Clarification of drug allergy history 292 is a valuable resource that allergist -immunologist s provide to patients with shared decisi on 293 making regarding testing and management options central to each evaluation. These 294 parameters will help clinicians better understand how and when to utilize drug challenges, 295 including consideration for 1 -, 2-, or multi -step challenges. While currently, 2 -step challenges 296 are required for reimbursement in the US, literature supports the use of single step challenges 297 in certain situations , and we are optimistic that 3rd party payers will reimburse this procedure in 298 the future. A proactive approach to delabeling penicillin allergy as well as use of safe antibiotic 299 alternatives for patients with proven penicillin allergy is emphasized. Approaches to diagnosis 300 and management of non -penicillin drug reactions are discussed in updated sections on 301 cephalosporins, sulfonamides, fluroquinolones, macrolides, aspirin, chemotherapeutic agents, 302 and biologics. This comprehensive resource provides consensus -based statements (CBS) 303 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 9 throughout, as well as detailed background and discussion to assi st implementation into clinical 304 practice. 305 306 Glossary 307 1. Allergy: For the purpose of this practice parameter, the terms \"allergy\" and 308 \"hypersensitivity\" will be used interchangeably , and both indicate an abnormal immune 309 response. The inclusion of both types of nomenclature reflects the variable use of these 310 terms in the collective literature on this topic 311 2. Delayed hypersensitivity reaction: Immunologic mediated reaction occurring at least 6 hours 312 after dosing, with majority occurring 1 -2 weeks after drug initiati on 313 3. Delayed intradermal testing (dIDT) : Intradermal injection of non -irritating drug concentration 314 on the volar aspect of the forearm followed by evaluation for induration 24 hours after 315 application 316 4. Desensitization: A form of temporary induction of drug tolerance typically for IgE -mediated 317 reactions through administration of multiple gradually increasing doses of a drug to allow for 318 treatment. Maintaining exposure to the drug is required to continue temporary induction of 319 tolerance . In this practice paramete r, we preferentially use \"induction of tolerance\" 320 5. Direct challenge: Performing drug challenge without prior skin testing 321 6. Drug challenge: Procedure whereby drug is administered to determine tolerance. Preferred 322 nomenclature compared with \"drug provocation t ests\" or \"test doses \", which imply intent to 323 provoke a reaction 324 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 10 7. Drug challenge; 1-step: One treatment dose of the drug is administered, followed by 325 observation for objective symptoms of reaction 326 8. Drug challenge; 2-step: 10% of the treatment dose of the drug is administered, followed 20 - 327 30 minutes later by 90% of the treatment dose if no symptoms occur 328 9. Drug challenge; multiple days: Treatment dose of the drug is administered daily at home for 329 5-10 days 330 10. Induction of drug tolerance: Administration of multiple gradually increasing doses of a drug 331 to allow for treatment. Ongoing consistent exposure to the drug is required to maintain 332 tolerance 333 11. Infusion reactions: Unpredictable adverse reactions unrelated to known side effects from a 334 drug and are commonly associat ed with monoclonal antibodies. 335 12. Latency period: Time from first exposure to a drug to the time reaction occurs 336 13. Nocebo effect: Objective or subjective symptoms occurring after administration of a placebo 337 dose 338 14. Penicillin major determinant: Detects the greates t number of patients with IgE -mediated 339 penicillin allergy through skin testing. This is penicilloyl -polylysine (PPL, Pre -Pen) 340 15. Penicillin minor determinants: Penicillin G, penicilloate, penilloate 341 16. Pharmacogenomics: The study of how genetic variations affe ct responses to medications 342 17. Phenotype: Observable clinical characteristics associated with interactions from specific 343 exposures 344 18. Structurally dissimilar: Cephalosporins that have disparate R1 side chains from other 345 cephalosporins or aminopenicillins. 346 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 11 19. Verified allergy: A patient with a verified drug allergy has confirmed their allergy via skin 347 testing and/or challenge. 348 349 What's New and What's Different 350 All of the updated sections contain significant new information and recommendations 351 compared with the p revious 2010 updated drug allergy practice parameter.1 Compared with 352 the previous update, there is an overall de -emphasis on the use of skin testing as compared 353 with drug challenge, particularly for the majority of patients who present with non - 354 anaphylact ic, non -severe cutaneous drug allergy histories. In addition, more emphasis is placed 355 on risk stratification based on reaction phenotype as well as the role for shared decision making 356 in diagnostic testing and management. Some of the most important chang es in this updated 357 practice parameter are as follows: 358 1. Recommendation to define a positive skin test as a wheal that is 3 mm than the 359 negative control for prick/puncture or intradermal tests accompanied by a 5 mm flare 360 2. Suggestion to use of 1 - or 2-step drug challenges for low -risk patients 361 3. Suggestion to use placebo challenges in patients with subjective symptoms or multiple 362 reported drug allergies 363 4. Suggestion to consider dIDT and/or patch tests (PT) to identify culprit drugs for specific 364 phenotypes of delayed drug reactions where the implicated agent is uncertain 365 5. Recognition that most pharmacogenetic associations identified to date are currently 366 unlikely to translate into clinical practice 367 6. Recommenda tion for proactive penicillin allergy delabeling 368 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 12 7. Recommendation against multiple day challenges in evaluation of most cases of 369 suspected penicillin allergy 370 8. Recommendation against penicillin skin testing prior to direct amoxicillin challenge in 371 low-risk ped iatric patients 372 9. Consideration for direct amoxicillin challenge in adults with low -risk penicillin allergy 373 histories 374 10. Recognition that patients with selective allergic reactions to piperacillin -tazobactam 375 may be identified with skin tests to piperacillin -tazobactam and may tolerate other 376 penicillins 377 11. Suggestion to perform direct challenge to cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains in 378 patients with non -anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy 379 12. Suggestion to perform skin tests to parenteral cephalosporins with non -identical R1 side 380 chains (prior to challenge) in patients with anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy 381 13. Specific guidance on administration of cephalosporins to patients with various 382 phenotypes of penicillin allergy 383 14. Specific guidance on administration of penicill ins to patients with various phenotypes of 384 cephalosporin allergy 385 15. Suggestion to administer carbapenems without prior testing in patients with other beta - 386 lactam allergies 387 16. Recommendation that allergist -immunologist s collaborate with hospitals and healthcare 388 systems to implement beta -lactam allergy pathways to improve antibiotic stewardship 389 outcomes 390 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 13 17. Suggestion to use a 1-step trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole challenge rather than 391 desensitization for low -risk patients where there is a need to delabel sulfonamide 392 allergy 393 18. Suggestion to use 1 - or 2-step drug challenge for non -anaphylactic reactions to 394 fluoroquinolones or macrolides without preceding skin testing 395 19. Recommendation against aspirin challenge to confirm a diagnosis of aspirin exacerbated 396 respiratory disease (AERD ) in cases of high diagnostic certainty based on history but that 397 aspirin desensitization re mains a therapeutic option when indicated 398 20. Suggestion for oral aspirin challenge only in patients where there is diagnostic 399 uncertainty of AERD 400 21. Suggestion that cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX -2) inhibitors may be used in non-steroidal 401 anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID is needed 402 22. Suggestion to use oral aspirin challenge in patients with NSAID -induced 403 urticaria/angioed ema to determine tolerance to other NSAIDs 404 23. Suggestion for 2 -step aspirin challenge (not desensitization) for patients with a history 405 of non-AERD aspirin allergy in acute need of aspirin for cardiovascular disease 406 24. Suggestion that patients with non-IgE chemo therapy or biologic reactions be treated 407 with slowed infusion rate, graded dose escalation, and/or pre -medications without 408 desensitization 409 25. Suggestion that for patients with immediate reactions to taxanes, the severity of the 410 initial reaction may assist in risk stratification and management 411 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 14 26. Suggestion that patients with non-IgE reactions to monoclonal antibodies (mAb) may be 412 treated with a slowed infusion, graded dose escalation, and/or premedication without 413 desensitization 414 27. Recognition that excipient allergy is very rare but may be considered in patients with 415 anaphylaxis to 2 structurally unrelated products that share a common excipient 416 417 Executive Summary 418 The primary focus of the drug allergy practice parameter historically has been to provide 419 suggestions and recommendations for the proper diagnosis and management of the spectrum 420 of drug hypersensitivity reactions. Since the most recent update in 2010 , which was a 421 comprehensive review on the topic of drug allergy at the time , our understanding of several 422 areas in the field has changed.1 This current update is a focused update on sections that the 423 work group deemed to have significant changes (or were not addressed) from the 2010 424 parameter. This update is not meant to be a com prehensive overview of drug hypersensitivity 425 reactions as was the 2010 update, but rather this parameter is a focused update which will 426 provide important suggestions and recommendations for the management of a variety of drug 427 hypersensitivity reactions. 428 Classification of Drug Allergies 429 The classification for drug hypersensitivity reactions has evolved. Allergic drug reactions 430 can be classified based on chronology, mechanism, and clinical phenotypes. The chronology of 431 drug allergic reactions is generally si mplified into either immediate or delayed reactions. 432 Immediate reactions are generally considered to occur within 1 hour but in some cases up to 6 433 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 15 hours of exposure to the drug.2, 3 Phenotypically , immediate drug reactions may present with 434 urticaria, angi oedema, bronchospasm, or in severe cases , anaphylaxis. Immediate reactions are 435 often IgE -mediated , but IgE -independent reactions can also occur. Recently , the Mas -related G - 436 protein coupled receptor membrane X2 ( MRGPRX2) on mast cells has been found to be 437 responsible for non-IgE mediated reactions to drugs such as vancomycin , neuromuscular 438 blocking agents , and fluoroquinolones.4 Delayed hypersensitivity reactions often evolve over 439 days or , in some cases , weeks following exposure to the drug. There are numero us clinical 440 phenotypes of delayed hypersensitivity reactions with the most common being benign (e.g. 441 maculopapular) exanthems.5 More severe delayed drug hypersensitivity reactions include the 442 well described phenotypes of drug reaction with eosinophilia an d systemic symptoms (DRESS), 443 acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Stevens -Johnson/toxic epidermal 444 necrolysis these syndromes are referred to as severe cutaneous 445 adverse reactions (SCARs). The immunologic mechani sms for delayed hypersensitivity reactions 446 are likely related to drug specific T cells including Th1, Th2, and cytotoxic T cells , Serum sickness -like reactions (SSLRs) are another phenotype of delayed drug 448 reactions that have c linical manifestations very similar to immune complex mediated serum 449 sickness , but the immunopathology of SSLRs is still not entirely clear. SSLR are characterized by 450 urticaria -like (lesions persist > 24 hours) and erythema multiforme -like lesions, joint 451 inflammation, and fever, but unlike serum sickness, nephrotoxicity and hypocomplementemia 452 are rare. There are also a number of organ -specific delayed drug reaction phenotypes (often 453 without cutaneous manifestations) including drug -induced cytopenias, liver injury, interstitial 454 nephritis, and vasculitis to name a few. These primarily non -cutaneous organ -specific reactions 455 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 16 will not be addressed in this update but have been reviewed in the prior update. 1 The 456 chronology of various drug hypersensitivity reactio ns is shown in Figure 1 . 457 Diagnostic Tests 458 In the United States (U.S.) , diagnostic tests for drug allergies are based primarily on 459 immediate skin testing and drug challenges. Delayed drug skin testing including dIDT and PT 460 have an evolving role in the diagnosis of certain phenotypes of delayed hypersensitivity 461 reactions.7 In vitro testing for drug allergy with tests such as basophil activation tests, 462 lymphocyte transformation tests, and other testing does not have any wel l validated 463 commercial assays in the U.S. and will not be discussed in this parameter. 464 While skin testing is often performed with drug hypersensitivity evaluations, the 465 accuracy of skin test s for most drugs is unclear. Furthermore , there has not been agre ement on 466 what even constitutes a positive skin test. The workgroup now recommends that a positive 467 prick/puncture or intradermal skin test is to be defined as a wheal that is 3 mm than the 468 negative control accompanied by a 5 mm flare. Recently , studies have shown an optimal 469 method for reproducible intradermal antibiotic skin testing.8 Fluid should be drawn out first by 470 filling the syringe with a larger volume (0.05 -0.07 mL) and expelling the excess fluid and air 471 bubbles to obtain 0.02 mL , then injecting to produce a baseline 3-5 mm bleb . While immediate 472 skin testing is often employed in the evaluation of drug hypersensitivity reactions, as will be 473 discussed later in the parameter, skin testing primarily is of most value in patients with histories 474 of drug -induced anaphylaxis. The majority of patients who have more benign, non -anaphylactic 475 reactions may be managed without drug skin testing. 476 Evidence for all testing modalities for delayed hypersensitivity reactions is limited and of 477 low certainty, generally based on small case series without drug challenge; hence, the 478 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 17 sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) 479 cannot be reliably calculated. However , in certain situations like a patient with DRESS syndrome 480 where several causal agents are potentially implicated, delayed skin testing may be considered 481 to help identify the potential culprit. While the accuracy of delayed drug skin testing is unclear, 482 it appears to be safe when performed at least 6 weeks to 6 mon ths following healing of the 483 drug reaction.7 484 In contrast to drug skin testing, drug challenges are considered the reference standard 485 for determining tolerance to a drug. A number of terms have been used to describe this 486 procedure including \"drug provocatio n tests \", \"graded challenges \", and \"test doses \". The term 487 \"drug challenge\" is recommended as this is in keeping with other allergic diseases (e.g. food 488 challenges, sting challenges). While \"drug provocation\" is commonly used in the international 489 literature, we do not recommend this term as the intent i s to show tolerance rather than to 490 provoke a reaction. Drug challenges may be given in an incremental (graded) fashion but can 491 also be administered as a single dose. Drug challenges can be performed for both immediate 492 and delayed phenotypes of drug reactio ns. There are contraindications to drug challenges 493 which are outlined later. In most scenarios, drug challenges are performed when the clinical 494 probability of a drug allergy is low. In these circumstances, drug challenges can be performed 495 with a 1 - or 2-step drug challenge. A 1-step challenge would involve administering a 496 therapeutic dose of the drug as a single step. In contrast, a 2-step challenge would involve first 497 administering a smaller dose, such as 10 to 25% of the final dose with observation, foll owed by 498 administration of the rest of the dose 20 to 30 minutes later . Patients with primarily subjective 499 symptoms or those who have multiple reported drug allergies should be considered for 500 placebo -controlled drug challenges.9 501 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 18 Most pharmacogenomic associ ations identified to -date are currently unlikely to 502 translate into clinical practice.10 A few genetic associations with serious immunologically - 503 mediated hypersensitivity reactions have been described. 11, 12 Screening for these specific 504 human leukocyte an tigen ( HLA) associations is helpful in reducing hypersensitivity reactions for 505 a few drugs and specific populations. Currently , genetic testing is not typically utilized for 506 diagnostic purposes ; however , this may evolve as more routine single HLA markers a nd other 507 genotyping strategies become available that associate with clinical evidence for use in both 508 screening and allergy diagnosis. 509 Antibiotic Allergy 510 In recent years many important updates regarding optimal diagnostic strategies for 511 antibiotic allergi es ha ve been published . In this parameter, updates regarding beta lactams 512 including penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems , and monobactams will be discussed. In 513 addition , important changes to diagnostic strategies for sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones , and 514 macrolides will also be reviewed. 515 Penicillin 516 Since the last practice parameter update on drug allergy, several lines of evidence have 517 pointed to the fact that a label of penicillin allergy is not benign.13 Patients with a history of 518 penicillin allergy ar e more likely to be treated with less effective, more toxic, or more expensive 519 antibiotics leading to increased cost, antibiotic associated infections, longer hospital stays, and 520 even increased mortality.14-19 Cost and simulation model -based economic studi es support that 521 penicillin allergy assessment is a cost -saving intervention.20, 21 Therefore, a proactive effort 522 should be made to delabel penicillin allergy whenever possible, and strong efforts should be 523 made to educate about the benefits of delabeling t o patients and clinicians. 524 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 19 There are multiple strategies for penicillin allergy delabeling which are primarily based 525 on the history of the reaction and patient comorbidities. While penicillin skin testing has been 526 the most carefully studied skin test reagent for drug allergy, we suggest penicillin skin testing 527 primarily for patients with a history of anaphylaxis or a recent reaction suspected to be IgE - 528 mediated (e.g., immediate onset urticaria) .22 For most other patients with histories of penicillin 529 allergy that are remote and benign, direct challenge without preceding skin testing is the 530 preferred a pproach. Patient histories are not always accurate, nevertheless risk -stratification by 531 historical features alone appears to be able to safely identify patients appropriate for direct 532 challenge. One caveat is that the majority of these studies have been conducted b y allergy 533 specialists and whether outcomes would be similar with histories and challenges performed by 534 non-allergy specialists remains to be determined. In pediatric patients with a history of benign 535 cutaneous reactions , we recommend direct amoxicillin ch allenge without preceding penicillin 536 skin testing. In contrast, adults with histories of distant and benign cutaneous reactions can be 537 considered for direct amoxicillin challenge (without skin testing) . However for those adults who 538 are particularly anxious or uncomfortable with the idea of a direct challenge, performing 539 penicillin skin tests first may be considered, since confirmation of negative penicillin skin testing 540 may be useful to alleviate these fears . In adult patients who are uncomfortable or anxio us 541 about direct oral challenge, negative skin testing may be useful to alleviate those fears. For 542 patients with histories that are inconsistent with penicillin allergy (such as headache or family 543 history of penicillin allergy) , no testing is required and t he patient may be delabeled. However, 544 in patients who are reluctant to accept the removal of a penicillin allergy after appropriate 545 counseling, amoxicillin challenge using a single treatment dose is sufficient to rule out an allergy 546 (and to gain acceptance of the delabeling) . Multiple day penicillin challenges are not 547 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 20 recommended as recent studies have shown that single day challenges detect the majority of 548 delayed reactions.23, 24 Recently, reports of patients with selective allergic reactions to 549 piperacil lin tazobactam have been published indicating that most patients with reactions to 550 piperacillin tazobactam can tolerate other penicillins.25, 26 Skin testing to piperacillin tazobactam 551 may be useful to identify this selective sensitivity where traditional penicillin skin testing or 552 amoxicillin challenge may be negative.25, 26 553 Cephalosporins 554 Immediate allergic reactions to cephalosporins appear largely to be related to antigenic 555 responses to the R1 group/side chains rather than the core beta -lactam portion of the molecule 556 or R2 group/side chains .27 Like in penicillin allergy, the history of the reaction is important in 557 determining the diagnostic approach. For immediate reactions to cephalosporins , we suggest 558 stratifying patients based on anaphylactic reactio ns versus non -anaphylactic reactions. For 559 those patients with non -anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a direct challenge should be 560 performed for a cephalosporin with dissimilar side chains to determine tolerance. In contrast , 561 for administration of cephalo sporins with similar side chains and for the less common 562 anaphylactic reaction history , a negative cephalosporin skin test to a parenteral cephalosporin 563 should be performed prior to challenge to determine tolerance. Urticaria fulfilling \"1 -1-1-1\" 564 criterio n (appearance within 1 hour after the 1st dose and regression within 1 day and occurred 565 within 1 year) suggests a high likelihood of having a positive skin test .22 566 Beta -lactam Cross -Reactivity 567 Since the last drug allergy practice parameter update, several studies indicate that the 568 risk of cross -reactivity amongst beta -lactams is lower than previous reports suggested.28 For 569 management approaches , we suggest stratifying patients based on anaphylactic versus non - 570 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 21 anaphylactic histories as well as verified versus unverified (unconfirmed) penicillin allergy. We 571 suggest that for patients with a history of an unverified non -anaphylactic penicillin allergy, a ny 572 cephalosporin can be administered routinely without testing or additional precautions. For 573 example, patients with a history of urticaria to a penicillin can receive any cephalosporin 574 routinely without prior testing. In contrast , for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis 575 to penicillin, a non -cross -react ive cephalosporin (e.g. cefazolin) can be administered routinely 576 without prior testing. 577 For patients with a primary allergy to cephalosporin, we suggest a similar approach 578 stratifying patients based on anaphylactic versus non -anaphylactic histories , as well as verified 579 versus unverified cephalosporin allergy. We suggest that for patients with a history of an 580 unverified non -anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a penicillin can be administered without 581 testing or additional precautions. For example, patients with a prior history of urticaria to 582 cephalexin can receive amoxicillin without prior testing. In contrast, for those rare patients with 583 a history of anaphylaxis to a cephalosporin, we suggest penicillin skin testing and drug challenge 584 be performed prior to administration of penicillin therapy. 585 Guidance on administration of carbapenems to patients with penicillin allergy has also 586 changed since the last drug allergy practice parameter update.28 We now suggest that in 587 patients with a history of penicillin o r cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be 588 administered without testing or additional precautions regardless of whether the reaction was 589 anaphylactic or not. In regard to monobactams such as aztreonam, both penicillin and 590 cephalosporin allergic patients may be administered aztreonam without prior testing with the 591 exception of patients who are allergic to ceftazidime (due to aztreonam and ceftazidime sharing 592 an identical R1 side chain ). However, since aztreonam is an expensive alternative for patients 593 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 22 allergic to penicillins, and there is increasing monobactam resistance, delabeling the penicillin 594 allergy is recommended.29 595 Cross -reactivity between beta -lactams in patients with SCARs appears based on the R1 596 side chain but data are incomplete. Avoidance o f all beta -lactams is generally recommended in 597 patients with a SCAR that is considered highly likely to be due to a beta -lactam; however, the 598 risk of a reaction should be weighed against the benefit of treatment of the underlying infection 599 and the availabi lity of alternative treatment options. For some SCARs, such as DRESS, skin 600 testing and other adjunctive testing may help identify the culprit drug and cross -reactivity 601 patterns, but no testing has a 100% negative predictive value. Small case series data su ggest 602 that some patients with DRESS from penicillins may tolerate other beta -lactams .30 Although 603 reported cases of SCARS due to 2 different classes of beta -lactams are rare, larger studies are 604 required to determine the safety of using alternative beta -lactams in patients with SCARs due 605 to a specific beta -lactam. 606 607 Sulfonamides 608 Guidance on the approach to sulfonamide allergy has also changed significantly since 609 the last drug allergy parameter update. As opposed to recommending induction of drug 610 tolerance pro tocols for those with histories of sulfonamide allergy, we now suggest direct 611 challenges that can be completed within 2 -3 hours . For patients with a history of benign 612 cutaneous reactions (e.g. morbilliform drug eruption [MDE ] or urticaria) to sulfonamide 613 antibiotics that occurred > 5 years ago, a 1 -step drug challenge with trimethoprim - 614 sulfamethoxazole can be performed when there is a need to delabel a sulfonamide antibiotic 615 allergy. For patients with reactions within the past 5 years, a 2 -step challenge is now 616 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 23 recommended. Sulfonamide delabeling can be performed for both immunocompetent and 617 immunocompromised individuals (including HIV infected patients) when there is a need for 618 sulfonamide antibiotic therapy. 619 Fluoroquinolones 620 Immediate -type reactions to flu oroquinolones have been increasingly described. There 621 is evidence for both IgE -mediated and non -IgE-mediated mechanisms, since fluoroquinolones 622 may cause non -specific mast cell degranulation via interaction with the surface receptor 623 MRGPRX2 .31 Unlike IgE -mediated reactions, non -IgE-mediated reactions may occur with first 624 exposure since prior sensitization is unnecessary. However, non -IgE-mediated reactions may 625 not be consistently or repeatedly observed for a given drug or be observed for other drugs that 626 interact with the MRGPRX2 receptor (such as vancomycin in patients who reacted to a 627 fluoroquinolone). For remote (i.e., >5 years ago) , non -anaphylactic reactions a 1- or 2-step 628 graded challenge with the implicated fluoroquinolone is suggested as a method of delabeling. 629 For more severe or recent (i.e., < 5 years ago) reactions, 1- or 2-step graded challenge with a 630 different fluoroquinolone than the one implicated in the historical reaction (since they may not 631 cross -react) may be considered. 632 Macrolides 633 While macrolides are one of the more common antibiotics listed in drug allergy records, 634 very few patients are confirmed to actually be allergic to macrolides. The utility of immediate - 635 type skin testing using non -irritating concentrations of macrolides is uncertain.32 Therefore, 636 based on the low pre -test probability, very low rate of anaphylaxis, and disagreement on the 637 utility of skin testing, direct challenge appears to be the most appropriate diagnostic approach 638 for patients with a history of non -anaphylactic reactions. 639 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 24 NSAID Hypersensitivity 640 Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause a spectrum of drug hypersensitivity reactions, including 641 exacerbation of underlying respiratory or pneumonitis 34 There are four primary categories of 643 NSAID reactions that can be diagnosed via history, presence of comorbid diseases , and drug 644 challenges. These reaction s include AERD, NSAID -induced urticaria and angioedema, , and single NSAID -induced reactions. A selective COX -2 inhibitor 646 may be used as an alternative analgesic in patients with any NSAID hypersensitivity phenotype 647 when an NSAID is needed. 648 In m any patients with suspected AERD, the clinical history is often sufficient to make a 649 diagnosis and an oral aspirin challenge is not required. However , in cases of diagnostic 650 uncertainty where patients may be avoiding aspirin or NSAI Ds, an oral aspirin challenge is 651 suggested to confirm the diagnosis of AERD. Aspirin desensitization followed by aspirin therapy 652 can be used to control nasal polyp regrowth and allow aspirin therapy for cardioprotection or 653 use of NSAIDs for pain relief. S everal different protocols for aspirin desensitization exist. 654 The phenotype of NSAID -exacerbated cutaneous disease manifests as exacerbations of 655 urticaria or angioedema in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. The general approach 656 to patients with t his condition is to primarily control the underlying urticaria. Patients whose 657 urticaria is controlled on either H1-antihistamines or omalizumab may be able to tolerate NSAID 658 therapy. 659 In contrast to the aforementioned phenotypes of aspirin/NSAID exacerbated respiratory 660 and cutaneous diseases, the NSAID inducible cutaneous phenotype cause s 661 urticaria/angioedema in patients without any underlying chronic spontaneous urticaria. 662 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 25 Patients wit h this phenotype may react to all cyclooxygenase 1 ( COX -1) inhibitors. An aspirin 663 challenge is suggested to identify such patients where there is uncertainty regarding tolerance 664 to other NSAIDs. 665 Lastly , there are patients who react specifically to single N SAIDs or structurally related 666 NSAIDs. There are multiple phenotypes within this group and patients may have reactions that 667 are immediate (i.e., urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis ) or delayed reactions (i.e., fixed 668 eruptions, meningitis, pneumonitis , or many others ). These single reactions are not 669 related to COX -1 inhibition and are thought to be either IgE -mediated reactions in the case of 670 immediate reactions or related to drug specific T -cell delayed hypersensitivity. 671 Guidance on the approach to patients with a history of aspirin allergy in the setting of an 672 acute coronary syndrome have changed since the last updated drug allergy parameter. As 673 opposed to utilizing an aspirin desensitization protocol, we suggest a 2-step aspirin challenge 674 for patients labeled with a n aspirin allergy if the history does not suggest aspirin -exacerbated 675 respiratory disease . A graded challenge is preferred as it provides the patient and clinician with 676 a true diagnosis and if negative, simpli fies any further questions about aspirin use. A challenge 677 is simpler than a desensitization (no need for compounding the aspirin dose), faster, and will 678 efficiently answer the question regarding hypersensitivity while simultaneously achieving the 679 therapeut ic objective. 680 Cancer Chemotherapeutics 681 Guidance on management of hypersensitivity reactions to cancer chemotherapeutics 682 has been expanded significantly in this parameter. The main approaches to care after a 683 presumed hypersensitivity reaction ( HSR) to a che motherapeutic include (1) desensitization, (2) 684 skin testing to assist with risk stratification , (3) risk stratification without skin testing and drug 685 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 26 challenge or (4) avoidance of the offending agent if an equally efficacious alternative exists . If 686 the clinical assessment is consistent with a HSR, then empiric desensitization is a reasonable 687 and safe approach to care and can be performed even when skin testing is not possible (i.e., 688 outpatient clinic without access to chemotherapy drugs for skin testing) . Candidates for drug 689 desensitization to chemotherapeutics include those with type I hypersensitivity reactions (mast 690 cell-mediated/IgE -dependent) including anaphylaxis. While 3 -bag desensitization protocols 691 have been most commonly utilized for intravenous medications , increasing evidence suggests 692 similar safety and efficacy by using a 1 -bag protocol resulting in a simpler and more time 693 efficient desensitization but more data are needed especially in patients with severe initial 694 HSRs .35 Patients without a c onvincing clinical history of a HSR do not require desensitization and 695 typically respond well to re -administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. Examples include 696 subjective symptoms of pruritus or lip swelling without any objective skin findings during th e 697 infusion. If symptoms are mild in nature (i.e., flushing or pruritus alone without hives, back pain 698 alone) or there is heightened patient concern around re -administration, then premedications, 699 such as H1-antihistamines, and a slowed infusion rate have be en used successfully without the 700 need for desensitization.36 701 Platins 702 For patients with a history of immediate allergic reactions to platinum -based 703 chemotherapeutic agents, the severity of the initial HSR and skin testing results may assist in 704 their risk s tratification and management. Skin testing may be useful in the management of 705 patients with platin HSRs and also identif ies cases where desensitization may be unnecessary 706 despite a clinical history suggestive of an HSR. However, while avoiding unnecessary 707 desensitization by identifying truly allergic patients, risk stratification protocols can create 708 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 27 operational challenges in addition to rising costs, increased patient time, multiple office visits , 709 and potential delays in treatment. Empiric desensitization remains a safe method to manage 710 patients after a platin HSR. 711 Taxanes 712 Taxane HSRs are generally thought not to be related to the active drug but instead may 713 be caused by excipients. In contrast to platinum HSR w here skin testing may be of value, the 714 role of skin testing after a taxane HSR remains unclear. We suggest that for patients with a 715 history of immediate allergic reactions to taxanes, the severity of the initial HSR may assist in 716 their risk stratification and manage ment. Pretreatment with systemic corticosteroids and H1- 717 antihistamines can decrease the rate of reactions to taxanes from 30% to 3%.37-39 For patients 718 with more Tyrosine kinase inhibitors been associated with significant idiosyncratic or 721 pharmacologic effects including cutaneous and systemic side effects (including a recent FDA 722 black box warning for serious heart -related events, cancer, blood clots, and death).40 The 723 mechanism of these adverse effects is pleotropic and may relate directly to tyrosine kinase 724 effects rather than immunologic hypersensitivity. Like other reactions associated with 725 chemotherapeutic drugs, recognition and correct clinical phenotyping is key to risk stratification 726 and the formulation of an appropriate management plan. This includes the decision on when to 727 reduce the dose, stop the drug , treat with corticosteroids , challenge or desensitize . 728 Immune checkpoint inhibitors 729 Immun e checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer treatment. The currently 730 available ICI are mAbs that block specific immune checkpoints, cytotoxic T -lymphocyte - 731 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 2022 28 associated protein 4 ( CTLA -4), programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1), and programmed 732 death-ligand 1 (PD -L1), leading to increases in T -cell activation and proliferation.41 The 733 mechanism of action of these drugs, which reduce self -tolerance, can lead to a number of 734 toxicities that are typically organ -specific autoimmune events and referred to as immune - 735 related adverse events (irAEs).41 The most common of these are mild to moderate and include 736 dermatitis, thyroiditis, and other endocrinopathies, hepatitis, colitis, interstitial nephritis and 737 pneumonitis.42-44 Rare but potentially fatal events include myocarditis and encephalitis.45, 46 It 738 is important for the allergist -immunologist to recognize these non -allergic events as they may 739 be consulted for common toxicities such as rashes or organ dysfunction or they may have 740 patients that they are fol lowing for other reasons that are under treatment with an ICI.44 741 Management of irAEs requires multidisciplinary care. 742 Biologics 743 Biologic agents are newer therapeutic agents created from living cells, tissues or 744 organisms that include mAbs (suffix \"mab\") an d soluble fusion receptors (suffix \"cept\"). Biologic 745 agents including mAbs have the benefit of target specificity and infrequent dosing yet have 746 potential to be immunogenic. A variety of mechanisms may result in reactions including 747 complement activation, SSLR, and mast cell activation either via IgE -mediated or direct mast 748 cell activation.47 Non -immune mechanisms such as tumor lysis and cytokine storm may also 749 cause symptoms that overlap with immune -mediated reactions. The utility of diagnostic testing 750 (e.g., skin testing and in -vitro testing) is limited by several factors including, but not limited to, 751 mechanistic uncertainty, the cost of the medications, availability, lack of validation, and the 752 unknown predictive value. Given these limitations, we suggest that skin testing for mAbs is 753 rarely clinically indicated or performed. 754 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 29 For patients with non -immediate reactions or a history of reactions inconsistent with 755 mAb HSR , a desensitization may not be required and treatment with a slowed infusion, graded 756 dose escalation, and/or premedications is suggested. In contrast, for patients with immediate 757 reactions including anaphylactic reactions to mAbs, drug desensitization should be considered 758 when the implicated drug is the preferred therapy. As in cancer chemother apy desensitization, 759 increasing evidence suggests similar safety and efficacy by using a 1 -bag protocol resulting in a 760 simpler and more time efficient desensitization but more data are needed especially in patients 761 with severe initial HSRs .35 762 Rituximab 763 The risk of rituximab HSR is especially high during the initial infusion, as up to 77% of 764 patients being treated for a B -cell lymphoma can develop a reaction during their first 765 exposure.48 Paradoxically, the risk of having a reaction to rituximab appears t o decrease with 766 subsequent infusions.49, 50 Tumor burden affects the type of infusion reaction . Other reactions 767 encompass several different immunologic mechanisms, including cytokine release syndrome, 768 hypersensitivity (mast cell -mediated) reactions and tum or lysis syndrome. Shared decision 769 making, in which the risks and benefits of the options are considered, is an important strategy. 770 For milder rituximab HSRs, slowed infusion (typically 50% usual infusion rate), graded challenge , 771 or desensitization are con sidered as reasonable options. In more severe reactions, empiric 772 desensitization is preferred. The utility of rituximab skin testing is unclear, especially in cases 773 where the reaction likely is not mast cell mediated. While drug challenges have been perfor med 774 in patients with moderate -severe reactions to biologics (including rituximab) and negative skin 775 testing, several of the patients who reacted upon challenge had moderate to severe 776 anaphylaxis.51 All challenges were carried out in an intensive care unit setting specifically 777 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 30 assigned for drug desensitization patients. The workgroup recommends this approach should 778 be considered only by very specialized centers. In patients who develop SSLRs to rituximab and 779 for whom there are no equally efficacious therapie s, rechallenge can be considered after 780 shared decision making with an assessment of risks and benefits. 781 Cetuximab 782 Most of the severe HSRs to cetuximab were associated with pre -existing IgE antibodies 783 against galactose --1,3-galactose, a carbohydrate attach ed to cetuximab.52 Investigation of th e 784 regional variation in reaction rates led to the discovery that Lone Star tick bites were the cause 785 of specific -IgE to galactose --1,3-galactose (alpha -gal) in these individuals. Other mAbs are 786 produced with the murin e SP2/0 cell line used for cetuximab and are glycosylated with alpha - 787 gal. These include infliximab, abciximab, basiliximab, canakinumab, golimumab, and 788 ustekinumab. While the alpha -gal content is lower in these antibodies, a case of first -dose 789 anaphylaxis to infliximab due to cross -reactive alpha -gal specific -IgE has been reported.53 There 790 are successful reports of desensitization to cetuximab in the literature.54, 55 791 Infliximab 792 Similar to rituximab, the mechanisms of infliximab reactions are likely divers e, including IgE 793 mediated hypersensitivity, cytokine release syndrome , and SSLR.56 HSR to infliximab occur in 794 approximately 10% of patients and are usually during the first or second exposure but can also 795 occur with subsequent doses. Antibodies against infliximab may reduce the efficacy of treatment 796 and increase the risk of HSR.57, 58 Risk stratification based on the severity of the HSR can be 797 considered in the evaluation and management of individuals that develop reactions to infliximab. 798 Testing for alp ha-gal specific -IgE should be considered in patients with first dose reactions to 799 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 31 infliximab, given the aforementioned potential for cross -reactivity in patients with alpha -gal 800 allergy. 801 Omalizumab 802 The risk of anaphylaxis with omalizumab is <0.1%, but interestingly 36% of reactions 803 occurred more than 1 hour after administration of the drug, and 7% occurred > 12 hours later .59, 60 804 In that study, 69% of the reactions occurred with the first 2 doses. A nonirritating omalizumab 805 concentration for intradermal skin testing was defined at 1:100,000 volume to volume dilution, a 806 concentration of 1.25 mg/mL, but the predictive value has not been established in individuals with 807 anaphylaxis to omalizumab.61 There are reports of successful desensitization to omalizuma b.62-65 808 SSLRs have also been reported with omalizumab. 809 810 Excipients 811 An excipient is an inactive substance that is formulated alongside the active 812 pharmaceutical ingredient of a medication. Excipients include coloring agents, preservatives, 813 stabilizers , and fillers.66 Excipients are more likely to contribute to intolerance than to a true 814 allergic reaction.67 Categories of excipients include foods and sugars such as lactose, mannitol, 815 gelatin , and cornstarch; polymers such as derivatives; dyes 816 and coloring agents; and other ingredients such as carboxymethylcellulose.66 The average oral 817 formulation of a product has approximately 9 inactive ingredients.66 Excipients are a very rare 818 cause of immediate or delayed reactions associat ed with drugs.68-70 Although delayed reactions 819 are associated with some excipients (e.g. propylene glycol), the most worrisome reactions are 820 life-threatening anaphylaxis associated with excipients such as PEG and carboxymethylcellulose 821 in injectable corti costeroids.68, 71 The optimal testing strategy for polysorbates and their cross - 822 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 32 reactivity with PEG requires further study. Excipient allergy may be considered in patients with 823 a history of anaphylaxis to >2 structurally unrelated drugs or products that share a common 824 excipient, (e.g., injectable corticosteroids; PEG-based laxatives). 825 826 827 Methods and overview of the practice parameter development 828 process 829 830 This practice parameter focuses on updates to the diagn osis and management of 831 various drug allergy reactions since the previous drug allergy practice parameters were 832 published in 2010.1 This update focuses on evolving evidence surrounding characterization of 833 drug allergy reactions, phenotyping, diagnosis, mana gement, clarification of drug allergy history 834 and updates to non -antibiotic drug allergy. A workgroup of experts was chaired by David Khan, 835 MD. The workgroup determined which areas warranted an update and then performed a 836 literature search for all relevant articles published since 2008. A search of the medical literature 837 was performed using a variety of terms that were considered relevant for this practice 838 parameter. Literature searches were performed on PubMed, MEDLINE, Medscape, Google 839 Scholar, and the Co chrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The time frame for most searches 840 was 2008 to 2021, but some topics required searches for an expanded timeframe from 1960 to 841 present. The searches included only English -language articles. 842 Although the ideal type of ref erence would consist of a randomized, double -blind, 843 placebo -controlled study, the topic of this practice parameter is represented by very few such 844 studies. Consequently, it was necessary to use observational studies, case series, basic 845 laboratory reports, and expert review articles to develop a document that addresses most of 846 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 33 the issues included in this practice parameter. The references cited in this practice parameter 847 represent the best quality and most relevant evidence for the discussion and recommendat ions 848 made herein. 849 This practice parameter contains systematically developed recommendations intended 850 to optimize care of patients and to assist physicians and/or other health care practitioners and 851 patients to make decisions regarding diagnosis and managem ent of suspected drug allergy. This 852 practice parameter was not intended to be a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 853 Development and Evaluation (GRADE) document. Because GRADE documents require a 854 comprehensive literature search, systematic review, and m eta-analysis for each question, they 855 require substantial resources, making it cost prohibitive to attempt to conduct a GRADE 856 analysis for all of the questions for which clinicians would like an answer. In addition, for many 857 questions, there is very limited evidence , and the work group/Joint Task Force on Practice 858 Parameters (JTFPP) must in these cases rely on expert evidence and opinion. Therefore, in this 859 practice parameter the recommendations are CBS s, which are based, at best, on a recent 860 literature sear ch of PubMed to update or add to the 2010 drug allergy document.1 We have 861 changed our method of grading recommendations to be more transparent, choosing words that 862 are used in a formal GRADE document (e .g., strong and conditional), to be consistent in 863 term inology and to maintain a common thread. However, the use of these words do es not 864 imply that we are equating our recommendations to the rigor required by a GRADE document. 865 The strength of the CBSs is determined to be either strong or conditional as defined in 866 Table I. The certainty of evidence for each recommendation is determined to be high, 867 moderate, low, or very low as defined in Table II. When the JTFPP did not have adeq uate 868 published evidence with which to determine the certainty of evidence , but nonetheless 869 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 34 recognized the need to provide guidance to the clinician, the CBSs were based on the collective 870 expert opinion and experience of the work group and JTFPP. Table III lists all the CBSs. 871 The practice parameter development process involved several stages. The workgroup began 872 the process by developing a list of key clinical questions and topics to be addressed. The topics 873 and questions were selected to reflect the most si gnificant advances and changes in the field 874 that affect clinical practice. At least 2 workgroup members were assigned to write and review 875 each section. A literature search was completed to determine the most updated information 876 for each CBS and discussion. The draft sections were reviewed by the workgroup chair with 877 subsequent revision by the authors. Subsequently, all sections were reviewed and revised by 878 the entire workgroup through several rounds of electronic and teleconference reviews. The 879 guideline wa s reviewed in detail by the JTFPP and revisions, when needed, were made in 880 conjunction with the workgroup. The external review follow ed as described above under 881 ''resolving conflict of interest'' in the Front Matter . 882 MAIN TEXT 883 Diagnostic Testing Updates 884 885 Drug Challenges 886 887 Drug challenges are a diagnostic test considered the reference standard to determine if 888 a patient may safely take a medication. A number of terms have been used to describe this 889 procedure including drug provocation tests, graded challenges , and test doses. The term \"drug 890 challenge\" is recommended as this is in keeping with other allergic diseases (e.g. food 891 challenges, sting challenges). While \"drug provocation\" is commonly used in the international 892 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 35 literature, we do not recommend this term as the intent is to show tolerance rather than to 893 provoke a reaction. Drug challenges may be given in an incremental (graded) fashion but can 894 also be administered as a single dose. 895 Drug challenges are typically indicated in patients who after evaluation are deemed 896 unlikely to be allergic to the drug. Several factors are used to determine whether a certain 897 history is a \"low -risk history\" and may include how remote the index reaction was, benign 898 cutaneous signs and symptoms only, subjective symptoms only, a high number of listed drug 899 allergies and drugs that infrequently cause allergic reactions. Drug challenges can be 900 particularly helpful in determining specific drug tolerance when a reaction occurs in the setting 901 of multiple concomitant drug exposures. Shared decision making may be used in patients with a 902 higher pretest probability of true allergy or a history of more severe reactions when the benefit 903 of drug therapy outweighs the risks. One exception to this is in patients being evaluated for 904 AERD with an unclear history where confirming sensitivity to aspirin may have significant 905 therapeutic implications (e.g. aspirin desensitization/therapy). In some patients with toxic 906 reactions to immune checkpoint inhibitors, drug rechallenge may also be considered.44 Drug 907 challenges are generally contraindicated in more severe non -IgE mediated reactions such as 908 SCAR, drug -induced liver injury, and drug -induced cytopenias ( Table IV). Rare exceptions to this 909 may include treatment of a life -threatening illness where the benefit of treatment outweighs 910 the risk of a severe drug reaction. A study from South Africa revealed that 50% of 46 patients 911 re-challenged with anti -tuberculosis drugs causing SCAR developed re-introduction reactions, 912 with most mild -moderate and self -reso lved, but severe reactions also occurred.72 The same 913 group reported on a series of 6 patients with anti -tuberculosis therapy SCAR, who reacted upon 914 rechallenge but had resolution of symptoms and no development of SCAR after treatment with 915 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 36 a single dose of methylprednisolone (100 -200 mg) within 3 hours of onset of rechallenge 916 symptoms.73 While drug challenges have generally been avoided in cases of serum sickness, 917 there are reports of some patients being able to tolerate drug challenges after SSLRs to certai n 918 drugs including rituximab, amoxicillin and other beta -lactams.74-76 A recent study of 75 children 919 with SSLR to beta -lactams (all with arthralgias/arthritis), found 93% had a negative 2 -step 920 challenge, however, 5 of 20 patients who were contacted develope d benign rashes with a 921 subsequent full treatment course.77 Therefore, drug challenge can be considered in SSLR 922 through shared decision making, considering factors such as remoteness of reaction, 923 importance of the drug, and likelihood that the reaction was drug -related. 924 Consensus Based Statement 1: We suggest that when the clinical probability of a drug allergy 925 is low, in patients without contraindications for a drug challenge, that it be performed with a 926 1- or 2-step drug challenge. 927 Strength of Recommendat ion: Conditional 928 Certainty of Evidence: Low 929 Numerous techniques for drug challenges have been published and the approach varies 930 considerably between clinicians and countries, but few have undergone comparative studies.78 931 A U.S. study compared outcomes of p atients with low -risk histories who underwent 1 - or 2-step 932 challenges (n=456) with multistep challenges involving 3 or 4 steps (n=74).79 Most challenges 933 were for antimicrobials (most commonly penicillin) but NSAIDs, opioids, cardiovascular drugs 934 and others were included. While 47% of challenges underwent skin testing before challenges 935 (the majority for penicillins), the rest did not have prior skin tests. Reactions were generally 936 mild -moderate and occurred at a similar low frequency between 1 -2 step challen ges (11%) and 937 the 3 -4 step challenges (12%). Data are lacking comparing 1 -step versus 2 -step challenges in 938 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 37 regard to safety. In patients with a history of more severe reaction or higher pretest probability, 939 2-step challenges may be preferred. The European Network for Drug Allergy and the European 940 Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology interest group on drug hypersensitivity guideline 941 for drug provocation tests have indicated a starting dose between 1:10,000 and 1:10 of the 942 therapeutic dose but typically involve multiple steps.80 There is a theoretical concern that 943 multistep challenges may potentially cause a desensitization. However, an in vitro animal 944 desensitization model of mast cells sensitized to dust mite showed that inhibition of mast cell 945 mediato r release was greatest with 2 -fold concentration increases compared to 10 -fold 946 increases, suggesting that 10 -fold increases used in drug challenges would be unlikely to cause 947 desensitization.81 A retrospective study from France analyzed optimal dosing for drug 948 challenges evaluating their 6 -9-step protocols starting as low as 1/10,000th of the final dose.82 949 Based on analysis of their reactive doses, they recommended a shorter 4 -step protocol starting 950 with 5% of the therapeutic dose. However, they also performed challenges in patients with 951 histories of anaphylaxis and found a 10 -fold increased risk for anaph ylaxis (compared with 952 patients without culprit drug anaphylaxis) during challenge, even with doses at 1% or less. For 953 these patients, they recommended starting at a 1/10,000th of the treatment dose. For most 954 drugs, which lack accurate skin or in vitro diag nostic testing, it is recommended to avoid drug 955 challenges in patients with convincing histories of anaphylaxis as drug desensitization would be 956 a safer approach. Some centers have performed 2 -3 challenges in the same day to multiple 957 antibiotics or a combi nation of antibiotics and NSAIDs.83, 84 While this is usually a more efficient 958 approach, the potential drawback to this approach is that if a delayed reaction occurs, repeat 959 separate drug challenges would be required. Finally, drug challenges can be used f or evaluation 960 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 38 of delayed drug reactions.85 Suggested challenge approaches are shown in Table V for patients 961 with histories of immediate reactions and Table VI for those with histories of delayed reactions. 962 While drug challenges are considered the reference standard for drug allergy 963 evaluations, some patients may have subsequent drug reactions despite a negative challenge. 964 In fact, compared to individuals with no history of a drug allergy, those who report at least one 965 drug allergy report a 2 to 3 -fold highe r incidence rate of new adverse reactions to most classes 966 of medications.86 A multi -center survey from centers in France, Italy and Portugal contacted 967 patients after negative drug evaluations.87 Out of 365 patients surveyed, 118 took the drug 968 found negativ e on testing or another related agent and 9 (7.6%) reported a reaction (urticaria 969 or an exanthem). Of these 9 patients, 4 accepted re -evaluation and 2 were found to be tolerant 970 upon repeat challenge with the other 2 reacting. Including the 5 who refused re -evaluation as 971 reactors, results yielded a NPV of 94.1% for drug challenge. A study from Turkey involving 91 972 children who received drugs previously challenged as negative found 11 who reported 973 reactions.88 Nine of the 11 cases were reevaluated with drug ch allenge and only 2 had positive 974 challenges. Including the 2 reactors who refused rechallenge, data yielded a NPV of 95.6%. 975 Thus, drug challenges have a high NPV, but similar to all tests are not infallible. We therefore 976 recommend that patients be delabeled following a negative drug challenge. 977 The safety of drug challenges has been evaluated in many studies and is dependent on 978 the inclusion of higher risk patients, the culprit drug, and the use of placebos. In recent U.S. 979 studies, the lowest rates of reacti ons (0.8 -4%) occurred in studies of low -risk patients when a 980 history of subjective reactions were considered and placebos were utilized.9, 89 Other recent 981 U.S. studies have shown reaction rates to be slightly higher (9 -12%), including rare reports of 982 anaph ylaxis occurring with parenteral challenges.79, 90 Several studies from a number of 983 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 39 countries have determined the safety of drug challenges in pediatric populations with rates of 984 reactions ranging from 4.7 -29.8%, with higher rates attributed to inclusion o f NSAID 985 challenges.91-95 In a meta -analysis of 112 primary studies which included a total of 26,595 986 participants with previous penicillin anaphylaxis, the pooled frequency of severe reactions to 987 challenge was estimated at 0.06% (95% Credible Interval [95%C rI]=0.01 -0.13%;I2=57.9%).96 988 Drug challenges are more likely to be positive in patients with NSAID reaction histories when 989 compared to antibiotic allergies, and this topic is reviewed elsewhere in this parameter. A 990 survey of international allergy specialist s reported that most respondents indicated that 991 challenges were very safe procedures, without any reports of need for transfer to an intensive 992 care unit for management of a reaction and low rates of need for epinephrine.78 Fatalities from 993 oral drug challen ge are exceedingly rare.97 994 For patients who require a specific drug that is urgently needed and more effective than 995 alternatives, treating through a mild exanthematous reaction with H1-antihistamines and 996 topical corticosteroids may be a reasonable approac h.98-100 Warning signs which would indicate 997 discontinuation of the drug may include the development of 1) target or bullous lesions, 2) 998 pustulosis, 3) widespread dark erythema, 4) painful skin, 5) mucosal erosions, 6) elevated liver 999 enzymes and 7) impaire d renal function. In general, the intention of a drug challenge is to rule 1000 out rather than confirm a specific delayed reaction. In the setting of SCAR, except under 1001 extreme circumstances where treatment options are limited, and the risk from an infection 1002 exceeds the morbidity of the adverse drug reaction such as in patients with tuberculosis and 1003 HIV coinfection, rechallenge should not be attempted.6, 101 A single dose oral challenge for SCAR 1004 may not be sufficient to rule out a delayed reaction, and the chal lenge may need to be 1005 extended over several days.73 1006 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 40 Consensus Based Statement 2: We suggest that placebo -controlled drug challenges be 1007 considered in patients with a history of primarily subjective symptoms and/or multiple 1008 reported drug allergies. 1009 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1010 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1011 A drug challenge should be considered positive if it results in objective symptoms. 1012 Subjective symptoms (which may include throat tightness without visible orofacial angioedema, 1013 pruritus, lightheade dness, subjective facial swelling, dyspnea without objective findings) are 1014 common in drug challenges. Subjective symptoms have been reported more frequently in 1015 women, those with prior histories of subjective symptoms, and those with a high number of 1016 report ed drug allergies.9 Drug -associated inducible laryngeal obstruction (e.g., vocal cord 1017 dysfunction) can be commonly mistaken for anaphylaxis when the presentation includes only 1018 isolated throat or chest tightness, and diagnosis may require laryngoscopy.102-104 Since drug 1019 challenges can be anxiety provoking, objective reactions can also occur, even with placebo 1020 doses. These untoward responses to a placebo are referred to as a nocebo effect; a study from 1021 Turkey reported that 11.7% of nocebo reactions resulted i n objective findings such as flushing, 1022 urticaria, cough, wheezing, tachycardia and vomiting.105 For these reasons, placebo -controlled 1023 drug challenges should be considered in patients who are at risk for anxiety -induced reactions 1024 (e.g, patients with multipl e drug allergies and prior subjective symptoms). A U.S. study of 170 1025 patients who underwent single -blind placebo -controlled drug challenges (the majority to 1026 amoxicillin after negative penicillin skin tests) noted 8.2% reactions to placebo with only 4% 1027 reac ting to the drug.89 In this study, placebo reactors were women who were more likely to 1028 have multiple drug allergy histories.89 For patients who report multiple drug allergies, 1029 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 41 demonstrating a nocebo reaction can be helpful to legitimize their symptoms whil e 1030 demonstrating they are not due to a drug allergy. Explaining to patients that placebo -controlled 1031 challenges are a routine method used to assist clinicians in interpreting identical symptoms that 1032 may be induced by an allergic drug reaction or anxiety/fear can be helpful. Suggested challenge 1033 approaches are shown in Table VII. 1034 1035 Testing for Delayed Hypersensitivity Reactions 1036 Overview 1037 Delayed106, 107 reactions occur on average in 2 -5% of treatment courses for common 1038 drugs such as antibiotics and may be higher in some populations , such as those treated with 1039 multiple drugs or patients co -infected with human immunodeficiency virus , where the risk of a 1040 drug exanthem is estimated to be 100 fold times that of the general population .106, 108 Although 1041 delayed immunolog ically mediated reactions are defined as those that occur at least 6 hours 1042 after dosing , the majority of delayed or T -cell mediated reactions occur early in the second 1043 week after initiation of drug therapy (Figure 1).106 1044 Testing for Delayed HSRs 1045 Evidence is low for all testing modalities for delayed HSRs and generally based on small 1046 case series without drug challenge ; hence , the sensitivity, specificity, PPV , and NPV cannot be 1047 reliably calculated. Currently , clinical diagnosis is still considered to be the gold standard. For 1048 more complex reactions , scoring systems and phenotype standardization have been proposed , 1049 including an online scoring calculator for DRESS available at 1050 https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=LPWDTD7TYCKN3TFM (See Supplemental Figure E 1) 1051 and others.107, 109, 110 The time from start of dosing to development of a delayed reaction varies 1052 considerably among drugs and types of reactions and is critical to defining the clinical 1053 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 42 phenotype and the culprit drug . Examples of clinically relevant d elayed hypersensitivity 1054 phenotypes compared with immediate hypersensitivity phenotypes are shown in Figure 1. This 1055 latency period combined with the clinical picture, including characteristics of the rash or 1056 systemic involvement , and histopathology (usually from a skin biopsy ), are valuable clues as to 1057 the clinical phenotype. Drug causality algorithms have also been derived to aid in the 1058 identification of specific drugs or classes of drugs in relation to specific drug reactions .111, 112 An 1059 instructional vide o on delayed hypersensitivity testing is available 1060 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= -KmMF_X5g4g. vivo testing ( PT and dIDT) 1063 Consensus Based Statement 3: We suggest that for specific phenotypes of delayed drug HSRs 1064 where the pre -test probability is high (e.g., DRESS), but the implicated agent is uncertain, 1065 that dIDT and/or PT may be useful as adjunctive tests to support drug causality. 1066 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1067 Certainty of Evidence: Very Low 1068 1069 The met hod and interpretation of dIDT and PT is outlined in Table VIII8, 113 and an 1070 instructional video for these tests is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= - 1071 KmMF_X5g4g . The use of dIDT (intracutaneous) PT (epicutan eous) for drugs has been less 1072 uniformly adopted in the U.S. by both allergist -immunologist s and dermatologists .114 Prick 1073 testing may also be used, but unless there is a suspicion of an immediate reaction, the 1074 sensitivity for delayed reactions is low. There is an overall lack of Food an d Drug Administration 1075 (FDA) approved reagents for testing, specialty centers that prepare and compound drugs for 1076 both dIDT and PT, and standardized methods .8, 115, 116 There is also lack of information on the 1077 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 43 relevant highest non -irritating concentrations for most drugs for both immediate and delayed 1078 reactions . Concentrations for some common drugs are listed in Supplemental Table EI . Unlike 1079 IgE-mediated reactions, the occurrence of a T-cell mediated reactions is much more dependent 1080 on the dose and concentration of the drug .115, 117 -119 The concentration of a drug needed to 1081 evoke a T -cell mediated response , both as a systemic or cutaneous HSR and in research -based 1082 in vitro/ex vivo assays , may be significantly higher than that which cau ses an immediate 1083 histamine release reaction.120-123 Evidence suggests that dIDT is more sensitive than PT for 1084 certain delayed reactions, such as MDE and DRESS/ drug -induced hypersensitivity syndrome 1085 where data are more compelling for antibiotic allergy and anticonvulsants (Table IX). 7, 113, 114, 1086 124-127 However, the ability to perform dIDT is dependent on the drug being available in a sterile 1087 parenteral formulation .7, 8 dIDT may be more convenient than PT for the patient as the re is no 1088 need to avoid showering, the reaction generally occurs within 24-48 hours, and the testing can 1089 be done on the arm in an area visible to the patient. For PT for drugs other than abacavir , it is 1090 essential that the drug remain in a soluble vehicle affi xed to the skin and undisturbed for 48 1091 hours. It is likely that the correct soluble vehicle for PT can considerably increase its sensitivity , 1092 but this is not known for most drugs . Petrolatum , or in some cases water for soluble drugs , is 1093 widely used for pra gmatic reasons. For SCAR, the sensitivity of PT and dIDT for most drugs 1094 cannot be calculated because of a lack of sufficient data with drug challenge . However, one 1095 study reported the rate of positivity of patch testing for serious cutaneous adverse drug 1096 reactions was greatest for DRESS (64%), followed by AGEP (58%) and SJS/TEN (24%) .7 In the 1097 case of a delayed reaction occurring in the setting of multiple drugs , PT and/or dIDT may be 1098 useful for both caus ality and cross -reactivity patterns. The use of PT and/or dIDT for different 1099 clinical phenotypes is shown in Table IX.7, 113, 114, 124 -127 For severe cutaneous adverse drug 1100 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 44 reactions like SJS/TEN , concern is not in triggering a reaction , but the lack of sensitivity of the 1101 PT. Given the imperfect negative predictive value , no patient with a negative dIDT or PT with a 1102 SCAR should be rechallenged to that specific culprit drug based on the results. In cases where 1103 one drug is patch test positive and other non-cross -reactive drugs administered concurrently 1104 are patch test negative the benefit o f rechallenge should be considere d against the risk of 1105 reaction. For DRESS , the sensitivity of PT is >50% for many drugs ; however , because of the risk 1106 of DRESS relapse , which is 12% in some studies ,128 it is prudent to avoid PT or dIDT until at least 1107 6 months ha ve elapsed from the acute reaction and/or the patient has been off systemic 1108 corticosteroid treatment for at least 1 month. This is due to the lower sensitivity o f the PT 1109 under these circumstances and also the chance of human herpesvirus reactivation and DRESS 1110 relapse which may cause confusion with the skin testing. The testing itself does not carry a risk 1111 of precipitating a systemic reaction and it does not lead t o viral reactivation .114 1112 Ex vivo and In vitro testing 1113 Currently there are no commercially available ex vivo or in vitro tests for delayed drug HSRs in 1114 the U.S. These are studied and available in select research laboratories but have not been 1115 validated across large numbers of drugs, patients, clinical phenotypes and centers. ELISpot is an 1116 ex vivo assay that detects antigen specific cytokine producing cells (most commonly interferon - 1117 ) in the peripheral blood in the presence of pharmacological doses of the drug or a defined 1118 metabolite of the drug , but typically in a concentration dependent manner .129-133 Flow 1119 cytometry and single -cell technologies that define the specific cell populations involved in the 1120 immunopathogenesis of delayed T -cell mediated reactions are evolving .134 The lymphocyte 1121 transformation test is another test commonly used in research laboratories that measures 1122 proliferation of T cells cultured in the presence of drug ,123, 135 -138 however, this has not been 1123 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 45 widely validated and is not available as a commercial test for drugs in the U .S. Like in vivo 1124 approaches , ex vivo and in vitro testing cannot be used to absolutely rule out a reaction to a 1125 drug , and clinical history is still the gold standard. 1126 1127 Pharmacogenomics 1128 Pharmacogenomics of Drug Allergy 1129 Most pharmacogenomic associations identified to -date are currently unlikely to translate into 1130 clinical practice; however, they have furthered our underst anding of the immunopathogenesis 1131 of these reactions .11, 12 1132 Immediate and Accelerated Reactions 1133 IgE-mediated 1134 Currently the specific ecologic and genetic factors leading to sensitization and 1135 predisposition to specific drug -induced IgE -mediated reactions an d differences across various 1136 populations in relation to epidemiology and patterns of drug utilization have not been well 1137 defined. The natural history of these reactions suggests that most reactions associated with 1138 common drugs such as penicillins and cepha losporins will wane with time.139 In addition, 1139 genetic factors, if important in the immunopathogenesis are likely necessary but insufficient 1140 and subject to ecologic (e.g., environmental determinants) and epigenetic modification. Most 1141 of the data in this area is with the penicillins and PEG -asparaginase. Several studies have shown 1142 an association between immediate hypersensitivity to asparaginase and immune response 1143 genes.140-145 In the first of these a strong association was noted between HLA -DRB1*07:01 and 1144 asparaginase hypersensitivity which correlated with the presence of PEG -asparaginase 1145 antibodies.140 A follow -up study to this demonstrated that these antibodies were specific to 1146 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 46 PEG, suggesting that PEG, and not L -asparaginase, is the major implicated antigen.146 A 1147 subsequent study also found a strong association with the intronic variant rs6021191 in nuclear 1148 factor of activated T cells 2, a transcription factor that controls T -cell activation. Independent 1149 studies showed a stro ng the DQA1*02:01 and immediate hypersensitivity to asparaginase.141 In one study reproducing the 1151 HLA class II association, children with variants in CCR4 -NOT Transcription Complex Subunit 3 1152 (rs73062 673), a gene shown to regulate the transcription of HLA genes, and HLA -DQA1 were 1153 more likely to experience PEG -asparaginase hypersensitivity.143 For beta lactams, until recently 1154 all but one study had taken a candidate gene approach. Some of the strongest a ssociations 1155 include: variation in HLA Class II antigen presenting genes, nucleotide -binding oligomerization 1156 domain -containing protein 2 genes which may affect HLA class II expression, release of pre - 1157 formed mediators such as beta -galactosidase -binding lect in involved 1159 association study was conducted on 662 patients with a clinical history of immediate reactions 1160 to either penicillins or cephal osporins that were confirmed by skin testing. A gene in linkage 1161 equilibrium with HLA -DRB1*10:01 (odds ratio [OR] 2.93; p= 5.4 x 10-7) was found to be 1162 associated with immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin.147 This was replicated in a second 1163 cohort with m eta-analysis of the two cohorts showing significant risk of immediate penicillin 1164 hypersensitivity associated with HLA -DRB1*10:01 recent 1165 genome -wide association study utilizing biobanks from the UK, Estonia, and U.S. associ ated a 1166 label of penicillin allergy with the HLA class I allele HLA -B*55:01(OR 1.30, p=2.04 x 10-31) and 1167 this was replicated in the 23andMe research cohort (OR 1.30, p=1 x 10-47).148 1168 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 47 Non-IgE mediated mast cell activation 1169 Several drugs in common use such as opioids, neuromuscular blocking agents, 1170 vancomycin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics and icatibant are capable of causing non -IgE 1171 dependent mast cell mediator release which presents with an anaphylaxis clinical phenotype 1172 (flushing, rash, minor changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and bronchospasm) without 1173 evidence of IgE cross -linking/Fc eRI signaling.149 A hallmark of non -IgE mediated mast cell 1174 activation associated with these drugs that is distinct from IgE mediated reactions, is that 1175 presentation varies in the same individual over time and is dependent on dose and method of 1176 administration. The mechanism by which these drug s activate mast cells is now thought to be 1177 through interaction with the MRGPRX2, mas -related G -protein coupled receptor.4, 150, 151 1178 Several loss and gain mutations have been identified that alter expression of an analogous 1179 receptor MRGPRX1 expressed on dorsal 1180 and pruritus.152 Although variation in MRGPRX2 has been defined there are cu rrently no studies 1181 associating polymorphisms in this gene with clinical phenotypes. 1182 Aspirin (and NSAID) exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) 1183 predictors of AERD belong to the arachidonic pathways and proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, and 1186 transforming growth factor beta. Genome wide analyses have also found HLA class II genes 1187 (HLA -DPB1) as the stro ngest Predictors 1188 exacerbated cutaneous disease are similar to AERD and are genes in the arachidonic acid 1189 pathway ALOX5 and other genes coding the ALOX5 -activating arachidonate, Journal 2022 48 thromboxane A synthas e 1, prostaglandin and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 1191 (CysLTR1.)11 1192 Delayed Reactions 1193 Class I HLA genes, have been strongly associated with severe delayed T -cell mediated 1194 adverse drug reactions. 12 These HLA associations may help to identif y patients and populations 1195 at risk for severe delayed HSRs ( Table X).12, 125, 126, 153 -159 For example, HLA-B*57:01 HLA -B*15:02 (carbamazepine SJS/TEN in some 1197 Southeast Asian countries) have been successfully utilized to reduce adverse drug reactions.125, 1198 156 Although many HLA and other gen etic associations may not translate into screening markers 1199 of immediate use, they may help shed light on immunopathogenesis.12 HLA-B*15:01 and HLA - 1200 DRB1*06:02 has been associated with amoxicillin -clavulanate drug induced liver injury in 1201 multiple studies; ho wever, the diagnostic test accuracy is too low for this to be used as a 1202 routine screening test for a commonly used antibiotic.160 1203 Physiologic states such as renal failure, or genetic variation in drug metabolism, may 1204 predispose to a specific T -cell mediat ed drug reactions. Small molecules and drugs have been 1205 posited to activate T cells through three non -mutually exclusive models that may explain a 1206 variety of clinical phenotypes.12, 153 The hapten/prohapten model postulates that the drug binds 1207 to a protein that then undergoes antigen processing to generate haptenated peptides that are 1208 presented by the major histocompatibility complex. For the pharmacological -interaction and 1209 altered peptide repertoire mechanisms a drug non -covalently interacts with immune rec eptors 1210 in a dose -dependent fashion. For instance, accumulation of oxypurinol (the long -acting 1211 metabolite of allopurinol), phenytoin by CYP2C9*3, and various CYP2B6 1212 polymorphisms in the case of nevirapine, are all associated with an inc reased risk of severe 1213 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 49 cutaneous adverse drug reactions.161-164 Although the immunopathogenesis of delayed 1214 reactions entails a complex interaction of drug and the host immune system, the exact set of 1215 mechanisms through which drugs cause tissue specific reac tions or by which T cells home to the 1216 skin and other organs and recognized drug altered epitopes has not been elucidated. 1217 A summary of recently described genetic associations with serious immunologically 1218 mediated adverse drug reactions in relation to thei r characteristics and those genetic 1219 associations currently recommended or used in clinical practice is shown in Table X. The safety 1220 and utility of a successful screening test means a 100% NPV, a reasonable PPV and a disease 1221 prevalence that although may be unusual is detectable in a given population. This translates 1222 into a realistic and cost -effective number needed to test to prevent one case of hypersensitivity 1223 (Table X). The lack of safer therapeutic alternatives is also a key consideration. A strong 1224 asso ciation between vancomycin DRESS and HLA -A*32:01 has been described ( Table X).120 1225 DRESS usually has a latency period of 2 -6 weeks allowing a window to order testing pre - 1226 emptively following initiation of therapy. Since many patients who initiate long cour ses of 1227 vancomycin may be on multiple antibiotics at the time of DRESS development HLA -A*32:01 1228 may also be a helpful diagnostic marker. More extensive databases of HLA associations with 1229 immunologically mediated adverse drug reactions are updated on a regula r basis and available 1230 in online resources such as Allele Frequency Net Database 1231 (http://www.allelefrequencies.net/hla -adr/adr_query.asp) and Litt's 1232 Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium 1233 also ma intains and updates evidence -based gene -drug clinical practice guidance to help 1234 facilitate translation of laboratory tests into actionable prescribing decisions.157, 165 The 1235 implications for use of pharmacogenomic in allergy and immunology pract ice 1236 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 50 relative to the FDA label has also recently been reviewed.166 Although HLA Class I single available, 1238 pharmacogenomic testing should not be part of routine diagnostic eval uation for patients with 1239 delayed HSRs. 1240 Summary of Pharmacogenomics 1241 Current actionable genes relevant to drug hypersensitivity include HLA -B*57:01 which is 1242 part of guideline -based routine HIV practice in the developed world. The accessibility of other 1243 genetic markers and their use in clinical practice has been more variable but have included HLA - 1244 B*15:02 pre -prescription screening for carbamazepine in Southeast Asia. The association 1245 between specific genetic markers and an immunologically mediated adverse dr ug reaction 1246 marks an advancement in the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of disease and serves 1247 as a valuable clue to pursue basic mechanistic studies. This area is expected to rapidly change 1248 over time as more routine single HLA markers and other gen otyping strategies become 1249 available that associate with clinical evidence for use in allergy diagnosis and screening. 1250 1251 Antibiotic Allergy Updates 1252 Beta -Lactams 1253 Penicillin 1254 1255 Burden of a Penicillin Allergy Label 1256 Consensus Based Statement 4: We recommend that a proactive effort should be made to 1257 delabel patients with reported penicillin allergy, if appropriate. 1258 Strength of Recommendation: Strong 1259 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 51 Certainty of Evidence: Moderate 1260 Approximately 10% of patients report a history of reacting to a penicillin class antibiotic. 1261 When evaluated for penicillin allergy, 90% or more of these individuals tolerate penicillins and 1262 therefore are labeled allergic unnecessarily .167, 168 Potential explanations for this discrepancy 1263 include waning of penicillin -specific IgE, the fact that some cutaneous reactions were the result 1264 of the underlying infection or an interaction between the infectious agent and the antibiotic, 1265 and mislabeling predictable non-immunologic symptoms as allergic. 1266 The penicillin allergy misla bel is not benign. Patients with a history of penicillin allergy 1267 are more likely to be treated with less effective, more toxic, or more expensive antibiotics such 1268 as fluoroquinolones, vancomycin, later generation cephalosporins , and clindamycin.14, 15 This 1269 prescribing practice compromises optimal medical care and increases costs.16 In two large -scale 1270 case -control studies, patients with a history of penicillin allergy were more likely to develop 1271 vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, and had longer hospital days and higher medical costs, compared with non-allergic 1273 controls .17, 18 In two large retrospective analyses, patients with a history of penicillin allergy 1274 were more likely to develop a surgi cal site infection after operations because of suboptimal 1275 perioperative antibiotic choice.169, 170 Another case -control study found that patients labeled 1276 penicillin -allergic had a 14% increased risk of death over a mean follow up of 6 years.19 Studies 1277 have demonstrated removal of the penicillin allergy label, such as via negative penicillin skin 1278 testing and challenge, leads to improved antibiotic selection with decreased use of broad - 1279 spectrum antibiotics .171-175 Additionally, introduction of reaction histor y-based algorithms in 1280 inpatient settings (without penicillin skin testing) also improved antibiotic utilization .176, 177 1281 While there are no randomized interventional studies of the utility of a penicillin allergy 1282 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 52 evaluation, outpatient penicillin allergy t esting was found to significantly decrease healthcare 1283 utilization (fewer outpatient visit s, fewer emergency department visits , and fewer hospital 1284 days) compared with matched controls over the subsequent 4 -year period.178 Cost and 1285 simulation model -based economic studies support penicillin allergy assessment may be a cost- 1286 saving intervention.20, 21 Therefore, a proactive effort should be made to delabel penicillin 1287 allergy whenever possible , and strong efforts should be made to educate patients and clinicia ns 1288 about the benefits of delab eling. Given the many benefits of removing the penicillin allergy 1289 label , evaluations are ideally performed electively, when patients are well and not in immediate 1290 need of antibiotic treatment. However, specific patients may be nefit from rapid and acute 1291 assessments, such as patients prior to surgery, transplant or chemotherapy, those on 2nd-line, 1292 less preferred antibiotics, or pregnant women prior to delivery.179-181 When appropriate, 1293 delabeling of penicillin allergy is endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and 1294 allergy/immunology and infectious disease societies.182-184 1295 Delabeling Patients with Histories Inconsistent with Allergy 1296 Consensus Based Statement 5: We recommend against any testing in patients with a history 1297 inconsistent with penicillin allergy (such as headache , family history of penicillin allergy , or 1298 diarrhea ), but a 1 -step amoxicillin challenge may be offered to patients who are anxious or 1299 request additional reassurance to accept the removal of a penicilli n allergy label . 1300 Strength of Recommendation: Strong Certainty of Evidence: Low 1302 The immunochemistry of penicillins has been well characterized, starting in the 1960s.1 1303 Penicillin skin testing detects the presence or absence of penicillin -specific IgE ant ibodies, and it 1304 is not useful or indicated for clearly non -IgE-mediated reactions. Also, skin testing is not 1305 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 53 indicated for non -allergic adverse reactions. Therefore, in patients with reaction histories 1306 inconsistent with allergy (such as headache , isolated gastrointestinal symptoms, or family 1307 history of penicillin allergy ), testing is not required. However, in patients who are reluctant to 1308 accept the removal of a penicillin allergy after appropriate counseling, amoxicillin challenge 1309 using a single treatment dose is sufficient to rule out an allergy , and these patients do not 1310 require penicillin skin testing. 1311 1312 Consensus Based Statement 6: We suggest penicillin skin testing for patients with a history of 1313 anaphylaxis or a recent reaction suspected to be IgE-mediated. 1314 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1315 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1316 Penicillin Skin Testing 1317 Penicillin skin testing is a more reliable method for evaluating IgE -mediated penicillin 1318 allergy compared with in vitro tests (radioallergosorbent test or enzyme -linked 1319 immunoassay).185 A systematic review and meta -analysis found that skin testing had a 1320 sensitivity of 30.7%, specificity of 96.8%, and area under the summary receiver -operating 1321 characteristic curve of 0.686, whereas serum specific IgE had a se nsitivity of 19.3%, specificity 1322 of 97.4%, and area under the summary receiver -operating characteristic curve of 0.420.185 1323 However, there are few prospective data comparing skin testing and serum -specific IgE with 1324 oral challenge. 1325 Penicillin skin testing s hould only be performed by personnel trained and skilled in the 1326 application and interpretation of this type of skin testing, with preparedness to treat very rare 1327 anaphylaxis. Appropriate positive (histamine) and negative (e.g., saline) controls should be 1328 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 54 placed, and they should test positive and negative, respectively, in order for the results to be 1329 valid.186 First, full -strength reagents are applied by the prick/puncture technique, and if these 1330 results are negative, intradermal testing should be performed. Antibiotic intradermal skin 1331 testing is most reproducible when fluid is drawn up by first filling the syringe with a larger 1332 volume (0.05 -0.07 mL) and expelling the excess fluid and air bubbles to obtain 0.02 mL, then 1333 injecting to produce a baseline 3 -5 mm bleb.8 There is no uniform agreement on what 1334 constitutes a positive skin test response, and the workgroup recognizes that different criteria 1335 has been used by various researchers over the years.167, 168, 187 -189 While there is no perfect set 1336 of criteria, th e workgroup recommends that a positive test be defined by the size of the wheal, 1337 which should be 3 mm or greater than that of the negative control for either prick/puncture or 1338 intradermal tests and be accompanied by a 5 mm or greater flare. A recent study consisting of 1339 more than 30,000 patients with a history of penicillin allergy reported the penicillin skin test - 1340 positive rate to be 1.0% when a positive test criterion 3mm compared to negative control was 1341 used and 0.5% when 5mm compared to negative cont rol was used.189 These data clearly 1342 indicate that either criterion results in the vast majority of patients being de -labeled of 1343 penicillin allergy. Penicillin skin testing, using the reagents described below and proper 1344 technique, is safe; fewer than 2% of skin test -positive patients experience systemic reactions 1345 and very few of these are anaphylactic in nature.167, 188, 190 -192 1346 The major determinant is commercially available as PPL (Pre -Pen\u00ae) in a premixed 6 x 10-1347 5M solution (Supplemental Table EII ). Of the minor determinants, penicillin G is commercially 1348 available in intravenous solution and should be used for skin testing off -label at a concentration 1349 of 10,000 units/mL. The other minor determinants (penicilloate and penilloate) are used for 1350 skin te sting at 0.01M; they have never been commercially available in the U.S., but a penicillin 1351 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 55 skin testing kit containing these minor determinants is under FDA review. Penicillin G left in 1352 solution (\"aged penicillin\") does not spontaneously degrade to form oth er minor determinants 1353 and should not be used as a substitute. In addition to the previously mentioned penicillin major 1354 and minor allergenic determinants, skin testing with a non -irritating concentration of the culprit 1355 penicillin should be considered (if it is available in intravenous form). For example, this would 1356 be piperacillin -tazobactam in those who reacted to piperacillin -tazobactam. The ideal skin 1357 testing concentration for these extended spectrum penicillins has not been firmly 1358 established.25, 26, 193 -195 1359 When multiple penicillin skin test reagents are used ( e.g., PPL, penicillin G, penicilloate, 1360 penilloate and , in some cases amoxicillin or ampicillin), 10% or more of skin test -positive 1361 patients are positive to only penicilloate or penilloate .167, 168 , 196 -198 The clinical significance of 1362 these findings is somewhat uncertain, since very few patients who are selectively positive to 1363 penicilloate or penilloate have been challenged with penicillin. Of those who have been 1364 challenged, some have experienced a naphyla xis.199, 200 Additionally, skin test -associated 1365 anaphylaxis has been described in patients positive only to minor determinants.167 1366 The NPV of penicillin skin testing is greater than 95%.167, 168, 171, 187, 198, 201, 202 This is true if 1367 the multiple penicillin skin test reagents are used, or if only PPL and penicillin G are used. 1368 However, it is not possible to directly compare the NPV obtained when all 3 minor 1369 determinants (penicillin G, penicilloate, penilloate) are used v ersu s when penicillin G wa s the 1370 only minor determinant used. In the retrospective \"real life\" observational reports , formal 1371 inclusion and exclusion criteria were not used and heterogenous patient populations were 1372 evaluated . Additionally, in most studies, not all skin test -negative patients underwent penicillin 1373 challenges. Given these limitations, it is not possible to give firm guidance regarding when to 1374 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 56 include penicilloate/penilloate in skin testing (versus only using PPL and penicillin G). Clearly, 1375 there are rare severely penici llin-allergic patients whose skin testing is solely positive to these 1376 minor determinants. However, the frequency at which this occurs and when skin testing 1377 without all the minor determinants may fail to detect these individuals is unknown. 1378 Selective All ergy to Specific Penicillins 1379 Some individuals demonstrate selective allergy to specific penicillins and tolerate others. 1380 This is most commonly described in patients who clinically react to ampicillin and /or 1381 amoxicillin, yet tolerate other penicillins such as penicillin VK and /or penicillin G.203-205 These 1382 individuals have positive skin test results to amoxicillin or ampicillin, but test negative to 1383 penicillin major and minor determinants, meaning their IgE -mediated reactions are assumed to 1384 be directed at the R -group side chains of aminopenicillins. In the U.S., patients with selective 1385 IgE-mediated allergy to amoxicillin or ampicillin are very rare, 187, 198, 206 -208 whereas in European 1386 studies, 25 -50% of pat ients have positive skin test results only to amoxicillin but not PPL, 1387 penicillin G, penicilloate , or .209-212 allergic to 1388 piperacillin -tazobactam and flucloxacillin (not available in the U .S.) are increasingly bei ng 1389 described .25, 26 Typically, these individuals have positive skin testing to piperacillin -tazobactam, 1390 but are negative to all other penicillin skin test reagents (and tolerate other penicillins). 1391 However, piperacillin -tazobactam skin test -negative been described to react on 1392 re-challenge.195 Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity of skin testing with a non -irritating 1393 concentration of piperacillin -tazobactam is unknown. 26, 213 1394 Penicillin Challenges 1395 Consensus Based Statement 7: We recommen d against the routine use of multiple day 1396 challenges in the evaluation of penicillin allergy. 1397 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 57 Strength of Recommendation: Strong 1398 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1399 Following negative penicillin skin test results, an elective challenge with the offending 1400 penicillin that caused the historical reaction is recommended . The purpose of such a challenge 1401 is to reassure the patient, patient's parents, referring physicians , and future prescribing 1402 clinicians of the safety of using penicillins and other beta -lactam antibiotics. Surveys of patients 1403 with negative penicillin skin test results (without subsequently being challenged with penicillin) 1404 found that a large proportion were not treated with beta -lactams because of fear on either the 1405 part of the patient or the treating physician .214 The challenge is typically completed in 1-step , 1406 but a 2 -step challenge may be considered if the reaction history is severe and/or recent . 1407 In re cent years, several European studies have suggested that a single therapeutic dose 1408 of an antibiotic may not be sufficient to exclude delayed reactions. These studies used 1409 extended challenges ranging from 3 -10 days with delayed reactions occurring in 5 -12% of 1410 subjects.74, 215 -220 In most studies, the reactions were self -reported but a few required photo 1411 documentation of the rash. Most reactions were mild and easily treated. A single study of 22 1412 patients with a self -reported history of delayed reactions to pe nicillins despite negative testing, 1413 found 50% had delayed reactions (mainly urticaria) at a mean of 6 days into a 10 day course of 1414 a penicillin.221 In contrast to these studies, reports from the U.S. have shown very low rates of 1415 delayed reactions (0 -1.8%) after negative penicillin skin tests and prolonged or repeated 1416 therapeutic exposures to penicillins.202, 222 -224 1417 Two recent studies have suggested that single day challenges can detect the majority of 1418 delayed reactions. A study in children with delayed rea ctions to beta -lactams suggested that 1419 delayed reactions may occur up to 7 days following a single challenge.23 Another study utilized 1420 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 58 a day challenge of amoxicillin amoxicillin clavulanate (n=104), followed by a 1421 \"washout\" period of 7 days prior to a one week therapeutic course at home.24 Two patients 1422 developed exanthems during the 7 -day \"washout\" period and one was lost to follow -up. Of the 1423 116 patients who received the at -home therapeutic dose (with no reaction during the washout 1424 period), only 1 had a mild exanthem after 7 days. The number needed to challenge using this 1425 protocol was 116 to identify one patient reacting to a therapeutic course. These data suggest 1426 that single day challenges are sufficient to detect delayed reactions and that using multiple day 1427 challenges is unnecessary. Given that the majority of these delayed reactions are quite mild and 1428 that a multiple day challenge will unnecessarily expose a patient to additional antibiotics when 1429 not needed, multiple day challenges are not recommended after negative single day challenges. 1430 Rates of Resensitization 1431 Resensitization after oral treatment with penicillins is rare in both pediatric and adult 1432 patients, including after repeated courses, and comparable with the rate of sensitization .201, 202, 1433 223, 225 Hence, routine repeat penicillin skin testing is not indicated in patients with a history of 1434 penicillin allergy who have tolerated one or more courses of oral penicillin. Resensitization after 1435 high -dose parenteral treatment with penicill in was thought more likely ,226, 227 however , recent 1436 research has contradicted previous findings.224 Still, drug allergy is more frequent in patients 1437 with repeated and parenteral exposures. R epeat penicillin skin testing is not necessary in 1438 patients who hav e been delabeled for penicillin allergy, whether or not future penicillin is given 1439 orally or intravenously for initial or repeated (parenteral or oral) courses, unless subsequent 1440 reaction occurs. Consideration may be given to retesting individuals before r epeated parenteral 1441 administration who prior penicillin 1443 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 59 Direct Penicillin Challenge (Without Preceding Skin Tests) 1444 Consensus Based Statement 8: We recommend against penicillin skin testing prior to direct 1445 amoxicillin challenge in ped iatric patients with a history of benign cutaneous reaction (such 1446 as MDE and urticaria). 1447 Certainty of Evidence: Moderate 1449 Aminopenicillins are associated with development of delayed -onset MDE in up to 7% of 1450 patients, compared with about 2% for penicillin VK .228, 229 These reactions are not related to 1451 specific IgE antibodies, and they are postulated in many cases to require the presence of a 1452 concurrent viral infection or another underlying illne ss.230 One example of this phenomenon is 1453 treatment of patient s with Epstein -Barr infect ion with amoxicillin or ampicillin, where 1454 approximately 30 -100% of patients develop a non -pruritic morbilliform rash .231-234 1455 Since infections are prominent deve lopment of benign cutaneous eruptions in 1456 children treated with amoxicillin,230 resulting in low rates of confirmed allergy, some studies 1457 have investigated re -challenging with amoxicillin without preceding penicillin skin testing .76, 217, 1458 230, 235 -237 The r ate of reactions observed ranged from about 5% to 10% and were generally no 1459 more severe than the historical reactions. None of the studies included patients reporting 1460 respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular symptoms, anaphylaxis, and vesicular or exfoliative 1461 eruptions. Some , but not all , studies excluded patients with angioedema. Most studies were 1462 carried out in specialty allergy centers and many of the subjects reported reactions with a first - 1463 time amoxicillin course (which makes IgE -mediated reactions highly unlikely). If a pediatric 1464 patient's past reaction consisted of a maculopapular exanthem or urticarial eruption, not 1465 accompanied by any systemic symptoms, and did not involve blistering or exfoliation of the skin 1466 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 60 or mucous membranes, then single dose amoxic illin challenge without prior allergy testing is 1467 recommended. However, the safety of this approach has not been thoroughly examined in 1468 primary care settings. Additionally, while not required, penicillin skin testing may be performed 1469 at the discretion of th e clinician, such as in patients who are concerned or anxious about direct 1470 challenge. Admittedly, skin testing may \"overdiagnose\" penicillin allergy in a very small minority 1471 of subjects by virtue of the PPV being less than 100%. However, the benefit of pro ceeding with 1472 testing in such individuals far outweighs not testing and hence not challenging, given that in 1473 that case, 90% or more of the patients will continue to be falsely labeled as penicillin -allergic. 1474 Consensus Based Statement 9: We suggest that dir ect amoxicillin challenge be considered in 1475 adults with a history of distant (i.e., > 5 years ago) and benign cutaneous reactions (such as 1476 MDE and urticaria). 1477 Recommendation: Conditional 1478 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1479 Adults are less likely than ch ildren to have viral eruptions masquerading as drug allergy, 1480 and they are more likely to experience severe or fatal penicillin -induced anaphylaxis. Analysis of 1481 drug -related anaphylaxis deaths in the U .S. (with penicillins being the most common identified 1482 culprit) showed higher rates with increasing age at 0.05 per million (age < 20 years), 0.18 (20 -39 1483 years), 0.51 (40 -59 years), 1.23 (60 -79 years), and 1.28 (80 years and older).238, 239 There is less 1484 evidence for bypassing penicillin skin testing in adults, with reported reactions rates of 1485 approximately 1 -6%.240-245 Similar to the pediatric studies, only patients fulfilling low -risk 1486 criteria were eligible for direct amoxicillin challenge. These included reactions occurring more 1487 than 1 -10 years ago, limited t o the skin (but not angioedema, blistering or exfoliative features) , 1488 and without other systemic symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis. Also, adults with distant 1489 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 61 childhood reactions where features of the reaction were unknown were eligible for direct 1490 amoxicill in challenge. In the only study to use a prospective, randomized , controlled trial 1491 approach, penicillin skin testing (followed by challenge if negative) was compared with direct 1492 amoxicillin challenge in patients fulfilling low -risk reaction history criteri a.243 Among those 1493 patients who underwent skin testing, 70/80 (87.5%) were negative and all tolerated amoxicillin 1494 challenge. Direct amoxicillin challenge was negative in 76/79 (96.2%) patients and in those 1495 patients with positive challenges, reactions were m ild. 1496 In 4 large studies of penicillin skin testing, statistical modeling was retrospectively 1497 applied to the clinical history, to define low -risk criteria that could guide direct amoxicillin 1498 challenge.244, 246 -248 Two studies reported similar criteria: 1) reaction occurring more than 1 year 1499 ago, absence of anaphylaxis, unknown name of index drug247 and 2) benign rash (no 1500 angioedema) occurring more than 1 year ago.248 Another study assigned values to criteria (5 1501 years or less since reaction - 2 points, anaphylaxis/angioedema or severe cutaneous reaction - 1502 2 points, treatment required for reaction - 1 point) and a score of less than 3 was classified as 1503 low-risk.244 The 4th study was unable to accurately predict penicillin allergy based on clinical 1504 history, without skin testing.246 Table XI summ arizes the findings in these studies.244, 246 -248 Most 1505 adult studies, like the pediatric ones, were all carried out in outpatien t ambulatory settings. If 1506 an adult's past reaction consisted of a distant maculopapular exanthem or urticarial eruption, 1507 not accompanied by any systemic symptoms, and did not involve blistering or exfoliation of the 1508 skin or mucous membranes, then single do se amoxicillin challenge without prior allergy testing 1509 may be considered. However, in patients who are uncomfortable or anxious about direct oral 1510 challenge, negative skin testing may be useful to alleviate those fears. 1511 Preventing Reaquisition of a Penicill in Allergy Label 1512 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 62 Once a patient is delabeled, it is important to make every effort to effectively 1513 communicate the updated penicillin allergy status across all medical record platforms and 1514 clinical encounters. Therefore, instructions to remove the penicilli n allergy label should be 1515 relayed to hospital systems, outpatient clinics, private physician and dental offices, and 1516 pharmacies. The patient and relevant family members should be given written documentation 1517 (such as a wallet card) indicating that they are no longer penicillin allergic and at no higher risk 1518 to develop allergic reactions to penicillins compared with the general population. If patients 1519 wore medical alert bracelets, these should be modified as well. Another potential strategy is an 1520 alert in the EMR alerting clinicians of the lack of penicillin allergy. While this process may seem 1521 straightforward, not infrequently the label is not universally removed, or sometimes re -appears 1522 after being removed.249, 250 1523 Cephalosporins 1524 Cephalosporins are documented as an \"allergy\" (includes adverse drug reactions) in 0.5 - 1525 2.0% of U .S. patients .27, 251, 252 New cephalosporin adverse reactions occur in about 0.5% of 1526 exposures .252 Large database analyses demonstrate that cephalosporins are documented as 1527 one of the most common drug culprits causing a variety of immediate and non -immediate 1528 HSRs .253 254 -256 1531 Considering cephalosporin immediate hypersensitivity, evidence suggests that allergic 1532 reactions to cephalosporins are more commonly directed at the R -group/side chains rather 1533 than the core beta -lactam portion of the molecule ( Figure 2).257-261 The strongest evidence of 1534 side chain cross reactivity is for identical side chains sharing an R1 group ( Table XII, 1535 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September , 2022 63 Supplemental Figure E2), although cross reactivity is plausible and has been observed for 1536 similar side chains and R2 groups ( Table XII, Supplemental Figure E2).262, 263 Cephalosporin 1537 sensitization may wane over time similarly to penicillin sensitization , with a loss of skin test 1538 reactivity observed in more than half of patients after 5 years .264 In this parameter, the term 1539 \"structurally dissimilar\" refers to cephalosporins that have disparate from other 1540 cephalosporins or aminopenicillins. 1541 An algorithm for cephalosporin administration a patient with a history of cephalosporin 1542 hypersensitivity is shown in Figure 3A . 1543 1544 Consensus Based Statement 10: We suggest that for patients with a history of non- 1545 anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, direct challenges (without prior skin test) to 1546 cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains be performed to determine tolerance. 1547 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1548 Certainty of Evidence: Moderate 1549 Patients with a history of allergy to one cephalosporin who require treatment with 1550 another cephalos porin can receive the indicated cephalosporin by a direct drug challenge if the 1551 R1 side chains are dissimilar and the reaction was non -anaphylactic .263 Limited clinical 1552 challenge studies have demonstrated that patients allergic to one cephalosporin are able to 1553 tolerate other cephalosporins with dissimilar R1 side chains .263 1554 Consensus Based Statement 11: We suggest that for patients with a history of anaphyla xis to 1555 a cephalosporin, a negative cephalosporin skin test should be confirmed prior to 1556 administration of a parenteral cephalosporin with a non -identical R1 side chain. 1557 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1558 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 64 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1559 For patient s with anaphylactic histories, it is recommended that parenteral 1560 cephalosporin treatment be guided by cephalosporin skin testing with non -irritating 1561 concentrations of the agent(s) desired for therapeutic use and ideally the cephalosporin(s) 1562 implicated in a naphylaxis . Non -irritating concentrations of commonly used cephalosporins 1563 have been described ; 2 mg/mL is often used but there is a range from 10 -33 mg/mL (Table 1564 XIII).27, 119, 265 -268 cephalosporin skin test suggests drug -specific IgE antibodies , and the patient 1567 should receive a skin test negative alternative cephalosporin, alternate antibiotic or undergo 1568 desensitization . A negative cephalosporin skin test should be followed by a drug challenge to 1569 confirm tolerance. Although cephalospor in skin testing has unknown validity to date , and its 1570 sensitivity is reliant on testing soon after the reaction ,268-272 testing may be useful for patients 1571 with anaphylactic or convincing histories of IgE -mediated reactions, patients with multiple 1572 reported drug allergies, or those with multiple reactions to beta -lactams. Skin testing may also 1573 be useful for patients who are uncomfortable, concerned, or anxious about direct challenge. 1574 Alternative options include cephalosporin induction of drug tolerance procedure performed 1575 empirically, which may be considered for patients with a severe reaction history or if the 1576 patient is acutely ill or pregnant. Administration of a structurally similar cephalosporin may be 1577 optimally accomplished using cephalosporin skin testing results to guide administration. 1578 Cephalosporin skin testing to guide cephalosporin administration may also be advisable for 1579 recent reactions or when the patient in question is chronically ill or pregnant. If administering 1580 an oral cephalosporin or skin testing is not possible, then higher risk drug challenges or empiric 1581 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 65 induction of tolerance procedures can be performed. Oral cephalosporins are not sterile , and 1582 therefore cannot be used for intradermal skin testing , and skin testing with cephalexin, the 1583 most common oral cephalosporin used in the U .S., has no clear utility.273 Non -beta -lactam 1584 antibiotics may also be considered, but may result in added patient morbidity, mortality, and 1585 cost of care .16-18, 169, 274, 275 1586 Consensus Based Statement 12: We suggest that for patients with a history of anaphyla xis to 1587 a penicillin, a structurally dissimilar R1 side chain cephalosporin can be administered without 1588 testing or additional precautions . 1589 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1590 Certainty of Evidence: Moderate 1591 An algorithm for c ephalosporin administration to patients with a history of penicillin 1592 hypersensitivity is shown in Figure 3B . Early penicillin/cephalosporin cross -reactivity estimates 1593 were 8%, which was rounded to 10% on the cephalosporin package insert label from the FDA. 1594 This cross -reactivity estimate was falsely high, however, because of the specific cephalosporins 1595 considered and contamination of cephalosporins with penicillins before 1980 .276 Considering 1596 417 patients across 12 clinical studies conducted after 1980, 8 (2%) had reactions to 1597 cephalosporins ,222, 277 -287 representing cross -reactivity range from between 2.0 -4.8%, rates 1598 similar to the incident rate of new drug allergies or reactions to a structurally dissimilar 1599 medications in patients with prior drug allergies .288 There is a large body of evidence that cross - 1600 reactivity is negligible even in patients with confirmed penicillin allergies .289, 290 Although cross - 1601 reactivity to the beta -lactam nucleus between penicillins and cephalosporins i s very low, cross - 1602 reactivity may be higher among drugs that share the R1 side -chain. A recent meta -analysis that 1603 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 66 considered 19 prospective and 2 retrospective studies found that the risk of cross -reactivity 1604 (based on skin testing) to cephalosporins in pati ents with proven penicillin (predominantly 1605 aminopenicillin) ceftazidime, has a unique side 1609 chain and appears to have very low cross -reactivity with penicillins despite being a first 1610 generation ceph alosporin .28, 255, 291 -293 The reaction rate (when evaluated by skin testing) to 1611 cefazolin among patients with an unverified penicillin allergy is 0. 7% (95% CrI, 0.1%-1.7%).293 1612 The reaction rate among patients with a confirmed penicillin allergy was recent ly determined to 1613 be just 0.8% (95% CI 0.13% -4.1%) among penicillin -allergic patients.294 In a 1614 meta -analysis of 77 studies, the cefazolin allergy was identified in 3.0 % of patients with 1615 confirmed penicillin allergy (95% C rI, 0.01% -17.0%).293 Ceftibuten, a 3rd generation oral 1616 cephalosporin, also has unique side chains from any penicillin and all currently available 1617 cephalosporins that may also make cross -reaction rates exceedingly rare.294 This consensus 1618 based statement may require an allergy a lert override in electronic health records in patients 1619 with a history of penicillin allergy who are prescribed cephalosporins although some US health 1620 systems have been able to inactivate such alerts .295, 296 While skin testing is not recommended, 1621 it may be advisable for specific patients with multiple drug allergies because of the possibility of 1622 coexisting sensitivities.294 For example, in one study that demonstrated lack of allergy to 1623 cefazolin and ceftibuten in 131 penicillin -allergic patients, one ipant was skin -test cefazolin, ceftibuten, carbapenems, and which 1625 indicates a sensitivity to an antigenic determinant of the beta -lactam ring. This single outlier 1626 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 67 patient was not challenged to determine if these skin test findings reflect clinical cross - 1627 reactivity. Finally, it is important to note that while meta -analytic data are available , the 1628 underlying studies were observational studies that suffer from biases s uch as a selection bias 1629 and lack of blinding.28, 293 1630 Consensus Based Statement 13: We suggest that for patients with a history of an unverified 1631 (not confirmed) non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy, a cephalosporin can be administered 1632 without testing or add itional precautions . 1633 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1634 Certainty of Evidence: Moderate 1635 Given that less than 5% of patients with an unverified penicillin allergy are truly 1636 allergic ,297 and approximately 2% of those who are truly allergic will experience a reaction to a 1637 cephalosporin,201, 222, 278, 284 when they are given cephalosporins directly the chance of a 1638 reaction is very low with a linked probability of approximately 0.1% (i.e. 0.05x0.02=0.001 ). 1639 Retrospective studies of parenteral cephalo sporin administration to patients with a history of 1640 penicillin allergy, without prior penicillin skin testing, have shown rare cephalosporin allergic 1641 reactions .298, 299 However, these studies suffer from selection bias as the lower risk patients 1642 were likel y those who were treated with cephalosporins instead of non -beta -lactam antibiotics. 1643 For patients with any immediate penicillin allergy history, a non -cross -reactive 1644 cephalosporin can be administered by full dose or drug challenge (Figure 3B). Performing 1645 penicillin allergy evaluation greatly simplifies all future beta -lactam administration 1646 recommendations for any patients with a penicillin allergy history and has the benefit of 1647 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 68 potentially delabeling the patients' penicillin allergy. If penici llin testing is negative, the patient 1648 can receive any cephalosporin without special precaution . 1649 If the test is positive, there may be an increased risk of reaction with a cross -reactive 1650 cephalosporin. Challenges to cephalosporins in patients with negative penicillin skin tests in this 1651 scenario are typically well tolerated (Figure 3B). An induction of tolerance procedure is also an 1652 option, particularly for patients with a severe reaction history, or for patients that are acutely ill 1653 or pregnant. Non -beta -lactam antibiotics may also be considered but may result in added 1654 patient morbidity, mortality, and cost of care .16-18, 169, 274, 275 1655 From 12 -38% of patients with penicillin allergy in Europe are proven to be selectively 1656 allergic to aminopenicillins (i.e., able to tolerate penicillin but not amoxicillin/ampicillin) .300, 301 1657 The prevalence of aminopenicillin allergy in the U .S. appears to be rare.189, 191 Proven 1658 aminopenicillin -allergic patients should generally avoid cephalosporins with identical R 1-group 1659 side chains. In patients with unverified non -anaphylactic aminopenicillin allergy, if an 1660 aminocephalosporin is recommended, a drug challenge could be performed. 1661 Consensus Based Statement 14: We suggest that in patients with a history of an unverified 1662 non-anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a penicillin can be administered without testing or 1663 additional precautions. 1664 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1665 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1666 1667 Consensus B ased Statement 15: We suggest that in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to 1668 cephalosporins, penicillin skin testing and drug challenge should be performed prior to 1669 administration of a penicillin therapy. 1670 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 69 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1671 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1672 Consensus Based Statement 16: We suggest against penicillin skin testing in patients with a 1673 history of non-anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy prior to administration of a penicillin 1674 therapy. 1675 Strength of Recommendation: Conditiona l 1676 Evidence: Low 1677 An algorithm for p enicillin administration to patients with a history of cephalosporin 1678 hypersensitivity is shown in Figure 3C . Patients with a history of an immediate -type or delayed - 1679 type (other than serious reactions such as SJS) allergic reaction to a cephalosporin who require 1680 penicillin can receive the indicated penicillin by direct challenge in most cases. In patients with 1681 an unverified non -anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a penicillin can be administered without 1682 any spe cial precautions. For example, patients with a history of urticaria to a cephalexin can 1683 receive amoxicillin without prior testing. Penicillin skin testing guided treatment is not 1684 recommended unless the cephalosporin allergy history was anaphylaxis, angioed ema, 1685 hypotension, or other severe IgE -mediated reactions. If penicillin skin testing is performed and 1686 negative, a drug challenge to the penicillin is still advised (Figure 3C). The role for direct 1687 challenge to penicillin in patients with a history of anaph ylaxis to cephalosporins with dissimilar 1688 1689 Carbapenems 1690 1691 Consensus Based Statement 17: We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or 1692 cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be administered without testing or additional 1693 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 70 precautions 1694 of Recommendation: Conditional 1695 Certainty of Evidence: Moderate 1696 The overall reported incidence of carbapenem allergy is 0.3 -3.7% .302 Clinical cross -reactivity 1697 between carbapenems and other beta -lactams is also low .303-308 A systematic review covering 1698 10 studies and 12 case reports included 838 patients with proven, suspected, or possible IgE 1699 mediated penicillin allergy, and carbapenem reactions occurred in 4.3% (95% CI , 3.1% to 1700 5.9% ).309 Of the subset with positive skin tests to penicillin (n=295), only 1 (0.3% [95% CI , 0.06% 1701 to 1.9%] ) had a reaction with symptoms consistent with a potentially IgE mediated mechanism. 1702 Of the patients with possible cephalosporin reaction (n=12), 3 (25%) reacted to the carbapen em 1703 with only 1 reaction potentially IgE -mediated .309 Another systematic review and meta -analysis 1704 covering 11 observational studies including 1,127 patients demonstrated a risk of cross - 1705 reactivity to any carbapenem as 0.87% (95% CI, 0.32 -2.32) .28 A recent prospective study of 211 1706 patients with skin test confirmed penicillin allergy all tolerated carbapenems .310 Patients with 1707 penicillin or cephalosporin allergy histories, as long as it is not a severe delayed cutaneous or 1708 organ involved reaction, c an receive carbapenems without prior testing. In certain patients or 1709 situations, such as multiple drug allergy or significant patient anxiety , a graded drug challenge 1710 might be preferred. 1711 Monobactams (Aztreonam) 1712 1713 Consensus Based Statement 18: We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or 1714 cephalosporin allergy, aztreonam may be administered without prior testing unless there is a 1715 history of ceftazidime allergy. 1716 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 71 Strength Recommendation: Conditional 1717 Certainty of Evidence: Moderate 1718 Aztreonam is less immunogenic and rarely causes HSRs .311-313 There is no cross -reactivity for 1719 IgE or T cell mediated hypersensitivity between penicillin and aztreonam .314-320 Likewise, no 1720 cross -reactivity has been cephalosporins and aztreonam, except for 1721 ceftazidime ( due to share d R1 side chain of ceftazidime ).316, 321, 322 Penicillin and cephalosporin - 1722 allergic patients (reported or confirmed -allergic) may safely receive aztreonam without prior 1723 testing, with the exception of patients who are confirmed allergic to ceftazidime. Conversely, 1724 aztreonam -allergic patients may be treated with all beta -lactams, except for ceftazidime , which with aztreonam . 1726 Aztreonam has become a commonly used acute therapeutic drug f or patients with penicillin or 1727 cephalosporin allergy histories, but it does not have activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram 1728 positive bacteria, it is not as effective against gram negative bacteria as other beta -lactams 1729 (e.g., cefepime, piperacillin -tazobactam), has increasing rates of resistance, and it is costly. It is 1730 thus now a common target for antibiotic stewardship efforts, especially in patients with 1731 reported penicillin allergy .29, 323 -326 1732 Drug allergy history -based beta -lactam allergy pathways 1733 1734 Consensus Based Statement 19: We recommend that allergist -immunologist s collaborate 1735 with hospitals and healthcare systems to implement beta -lactam allergy pathways to 1736 improve antibiotic stewardship outcomes. 1737 of Strong 1738 Certainty of Moderate 1739 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 72 Complementary to the recommendations above, integrated beta -lactam pathways can 1740 be used for patients that acutely need a beta -lactam antibiotic in the hospital setting .327 Acute 1741 care beta -lactam allergy pathways are defined as coordinat ed programs that facilitate beta - 1742 lactam allergy assessments for emergency, hospitalized, and perioperative patients as part of 1743 antibiotic stewardship .327 Acute care beta -lactam allergy pathways have been implemented and 1744 studied; a recent nonsystematic review identified 36 articles describing acute care beta -lactam 1745 pathways.327 Of these articles, there were interventions based solely on the allergy history 1746 (n=8), those that used the allergy history with direct drug challenges (n=2), penicillin skin 1747 testing (n=15), or both (i.e., comprehensive beta -lactam allergy pathways that include all allergy 1748 procedures, n=11) .327 Comprehensive pathways have been developed and published.177, 328 -332 1749 Other effective strategies for inpatient adoption include electronic health record triage 1750 mechanisms for penicillin allergy skin testing and direct drug challenges .333-335 An important 1751 consideration to implementing a beta -lactam allergy pathway that is not delabeling focused, is 1752 that the patients may not have their beta -lactam allergy label effectively removed. Thus, 1753 subsequent outpatient allergy/immunology evaluation represents appropriate follow up care 1754 for these patients. 1755 1756 Sulfonamides 1757 Consensus Based Statement 20: We suggest th at for patients with a history of benign 1758 cutaneous reactions (e.g. MDE , urticaria) to sulfonamide antibiotics that occurred > 5 years 1759 ago, a 1 -step drug challenge with trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole be performed when there 1760 is a need to delabel a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy. 1761 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1762 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September , 2022 73 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1763 Sulfonamides are the 2nd most commonly reported allergy in the health record.251 Sulfonamide 1764 antimicrobials are structurally different than non -antimicrobial sulfonam ides due to the 1765 presence of an aromatic amine group at the N4 position ( Figure 4 ).336 Because of this, there is 1766 minimal concern for cross -reactivity between sulfonamide -non-antimicrobials in patients with 1767 histories of reactions to sulfonamide antibiotics, including the sulfone ( Table X capable of eliciting numerous phenotypes ranging 1769 from the most common MDE to urticaria to SCAR. Immediate skin tests have been utilized in 1770 patients with immediate reaction histories (e.g. urticaria or anaphylaxis), and limited data 1771 suggest that skin test reactivity may wane fairly rapidly within a year.339 In contrast, delayed 1772 skin testing (IDT and PT) has poor sensitivity for MDE and fixed drug eruption (FDE) .340, 341 1773 1774 Due to the limitations in skin testing, particularly in patients with histories of benign 1775 exanthems, induction of drug tolerance procedures have been utilized where there is a need for 1776 sulfonamide antibiotic therapy. More than 20 induction of drug to lerance or multi -step 1777 challenge procedures have been published, predominantly in patients with HIV in need of 1778 prophylaxis with trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole (TMP -SMX).336 These protocols have high 1779 rates of success and may range from 6 hours to 10 days; sam ple protocols are included in the 1780 prior drug allergy practice parameter from 2010.1 Whether these \"desensitization\" protocols 1781 truly induce drug tolerance has not been established. Three studies, all in HIV patients with 1782 non-anaphylactic histories, have com pared full -dose challenge of TMP -SMX with an induction 1783 of drug tolerance procedure.342-344 All 3 studies showed no difference in successfully reaching 1784 the full dose of TMP -SMX whether the dose was simply administered or given as a 1785 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 74 \"desensitization\". These data suggest that full dose challenge appears equally efficacious to 1786 achieving a therapeutic dose of TMP -SMX. A small study of 8 subjects with anaphylactic 1787 reactions to TMP -SMX, including 5 with hypotension, showed the efficacy of a rapid, 5 hour 1788 desensiti zation protocol.345 Induction of tolerance protocols should be relegated primarily to 1789 those with convincing histories of anaphylaxis. 1790 Less data are available on challenge or induction of tolerance procedures in patients 1791 without HIV.346-348 Multiple step ch allenge or \"desensitization\" protocols all had high success 1792 rates from 93 -98%. The largest study evaluated 195 patients (without HIV) who underwent a 1793 full-dose challenge (n=173) or a 2 -step challenge (n=22).349 The 1 -step full dose challenge group 1794 had a 95 % success rate compared with 86% success in the 2 -step group. Those stratified for 2 - 1795 step challenges had higher risk histories including more recent reactions or anaphylactic 1796 histories, likely accounting for the lower success rate of rechallenge ( Table XV). This study also 1797 showed a higher likelihood of passing the challenge with more remote histories and a vague 1798 \"sulfa\" allergy label. Importantly, all of these studies excluded patients with histories of SCAR. 1799 Based on these data, a 1 -step full -dose challeng e seems appropriate for the majority of patients 1800 with non -anaphylactic, benign cutaneous reactions that occurred > 5 years ago. Criteria for 1801 patients appropriate for a 1 -step or 2 -step challenge are shown in Table X V.349, 350 1802 Fluoroquinolones and Macrolide s 1803 Consensus Based Statement 21: We suggest using a 1 - or 2-step drug challenge without 1804 preceding skin testing to confirm tolerance in patients with a history of non -anaphylactic 1805 reactions to fluoroquinolones or macrolides. 1806 Strength of Conditional 1807 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1808 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission September 7 , 2022 75 1809 1810 Fluoroquinolones 1811 The most common type of allergic reaction to fluoroquinolones is a delayed onset 1812 maculopapular exanthem , which is generally benign and self -limited. These rashes occur in 2 - 1813 3% of treated patients, a lthough the rate varies among different agents and appears to be 1814 highest for gemifloxacin.351-353 Allergic cross -reactivity among fluoroquinolones for delayed 1815 cutaneous rashes appears to be low; only 10% of patients who developed uncomplicated MDE 1816 on gemif loxacin reacted to ciprofloxacin (which was given immediately after the gemifloxacin 1817 course).353 PT is not useful in evaluation of delayed maculopapular exanthems .354 When 1818 patients with history of fluoroquinolone -associated rashes undergo evaluation with r e- 1819 challenge with the culprit agent, there is a high chance of success, since only about 5% develop 1820 recurrence.354, 355 1821 Immediate -type reactions to fluoroquinolones have been increasingly described. There 1822 is evidence for both IgE -mediated and non -IgE-media ted mechanisms, since fluoroquinolones 1823 may cause non -specific mast cell degranulation via interaction with the surface receptor 1824 MRGPRX2. Unlike IgE -mediated reactions, non -IgE-mediated reactions may occur with first 1825 exposure since prior sensitization is un necessary. Otherwise, however, the clinical 1826 presentations of these 2 types of reactions are indistinguishable. The rate of fluoroquinolone - 1827 related anaphylaxis has been reported to be 1 -5 per 100,000 prescriptions and moxifloxacin is 1828 implicated most often;356, 357 this rate is comparable to cephalosporins but lower than 1829 penicillins.356 Analogous to other antibiotic allergies such as penicillins, IgE -mediated allergy to 1830 fluoroquinolones appears to wane and resolves in many (but not all) patients.358 Consequen tly, 1831 studies have shown that about 2/3 to 3/4 of patients with convincing histories of immediate - 1832 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 76 type reactions to fluoroquinolones tolerate the culprit antibiotic when re -challenged.354, 355, 359, 1833 360 The majority of immediate reactions to fluroquinolones are not IgE -mediated, but the extent 1834 of IgE -mediated allergic cross -reactivity among fluoroquinolones, based on limited number of 1835 case series, is approximately 50%.361-367 1836 The urgency of fluroquinolone delabeling may be lower than that for beta -lactam 1837 delabeling, and patient preference may play some role. Skin testing with fluoroquinolones is 1838 not validated or standardized. Non -irritating concentrations are difficult or impossible to 1839 determine due to the antibiotics' propensity to cause non -specific mast c ell degranulation.119, 1840 368 Likewise, there are no validated commercially available in vitro tests for IgE -mediated allergy 1841 to fluoroquinolones. Basophil activation testing has been described in the research setting.369, 1842 370 Milder reactions, such as MDE and urticaria, that occurred more than 5 years ago may be 1843 most amenable for a 1 - or 2-step graded challenge with the implicated fluoroquinolone. For 1844 more severe or recent reactions, single dose or 2 -step graded challenge with a different 1845 fluoroquinolone than the one implicated in the historical reaction (since they may not cross - 1846 react) may be considered. Patients who are proven allergic or likely allergic and require a 1847 fluoroquinolone, with no acceptable alternative treatments, may receive the culprit 1848 fluoroq uinolone via 1853 Allergic reactions due to than those to penicillins, 1854 cephalosporins, sulfonamide antibiotics , and fluoroquinolones. The most common macrolide - 1855 related allergic reactions are delayed cutaneous reactions, and they occur in about 1% of 1856 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 77 patients .373, 374 IgE-mediated reactions are uncommon, limited to case series, and anaphylactic 1857 reactions are extreme ly rare. When patients with convincing histories of allergic reactions 1858 undergo formal evaluation, only about 5% are confirmed to be allergic .32, 375 -378 Skin testing with 1859 macrolides is not validated or standardized since the allergenic determinants are unk nown. The 1860 utility of immediate -type skin testing using non -irritating concentrations of macrolides is 1861 uncertain. Some studies have found skin testing to be useful and predictive of reactions ,377 1862 whereas in other similarly designed studies, skin testing per formance compared with oral 1863 challenge was poor .32 Therefore, based on the low pre -test probability, very low rate of 1864 anaphylaxis, and disagreement on the u tility of skin testing, direct challenge appears to be the 1865 most appropriate diagnostic approach for p atients with a history of non-anaphylactic reaction s. 1866 There are no commercially available in vitro tests for IgE -mediated allergy to macrolides. 1867 Patients reporting purely benign cutaneous reactions (i.e., MDE or urticaria) to 1868 macrolides are candidates for 1- or 2-step drug challenge. Using this approach allows 95% of 1869 patients to safely reintroduce macrolides.32, 375 -378 In patients who fail challenge or in whom 1870 challenge is not pursued and who require a macrolide without acceptable alternative 1871 treatments, the antibiotic may be administered via induction of tolerance .379 The urgency of 1872 macrolide delabeling may be lower than that for beta -lactam delabeling , and patient 1873 preference may play some role . Given the rare nature of confirmed allergy to macrolides and 1874 lack of validated diagnostic testing, the extent of allergic cross -reactivity among macrolides is 1875 unknown. 1876 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause a spectrum of allergic reactions, including exacerbation of 1879 underlying respiratory disease, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, and rarely pneumonitis and 1880 meningitis.33, 34 There are four primary categories of NSAID reactions that can be diagnosed via 1881 history, presence of comorbid diseases and drug challenges. These reactions are outlined in 1882 Table XVI and A history of nasal polyposis with 1884 subsequent acute onset respiratory sym ptoms after NSAID exposure suggests a diagnosis of 1885 AERD. Similarly, patients with a diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria who experience a 1886 worsening of urticaria or angioedema with NSAID exposure should be diagnosed with NSAID - 1887 exacerbated cutaneous di sease. These two phenotypes occur upon COX -1 inhibition and are 1888 not IgE -mediated or drug specific. N SAID -induced urticaria and single NSAID -induced reactions 1889 are discriminated based on cross reactivity patterns and reaction type. Specific NSAID reactions 1890 are thought to be drug specific reactions and are not cross -reactive with other structurally 1891 unrelated NSAIDS. Both IgE -mediated reactions causing anaphylaxis and T -cell mediated 1892 reactions resulting in various cutaneous manifestations are examples of specif ic NSAID 1893 reactions. The phenotype of NSAID induced urticaria and angioedema that cross reacts with any 1894 other COX -1 inhibitors seems specifically to cause cutaneous symptoms with anaphylaxis being 1895 extremely unlikely .380-382 1896 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 79 Consensus Based Statement 22: We suggest a selective COX -2 inhibitor may be used as an 1897 alternative analgesic in patients with any NSAID hypersensitivity phenotype when an NSAID 1898 is needed. 1899 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1900 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1901 1902 Aspirin -Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD) 1903 AERD is a clinical entity characterized by aspirin - and NSAID -induced respiratory 1904 reactions in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma. The nomenclature ascribed to this 1905 type of reaction has included terms such as aspirin sensitivity , aspirin intolerance , aspirin 1906 idiosyncrasy (N -ERD) aspirin triad and Widal or Samter's triad .383 Although N -ERD is commonly used, 1908 this acronym may have a negative co nnotation, thus AERD is still preferred in the U.S. 1909 AERD is unique and does not fit precisely into the usual categories of adverse drug 1910 reactions. AERD onset is often reported following an upper respiratory infection, with onset of 1911 perennial rhinitis follo wed by the development of sinonasal polyposis, and progression to 1912 asthma.384 Rhinitis is often by chronic sinusitis, anosmia, and nasal polyposis. The 1913 literature on the chronology of the development of these components is mixed. Asthma and 1914 hype rsensitivity to NSAIDs usually develop several years after the onset of rhinitis.384 Upper and 1915 lower respiratory tract symptoms are frequently sudden and often severe after administration 1916 of aspirin or any NSAID that inhibits the COX -1 enzyme. 1917 Despite avoidance of aspirin and cross -reacting drugs, these patients typically 1918 experience refractory rhinosinusitis and asthma \u2014in some cases requiring repeated sinus 1919 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 80 surgery with frequent or chronic administration of systemic corticosteroids.385 AERD is r are in 1920 children with asthma and becomes increasingly more common in adults with asthma. 1921 Approximately 7% of adults with asthma and a third of patients with asthma and nasal 1922 polyposis have AERD.386, 387 1923 observed in leuk otriene pathways and 1924 prostaglandin metabolism due to reduction of prostaglandin E 2 and reduction of signaling 1925 through the E prostanoid 2 receptor.388 These biochemical changes are augmented after COX -1 1926 inhibition by NSAIDs, leading to increased production of leukotriene mediators, manifesting as 1927 an acute clinical reaction. Long -term therapy with aspirin after desensitization leads to 1928 improvement in some of these biochemical changes and is associated with improved clinical 1929 outcomes. These molecular pathways have been reviewed extensively elsewhere and are 1930 summarized in Table XVII.388, 389 1931 Aspirin and NSAIDs that inhibit COX -1 can all cause reactions in patients with AERD and 1932 are considered cross -reactive ( Table XVIII). Analgesics that are weak inhibitors of -1 (eg, 1933 nonacetylated salicylates and acetaminophen; Table XVIII) may cause reactions in highly 1934 sensitive individuals if administered at higher doses (650 -1000mg) but are typically mild.390, 391 1935 NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX -2 but also inhibit COX -1 at higher doses may result in 1936 reactions, depending on the dose given. Reactions to selective COX -2 inhibitors are extremely 1937 rare in patients with AERD and they can typically be taken safely.392-395 1938 1939 Consensus Based Statement 23: We recommend against an oral aspirin challenge to confirm 1940 the diagnosis of AERD in cases of high diagnostic certainty based on clinical history; however, 1941 aspirin desensitization remains a therapeutic option when indicated. 1942 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 81 Strength of Recommendation: St rong 1943 Certainty of Evidence: Low 1944 Neither skin testing nor in vitro tests are useful for AERD. The diagnosis of AERD is 1945 usually established by history, with the probability of reacting to a formal challenge ranging 1946 from 80 -100% in patients with a typical his tory.387 When patients with a history suggestive of 1947 AERD (ie, asthma, rhinosinusitis, and history of a single respiratory reaction to aspirin or aspirin - 1948 like drug) are challenged with aspirin, approximately 80% will have a respiratory reaction 1949 confirming t he diagnosis.387 When there is a history of multiple reactions to structurally 1950 dissimilar NSAIDS (ibuprofen and aspirin for example) the rate of a positive challenge 1951 increases.387 In one study of 243 patients, all those with a history of aspirin causing a severe 1952 reaction requiring hospitalization or intensive care level monitoring had positive oral aspirin 1953 challenges.387 Thus, in most patients with histories suggestive of AERD, an aspirin challenge to 1954 exclusively confirm the diagnosis is not required or rec ommended. Thus, in patients with at 1955 least two respiratory reactions to different NSAIDS or a respiratory reaction requiring 1956 hospitalization, further diagnostic testing with aspirin challenge is unnecessary. 1957 Consensus Based Statement 24: We suggest an ora l aspirin challenge to confirm the diagnosis 1958 of AERD in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. 1959 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1960 Certainty of Evidence: Moderate 1961 If the history is unclear or unknown (e.g. no recent history of NSAID ingestion) and when a 1962 definite diagnosis is required, a controlled oral provocation challenge with aspirin should be 1963 performed (Table XIX). This may be necessary in patients who have a remote NSAID reaction 1964 history or don't take NSAIDS at all, or in whom the reaction description was atypical (cutaneous 1965 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 82 only symptoms, >3 hours from ingestion to reaction or prolonged symptoms lasting >8 -10 1966 hours ). Making an AERD diagnosis is critical for counselling patients on NSAID avoidance, the 1967 opportunity for aspirin desensitization, and provides more insight into the underlying polypoid 1968 disease and asthma which will likely be more recalcitrant to therapy. T wenty -four hour urinary 1969 leukotriene E4 measurements are elevated at baseline in AERD, but a diagnostic cutoff has not 1970 yet been established. Although this could be used in conjunction with other clinical features, 1971 the gold standard diagnosis requires an ob served aspirin challenge when the history is 1972 uncertain.396 1973 1974 Consensus Based Statement 25: We suggest that a challenge procedure be used to diagnose 1975 AERD when there is diagnostic uncertainty and that a desensitization protocol be used when 1976 the intention i s to place a patient on a daily therapeutic aspirin dose for cardioprotection, 1977 pain relief or to control nasal polyp regrowth. 1978 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 1979 Level of Evidence: Moderate 1980 Management of AERD - challenge and desensitization 1981 Aspirin desensitization is a form of pharmacologic induction of drug tolerance. The term 1982 \"desensitization\" is used for historical context; however, this procedure is distinguished from 1983 any other immunologic induction of drug tolerance in that unique bioche mical events occur 1984 during \"desensitization\" that can be associated with clinical benefit. Similar to other induction 1985 of drug tolerance procedures, pharmacologic induction of drug tolerance procedures induce a 1986 temporary state of tolerance to aspirin/NSAIDs that is maintained only as long as the patient 1987 continues to take aspirin. Pharmacologic induction of drug tolerance is typically performed over 1988 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 83 hours to days and generally starts with milligram amounts. The most common indication for 1989 aspirin desensitizatio n in the United States is poorly controlled airway disease despite use of 1990 appropriate medications for patients who require long -term treatment with systemic 1991 corticosteroids to control their upper and lower respiratory disease. When the intention is to 1992 both identify whether hypersensitivity exists through a challenge and then simultaneously 1993 convert to desensitization if the patient demonstrates hypersensitivity, the term 1994 challenge/desensitization has been used to delineate both occurring simultaneously as pa rt of a 1995 single procedure.397 Although many clinicians might use the same protocol for both a challenge 1996 and a desensitization, the purpose of the challenge is to identify the HSR through objective 1997 measures such as a drop in FEV 1 >10-15%, a drop in peak nasa l inspiratory flow >25%, physical 1998 examination findings (wheezing, sneezing, rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection) and also 1999 symptoms.398-400 Any of the protocols listed in Table XX can be used as an aspirin challenge 2000 protocol in patients where diagnostic unce rtainty exists for AERD and confirmation of this 2001 sensitivity is required. A patient who has objective reactivity during a desensitization procedure 2002 has simultaneously confirmed the AERD diagnosis and thus functions as a positive aspirin 2003 challenge. A chall enge procedure is completed when the patient has evidence of a reaction. It 2004 should be noted that there are variables that affect the outcome of the aspirin challenge. 2005 Concurrent leukotriene -modifying therapy may lead to a negative challenge in a patient w ith 2006 AERD.401 Similarly, omalizumab may completely block aspirin induced reactions.402 403 In 2007 patients who have recently had a debulking polypectomy as many as 1/3 will convert to a 2008 negative challenge , thus aspirin desensitization ideally should be performed within several 2009 weeks of sinus surgery .404, 405 During desensitization, doses are repeated and advanced after the 2010 patient recovers from the reaction and the goal is to achieve a dose of at least 325mg aspirin 2011 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 84 daily. This dose allows use of any dos e of any NSAID without concern of a reaction. If a final goal 2012 of 81mg is desired purely for antiplatelet effect, that can be the final dose of the 2013 desensitization , but the patient will not be desensitized to a higher dose of aspirin or another 2014 NSAID. 2015 Precautions for aspirin desensitization in AERD should emphasize frequent monitoring 2016 of lung function and management of severe bronchospasm. Protocols vary in dose and timing 2017 of aspirin, but generally require 1 -3 days to accomplish.406-408 Newer studies ou tline protocols in 2018 which the intention can be to complete the desensitization in a single clinic day (Table XX).409, 2019 410 Reaction severity and duration may still dictate the conversion to a multiday protocol ( Table 2020 XIX). Desensitization involves incrementa l oral administration of aspirin during 1 to 3 days, 2021 starting at 20.25 -40.5 mg and going up in steps to the full dose of 325 mg.406, 408, 411 Intranasal 2022 ketorolac is used as an additional option to initiate desensitization with the intention of limiting 2023 the initial symptoms into the upper airway.408 In cases where the days of desensitization are 2024 not consecutive, patients may continue the highest tolerated dose daily until the 2025 desensitization can be completed. Continued daily administration of at least 325 m g of aspirin 2026 once daily is required for patients to remain in a tolerant state.412 However, higher doses are 2027 usually necessary to control nasal polyps and airway inflammation with initial doses of 650 mg 2028 twice daily being necessary for optimal effect.413 Aspirin therapy may be associated with 2029 gastritis, epigastric pain or gastrointestinal bleeding. Using an enteric coated aspirin, and other 2030 modes of gastrointestinal prophylaxis may be considered.397, 414 Gaps in aspirin doses > 48 2031 hours may lead to loss of tolerance and after 5 days all patients will react to aspirin and require 2032 another desensitization procedure to resume therapy.412 This presents a problem for patients in 2033 whom a surgical procedure necessitates aspirin discontinuation. If the surgical proced ure can 2034 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 85 be safely performed during a 48 -hour window, aspirin can safely be restarted immediately after 2035 surgery at the previous aspirin treatment dose. Reducing the dose of aspirin to 325 mg daily for 2036 7 days prior to surgery, holding aspirin the day prior a nd the day of surgery, and then restarting 2037 aspirin immediately post -operatively allows patients to retain their state of tolerance.415 Using 2038 ibuprofen in lieu of aspirin during surgery to \"bridge\" the patient and have presumably less 2039 aspirin -related bleedi ng complications is another consideration.416 For patients who need to be 2040 off aspirin for >48 hours, desensitization should be repeated. Decisions on the best approach 2041 for modified vs complete desensitization need to be made on an individualized basis taki ng into 2042 account factors including patient history, severity of symptoms during desensitization, severity 2043 of asthma, and the eliciting dose. Leukotriene -modifying agents have been found to diminish 2044 the lower respiratory asthmatic response during aspirin des ensitization and therefore are 2045 recommended as pretreatment for patients with AERD preparing for aspirin desensitization 2046 who are not already taking one of these agents (when not otherwise contraindicated).417, 418 2047 Inhaled corticosteroid/long -acting beta ago nist inhalers serve a dual purpose of optimizing 2048 asthma control prior to desensitization but also diminish the severity of NSAID induced 2049 bronchospasm and therefore should also be considered for pretreatment.417, 419 Once patients 2050 are desensitized, universa l tolerance to all COX -1 inhibiting NSAIDs (in addition to aspirin) is 2051 achieved. 2052 2053 Management of AERD - aspirin as therapy 2054 Management of patients with AERD involves avoidance of aspirin and NSAIDs and 2055 aggressive medical and/or surgical treatment of underlying asthma and rhinitis or sinusitis. A 2056 pharmacologic induction of drug tolerance procedure (aspirin desensitization) is an important 2057 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 86 therapeutic option for patients with AERD. Aspirin desensitization treatment improves clinical 2058 outcomes for both upper and lower respiratory tract disease.411, 420 -425 During long -term aspirin 411 Aspirin desensitization 2062 has been shown to be cost - effective ( $6,768 per quality -adjusted life -year s for AERD) .426 2063 Variables which might affect the which may lead to a 2065 negative challenge in some patients.397 With the advent of biologic therapies for nasal 2066 polyposis such as dupilumab, where benefit is observed in AERD, it remains to be seen how 2067 these may also alter clinical presentation of aspirin and NSAID drug allergic reactions is an 2071 exacerbation of urticaria or angioedema in patients with chronic urticaria ( Table 2072 XVI). Approximately 10% to 40% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria develop a 2073 worsening of their condition after exposure to aspirin or NSAIDs.428, 429 The rate appears to be 2074 more frequent in patients in an active phase of their urticaria or angioedema syndrome. Most 2075 patients with a history of exacerbations induced by aspirin or NSAIDs demonstrated the 2076 presence of histamine -releasing factors assessed by autologous serum -induced the development 2078 of chronic spontaneous urticaria.431 All drugs that inhibit COX -1 cross -react to cause this 2079 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 87 reaction, and the arachidonic acid metabolism dysfunction described herein in the section in 2080 AERD is thought to play a pathogenic role. Selective COX -2 inhibitors are generally well 2081 tolerated in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, although there may be rare 2082 exceptions.432-434 2083 Management NSAID -exacerbated cutaneous disease 2084 Aspirin or another NSAID is occasionally medically necessary in patients with NSAID - 2085 exacerbated cutaneous disease . Although desensitization has been attempted, patients with 2086 chronic urticaria or angioedema that is exacerbated by aspirin do not typically achieve 2087 tolerance via either rapid (2 -5 hours) or standard (1 -3 days) aspirin challenge or desensitization 2088 protocols and continue to experience flares of their cutaneous condition with exposure to 2089 aspirin or cross -reacting NSAIDs.435, 436 The general approach to patients with this condition is to 2090 primarily control the underlying urticaria. In patients with uncontrolled chronic urticaria, they 2091 are unlikely to tolerate NSAIDS at any dose, but once the urticaria is controlled, some patients 2092 tolerate single dose NSAID challenges. Whether they may tolerate continuous daily treatment is 2093 not established.436 Case reports suggest that when the skin disease is controlled with 2094 omalizumab, some patients may then be able t o NSAIDs.436-438 2095 Multiple NSAID -Induced Urticaria and NSAID -Induced Urticaria and Angioedema, 2097 we suggest an oral aspirin challenge to identify whether the reaction is COX -1 cross -reactive. 2098 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 2099 Certainty of Evidence: Low 2100 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 88 A third type of drug hypersensitivity to aspirin or NSAIDs is urticaria or angioedema due 2101 to aspirin and any NSAID that inhibits COX -1 in individuals without a prior history or ongoing 2102 chronic urticaria ( Table XVI).33, 439 These patients are usually able to tolerate COX -2 inhibitors, 2103 and their reactions are purely cutaneous without accompanying anaphylactic symptoms.432, 434, 2104 440 In one study, over a 2 -year period, 63% of patients became naturally tolerant to NSAIDS.441 2105 Patients with a history of acute urticaria to multiple NSAIDs might be at increased risk for the 2106 development of chronic urticaria, although conflicting studies exist.431, 442 It is difficult to 2107 determine the diagnosis in a patient with a history of a single NSAID reaction who now avoids 2108 all NSAIDS. An accurate diagnosis requires a challenge with several studies demonstrating the 2109 safety and utility of performing challenges with structurally dissimilar NSAIDS.380-382 For 2110 exam ple, if the reaction occurred with ibuprofen, an aspirin challenge will address whether this 2111 is a cross -reactive or possibly a drug -specific allergic reaction as described next. 2112 generally managed by avoidance. In the 2114 setting of inflammation requiring COX -2 blocking effect, specific COX -2 inhibitors will generally 2115 be tolerated.440, 443 Given the low rate of reactions (8 -11%) that also occur to COX -2 inhibitors, 2116 the first dose could be given under observation. In contrast to the aforementioned 1 - to 3-day 2117 protocols for induction of drug tolerance to aspirin (aspirin desensitization) in patients with 2118 AERD, there are limited data on more rapid (2 -5 hours) protocols in patients with histories 2119 predominantly of cutaneous reactions (urticaria or angioedema) to aspirin but also include a 2120 few patients with histories of respiratory reactions.435, 439, 444 -446 2121 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 89 Concomitant high dose (2 to 4 times the standard daily dose of a non-sedating 2122 antihistamine) H1-antihistamines might also be another avenue to allow occasional safe use of 2123 NSAIDS. 2126 A fourth type of drug allergic reaction is aspirin or single NSAID -induced urt icaria or 2127 angioedema or anaphylactic reaction, which case other NSAIDs are tolerated ( Table XVI).447-2128 450 The underlying etiology of these reactions is not fully understood. The clinical pattern of a 2129 preceding period of sensitization during which the dru g is tolerated suggests an IgE -mediated 2130 mechanism, but there are limited reports of detection of specific IgE to NSAIDS. In pyrazolone 2131 derivatives, positive skin and enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay in vitro test results were 2132 seen in 51 of the 53 patients .451 Similarly, in 6 subjects with metamizole hypersensitivity, skin 2133 tests were positive in all patients.452 This reaction is not due to arachidonic acid dysfunction, 2134 and any NSAID, including selective COX -2 inhibitors, may be responsible.453, 454 Although specific 2135 IgE mediated reactions theoretically can occur to any pharmacologic agent, controversy exists 2136 regarding the presence of an anaphylactic response specific to aspirin. Aspirin reactions are 2137 typical in the cross -reactive patterns described above bu t have not been conclusively shown to 2138 exist through a structure -specific immunologic mechanism. All studies that have \"desensitized\" 2139 to aspirin beginning at doses designed to accommodate an IgE mediated mechanism were done 2140 empirically based on a remote hi story. Specific aspirin allergy might be assumed in patients 2141 with a remote history of an aspirin reaction and recent tolerance of a separate NSAID such as 2142 ibuprofen. But this assumption should be dispelled by the lack of reports of aspirin -specific 2143 hyperse nsitivity. Direct challenges to aspirin in this situation are nearly always negative .455, 456 2144 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 90 Management of single NSAID reactors 2145 Successful management of single NSAID reactors is contingent on determining the 2146 culprit NSAID. It would be unusual to have a patient require a specific NSAID for a medical 2147 condition - other than aspirin. Since most NSAIDs are not available in a parenteral form, and 2148 the positive and negative predictive values are unknown, skin testing is generally not 2149 recommended in evaluation of these patients. Challenge to NSAIDs in a different structural 2150 class would provide options for as needed pain control ( Table XXI). Direct aspirin challenges 2151 should be performed to allow future aspirin use. 2152 Other NSAID Hypersensitivity Subtypes 2153 In mastocytosis, 2 exhibit hypersensitivity to aspirin or NSAIDS - 2154 through the nonspecific consequence of mast cell degr anulation.457 Separately, patients might 2155 exhibit unexpected respiratory symptoms, or combined (\"blended\") respiratory and cutaneous 2156 reaction to aspirin or NSAIDs . These cannot be classified into 1 of the 4 reaction types 2157 described herein.458 In addition, allergic reactions to aspirin or NSAIDs can rarely manifest as 2158 pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonias Meningitis is much more common with 2159 ibuprofen and although likely drug specific, cross reactivity to other NSAIDS has been 2160 reported.459 In al l of the above situations, consideration should be made for the chemical 2161 structure of the culprit NSAID and that an alternative class might be tolerated in this situation, 2162 although studies in the above situations are lacking (Table XXI). 2163 NSAIDS are also co mmon causes of delayed drug HSRs that comprise up to 5% of all such 2164 reactions and occur greater than 6 hours after dosing although many will occur after days to 2165 weeks following initiation of a new NSAID.460 Many of such reactions are thought to be T -cell 2166 mediated. Delayed HSRs associated with NSAIDs include cutaneous as 2167 DRESS , SJS/TEN, and AGEP.462 NSAIDs are also amongst the -induced 2170 causes of interstitial nephritis 463, aseptic menin gitis. 465 NSAIDs are amongst the most common causes of FDE and include in 2172 particular the oxicam, acetic acid, acid derivatives and Oxicam meloxicam, piroxicam) acetic diclofenac) have been more hig hly 2174 associated with severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions ; oxicam and selective COX -2 inhibitors 2175 are the most commonly associated with SJS/TEN.466 Since prodromal symptoms of SJS/TEN 2176 include involvement, NSAIDS (particularly ibuprofen) and acetaminophen 2177 may be started following onset of initial symptoms and falsely implicated in some SJS/TEN and 2178 erythema multiforme cases (protopathic effect). Lesional (FDE) or general patch testing have 2179 been employed for diagnosis of cutaneous delayed r eactions associated with NSAIDs with 2180 varying sensitivity. Cross -reactivities within the same chemical class although not universal (e.g. 2181 lack of cross -reactivity between ibuprofen and naproxen reported for FDE) are well described 2182 and for severe reactions avoidance without rechallenge within that class ( Table XVIII, Table 2183 XXI) is recommended.460 This is due to the potential recurrence of a severe drug 2184 hypersensitivity that cannot be well predicted with current testing approaches. 2185 Common NSAID hypersensiti vity clinical scenarios 2186 Consensus Based Statement 27: We suggest a 2 -step aspirin challenge for patients with a 2187 history of non-AERD aspirin allergy to aid in the management of cardiovascular disease 2188 events. 2189 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 92 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 2190 Certainty of Evidence: Very Low 2191 Urgent requirement for aspirin in a patient with an acute coronary syndrome 2192 In the setting of an acute coronary syndrome, the need for the anti -platelet effect of 2193 aspirin might supersede the goal of the allergist -immunologist to firs t determine whether the 2194 patient has ongoing hypersensitivity. A graded aspirin challenge or aspirin desensitization are 2195 two options available to the allergy consultant. A graded challenge is preferred as it provides 2196 the patient and clinician with a true di agnosis and if negative, simplifies any further questions 2197 about aspirin use . 2198 Although aspirin desensitization has been associated with success in allowing patients 2199 who otherwise would have been denied the benefits of aspirin to receive this drug safely, i t is 2200 unclear whether these protocols truly induce drug tolerance (desensitization) or are simply a 2201 multistep graded -dose challenge.456 Most of the patients described in these reports required 2202 aspirin for acute coronary syndromes or before coronary stents a nd had a history of prior 2203 adverse reaction to aspirin. No confirmatory challenge studies could be performed to 2204 determine whether the previous reactions were causally or coincidentally associated with 2205 aspirin. For this reason, it is uncertain whether these patients were truly aspirin sensitive. 2206 Fortunately, two larger studies now demonstrate the logistical feasibility and relative safety of 2207 these empiric \"desensitization\" strategies in the acute cardiovascular setting.445, 455 Most 2208 subjects in this same popu lation who underwent a challenge had a negative aspirin challenge 2209 and were therefore never allergic at the time of their desensitization.455 An example of a rapid 2210 aspirin challenge desensitization protocol is provided in Table XXII.445 It is likely that in patients 2211 with poorly controlled NSAID -exacerbated cutaneous disease, that 2212 Journal September 7 , 2022 93 protocols might culminate in persistent urticaria. The allergy consultant will need to discuss this 2213 possibility with the cardiovascular team early on. A pre ferred protocol of a simple 2 -step oral 2214 challenge ( Table XXIII) has been reported and could be applied to any non -AERD aspirin 2215 hypersensitivity scenario.456 This can be finished at 81mg i f that is the target dose, or could be 2216 continued to 325mg if necessary. The disadvantage of performing a \"desensitization\" to aspirin 2217 is that the patient retains the aspirin allergy label and the concomitant issues that might come 2218 up with future need to re -introduce aspirin after a lapse in therapy. Table XXIII provides an 2219 example protocol, but variations on this could include lower starting doses, and shorter 2220 intervals between doses based on clinician preference, and patient characteristics such as 2221 unstable cardiac status or anxiety. Thus, in a patient with a remote history of an NSAID reaction 2222 and no AERD or active urticaria, a challenge is preferred. In a large series of NSAID challenges, a 2223 two-step challenge protocol was efficient and convenient. In thi s group, 75% had a history of 2224 NSAID induced urticaria or angioedema, 85% of the challenges were negative, and only 3/262 2225 challenges were treated with epinephrine, none with hemodynamic instability.467 A challenge is 2226 simpler (no need for compounding the asp irin dose), faster, and will efficiently answer the 2227 question regarding hypersensitivity while simultaneously achieving the therapeutic objective. It 2228 is understood that in some institutions, established aspirin desensitization protocols might be in 2229 place an d be more convenient. Extremely unstable patients might also be candidates for 2230 desensitization where much lower start ing doses are used. Patients with a history consistent 2231 with AERD (respiratory reactions to NSAIDS, history of nasal polyposis and asthma) w ould be 2232 best served by performing a desensitization specific to AERD as outlined earlier in Table XX . 2233 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 94 A patient requiring NSAID use for pain 2234 In this setting, \"as -needed\" treatment would likely be preferred. The goals of the allergy 2235 consultant should be t wo-fold. First is to make an accurate diagnosis of NSAID hypersensitivity. 2236 This is done through history and use of selected oral challenges. Proving the patient does not 2237 have NSAID hypersensitivity allows any NSAID to be used and answers the clinical ques tion. 2238 The second goal is to find the best treatment option in a patient with verified NSAID 2239 hypersensitivity. Most frequently, a challenge with a specific COX -2 inhibitor will be tolerated 2240 and allow use of that medication. If a specific NSAID allergy is suspected, challenge with an 2241 NSAID in a different structural group should be considered ( Table XXI). If regular use of an 2242 NSAID for pain control is necessary, desensitization can be considered, but as previously 2243 discussed, the effectiveness of this approac h is dependent on the specific NSAID 2244 hypersensitivity phenotype. In AERD, patients may be desensitized 325mg daily aspirin and 2245 could take additional NSAIDS as needed for pain relief. In patients without AERD, this is also an 2246 opportunity to challenge wi th the culprit drug to delabel the NSAID allergy for the patient. 2247 NSAID Hypersensitivity in Children 2248 In general, the above approaches can be applied to pediatric patients with HSRs to 2249 NSAIDs, with the exception that AERD has only rarely been reported in the pediatric 2250 population.468, 469 Only 31 -68% of children will have NSAID hypersensitivity confirmed upon 2251 challenge, demonstrating the difficulty in relying on history for diagnosis. A recent report 2252 describes 526 direct provocation challenges with the cul prit drug in 6 centers with a positive 2253 challenge rate of 19.6%.470 In a subgroup of children, NSAID reaction patterns cannot be 2254 adequately explained by current mechanistic understanding.471, 472 2255 Journal revision 2256 Allergic rashes may occur in 1 -2% patients following introduction of clopidogrel, a 2257 thiopyridine inhibitor of platelet activation, that is often recommended in aspirin -intolerant 2258 patients.473 Although the mechanisms of such reactions are unknown, successful oral induction 2259 of drug tol erance protocols have been reported.474, 475 Although induction of tolerance is 2260 successful in these situations, rechallenge or continued therapy is also reportedly successful.473 2261 2262 Cancer Chemotherapeutic Hypersensitivity 2263 Infusion reactions are defined as n egative or adverse reactions to specific drugs that are 2264 usually not predictable and unrelated to the known side effects from a drug. Some infusion 2265 reactions are felt to be HSRs , while others do not have an allergic component and are caused by 2266 other compon ents of the immune system. HSRs have emerged as a significant complication for 2267 many commonly used chemotherapeutic agents .476-479 The ability to use first -line 2268 chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of patients with cancer is critical to good patient 2269 outcomes, but unfortunately, an increasing incidence of HSRs are limiting their use. 2270 Immediate HSRs can range from mild cutaneous er uptions to anaphylaxis and are often 2271 mast cell mediated. Delayed reactions typically 6 -24 hour later are more likely related to T-cell- 2272 mediated mechanisms. Site -specific toxicities such as mucositis, alopecia, nail changes, or hand - 2273 foot syndrome lead to dr ug discontinuation and are reversible. Benign delayed exanthems can 2274 occur but often amenable to \"treating through\" with symptomatic management (i.e., oral H1- 2275 antihistamines). However, more worrisome reactions can include erythema multiforme or 2276 severe cuta neous adverse drug sickness, DRESS , and AGEP . 2277 These types of severe T -cell mediated delayed reactions are typically not amenable to 2278 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 96 desensitization, are associated with long -lasting memory T -cell responses and typically ind icate 2279 that the drug needs to be avoided completely. Other reactions associated with cancer 2280 chemotherapeutic agents or the underlying disease itself can include 2281 dIDT may be 2283 useful for certain cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) reactions but avoided in SJS/TEN where 2284 the sensitivity is low . PT may also be useful in these severe delayed T -cell mediated reactions 2285 (see section on Testing for Delayed Hypersensitivity Reactions) . The cutaneous toxicity of some 2286 chemotherapeutic agents may forbid any type of skin allergy testing. 2287 The lack of a standardized approach to management after a presumed mast cell 2288 mediated HSR leads to suboptimal outcomes including: needless avoidance of first -line 2289 chemotherapeutic agents in patients who could tolerate re -challenge without desensitization or 2290 intentional re -challenge with a drug that may cause a recurrent and severe HSR. However, 2291 there is significant research and experience showing that an accurate clinical history and proper 2292 evaluation improves patient outcomes despite a reported HSR to chemotherapeutics . This 2293 section will focus specifically on approach to care of patients with immediate HSRs to specific 2294 chemotherapeutics frequently prompting referral to the allergist -immunologist and cite the 2295 supporting literature on evaluation and management of these HS Rs (Table XXIV).480-488 2296 Consensus Based Statement 28: We suggest that in patients with immediate reactions to 2297 chemotherapeutics a drug desensitization may be performed when the implicated drug is the 2298 preferred therapy. 2299 Strength of Recommendation: revision September 7 , 2022 97 The main approaches to care after a presumed HSR to a chemotherapeutic include (1) 2302 desensitization, (2) skin testing and risk stratification or (3) risk stratification without skin 2303 testing and challenge . There are advantages and disadvantages with each approach. 2304 While most of the desensitization protocols published in the literature initially focused on 2305 antibiotics, this principle, has since been applied successfully to other drugs including 2306 chemotherapeutic agents.483, 489, 490 If the clinical assessment is consistent with an HSR, then 2307 empiric desensitization is a reasonable and safe approach to care and can be performed even 2308 when skin testing is not possible (i.e., outpatient clinic without access to chemotherapy drugs 2309 for s kin testing , skin toxic chemotherapeutics ). Candidates for drug desensitization to 2310 chemotherapeutics include with type cell mediated/IgE -dependent) 2311 including anaphylaxis. Desensitization protocols allow patients to safely receive first -line 2312 chemotherapy treatments for management of life -threatening oncologic diseases to reach 2313 optimal outcomes. Drug desensitization should be performed when there is no reasonable 2314 alternative as with first -line cancer treatments. Drug desensitization protoc ols for 2315 chemotherapeutics can last several hours with dose doubling every 15 -20 minutes and are 2316 usually performed in inpatient units or infusion centers with trained staff. 2317 Consensus Based Statement 29: We suggest that patients with non -immediate reaction s or a 2318 history of reactions inconsistent with chemotherapeutic hypersensitivity may be treated with 2319 a slowed infusion rate , graded dose escalation, and/or pre -medications without 2320 desensitization. Strength 2323 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 98 Patients without a convincing clinical history of an HSR do not require desensitization and 2324 typically respond well to re-administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. Examples include 2325 subjective symptoms of pruritus or lip swelling without any objec tive skin findings during the 2326 infusion or the occurrence of redness of the skin without any itching, rash or hives several 2327 hours after treatment is completed. In these cases, skin testing and desensitization are not 2328 indicated. If symptoms are more objecti ve but mild in nature (i.e., flushing or pruritus alone 2329 without hives, back pain alone) or heightened patient concern around re -administration, pre - 2330 medications, such as H1-antihistamines, and a slowed infusion rate have been used successfully 2331 without the need for desensitization.36 For patients with a high level of anxiety around re- 2332 treatment despite an unconvincing reaction history or describing a sensation of throat tightness 2333 or trouble breathing without objective findings, skin testing can be considered to provide 2334 reassurance , and subsequent slowed infusion rate may alleviate some of their treatment 2335 concerns. 2336 2337 Platin s 2338 HSRs occur in of with gynecologic malignancy receiving carboplatin, 5 -20% in 2339 patients receiving cisplatin, and up to 24% in patients with multiple cancer types (including 2340 gastrointestinal) receiving oxaliplatin .476, 491, 492 Platinum compounds typically cause HSRs after 2341 several treatment courses,493, 494 suggesting a period of sensitization is important and an 2342 immun ologic IgE mechanism is likely . There are varying reports of cross -reactivity between 2343 platin agents but the lowest between oxaliplatin and cisplatin.485, 495, 496 With carboplatin, the 2344 incidence of HSRs increases from 1% in individuals who have received 6 or fewer carboplatin 2345 infusions to 27% in those who received 7 or more, and up to 46% in patients who have received 2346 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 99 greater than 15 infusions.476, 497 The peak incidence of carboplatin HSRs occurs with th e eighth 2347 or ninth exposure, which generally corresponds to the second or third cycle of re -treatment 2348 after recurrence of malignancy.476 Pretreatment with corticosteroids and H1-antihistamines 2349 does not prevent HSRs from occurring again and does not prevent anaphylaxis.498 2350 Consensus Based Statement 30: We suggest that for patients with a history of immediate 2351 allergic reactions to platinum based chemotherapeutic agents, the severity of the initial HSR 2352 and skin testing results (if available) may assist in thei r risk stratification and management. 2353 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 2354 Certainty of Evidence: Low 2355 As discussed, desensitization can be successfully used to continue first -line treatment in 2356 cancer patients despite an immediate HSR. However, skin tes ting has been found to be useful in 2357 the management of patients with platin HSRs and also identify cases where desensitization may 2358 be unnecessary despite a clinical history suggestive of an HSR. Skin testing to platins should be 2359 considered when it will impa ct patient care decisions but not delay care. Skin testing with the 2360 platin drug has been demonstrated to be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of HSR to 2361 platinum -based chemotherapeutic agents, including carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin.476, 2362 494, 496 However, the false negative rate of carboplatin skin testing (i.e., the development of HSR 2363 with next exposure after a negative skin test) is reported to be as high as 8 -8.5% in the 2364 literature.499, 500 It has been observed that some patients with a clin ical history suggestive of a 2365 platinum agent HSR but with negative initial skin testing experienced HSRs with subsequent 2366 drug exposure even when that exposure occurred during attempted drug desensitization. 488 2367 When initial skin testing is negative, the t ime elapsed since the platin HSR occurred (<6 2368 weeks or >6 months) should be taken into consideration and r epeat skin testing has been 2369 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 100 utilized to identify individuals that are truly allergic.501, 502 In part, this guidance is based on the 2370 data from genera l anesthesia and hymenoptera venom evaluations and described in the 2371 literature for platin HSR suggesting some patients may have falsely negative skin tests for 4 -6 2372 weeks after a systemic reaction.501, 502 However, this should not delay treatment and care c an 2373 proceed under the assumption of true allergy based on the clinical history until platin skin 2374 testing can be performed. Prior data has shown that skin testing may convert from negative to 2375 positive after subsequent carboplatin exposures if the time interv al between initial skin testing 2376 and the HSR is greater than 6 months.488, 502, 503 One note of caution, skin testing should not be 2377 performed for chemotherapy drugs with vesicant skin reactivity such as doxorubicin.504 Local 2378 skin necrosis has also been seen with carboplatin full concentration intradermal testing (10 2379 mg/mL) and therefore the maximum concentration for intradermal use should be 5 mg/mL . 488 2380 A risk stratification protocol utilizing three serial skin tests has been shown to be safe 2381 and effective in evaluating and managing patients with carboplatin -induced HSR.503 This 2382 protocol has been reported to safely differentiate allergic from non -allergic patients and helps 2383 prevent unnecessary desensitizations (Figure 5).501 However, while avoiding unnecessary 2384 desensitization by identifying truly allergic patients, risk stratification protocols can create 2385 operational challenges in addition to rising costs, increased patient time, multiple office visits 2386 and potential delays in treatment. One potential approach sought to simplify the platin skin 2387 testing/risk stratification process while maintaining safety and efficacy by studying a modified 2388 1-step platin intradermal skin testing protocol (using highest platin skin test concentra tion only) 2389 in patients with a history of platin HSR who have tolerated an initial desensitization.505 It is 2390 important to note that empiric desensitization (without prior skin testing) remains a safe 2391 method to manage patients after an HSR , though there is limited evidence for this approach . 2392 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 101 Skin testing with chemotherapeutics is often difficult to perform due to limited access to the 2393 drugs and in many cases, institutional policies on who can handle chemotherapeutic drugs. In 2394 both academic and even more so i n non -academic centers, chemotherapeutic skin testing may 2395 not be feasible. Empiric desensitization without skin testing allows the patient to proceed with 2396 first-line therapy. 2397 For patients with positive skin test results, various desensitization protocols h ave been 2398 reported .498, 506, 507 The most experienced published approach has used a 12 -step 2399 desensitization protocol for a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, including platinum 2400 compounds, has been reported to be successful in 413 procedures, with 94% of p rocedures 2401 having only a mild or no reaction and 6% had moderate to severe reactions .506 A more recent 2402 report indicated that in 2,177 cases of chemotherapy or mAb , desensitization in 370 patients 2403 with 15 different agents, 93% of the cases had no or mild re actions and all patients were able to 2404 complete all desensitization courses and continue as first line therapy.508 A slightly modified 2405 desensitization protocol with 13 -steps using one additional step in the last/third bag where 2406 reactions were frequently oc curring has also shown a high rate of success.501 These multi -step 2407 desensitization protocols are labor intensive leading to several recent publications showing 2408 success using a 1 -bag desensitization protocol (Table XXV).509 While these still require multiple 2409 steps, no carboplatin drug dilutions were required significantly simplifying the burden of 2410 resources (i.e., skilled pharmacist, preparation time) needed to proceed safely and shortening 2411 the time required for desensitization . 2412 When analyzing the c osts and life expectancy of patients that underwent carboplatin 2413 desensitization it was found that overall health costs were not increased, and the life span was 2414 equal or superior compared to a cohort control group of patients with similar cancers 2415 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 102 undergoin g the same treatment courses without prior infusion reaction who did not receive 2416 desensitization .508 2417 There are also emerging data using drug provocation or challenge protocols based on 2418 the severity of the initial HSR as a major factor in risk stratificati on and subsequent de -labeling 2419 of patients with a history of platin hypersensitivity.36, 51 A 2013 study evaluated 12 low -risk 2420 patients with platin HSRs and negative platin skin testing.510 They all underwent platin challenge 2421 and 7 out of 12 tolerated the c hallenge and did not require desensitization. In another study, 2422 one out of 21 positive platin challenge patients had anaphylaxis (hives, hypoxemia, 2423 hypotension, dyspnea, and wheezing) which required epinephrine and resolved within 30 2424 minutes.511 The study concluded that platin challenges can reduce desensitization requirements 2425 (32% of platin challenges were negative) but still have an inherent risk. It is important to note 2426 that the risks may be different when comparing challenge protocols performed with ca rboplatin 2427 to other chemotherapeutic agents however, this methodology has been safely applied to other 2428 chemotherapeutics and biologics. 2429 Serum specific IgE to platins are promising but still remain investigational. Basophil 2430 activation test has been shown to identify patients with carboplatin and oxaliplatin allergy and 2431 to detect severe reactors and reactors during drug desensitization and may be a useful 2432 biomarker in the future.512 2433 Recent data show that inherited mutations in BRCA 1/2 appear to be associate d with a 2434 higher risk for carboplatin HSRs.513, 514 Patients with a BRCA 1/2 mutation are also at higher risk 2435 for reacting during desensitization514 and therefore, allergist -immunologist s should refer 2436 women with BRCA 1/2 mutation for further counseling acco 2437 2438 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 103 Consensus Based Statement 31: We suggest that for patients with a history of immediate 2439 allergic reactions to taxane based chemotherapeutic agents, the severity of the initial HSR 2440 may assist in their risk stratification and management. 2441 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional Evidence: Low Taxane s 2444 Taxanes are a that includes paclitaxel and docetaxel. 2445 Paclitaxel is a natural compound, originally isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree ( Taxus 2446 brevifolia ) and found to have anticancer properties. Taxane HSRs are generally thought not to 2447 be related to the active drug but instead may be caused by excipients. Examples include 2448 Cremophor -EL, a lipid solvent vehicle used in paclitaxel, and polysorbates, used in other 2449 chemotherapeutics like the taxane family, paclitaxel and docetaxel produce 2450 infusion reactions in 10 -50% of patients on first administration,37 suggesting either a direct, 2451 non-IgE-mediate mechanism or the presence of pre -existing specific -IgE. Taxanes may cause 2452 mast cell and/or basophil activation through IgE -mediated mechanisms, direct action on 2453 basophils, or IgG mediated mechanisms that cause complement activation and release of 2454 anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a).484 Therefore, the role of skin testing taxane HSR remains 2455 unclear.484, 515 If Cremophor -EL is the culprit as described in the literature,483 then skin testing 2456 has little value while the opposite is true for IgE mediated reactions which appear to be much 2457 less common with taxanes. Clinically, it is not easy to differentiate IgE from non -IgE reactions 2458 based on symptoms alone with taxane HSRs but skin testing has been described as a potential 2459 tool as a subset of patients may react via an IgE -mediated process based on prior sensitization 2460 (i.e., to a cross -reactive pollen from the yew tree) . 516, 517 However, it is unclear that skin testing 2461 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 104 impacts c linical management and the pathophysiology of Taxane hypersensitivity which may 2462 relate more to non -specific mast cell activation as opposed to specific IgE in most cases. 2463 Pretreatment with systemic corticosteroids and H1-antihistamines can decrease the rat e 2464 of reactions to taxanes from 30% to 3%.37-39 However, patients who develop immediate 2465 react ions despite pretreatment can be successfully managed using a three -bag desensitization 2466 protocol similar to chemoth erapeutics, performing 2467 the desensitization procedure is labor intensive as pharmacists and nurses need to prepare and 2468 administer diluted solutions. To address this, a 1 -bag protocol was recently shown to be 2469 noninferior to a multi -bag rapid desensitization protocol with 98% success and could offer a 2470 safe, effective, less labor -intensive option for paclitaxel desensitization.519 In addition, the 2471 literature shows that the majority of patients with mild taxane reactions (i.e., without 2472 respiratory symptoms or h ypotension) can safely resume regular or slowed infusions without 2473 desensitization.520, 521 For example, one study developed and used a risk stratification algorithm 2474 in 35 patients with paclitaxel HSRs (Figure 6).520 All 5 patients with a grade 1 initial HS R 2475 tolerated re -treatment without desensitization, so unnecessary desensitizations were avoided 2476 and no patients developed severe HSRs. Still, another study similarly showed safety of risk 2477 stratification based on the severity of the initial HSR in conjunctio n with skin testing to guide 2478 taxane reintroduction.516 These types of algorithms can be used to aid clinicians in the 2479 management of patients who previously experienced a taxane HSR. 2480 Another option for patients who react to paclitaxel is to switch to a non -cremophor 2481 paclitaxel such as paclitaxel formulated as albumin -bound particles which is not used routinely 2482 due to cost. 2483 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 105 Severe delayed reactions that are often T -cell mediated such a s been described in case reports in association with paclitaxel and these are not amenable to 2486 desensitization.484, 522 2487 Radiation recall dermatiti s is a localized drug -induced inflammatory skin reaction 2488 occurring in a previously irradiated site months to years after discontinuation of ionizing 2489 radiation exposure that has been noted with certain chemotherapeutic drugs including 2490 paclitaxel.523 The lit erature erythema, 2491 edema, vesicle formation and the site of previous irradiation with paclitaxel 2492 treatment. Symptoms usually appear within days to weeks after exposure to the causative 2493 agent. In addition to stopping the precipitating agent, topical corticosteroids have been 2494 beneficial. Shared decision making can be used to discuss risks and benefits of using the culprit 2495 again once symptoms improve. 2496 2497 Asparaginase 2498 Asparaginase is a criticall y important treatment for specific cancers including acute 2499 lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Immediate -type reactions to 2500 asparaginase occur in as many as 3 -45% of patients.524 2501 There are three formulations of asparaginase that are FDA -appro ved for use in the U.S. 2502 The first is native Escherichia coli asparaginase while the second is a pegylated (PEG) form of 2503 asparaginase, also derived from Escherichia coli. The third formulation is asparaginase , which is 2504 derived from an alternate bacterial so urce, Erwinia chrysanthemi . In patients who react of either Erwinia 106 pegylated asparaginase may be better tolerated.525 Data show that in patients who switch to 2507 asparaginase Erwinia asparaginase, 2508 leukemia outcomes are similar to patients who never developed clinical hypersensitivity.526, 2509 527 The mechanism of these reactions is unknown, but symptoms and signs consistent with 2510 mast cell mediator release, as well as anaphylaxis, have been described. Successful use of 2511 asparaginase rapid induction of drug tolerance protocols are reported.528, 529 2512 Patients who developed an HSR to Escherichia -derived asparaginase showed 2513 increased levels of anti -asparaginase antibodies as well as decreased asparaginase activity.524 2514 While premedication with steroids reduces the rate of HSRs when studied across trials 2515 comparing patients pre -medicated with steroids and those not given steroids , it is unknown 2516 whether the development of anti -asparaginase antibodies is similarly reduced. Anti -PEG 2517 asparaginase IgG has shown utility in predicting and confirming clinical reactions to pegylated 2518 asparaginase as well as in identifying patients who are most li kely to experience failure with 2519 rechallenge.146 Additionally, the presence of anti -PEG IgG antibodies may correlate to Tyrosine kinases are a large group of enzymes that participate in many cell functions, 2523 including cell signaling, growth, and division. The challenge using tyrosine kinase inhibitors 2524 (TKIs) has been their association with significant idiosyncratic or pharmacologic effects 2525 including cutaneous and systemic side effects (including a recent FDA black box warning for 2526 serious heart -related events, cancer, blood clots, and death) .40 The mechanism of these adverse 2527 effects is pleotropic, and may relate directly to tyrosine kinase effects rather than immunologic 2528 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision 7 , 2022 107 hypersensitivity. In rare cases, HSRs have been described. These enzymes, which may be 2529 overactive and found at high levels in cancer cells, can be blocked using TKIs to slow the growth 2530 of the cancer cells. TKIs are broadly described as a type of targeted therapy that identifies and 2531 inhibits only specific types of tyrosine kinase in cancer cells while not affecting normal cells. 2532 Approximately 50 TKIs are currently (2021) FDA approved in the U.S. and play a valuable role, 2533 not only in the treatment of maligna ncies but also in a myriad of autoimmune conditions and 2534 myeloproliferative disorders. TKIs are categorized based on the specific tyrosine kinase target 2535 (i.e., Epidermal growth kinase inhibitors , etc). 2537 Like other reactions associated with anti -chemotherapeutic drugs, recognition and 2538 correct clinical phenotyping is key to risk stratification and the formulation of an appropriate 2539 management plan. This includes the deci sion on when to reduce the dose, stop the drug or 2540 treat with corticosteroids. Proactive approaches to care of the patient undergoing 2541 chemotherapy also starts with patient education on the most important or likely adverse 2542 events that may occur and when to c all their physician (i.e., primary care, oncologist) so that 2543 such reactions can be recognized and managed early and effectively. 2544 The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor's (EGFR -TKI) most 2545 common adverse effect is skin toxicity, usual ly manifested as acneiform rash, skin fissure, 2546 xerosis, and paronychia. More than half of patients taking these drugs experience an acneiform 2547 eruption. It is usually mild or moderate but can be severe in a minority of cases. Because EGFRs 2548 are highly expres sed in sebaceous epithelium, eruptions are generally most concentrated in 2549 seborrheic areas such as the scalp, face, neck, chest and upper back. The periorbital region, 2550 palms and soles are usually spared.531 The acneiform eruption is often dose -dependent an d 2551 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 108 begins within one week of treatment.532 Hand -foot skin reactions, presenting with pain and 2552 blistering on the palms and soles, are reported with sorafenib, sunitinib, and other EGFR 2553 inhibitors. EGFR inhibitors have also been associated with hair changes, aphthous ulcerations of 2554 the oral and nasal mucosa, photosensitivity, urticaria. Cases of SJS and TEN have been 2555 reported with TKIs, but the incidence is low.533-535 2556 Management of cutaneous side effects includes topical and systemic corticosteroids, 2557 antibiotics (lesions can be superinfected by bacteria), topical urea, salicylic acid and oral 2558 isotretinoin. Patients who develop pruritus may benefit from H1-antihistamines or gamma - 2559 aminobutyric acid agonists such as gabapentin.536, 537 In some cases, the dose of TKI is reduced 2560 or the TKI is discontinued and then reintroduced at a lower dose once the cutaneous symptoms 2561 improve. Immediate discontinuation of the drug is recommended if there is any sign of a 2562 bullous or exfoliative skin rash. NSAIDs, minocycline rash.538, 539 2564 Oral mucositis stomatitis are also common adverse events associated with TKIs. A 2565 patient with oral mucositis may have extensive erythema or aphthous-like stomatitis.540 Most 2566 stomatitis/mucositis cases are mild but can be very painful and make eating and drinking 2567 difficult. The frequency of diarrhea is 24 -41%.541 Endocrine dysfunction (hyperglycemia, 2568 hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia), as liver problems, ocul ar toxicity, 2569 peripheral edema, joint pain and proteinuria can also occur.542 These effects are usually mild, 2570 but severe cases can occur, significantly affecting patients ' well-being, treatment compliance 2571 and quality of life. 2572 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 109 Adverse Reactions to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors 2573 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer treatment since the first 2574 approval of the cytotoxic T 2021, these include 7 drugs with indicatio ns for 17 cancer types ( Table XXVI). 2576 Treatment has also diversified to include not only dual immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy 2577 that originated with CTLA -4 and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1) inhibitor combinations 2578 in melanoma but also combinations incorporating chemotherapy and o ther targeted therapies. 2579 The currently available ICI are mAbs that block specific immune checkpoints, CTLA -4, 2580 programmed death to increases in T -cell activation and proliferation.41 2581 The mechanism of action of these drugs , which reduce self -tolerance, can lead to a number of 2582 toxicities that are typically organ -specific autoimmune events and referred to as immune - 2583 related adverse events (irAEs).41 The most common of these are mild to moderate and include 2584 dermatitis, thyroidi tis, and other endocrinopathies, hepatitis, colitis, interstitial nephritis and 2585 pneumonitis.42-44 Rare but potentially fatal events include myocarditis and encephalitis.45, 46 2586 Non -specific adverse drug reactions such as fatigue, pruritus without rash, art hralgia, loss of 2587 appetite and weight loss are common. Overall, some form of toxicity occurs in approximately 2588 20% of those treated; however, 50% of those treated with combination therapies, such as PD -1 2589 and CTLA -4 inhibitor combined therapy, will experience an ICI related adverse event.43 2590 Infusion reactions related to ICI are typically mild and occur in up to 25% of those 2591 treated with PD -1 and PD -L1 agents in particular.44 For avelumab these may be more 2592 pronounced and treatment with an antihistamine and ac etaminophen has been 2593 recommended.543 Allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis are extremely uncommon and 2594 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 110 consideration would need to be given for the excipients of these drugs which contain 2595 polysorbate 80 , except for avelumab Exacerbation of asthma 2596 and atopic disease may occur but is uncommon.544 Pruritus without rash is a common side 2597 effect and postulated to have a neurologic basis.545 Gabapentin is often effective in 2598 management.545 It is important for the allergist -immunol ogist to recognize these non -allergic 2599 events as they may be consulted for common toxicities such as rashes or organ dysfunction or 2600 they may have patients that they are following for other reasons that are under treatment with 2601 an ICI.44 Treatment of the tox icities is currently based on the common terminology criteria for 2602 adverse events.546 For mild reactions, symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended 2603 and therapies may be continued.43 These could include topical corticosteroids and oral H1- 2604 antihis tamines 2605 hypophysitis, diabetes, adrenal insufficiency). In the case of more severe toxicities the ICI 2606 should be stopped and systemic corticosteroids (0.5 -2 mg/kg/day tapered over 4 -6 we eks) have 2607 remained the mainstay of treatment. For those who do not improve on corticosteroids or who 2608 flare during a corticosteroid taper, a disease specific immunomodulator directed against a 2609 specific target may be indicated. Rechallenge to the ICI is a shared decision between the 2610 patient and the provider that weighs the risk of recurrence and morbidity with rechallenge 2611 compared with the benefit of tumor response. For grade 4 reactions rechallenge is typically 2612 considered contraindicated. Several s tudies have now looked at the recurrence of ICI toxicities 2613 with rechallenge with the same agent or same class of agent , or de -escalation from dual ICI 2614 therapy to single therapy (e.g., CTLA -4/PD -1 therapy to PD The 2615 rates of recurrence with rechallenge with the same ICI have been 50% or less and more 2616 common with colitis, pneumonitis and hepatitis. De -escalation of combined ICI therapy to single 2617 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 111 therapy (e.g. PD -1) was associated with a more modest risk of recurren ce of 20% or 2618 less. Current ICI rechallenge strategies under study include concomitant use of selective 2619 immunosuppressant therapy. Generally both the management of the toxicity and the decision 2620 for future treatment is done in conjunction with the patient's multidisciplinary care team. 2621 Recent guides to the work -up and management of ICI toxicity , including evidence and 2622 consensus based recommendations to recognize and manage single and combination ICI irAEs , 2623 have been published by the National Comprehensive Can cer Network (NCCN)552 and the Society 2624 for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC).553. Identification of individual genetic factors or other 2625 biological markers that would predict which patients are at risk for irAEs has not been defined 2626 for clinical use but is und er study.554 Management 2629 Biologic agents are newer therapeutic agents created from living cells, tissues or 2630 organisms that include mAbs (suffix \"mab\") and soluble fusion receptors (suffix \"cept\") . The 2631 nomenclature for mAbs is described in Supplemental Table EIII . Structurally, these can be 2632 based on a common immunoglobulin G structure but with considerable differences in the 2633 degree of the residual non -human component. The other main structur al group are often 2634 referred to as \"small molecules\"; and although the target is a specific immune pathway 2635 molecule or receptor, the drug size is small and generally not comprised of an immunoglobulin 2636 structure. Within the mAb class, agents can be further c haracterized by the penultimate syllable 2637 \"u\" for fully humanized, only the 2638 complementarity determining region remains murine but the rest of the antibody is humanized 2639 (Supplemental Table EIII ). Humanization of the immunogenicity 2640 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 112 agents although fully humanized antibodies carry some risk.555 In addition to protein structures, 2641 heterogeneity can be introduced through other manufacturing processes due to glycosylation 2642 variants, carboxy or amino terminal acid additions, aggregates and other factors. The 2643 development of biologic agents is rapidly expanding the therapeutic space with >150 agents 2644 approved for treatment of malignancy and immunologic/inflammatory conditions as well as 2645 expansio n to conditions to such as migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, and Alzheimer's 2646 disease . All of these agents are immunogenic and potentially capable of triggering local or 2647 systemic HSRs . 2648 Almost all biologic agents are administered via subcutaneous o r intravenous injection, 2649 and they are either engineered antibodies targeted against a specific target, or mimics of 2650 human protein agonists blocking or effecting function through a specific pathway. Biologic 2651 agents have the benefit of target specificity and infrequent dosing yet have potential to be 2652 immunogenic. A variety of mechanisms may result in reactions including complement 2653 activation, SSLRs , and mast cell activation either via IgE -mediated or direct mast cell activation. 2654 Non -immune mechanisms such as tumor lysis and cytokine storm may also cause symptoms 2655 that overlap with immune -mediated reactions. The utility of diagnostic testing (e.g., skin testing 2656 and in -vitro testing) is limited by several factors including, but not limited to, mechanistic 2657 uncerta inty, the cost of the medications, availability, lack of validation, and the unknown 2658 predictive value. Given these limitations, the Work Group suggests that skin testing for mAbs is 2659 rarely clinically indicated. See the Practical Guidance for the Evaluation and Management of 2660 Drug Hypersensitivity; Specific Drugs for more information.556 2661 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 113 Consensus Based Statement 32: We suggest that patients with non -immediate reactions or a 2662 history of reactions inconsistent with mAb hypersensitivity may be treated with a sl owed 2663 infusion, graded dose escalation, and/or pre -medications without desensitization. 2664 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 2665 Certainty of Evidence: Low 2666 Consensus Based Statement 33: We suggest that for patients with immediate reactions or a 2667 history cons istent with anaphylaxis to mAbs drug desensitization should be considered when 2668 the implicated drug is the preferred therapy. 2669 Strength of Recommendation: Conditional 2670 Certainty of Evidence: Low 2671 There is a growing need for allergy/immunology specialists to be involved in the 2672 management of immunologic adverse events associated with use of mAbs . The mechanism of 2673 these reactions is heterogenous, which may influence management approaches. Even without 2674 knowledge of the underlying mechanism, most patients with react ions to mAbs may be 2675 managed through strategies including slowed infusion, premedication, and rapid 2676 desensitization protocols.557 After appropriate evaluation, many patients can be managed in a 2677 way to allow continuation of the culprit agent, which often has no therapeutic equivalent. 2678 While adverse and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to numerous mAbs , currently 2679 only a small number of agents are suspected culprits for the majority of referrals to 2680 allergy/immunology specialists, and these will be discussed in more detail in this parameter. 2681 Details regarding management of reactions to less frequently implicated biologics are described 2682 elsewhere.556 2683 mAb approved for the treatment of several 2685 types of cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, the benefit of any mAb treatment must be 2686 balanced against its risk of causing reactions. This risk is especially high during the initial 2687 infusion, as up to 77% of pati ents being treated for a B -cell lymphoma can develop a reaction 2688 during their first exposure.48 Paradoxically, the risk of having a reaction to rituximab appears to 2689 decrease with subsequent infusions.49, 50 Tumor burden affects the type of infusion reaction 2690 which encompass several different immunologic mechanisms, including cytokine release 2691 syndrome, HSRs (mast , and lysis syndrome ( Table XXVII). In some cases, 2692 clinical symptoms of mast cell -mediated and cytokine -release syndrome reaction s may overlap, 2693 which has been termed a mixed reaction. Cytokine release is thought to occur when rituximab 2694 interacts with CD20 on lymphocytes leading to cytokine whereas HSR are attributed to 2695 mast cell degranulation. Acute cell lysis akin to tumor lysis syndrome may occur, with increase 2696 in serum creatinine, potassium, calcium, phosphate, lactate dehydrogenase , and uric acid and 2697 decrease in calcium and phosphate. The severity of the cell lysis syndrome is variable, but renal 2698 failure and acute, life -threatening pulmonary edema may occur within 12 -24 hours of the first 2699 infusion ( Table XXVII). 2700 Appropriate management of a reaction includes cessation of the rituximab infusion and 2701 treatment of the reaction. As a result, complete drug avoidance has been a dvised needlessly in 2702 some patients who would benefit from additional rituximab treatment. Other patients undergo 2703 unnecessary desensitization procedures when the reactions are not consistent with significant 2704 mast cell mediated events. One commonly recommen ded approach to evaluating a patient 2705 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 115 after a rituximab HSR (mast cell mediated) is risk stratification ( Figure 7).558 These algorithms 2706 based on experience at one large academic institution start by grading the reaction: grade 1 is 2707 generally cutaneous symptoms only (rash, itching, flushing), grade 2 includes urticaria, nausea, 2708 vomiting, dyspnea or asymptomatic includes symptomatic 2709 bronchospasm, dyspnea, hypoxia, and/or wheezing while grade 4 includes anaphylaxis. In a risk 2710 stratification algorithm proposed by Levin et al.,558 most patients with a grade 1 reaction 2711 tolerated rechallenge. However, all 4 patients with a grade 3 reaction had a reaction during 2712 rechallenge. The outcome of same -day rechallenge after an initial grade 2 reaction was varied; 2713 most patients (26 of 31 [84%]) tolerated same -day challenge, but 5 patients had a reaction (all 2714 grade 1 -2 severity). Following this algorithm, patients with a grade 1 reaction may receive same 2715 day rechallenge once initial reaction symptoms have improved.558 Shared decision making, in 2716 which the risks and benefits of the options are considered, is an important s trategy. For grade 1 2717 or 2 reactions, slowed infusion (typically 50% usual infusion rate), graded challenge or 2718 desensitization are considered as reasonable options. In grade 3 or 4 reactions, an allergy 2719 specialist consultation may be a preferred option. The utility of rituximab skin testing is unclear, 2720 especially in cases where the reaction likely is not mast cell mediated. Rituximab desensitization 2721 is safe and successful and can be completed within one day but should be performed under the 2722 guidance of exper ienced staff who can manage allergic reactions.559 One group has described 2723 drug challenges in 60 patients with reactions to biologics (including rituximab) in patients with 2724 negative skin testing.51 All challenges were carried out in an intensive care uni t setting 2725 specifically assigned for drug desensitization patients. Forty -seven (78%) passed the challenge; 2726 however , of the 13 patients who reacted with challenge, 8 had moderate -severe anaphylaxis. 2727 The workgroup recommends this approach should be considere d only by very specialized 2728 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 116 centers. Separately, approach to repeat treatment after a cytokine release or tumor lysis 2729 infusion rituximab reaction may depend upon tumor burden. There are case reports of 2730 mortality secondary to cytokine release syndrome in pa tients with a very high tumor burden 2731 supporting the notion that a decrease in tumor burden may lead to a decreased risk of 2732 reactions.560, 561 Shared decision making with a focus on risks and benefits is important when 2733 making the decision on how to proceed with treatment after an initial reaction. 2734 2735 SSLR s have been reported with rituximab and many other biologics. A systematic review 2736 reported on 33 cases of rituximab SSLR75 and a French study identified 37 cases.563 2737 SSLRs appear to be more common in autoim mune diseases (78 -85% of all cases) and in 2738 women , and have the typical triad of arthritis, fever, and cutaneous manifestations (purpura, 2739 urticaria, erythema). In the two aforementioned reports, 2 of 4 and 6 of 7 rechallenges 2740 respectively to rituximab were well tolerated. Thus, in patients who develop SSLRs to rituximab 2741 and for whom there are no equally efficacious therapies, rechallenge can be considered after 2742 shared decision making with an assessment of risks and benefits. There are no large studies on 2743 validated pre -medication regimens, but both H1-antihistamines and systemic glucocorticoids 2744 have been used. 2745 Allergist -immunologist s should be aware of the possibility for serious, non -immediate 2746 adverse reactions to myocardial infarction, 2747 arrhythmia, shock, and pulmonary toxicity. These reactions are not amenable to desensitization 2748 and drug avoidance is usually necessary. 2749 Journal revision September 7 , the epidermal growth factor 2751 receptor. A high prevalence of HSRs ranging from 12 -29% has been reported in southeastern 2752 U.S.564-566 On further study, most of the severe HSRs to cetuximab were associated with pre - 2753 existing IgE antibodies against gala ctose --1,3-galactose, a carbohydrate attached to 2754 cetuximab.52 Investigation of this regional variation in reaction rates led to the discovery that 2755 Lone Star tick bites were the cause of specific -IgE to galactose --1,3-galactose (alpha -gal) in 2756 these indiv iduals. However, cases subsequently have been reported increasingly in 2757 other parts of the U.S. Galactose -alpha -1,3-galactose has also been found in most 2758 mammalian or \"red meat\" and likely explains delayed red meat anaphylaxis.567 Most food 2759 allergies are di rected against a protein molecule, but galactose --1,3-galactose is a 2760 carbohydrate, and slower absorption may explain the delayed nature of the allergic reaction to 2761 red meat. Other mAbs are produced with the murine SP2/0 cell line used for cetuximab and ar e While the alpha -gal content is lower in these antibodies, a case 2764 of first -dose anaphylaxis to infliximab due to alpha -gal specific -IgE has been 2765 reported.53 There are successful reports of desensitization to cetuximab in the literature.54, 55 2766 Use of panitumumab, another mAb specific for epidermal growth factor receptor, after a 2767 cetuximab HSR be 2769 Infliximab is a mAb targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha. After initial approval, infusion - 2770 related adverse events without a clear understanding of pathophysiology were reported. Similar to 2771 rituximab, the mechanisms are likely diverse, including IgE mediated hypersensitivity , cytokine 2772 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision syndrome , and SSLR.56 HSRs to infliximab occur in approximately 10% of patients and are 2773 usually during the first or second exposure but can also occur with subsequent doses. Cytokine 2774 release and SSLR have been reported with symptoms 5 -7 days after infusion. Interestingly, co - 2775 administration of thiopurine immunomodulators or methotrexate, have been efficacious in 2776 preventing some reactions to infliximab.56 Premedication with intravenous corticosteroids has not 2777 been shown reduce the immuno genicity of infliximab.569 Antibodies against infliximab may 2778 reduce the efficacy of treatment and increase the risk of HSR.57, 58 Risk stratification can be 2779 considered in the evaluation and management of individuals that develop reactions to infliximab 2780 (Figure 8 ).556 This protocol is based on a small number of patients and the effects of premedication 2781 independent of desensitization has not been studied.570 Testing for alpha -gal specific -IgE should be 2782 considered in patients with first dose reactions to infli ximab, given the aforementioned potential 2783 for cross -reactivity with alpha receptor mAb that binds to both circulating 2787 soluble IL -6 receptor and membrane -expressed IL -6 recep tor. The most common reported 2788 adverse events are infections and gastrointestinal symptoms; however, there are cases of HSRs 2789 and anaphylaxis.571, 572 Rapid desensitization is a safe and successful option for patients who 2790 need tocilizumab despite an immediate HSR.573 Delayed 2791 vasculitis have been reported.574 Successful induction of drug tolerance has been reported in a 2792 patient with a benign exanthem to tocilizumab and a positive delayed intradermal skin test.575 a n anti-IgE mAb , currently FDA approved for the treatment of moderate - 2795 to-severe allergic asthma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and nasal polyposis. Review of the data 2796 shows a <0.1% risk of anaphylaxis with omalizumab, but interestingly 36% of reactions occurred 2797 more than 1 hour after administration of the drug, and 7% occurred > 12 hours later.59 A 2798 nonirritating omalizumab concentration fo r intradermal skin testing was defined at 1:100,000 2799 volume to volume dilution, a concentration of 1.25 mg/mL, but the predictive value has not 2800 been established in individuals with anaphylaxis to omalizumab.61 There are reports of 2801 successful desensitization to omalizumab. ( Table XXVIII).62-65 577 2803 Excipients Allergy 2804 Consensus Based Statement 34: We suggest the clinician recognize that excipients are a very 2805 rare cause of immediate or delayed reactions associated with drugs. Still, excipient 2806 hypersensitivity may be considered in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to >2 structurally 2807 unrelated drugs or products that share a common excipient, (e.g., injectable corticosteroids; 2808 PEG-based Evidence: Low 2811 An excipient is an inactive substance that is formulated alongside the active 2812 pharmaceutical ingredient of a medication. Excipients include coloring agents, preservatives, 2813 stabilizers and fille rs.66 The main of the excipient is to improve accurate dispensation 2814 of the product, facilitate drug absorption and solubility, improve stability (extend shelf -life) and 2815 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 120 enhance tolerability including appearance and taste.578 Similar to the active pharmaceutical 2816 ingredient of a drug, excipients are more likely to contribute to intolerance than to a true 2817 allergic reaction.67 Categories of excipients include foods and sugars such as lactose, mannitol, 2818 gelatin and cornstarch; polymers such derivatives; dyes coloring agents; and 2819 other ingredients such as carboxymethylcellulose.66 There is a paucity of literature to support 2820 allergy to dyes as excipients of drugs. The average oral formulation of a product has 2821 approximately 9 inactive ingredients.66 Excipients are a very rare cause of immediate or delayed 2822 reactions associated with drugs.68-70 Standardized excipient testing reagents and 2823 concentrations are lacking.67, 579, 580 The use of some recommended sources for excipients, such 2824 as artificial tears containing polysorbate 80, has led to frequent false positives.581 The excipients 2825 present in specific drugs and products and their availability can vary widely across different 2826 countries.582 In addition, the route and mechanism by which pa tients may become sensitized to 2827 excipients may differ. For instance, carboxymethylcellulose present in many foods has been 2828 recognized as a cause of anaphylaxis.583 However, individuals with anaphylaxis to parenteral or 2829 high dose oral formulations with car boxymethylcellulose, such as corticosteroids or barium 2830 sulfate preparations, appear to tolerate the low concentrations present in foods or oral 2831 medication.71, 583 -585 The same is likely true for polysorbates and lower molecular weight PEG 2832 excipients.67 Ingestion challenge is recommended to determine oral tolerance to these 2833 excipients . 2834 Although delayed reactions are associated with some excipients (e.g. propylene glycol), 2835 the most worrisome reactions are life -threatening anaphylaxis associated with excipien ts such 2836 as PEG carboxymethylcellulose in injectable corticosteroids.68, 71 Although patients with 2837 PEG allergy generally tolerate mRNA vaccines that incorporate PEG, they may still have 2838 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 121 anaphylactic reaction to other drugs that have PEG.586 Common excip ients, their associated 2839 drugs, cross -reactivity patterns and potential testing strategies are shown ( Table XXIX)67, 68, 70, 71, 2840 349, 580, 582, 583, 587 -600 and a general approach to management and testing for excipient allergies is 2841 proposed ( Figure 9). As previously mentioned, the validity and diagnostic certainty for most 2842 excipient skin testing is uncertain. 2843 2844 References 2845 1. Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters.

For IgE and non -IgE mediated immediate 4461 reactions these occur within hours (<6 hours) of ingestion whereas all delayed reactions occur 4462 >6 hours. The latency period is an ext remely valuable clue to along with other clinical features 4463 to the clinical phenotype of the reaction with some reactions e.g. AGEP occurring very quickly 4464 to antibiotics and other reactions;DRESS having a latency at minimum of 2 -3 weeks; SJS/TEN 4465 appearing a s early as 4 days or out to 8 weeks after initiation of medication. Since multiple 4466 drugs are frequently taken together at the time of a reaction, a timeline outlining all drugs 4467 taken at the time first symptoms of a reaction occur and the evolution of the symptoms 4468 alongside the history of initiation of specific drugs should be documented and is a valuable tool 4469 to aid in drug causality for a given clinical phenotype of reaction. 4470 4471 Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 158 Figure 2. Penicillins and cephalosporins share common structures that are thoug ht to be the 4472 source of cross -reactivity: (1) beta -lactam ring, shown in green; (2) side chain, or R group with 4473 R1 location shown in red and R2 location shown in gray. Cross -reactivity is largely based on R 1 4474 side chains, with identical side chains in patien ts with IgE -mediated allergy posing the highest 4475 risk. Rarely, cross -reactivity has been demonstrated through R2 side chains and the beta - 4476 lactam ring. ( Table XII ). 4477 4478 Figure 3.

Grading the strength recommendations 4526 4527 Strong Recommendation The workgroup and JTFPP are confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects. This recommendation may be appropriate to be used as a practice standard indicator. When making a strong recommendation, the wording is \"We recommend\" implying that the clinician would choose to follow the recommendation in most circumstances. The implications of a strong recommendation are: For patients \u2014most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; request discussion if the intervention is not offered For clinicians \u2014most patients should receive the recommended course of action For policy makers \u2014the recommendation can be adopted as a policy in most situatio ns Conditional Recommendation The workgroup and JTFPP concluded that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effect but are not confident. When making a conditional recommendation, the wording is \"We sug gest\" implying that the clinician may choose to follow the recommendation but that decisions may vary based on contextual factors. The implications of a conditional recommendation are: For patients \u2014most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not For clinicians \u2014you should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and that you must help each patient to arrive at a management Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 160 decision consistent with her or his values and preferences. It is likely that shared decision making will plan a major role in arriving at the management decision. For policy makers \u2014policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of many stakeholders 4528 Consensus -based Statement When there are either no published studies, or very limited and/or weak evidence, a consensus statement without any category of certainty of evidence was developed. The degree of agreement by all JTFPP and workgroup members is indicated, with voting detai ls provided if there were dissenting votes. 4532 4533 4534 4535 Table of evidence for each recommendation. 4536 4537 High = Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. The recommendation is based on high quality evidence, e.g., multiple highly rated randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and metanalyses Moderate = Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. The recommendation would likely be based upon somewhat limited evidence, e.g., reduced number or quality of randomized controlled trials , controlled trials without randomization Low = Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. The recommendation would likely be based upon very weak evidence, e.g., non -experimental studies, registries, comparative studies Very low = Any estimate of effect is very uncertain. The recommendation is based largely very low quality studies and/or on expert opinion. consensus -based statements (CBS). 4555 Section and Number CBS Strength of Recommendation Certainty of Evidence Drug Challenges CBS 1 We suggest that when the clinical probability of a drug allergy is low, in patients without contraindications for a drug challenge, that it be performed with a 1 - or 2-step drug challenge. Conditional Low CBS 2 We suggest that placebo -controlled drug challenges be considered in patients with a history of primarily subjective symptoms and/or multiple reported drug allergies. Conditional Low Testing for Delayed Hypersensitivity Reactions CBS 3 We suggest that for specific phenotypes of delayed drug HSRs where the pre -test probability is high (e.g., DRESS), but the implicated agent is uncertain, that dIDT and/or PT may be useful as adjunctive tests to support drug causality. Conditional Very Low Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 162 Beta -Lactams CBS 4 We recommend that a proactive effort should be made to delabel patients with reported penicillin allergy, if appropriate. Strong Moderate CBS 5 We recommend against any testing in patients with a history inconsistent with penicillin allergy (such as headache, family history of penicillin allergy, or diarrhea), but a 1 -step amoxicillin challenge may be offered to patients who are anxious or request additional reassurance to accept the removal of a penicillin allergy label. Strong Low CBS 6 We suggest penicillin skin testing for patients with a history of anaphylaxis or a recent reaction suspected to be IgE-mediated. Conditional Low CBS 7 We recommend against the routine use of multiple day challenges in the evaluation of penicillin allergy. Strong Low CBS 8 We recommend against penicillin skin testing prior to direct amoxicillin challenge in pediatric patients with a history of benign cu taneous reaction (such as MDE and urticaria). Strong Moderate CBS 9 We suggest that direct amoxicillin challenge be considered in adults with a history of distant (i.e., > 5 years ago) and benign cutaneous reactions (such as MDE and urticaria). Conditiona l Low CBS 10 We suggest that for patients with a history of non -anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, direct challenges (without prior skin test) to cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains be performed to determine tolerance. Conditional Moderate CBS 11 We suggest that for patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a cephalosporin, a negative cephalosporin skin test should be Conditional Low Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 163 confirmed prior to administration of a parenteral cephalosporin with a non-identical R1 side chain. CBS 12 We sugg est that for patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a penicillin, a structurally dissimilar R1 side chain cephalosporin can be administered without testing or additional precautions. Conditional Moderate CBS 13 We suggest that for patients with a histo ry of an unverified (not confirmed) non -anaphylactic penicillin allergy, a cephalosporin can be administered without testing or additional precautions. Conditional Moderate CBS 14 We suggest that in patients with a history of an unverified non - anaphylact ic cephalosporin allergy, a penicillin can be administered without testing or additional precautions. Conditional Low CBS 15 We suggest that in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to cephalosporins, penicillin skin testing and drug challenge should be performed prior to administration of a penicillin therapy. Conditional Low CBS 16 We suggest against penicillin skin testing in patients with a history of non-anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy prior to administration of a penicillin therapy. Conditional Low CBS 17 We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be administered without testing or additional precautions. Conditional Moderate CBS 18 We suggest that in patients with a history of penicilli n or cephalosporin allergy, aztreonam may be administered without prior testing unless there is a history of ceftazidime allergy. Conditional Moderate CBS 19 We recommend that allergist - Strong Moderate Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 164 immunologist s collaborate with hospitals and healthcare systems to implement beta -lactam allergy pathways to improve antibiotic stewardship outcomes. Sulfonamides CBS 20 We suggest that for patients with a history of benign cutaneous reactions (e.g. MDE , urticaria) to sulfonamide antibiotics that occu rred > 5 years ago, a 1 -step drug challenge with trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole be performed when there is a need to delabel a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy. Conditional Low Fluoroquinolones and Macrolides CBS 21 We suggest using a 1 - or 2-step drug challenge without preceding skin testing to confirm tolerance in patients with a history of non - anaphylactic reactions to fluoroquinolones or macrolides. Conditional Low Aspirin/NSAID Hypersensitivity Phenotypes CBS 22 We suggest a selective COX -2 inhibitor may be used as an alternative analgesic in patients with any NSAID hypersensitivity phenotype when an NSAID is needed. Conditional Low AERD CBS 23 We recommend against an oral aspirin challenge to confirm the diagnosis of AERD in cases of high diagnostic certainty based on clinical history; however, aspirin desensitization remains a therapeutic option when indicated. Strong Low CBS 24 We suggest an oral aspirin challenge to confirm the diagnosis of AERD in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Conditional Moderate CBS 25 We suggest that a challenge procedure be used to diagnose AERD Conditional Moderate Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 165 when there is diagnostic uncertainty and that a desensitization protocol be used when the intention is to place a patient on a daily therapeutic aspirin dose for cardioprotection, pain relief or to control nasal polyp regrowth. Multiple NSAID - Induced Urticaria For patients with NSAID -Induced Urticaria and Angioedema, we suggest an oral aspirin challenge to identify whether the reaction is COX - 1 cross -reactive. Conditional Low Common NSAID Hypersensitivity Clinical Scenarios CBS 27 We suggest a 2 -step aspirin challenge for pa tients with a history of non- AERD aspirin allergy to aid in the management of cardiovascular disease events. Conditional Very Low Cancer Chemotherapeutic Hypersensitivity CBS 28 We suggest that in patients with immediate reactions to chemotherapeutics a drug desensitization may be performed when the implicated drug is the preferred therapy. Conditional Low CBS 29 We suggest that patients with non - immediate reactions or a history of reactions inconsistent with chemotherapeutic hypersensitivity may be treated with a slowed infusion rate, graded dose escalation, and/or pre -medications without desensitization. Conditional Low Platins CBS 30 We suggest that for patients with a history of immediate allergic reactions to platinum based Conditional Low Journal Pre-proofPostsubmission revision September 7 , 2022 166 chemotherapeutic agents, the severity of the initial HSR and skin testing results (if available) may assist in their risk stratification and management. CBS 31 We suggest that for patients with a history of immediate allergic reactions to taxane based chemotherapeutic agents, the severity of the initial HSR may assist in their risk stratification and management. Conditional Low Biologic Hypersensitivity CBS 32 We suggest that patients with non - immediate reactions or a history of reacti ons inconsistent with mAb hypersensitivity may be treated with a slowed infusion, graded dose escalation, and/or pre -medications without desensitization. Conditional Low CBS 33 We suggest that for patients with immediate reactions or a history consistent with anaphylaxis to mAbs drug desensitization should be considered when the implicated drug is the preferred therapy.

Patients with a 4984 history of gastrointestinal reactions or delay in reaction might not do as well in the faster protocols. 4985 Ketorolac nasal spray - 60 mg/2 ml ketorolac (2 ml + 2.75 ml preser vative free saline) = 12.6 mg/ml = 1.26 mg per 100 4986 mcg spray 4987 The timing above assumes minimal or no reaction to aspirin doses. In most situations, when a reaction occurs, the 4988 protocol is paused and resumed only after the reaction has largely resolved. 4989 Doses triggering a reaction should be repeated prior to up -dosing. 4990 Given the above factors, many patients will require a second day to complete the desensitization even if the intention 4991 was to complete it in one day. 4992 Most patients will react at a dose between 40.25 mg and 120 mg of chemical structure aspirin challenge protocol for patients with cardiovascular disease.445 5037 Time Dose 0 minutes 1mg 30 minutes 5mg 60 minutes 10mg 90 minutes low dose aspirin graded challenge for cardiovascular emergencies456 5074 Time Dose 0 minutes 40.5mg 90 minutes 40.5mg* * At this point, the goal of 81mg of aspirin has been reached.
