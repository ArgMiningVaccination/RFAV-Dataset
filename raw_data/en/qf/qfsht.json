This process ensures that the vaccine strain is not able to persist in the environment. The murA gene is responsible for the catalysis of one of the first steps in the biosynthesis of muramic acid, which is a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall. The regulated lysis phenotype was achieved by inserting the tightly regulated araC ParaBAD cassette in place of the chromosomal murA promoter. Strains with this mutation require growth media supplemented with arabinose in order to survive. Without arabinose, they are unable to synthesize the peptidoglycan cell wall. Following the colonization of fish lymphoid tissues, the murA protein is no longer synthesized due to the lack of arabinose. Lysis is subsequently achieved in vivo, thus preventing the generation of disease symptoms and the spread of the strain into the environment. Vaccine strain 16,016 with the genotype PmurA180 ::TT and higher LD50 value than that of the wild-type strain. Studies have demonstrated that upregulation of the expression profiles of cd4 , cd8 and mhc-II genes in different organs of vaccinated catfish. Vaccine strain 16,016 induced systemic and mucosal IgM titers and conferred significant protection to catfish against E. piscicida wild-type challenge. Our lysis RAEV is the first live attenuated vaccine candidate designed to be used in the aquaculture industry that displays this biological containment "}
