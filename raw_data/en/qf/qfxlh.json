There are many B vitamins. A few are rising stars in the West Palm Beach bone health and even West Palm Beach back pain relief spheres. Aging, osteoporosis, [back pain](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-West-Palm-Beach/chiropractic-topics/west-palm-beach-back-pain), and related fractures are a few of the reasons. Chiropractic Care presents new research supporting the testing of B vitamin levels and adjusting any low levels with diet and supplementation as appropriate. AGING, OSTEOPOROSIS, FRACTURE, VITAMIN B We are aging. We're not alone in this. Globally, aging is growing. Along with aging comes the growth of osteoporotic fracture incidence and morbidity, mortality, and cost related to such fractures. It is quite an unpleasant circle! Preventing [osteoporosis](/doctor/chiropractor/chiropractic-West-Palm-Beach/id-your-pain/osteoporosis) and improving the health of bone is a reasonable goal when considering aging. Dietary modification has been shown valuable as has supplementing with B vitamins. Recent researchers wrote that support keeps growing for the possible protective role of B vitamins especially B2, B6, folate (B9), and B12 for bone health. Research mentioned that eating vitamin B enriched foods is one way to go to contain any adverse effects of high-dose B vitamin supplementation.

Chiropractic Care will collaborate with you to find out what's best for you and your bones. BONE, BMD, HIP FRACTURE, VITAMIN B For years, Chiropractic Care has studied the suggestions of Vitamin B for bone health, and the latest review article of 29 studies supports testing and supplementation of B vitamins. 14 studies stated that blood tests revealing low serum levels of folate (vitamin B9) are signs of risk for reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures in older people, particularly women. Taking folate vitamin B9 (500mcg-5mg a day) enhanced BMD in another study. Taking B6 reduced the risk of hip fracture. These findings prompted the researchers to propose that checking folate and homocysteine blood levels in elderly patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis is vital. They even go so far as to state it is mandatory.

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY BENEFIT OF VITAMIN B B vitamins may well be a link in controlling inflammatory chemicals through homocysteine control, methylation, lowering CRP, etc. The roles of B vitamins - thiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin - in back pain and other musculoskeletal disorders lean toward being anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, neuroprotective, and neuromodulatory.
