The Medical Research Network on SSRN is an open access preprint server that provides a venue for authors to showcase their research papers in medicine in our research community, speeding up dissemination and providing the scientific community access to groundbreaking working papers, early-stage research, clinical research, and even peer reviewed or published journal articles. SSRN provides the opportunity to share different outputs of research such as preliminary or exploratory investigations, book chapters, PhD dissertations, course and teaching materials, presentations, and posters among others. SSRN also helps medical scholars discover the latest research in their own and other fields of interest within the life sciences while providing a platform for the early sharing of their own work, making it available for subsequent work to be built upon more quickly. The medical discipline interacts and overlaps with ethics, informatics, computations, economics, biology, chemistry, and physics to uncover new treatments, develop new diagnostic techniques, and new medical devices that will improve outcomes in healthcare. Many of the papers included in the Medical Research Network are preprints: early stage research papers that have not been peer-reviewed. The findings should not be used for clinical or public health decision making and should not be presented to a lay audience without highlighting that they are preliminary and have not been peer-reviewed.
