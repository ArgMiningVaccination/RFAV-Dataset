Supports relaxation and stress relief The energy, or biofield, healing method of Reiki is designed to trigger the body's relaxation response, increase positive energy and reduce stress, which aids the immune system in fighting illness. The biofield is the scientific term for the subtle vibrational energy field that surrounds and interconnects with our physical bodies. Stress contributes to many illnesses, and stress reduction and relaxation are proven benefits of Reiki treatments. Provides relief from chronic pain, anxiety, and depression Research shows that Reiki helps support mental health, and reduces the symptoms of anxiety, depression, mood disturbances, and chronic pain.
