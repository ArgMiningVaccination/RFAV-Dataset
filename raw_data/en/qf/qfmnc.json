(4th quarter) The etheric is more fixed inside the sculptural astralic; the outbreathing of the earth is widening; beneath extremes become more present: greedy rough ahrimanic Earthgnomes at the ground - earthfleeting -luciferic Sylphs in the sun set sky. All you in the Southern Hemis phere , please compare with your Qualities outside that qualities which we can find in the Northern Hemisphere in the 2nd half of September : (3rd quarter) In nobel clearing is streaming the newest soul - and spiritbeing -dignity from the astral and spiritual cosmos into the relaxed 4 etherkingdoms, middling own -midth -home\" - and imprinting the ethers with viscosity (4th quarter) Michaels futurelovefire flows - united with newest cosmic wisdom - in Sophias -Sunbride - Light from the sky - and brings e nchouraging force -receiving -gladness to Natura -Persephonea - Earthmother, Elementarybeing and Man 14 A special awareness can be given in this time towards the following: At looking on meadows or fields we perceive - in the feeling - a passage from elementar y tenderness to more and more rough greedy downpulling willing - of ahrimanic gnomes - there. And at lookinginto the whole sundown -mood in the sky we can notice the appearance of a mood which is tired this earthlife and wants to stream out oft he earthly realm out into the cosmos - which is coming from huge luciferic sylphs in the sky there. Now we have a time that seemed made for to die - but also for to rise again. Just because of this it's important to search and hold our focus onto the subtile, lightful, tender and deeply healing renewing substance of spring -archangel Raphael - for to recei ve fully and take -in out of this fine lovefilled forcesstream spring -puryfying -substance and pre -felt resurrection -force - for us and our surrounding! On the day up in the blue sky, we can find somekind of etheric -astralic opening and flourishing - with raphaelic healing fineness. The following text is a google translation ( - sorry we could not correct it anymore) Third week of March Arrived - and already begins Soul Drama In the physical The landscape is further and more differentiated in its appearance and mood. In the etheric The etheric expands throughout the earth's space; increasingly also in the heights. In doing so, it forms coherently on aurally predicted lines. For example, a denser reproduction of sound -etheric forms around the spout. The light-ethereal playing is still virgin and less effective. In the vitality -soulalike The astral connection between the soul light of the expanses and the soul exhalation of the earth has completely merged. Over th e weeks, this astrality has become ever more substantial and enveloping, and now forms a kind of differentiating \"brood -space\" for ethereal developments. In character -soulalike Heavenly, heaven seems to have arrived on earth, and the earth has opened wide . In the more differentiated spiritual of the kingdoms of nature and of the air -light area there is a character of enjoyment. In the celestial area, especially in the evening, an unexpected longing character slowly emerges. It starts these days with a ligh t soul drama in the earth environment. 15 In the dignity -soulalike Behind the first differentiating soul -drama can continue to be perceived a great, benign -salutary - looking observer's dignity. In spirit -being -realm In the lower natural universe the earth m other Persephone can be experienced. She has stepped out of the inward earthiness of winter, and her soul -sight has been turned to the heights she had herself awakened. In the elemental beings world, the leaf -dreaming dreams of the undines form around the end of the sprout. In sprouting above the ground, there are still some coarse Ahrimanic gnomes and indigenous tendencies, which greedily want to sip the soul of the heights into the open earth. Access examples In the evening, when we compare the sunset mo od with the ground area of a meadow, the one -sided tendencies of power and sensation can be identified and described. Shadow expression of the time experience The human soul reflects the experience of sunny Late afternoon -up Evening sky increasingly a melancholy tendency. It also contains a temptation, as if the soul wants to fly right through to the sky, and not to stay longer in this \"earthly low existence \". Celebration opportunity of this time If one follows the surrender of the earth upward and the \"enjoying contemplation\" of the coming in itself in a balancing way and combines consciously with the goals of the goals of spring, then one can absorb the great background force. The special ability to grasp, carry through and balance the extremes is conveyed as the Raphaelian salvific in all microcosmic developmental trajectories. Fourth week of March Meaningful Feelings between earthly Greed and heavenly Flight In the physical The landscape looks increasingly fuller, more powerful and more expressive. In the etheric The coarse and yet delicate life forces are held by the astral shell - in the finest, devitalizing fashion - so that the expanding etheric clouds can not dissolve into the periphery, but gently incubate from this radiating envelope - unfolds along their specifications , In the vitality -soulalike The solar and planetary soul works all the way down to the ground. The astrality is no longer tender, but acts plastic and tangible. The devitalized, light -beam -like astral lines and forms create a kind of ether vacuum, which attracts the life forces. The always expansive ether wants to fill up this ether -poverty, like the water the dry sponge. In character -soulalike The sympathetic -attractive and antipathic -repe llent becomes partially more pronounced in the soul outside. In the soil area, there is often a grossly self -centered character feeling. There is something in the sky that wants to move away into the highs and the farthest, even seeming to escape the world in the evening. 16 In the dignity -soulalike Behind the approaching emotionalism of the soul, an increase of the awakening activity can be perceived in a benignly salutary observer's dignity, often unconsciously able to kindle a kind of soul-satisfying adventure of human dignity, such as: \"This is the touching path of being human in the new Year! In spirit -being -realm The elemental beings are also involved in this feeling. The processes in the etheric -astral interplay flow as a kind of o ut of the elementary consciousness: Since with them perception and recognition are one, beats in their perception of the great heaven -earth -breath, the Wahrgenom\u00acmene into their living -emotional flow of action! Many small gnomes are now working on the grou nd and sprouting. On top of that, there are peaceful sound -ether -and-upholstery or bells. It is also the marriage of extreme, primitive elementals such as \"heaven -slumbering\" Ahrimanic Grobgnome and escaping Undine Sylphs high in the air. 5) Access exampl es One observes one's own soul's household in its reactions to the experience of nature - as in the daytime review: How was the state of health in relation to the ground or meadow area, how (especially towards the sunset) in relation to the sky and the hor izon? Please let it fade and describe differentiated!* Shadow expression of the time experience In us can be a concerned -wistful Overview arise, but also easy the seductive sentiment of earthly flight, to slip out into the heavens and no longer want to jo in in the earth's evolution. Celebration opportunity of this time The purposeful healing -through -dignity of this time can put us in the middle of a balancing world or in a sacrificial power cross. This imaginative experience can make us distinguish and capture the time - bound mortal and the resurrectable eternal of our inner and outer world. * See also Rudolf Steiner: The experience of the annual run in four cosmic imaginings (GA 229), lectures from 7 and 13 October 1923. Transition fro m March to April From the sensitive to the empathic transition to April In the physical The (especially in the sight of the woods) of different bud colors embossed landscape looks filled with the expansive sweep of the soft edges of the mold. The bird voices are -especially in the evening -less active, but more relaxed and satisfied. In the etheric The refining and contouring etheric forces form force fields around the sprouts. A velvety -dreaming sound ethereal that seems to radiate softly has becom e prevalent. In the vitality -soulalike At the end of March, the solar and planetary soul coming from the heights (which unites with the earthly soul that curses upwards) becomes more and more contoured. This over -intensive openness of the earthly soul tow ards heaven has reached its climax. 17 The intrinsic fineness that comes in it brings devotion into the image -force event, which in turn is connected with the soul. In character -soulalike The below rough and world -fleeting mood in the sky is gradually blend ed by the great nature of a mood similar to the blessed fall asleep - only that this fall asleep now affects the whole earth. Something dreaming -caring about the earth environment resonates in it. In the dignity -soulalike With the increased sensitivity re finement in the healing - benevolent background -dignity in the astral of the earth - space, a dainty differentiation becomes visible. It can be characterized as a fine, knowledgeable guiding and promoting of unfolding of all creatures of the earth. In spirit -being -realm In the elemental beings, differentiations between their etheric body and their mental nature increase. In the foreground close to the earth there are often guarded micro -gnomes and above them \"common Undine bells\". The sylphs, which have become more contorted in the melancholy form of the last time, and the first clearer fireflies, blow in the distant sunlight. In the heights, in and behind the clouds, are configured from large elemental beings that have shares of gnomes, undines and sylphs. They interact with the landscape angels and create a fertile \"bridge\" that leads downwards to the earth, bringing heavenly design and development impulses. The Earth Mother Persephonea picks these up and distributes the effects to all beings and creatures dow n on earth. Access example Especially in the air play of nature, in the spaces between plants and close to the tree roots, different qualities can be located mentally, which - inwardly penetrated - can be described down to the very essence. Shadow expression of the time experience In this open multiplicity, men can experience themselves as dissolved in soft stimuli. Celebration opportunity of this time Within the therapeutic context of healing*, the actual healing can be grasped, absorbed and mediated into the inner and outer evolution of the soul. Central to this is a conversion of the innermost soul inte ntions into full -scale new existence in the world conditions that will come this year. * See Rudolf Steiner: The Experience of the Year in F our Cosmic Imaginations (GA 229), lecture of 7 October 1923 (Raphael). The main speech of the cosmos shows: First of all: The experience with lunar years like this (1999, 2006, 2013, 2019) is: transitional, empathetic and gentle things come up again and again in the lunar years. May this opportunity be seized! No planet is in decline and a rapid process sequence is likely to continue - until the end of April. Now it goes from the more astral lonely new moon, on Sunday 23rd to the more ethereal ly effective full moon, on Monday 9th at 18.47. 18 After the signature of the intensity of the conjunction of the century Saturn conjunction Saturn - Pluto (Sun. Jan 12) with Mercury and Sun, it is now about the language of the transformation demands of Mars and Jupiter, which Pluto and (Mars) Saturn meet. Mars meets Pluto (Monday, March 23 at 6:00 a.m.) and Saturn (Tuesday, March 31 at 9:00 p.m.) and Jupiter meets Pluto (on Sunday, April 5 at 3:15 a.m.) - with the tendency not to leave us alone, if we still h old onto those who are not worthy of the future ...! So are the two weekends - z. B. especially on Sunday, March 22nd and Saturday, April 4th - for activities such as those on January 12th - inspirational walks, alone or in self- responsible forms! (Next, Jupiter will meet Pluto on June 30th, then November 21st, and Saturn then on December 21st! After that, the passage of the planets through the Saturn -Pluto meetings has ended and Saturn is no longer in the astrological Capri corn but for a good two years in Aquarius in which the Pluto - stepping out of the Capricorn - will follow for the first time in 2023 and completely from 2024.) Mars conjunction Jupiter speaks, on Fri. 20, calling for clarifying energy - which depends on our getting up. .Liberating from strength, Saturn comes from Capricorn into Aquarius! - By July 2; there he goes back to the Capricorn (due to retrograde) - until December 18, 2020, on which he permanently enters Aquarius. On weekends Saturday 28th and Su nday 29th we have venus harmonies through Trigone with Jupiter - clarifying -loving language - Saturday 28th at 5:00 am and with Pluto Sunday 29th at 5:00 am. This is also suitable Weekend for activities! 2020 seems in general, with the culinary focal points of the language of confrontation / letting go and initiation / renewal, to have a special historical signature of the change! The following detailed constellations of the second half of March 2020 in the picture (Greenwich time - German time plus 1 hour): 19 ... we have to learn to understand the Star -constellations and it's Influence on that, what happens on Earth. Than we come near that Speech, that was spoken from Christ.\" (R. Steiner, GA 220, 21.01.1923) The speech of the social happenings (old informations which have still actuality are in blue, new ones in red): Not to forget here: towards ungood news we shall try to think them into the right form\" (so an advice from R. Steiner): Renewing/Phenomens: More and more students are involved worldwide in climate change, refugee aid, anti -nationalism -coherent hollownesses of the daily surviving lies and primitivities of (co -) ruling parties and power politicians, working daily into the media and minds, reach a temporary climax. The public abundance of clumps of cold-empty ahrimanic spaces, which seems to have grown in a democratic context, will be medically noticeable in 2018 as a revelation of the earthly souls as an eerie emptiness in the Earth's soul hull. Man can feel called upon to im pregnate all earthly thoughts with his purifying Christ joyfulness of the sooner or later effective human hearts of the social and natural space. \"And with the Christ right in us, we enliven all light on earth around us, carry life into the dead light, hav e animate ourselves to the light,\" said Steiner (GA 218, 23.10.22). In this repeated rebellion of the Antichrist, we need the powers of human beings forming Christ's body: our actively astonishment (in front of hidden goodness), our actively loving compas sion, our active ability of conscience (see GA 133, p. 113ff). With regard to the actually fitting empathic -looking Michael culture, a lot can be achieved compared to the tumb - unconscious single and group captivities all over the world now! Every morning a nd evening, taking the social and natural world into the loving view of Christ in a similar way, we can do some of the spiritual work that is especially into human hands. How easy it is for humanity - through fears - to take away the rights of freedom! A virus (corona virus) and the focus of the media and insurance companies on money and politics on supposed security makes new mass hysteria opportunities that have an unstable effect even in global economic conditions and disastrous for poorer micro - entrepreneurs, with late consequences that are likely to exceed the virus consequences . \"Doctors at the New York University School of Medicine have made an incredible discovery: they've discovered a new 'organ' in the human body. Actually, it was known as in terstitium.\" It consists of dark bands and bright, fluid -filled interstices, which so far have no relation to the organs an stays in the in -between.

May clearness a nd humanity come back into the hearts and minds! It is as if Trump turns America brutal in its opposite. The American spirit of freedom and generosity feels like cutted of in the worlds west! The primitive -labile world power leader Trump announces agreement plays with power gamblers. A political style of yesteryear offers more and more evil -superpowers space. \"Lack of ideas in peacetime brings war\", says Rudolf Steiner. Real danger of war can be seen in the cutting down of the so -called Iran -Deal through Trump and his extreme rightwing defense minister - still following the middleage US - Doktrine. Outdated power politics with violence (US murder of Iranian general) will hopefully raise awareness of a new opposite world politics of brotherly support. Also Romania follows the going down trend\" - with corrupt oldfashioned primitive politics.

Existential call in question: What we could fell specially this year, is coming into the press: the insects are dying dramatically in the last 30 years - we lost about 80 % of them since 1989 (and birds follow them rapidly).Following Steiner they are keeping the soul in nature in toge therness with the cosmic spirit - we have a lot of soul problems and others from losing the finest creatures on earth? Can we go in groups (see the Micaelmas -Fazit) with preparations., meditations and eurythmy to create areas, farms and landscapes with El ementalbeings and Insects again!? The general animal stock in nature in Germany has gone back to the latest research in the last 50 years by 50%! The sequence is observable anthroposophically: The etheric loses its effectiveness due to a lack of astral en graving and evaporates more. This is accompanied by the fact that the cosmic -astral and the cosmic -spiritual carried by it do not sufficiently affect the earthly. Here, there is an urgent need for more human help in a dignifi ying rhythmic, repetitive, medi tative, eurythmic, and preparizing approach to nature and the surrounding area! May - especially from the perceptual work out everywhere groups form for it! A schocking analysis in Germany: in only 10 years 67 percent less insects in grasslands and 40 percent less insects in forests!

Not to forget: In Fukushima is not found a solving found for dealing with the permant rea tion of radioactive collingwater - already 100 very insecure huge Tanks are standing around the buildings ... . How can the Anthroposophical Society work out of the actual good Spiritual World? 2012 - 19: It seems the Anthroposophical Society is pulling th e existencial problem of not finding enough young members since years - and still - to much out of the awareness. Like a typical mirror of our time, we can see four main streams at the moment: - a mainstream -group, partly seeminly a bit paralised, more observing, commenting or consuming happenings - a stream of active workers in anthroposophic institutions, seeing, mostly a bit hopeless, how anthroposophy seems to fade in this instituitions 22 - a perephery -stream of spiritual working people in meditation and supersensible perception, which want to grow to real spiritual science - a conglomerat of more intellectual, philosophical and academical orientated anthroposophists Active inner work, bridgebuilding and coworking has good chances - if many overcome narrowness of own directions. Unfortunately, the public image of anthroposophy in German -speaking countries is increasingly influenced by nationalistic and racist -looking websides - a startling development! Can the new webside with Interviews to Anthroposophic Meditation from Germany be a help? See: www.anthroposophische -meditation.org and fading practise\" had been sucessful practised at the biggest german academic meditation event with Anna -Katharina Dehmelt: http://2018.meditation - wissenschaft.online/303528023 ) Groundbreaking books appear at the right time; Books for the formation of anthroposophical communities and concrete perception work: - Benjamin Schmidt's biography \"Wilhelm Rath\", - Iris Paxino's concrete book of Perception and Practice \"Bridges between Life and Death\" and the -DieDrei, Special Edition \"Spiritual Knowledge and Training Path \". They are all in german. The striving for networking on the Michaelmasmeeting in Dornach since 2018 seemingly to be a good idea! Now we need directionlessness as a necessary step of yield devoted opening for the new, then meditatively researching the future for to create out of \"nothingness\" for at least 3.3 years, and this - first of all asking \"how Michael would do it\" - to bring into prototypical designs, so that it could help to transform from creative chaos into contemporary forms - u. a. those of the intertwining of free new communities (see article in 2nd half of July Advice). If we can be in coherence with the actual spiritual world entrustments (see the Yearcircle reports to every yearfestival since the Holy Nights 2018 - 2019), then significant healing renewing is expec ted within the next 15 years. So could flow a deeper wave of new anthroposophical methods and institutions into the developments of the first half of the 21st century. The expanded Colloquium \"Super sensible Perception\", from the 1st weekend in Advent 2019, in the Rudolf Steiner House in Stuttgart, was extremely hopeful. First fruits of the grown practizising -stream of Anthroposophic Meditation became visible. After the German Anthroposophic Society had alre ady organized a similar event with karma researchers, now 120 invited spiritual researchers have found the 1st collogium on spiritual research. The workshop was prepared by supernatural perceivers from the \"Collogium Supernatural Perception\", which was fou nded 8 years ago by Jasmin Mertens. The preparatory group consisted of Gunhild von Kries, Dirk Kruse, Thomas Mayer, Dieter Schmautz and Michael Schmock. Unusually collegial and harmonious, in a direct openness to the spiritual world , and a procedural way of working, there were exchanges in various formats. In approx. 40 different practice workshops, made the different approaches of researchers - nearly all working with this already in demanding proffessions - mostly good to relive. The many new suggestions and work friendships were received with great satisfaction and gratitude. Everything called for \"carry on\". A similar event will take place again next year.
